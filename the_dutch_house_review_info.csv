But please go and order an audiobook because TOM HANKS is fantastic, impeccable, meticulous narrator. (Yes, he is our Danny boy). So as a result paperback version: 4 stars Audiobook: 5 stars Let’s rounded 4.5 up to 5 celebration of master story telling stars!I started to read the book and I was about to give four stars ! Please, don’t get me wrong, I love the writing and those vivid characters, I was about to give million slaps to one of them: Yes, EVIL STEPMOM ANDREA, I’m talking about you! But slow pace and too many jumping between time lines a little exhausted me. But as soon as I learned Tom Hanks is on the board, I stopped reading and I started listening to the book with a huge smile on my face. Danny and Maeve will always stay on my mind and heart as amazing siblings. Their mother abandoned them. (Actually she was another version of Mother Theresa and she rejected to live in a mansion when too many poor people suffer out there so she left the place. She still loved her husband and she didn’t intend to leave her children. Her belief as social responsibilities always come first even it means to neglect her own family is irritated me so much! I’m not quite fan of this character. But thanks God, we have evil stepmother to hate more!) And their father passed away when he was only 53. They both lost their parents at young age but what they didn’t know they would be also homeless with great scheme her stepmother dearest had planned details with her lawyer. She got the control of the business of their father and she got the Dutch House to live with her two daughters. So she kicked her step kids out. She even tried to prevent Danny take money from trust fund for his education because Danny chose an expensive school and her own daughters couldn’t get the highest education they need, if all the money would spend for Danny’s needs. (At least her attempts were stopped by their father’s lawyer this time. I think Andrea deserved a special place in hell but in my opinion, hell would be like a spa treatment for her!) So all the losses they suffered, keep united this brother and sister against the entire world. They became each other’s priorities and supported each other for every big life decisions. (Maeve helped him to connect with his future wife even they didn’t get along for a long time and resented each other!) They grew up, but they resumed going to the Dutch House and stopped their cars in front of the place, waited to see any activity around or inside and they left. THAT BECAME THEIR ROUTINE FOR YEARS like visiting an old relative they check randomly to make sure she’ still alive!Years passed, they got old. They resumed going back there…Till one day their mother returned back and requested them to drive her to the house and finally she bangs on the door to meet with Andrea. That is the beginning of some endings! The house was like a living and functioning organism marked the milestones of the sibling’s lives and changed them forever. Past and future combined with sadness, regrets, resentments, sister and brother’s devotion, marriage, nostalgia, childhood memories, unfinished businesses, yearning for real and functional family, life decisions.  As the life moved on , two siblings’ a special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house, buried there, even they thought they moved on but they couldn’t. Because house gave them hope that one day their mother could return. House made them grow up earlier. House made them connect with their maids, nanny ( also mistress of their father) and many childhood happy memories. Even they’ve kicked out, they have never left the place and the house never left them, too. It left a vulnerable scar on their mind and soul. It always stayed with them till the end of their lives.Amazing story-telling, remarkable characterization and best narration!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5," The Dutch House starts out strong, but then ultimately doesn't go anywhere.We are introduced to siblings Danny and Maeve, the center of this family saga. Their father strikes it rich and buys a lavish mansion known as The Dutch House as a surprise for their mother. That event reverberates with repercussions for everyone in the family and kicks off a five decade long story.This is my first Ann Patchett, and I've heard amazing things about her, so I tore into this book with gusto. And I was hooked from the first page. I found the characters and the writing to be riveting and was thoroughly enthralled with where this story was going. But then about a third of the way into it, a big turning point happened. And after that, well, I didn't really see the point of the story anymore. The writing remained interesting, but the characters and their actions stopped making sense to me. The story kind of fizzled out and then limped along without a clear narrative for the rest of the book.Usually, even if I don't connect with a story, I can still guess what the author is trying to say. But in this case, I'm stumped. Perhaps it's the message that forgiveness is key no matter how egregious the wrong? But that doesn't make sense to me, so I honestly don't know.The writing is still compelling enough that it helped carry the story through to the end, so I was never bored. But the last two thirds shambled along without momentum or purpose, and was utterly forgettable. It feels like I read a short story that reached its conclusion and then continued on for 200 more meandering pages."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an absorbing read even though the narrator was infuriating, self-absorbed, oblivious, selfish, and annoying. It follows two siblings, Danny and Maeve, and their childhood home, The Dutch House, across decades with a mother who disappeared, an emotionally distant father, his new wife and her daughters and, eventually, Danny’s wife and children. There is an epic feel to this novel but it is also an intimate portrait of siblings who have found home in each other when they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. Patchett is a formidable novelist. She takes such care with her storytelling. She creates an indelible sense of place and the narrative does some interesting things with chronology. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsSometimes in a novel, a place is such a strong and integral part of the story that it deserves as much attention as if it were a character. The house in this novel exerts so much influence over the lives of the characters, sometimes more so than the other people in their lives. The house, with its big windows and ornate design is a symbol of success for Cyril Conroy, the self made real estate developer. To his wife Elna, it is everything that is wrong with the world, when so many others have nothing. To their children, Maeve and Danny, it is where they live. As adults, it’s much more complex; it represents everything they lost. To Conroy’s second wife Andrea, it’s a possession she has to have. Narrated by Danny, the story moves back and forth from their childhood over decades, a family saga of sorts, but the Conroy family for most of the novel is just the two of them, Danny and Maeve. This is in so many ways about the past, the past they can’t let go of, the past that shapes who they become as adults. “Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” Danny asks his sister Maeve. “ I see the past as it actually was,” Maeve said. Danny responds “ But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” ** It’s also about sibling love and sacrifice as the brilliant Maeve gives up so much of her life to care for Danny, to make sure he is okay. I was so emotionally connected to them and I loved their relationship. It was at times heartbreaking to see how deep seated these wounds of the past are for both of them .The plot, which captured me from the beginning is one the reader should discover for themselves, so no spoilers here. The bottom line is that I loved pretty much everything about the book - the writing, the characters, the story. I found it nearly perfect and it is 4.5 stars because of something in the end that I found hard to reconcile. I keep a list of favorite writers and Ann Patchett has been on that list for quite a while now. I’ve read every novel she’s published. Her characters always feel fully developed and making an emotional connection is easy because she allows us to know them. Definitely recommended! I read this with Diane and Esil as one of our ongoing buddy reads and as always appreciate their thoughts.**Quotes are from the advanced copy.I received an advanced copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"Reading Road Trip 2020Current location: Pennsylvania“Swear to God, you really were that boring.”The night my book club discussed Ann Patchett's Bel Canto some ten years ago, I clutched my copy of that novel to my chest like a companion animal and huffed and puffed away, defensively, every time a woman in the group grumbled “so unbelievable” and “that ending!” Who were they, those wenches, to speak ill of a book I adored about love and opera? Later, on various telephone calls, my sister (another devoted reader and reviewer) frequently gave the beast a poke, belaboring, yet again, my recommendation of Bel Canto to her. Why had I recommended this far flung tale of messy plot points and undeveloped characters to her?Harrumph.Then came the night at book club when we discussed Patchett's State of Wonder. I was so stricken with jungle love, I was practically sitting there with my Pinot Noir, burning up with malaria. When one of the ladies mentioned the COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE ending, I felt a small flutter of doubt in my heart. . . yes, it's true, the ending was bad, but, but, but. . . The jungle! Okay, there was the scene with that kid and that scene on the dock that made absolutely no sense, but, but. . . The jungle!So, I started The Dutch House with a big smile on my face. I even purchased a new hardcover copy (almost unheard of for me), and jumped right in to Patchett's characteristically readable prose and her memorable one-liners.Oooooh, a mansion! Well, that's as appealing as an opera house or a jungle that holds the promise of sex!But the doubts came quickly with this one. Why were the two protagonists, siblings Maeve and Danny, just sitting outside the house like two cardboard cutouts? Why weren't we ever getting inside their heads, instead of having the story narrated TO US? Was I ever going to know these two people? Was this, like, a play?Wait, wait. . . why were they still sitting there, but two pages ago they were teens and now one is married and the other is graduated and working now. Wait, wait. . . he has kids? But I never even knew him to kiss a girl! Was this, like, a play about time travel?And then. . . when the 53-year-old father, Cyril Conroy, dies and leaves his two motherless children without a will. . . well, folks, I CRIED FOUL. I looked right at my book and declared NO.Not only was Cyril Conroy a REAL ESTATE MOGUL worth God knows how much money, one of his best friends was a LAWYER who not only had drawn up a very detailed educational trust for his kids. . . but Mr. Conroy, being the owner of so many buildings in Pennsylvania and New York, was, in fact, so legally minded, that he once “paid a man from the American consulate to meet [their mother's] ship in Bombay. He'd mailed the divorce papers and the man took my mother straight to the consulate and had her sign them in front of a notary.” And, get this, the next line is: “ALL VERY LEGAL.” (page 288, in case you're interested in details)Cyril Conroy was known for being a stickler, the type of man who crossed his “i's” and dotted his “t's.” This was not a man who would be remiss in having his lawyer draw up a very thorough will for his motherless children.To quote Maeve from the book: “Did that really happen?”To quote Danny from the book: “Are you making this up?”As far as I am concerned, the entire premise of this story is tragically flawed, right from the start. The novel, in my opinion, also makes the mistake of being approximately 100 pages too long, and suffers from almost no real character development. As readers, we are TOLD everything, like a Greek tragedy, narrated aloud. We SEE almost nothing here, but two mannequins sitting in a car, exchanging some clever dialogue.I will tell you this: I will not be the reader with stars in her eyes, when my book club discusses this one."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest novel proves to be a absolute delight to read with its echoes of the darkest of fairytales with the requisite wicked stepmother in the form of Andrea. We are provided with Patchett's acute understanding and keen observational insights of what it is to be human, the complex nature of family and the dysfunctional dynamics that proliferate. Shortly after WW2, Cyril Conroy's life catapults from poverty into wealth which propels him to buy the architectural jewel that is the Dutch House with its many windows in the Pennsylvania suburbs for his wife, Elna, a house that is to splinter his family apart. As the narrative moves back and forth in time through five decades, the house turns out to be an integral part and trigger for the dramas that ensue, the highs and the lows. Danny grew up with little memory of his mother who left so early in his life, and his father is a distant figure, contributing to the strong bond with his older sister, the bright and determined Maeve, a woman of substance who takes on the mantle of caring and protecting him. Cyril brings Andrea into the lives of Maeve and Danny, and goes on to marry her. Andrea, with her children, is driven by ambition that inform her behaviour and decisions, catalysts for how events pan out in the house and family interactions until Cyril's dies, leaving Andrea with everything. Andrea reacts by throwing Maeve and Danny out. The siblings are pushed out of their privileged and comfortable lives, finding themselves facing a life of poverty and challenges with only each other to rely on. Maeve dedicates her life to Danny at the expense of her own life and ambitions, with both positive and negative outcomes, although their future lives are to be shaped by their constant obsession with the house and their inability to let go of the past.Patchett writes a compulsive novel of family, sibling relationships, secrets, memories that can so often turn out to be unreliable, coming to terms with what life can throw at you, grief, loss, love and forgiveness. It is beautifully written, with rich, atmospheric vibrant descriptions and with Patchett's stellar and skilful characterisation and development, she has an uncanny capacity to give us pictures of emotional and meaningful depth of her characters interior lives. This is a brilliant, thought provoking, multilayered, complicated and well crafted book infused with a wryness and humour that made it such a memorable read. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"Hang on, I swear I’m about to write this review, but first I need to call up every real estate agent in the greater Philadelphia area and inquire about purchasing the Dutch House.Okay, so yes, the Dutch House is fictional.Plan B: I will make millions and millions of dollars and then become best friends with Ann Patchett and she and I will team up as co-architects to construct a real life version, and both of us will ignore the fact that we have no architecture experience and that I haven’t taken an actual math class in about 6 years (long story) and also that the Dutch House as a literary symbol brings only suffering and obsession.I’m sure I’ll figure it out. I’m an English major, so according to my calculations, making millions of dollars will take me...476 years.We’ve got time.Until then, I will think about this book. To keep me motivated and inspired.I will think about how it is beautifully written, and so real and emotive and human, and how I FELT everything that happened in this book. How it all felt real and painful and true.I will think about how I love Maeve, and I love Danny, and I love May and Kevin and Celeste, and I love Sandy and Jocelyn, and how I even love Norma and Bright.Mostly, I will think about the Dutch House, and the borderline grotesque beauty of the dining room, and the big portraits in the living room, and the windowseat in the best bedroom, and the seating area at the top of the stairs, and the warm kitchen, and the cold high-up beds.And those 476 years will just fly by.Bottom line: Immediately after finishing this book, I resolved to read everything by Ann Patchett.----------------pre-reviewactually i grew up in the Dutch House and the characters from this book are my family and this is the story of my life.review to come / 4.5 stars----------------tbr reviewi promise eventually i'll move on from gazing lovingly at this cover and actually open this book"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 2 out of 5,"3 stars if im feeling generous, which im not, so 2.5 stars it isthis was so blah. no word encapsulates this book for me more perfectly than ""blah."" i recognize that this book had some nice, touching moments, but on the whole it felt so heartless. after about the first quarter of this book, this started becoming very apparent. the dutch house reminded me of all the things i disliked about mary beth keane's ask again, yes and jhumpa lahiri's the namesake: the reliance on having a character tell us the plot as opposed to us seeing it unfold; the huge time jumps that leave characters in the most boring, cookie-cutter lives, in stark contrast to their initially compelling childhoods. like i dont know how many times i have to read about time jumps where interesting characters end up married to some wishy-washy character whose only function is to be of the opposite sex so that the main character can get married to them and have the compulsory 2 kids and white picket fence. can we not think of literally anything that's more interesting ? like anything ? ill even take 3 kids instead of the usual 2. WRITERS, PLEASE, TRY HARDERit goes without saying that where the first quarter of this book was compelling for me, the other two-thirds completely lost me. what i was invested in were the family dynamics, the brother-sister relationship. what i was not invested in was seeing danny take college courses and hang out with his (painfully boring) girlfriend and do random real-estate things that i could not care less about. (and by the way, celeste's whole character just reeked of the ""im not like other girls"" trope. i know she's peripheral to the story, but she's never her own character, not even a little bit. she exists exclusively in relation to and for danny.) i also didnt really think that the characters' motivations made all that much sense. andrea was barely anything much more than an Evil, Gold Digging Step Mom. and all the animosity between celeste and maeve felt extremely unfounded, not to mention very annoying.reading this book was just one long downward trajectory. the more i read it the more it irritated me till finally at the end i was like okay i definitely dont like this book."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"E-book - ( own)... and Audiobook.... ( own), narrated by Tom Hanks. Having read and loved other books by Patchett, [“Commwealth”, “Bel Canto”, “State of Wonder”, “This Is The Story of A Happy Marriage”, and “Run”], plus all the raving early reviews - I was looking forward to reading this. And now I’ve joined the choir with other readers and friends singing....“This is a wonderful novel”. I pre-ordered the ebook months ago - soon to learn that my High School boyfriend- [haha]- Tommy Hanks - was reading the Audiobook....so I purchased the Audiobook as well. TOM HANKS was FLAWLESS in reading this novel. Man, he made this book come alive!!! Tom was so darn good - it was easy to be fooled that he was reading his own memoir. Mixing a gifted author with the enormously talented actor, is like finding a FRUIT LOOP in a bowl of CHEERIOS.....( Danny did eat Cheerios for breakfast in this story).Tom Hanks, as narrator, ( cast as Danny Conroy ), delivers Ann Patchett’s novel’s as if he ‘is’ Danny. Hank disappears - and what we are left with is this bright, funny, kid/guy: Danny!!Danny’s devotion to his sister, Maeve, (7 years older than him), is deeply moving. Their relationship is major and memorable. Danny was innocent - uniformed - unenlightened - incognizant in ways - yet when it came to his sister, Maeve, he knew more about her than anyone. He was always looking at her - observing her - loving her - immensely loyal to her. “The story of my sister, was the only story I was meant to tell”....says Danny. “The Dutch House” is a brother-sister psychodrama about wealth, loss of family, sibling loyalty, anger, desire, resentment, love, forgiveness, etc. Danny and Maeve grew up in a luxurious mansion outside of Philadelphia, known as the Dutch House.....(named for previous owners cigarette moguls of Dutch heritage). The details of the house - the descriptions of the rooms - the cook & housekeeper - the family complexities- of mother - father - stepmother - siblings - wives - sickness - college - marriage - divorce - emotional attachments - abandonment - sadness - hope -past & future - is exquisitely impactful. As the story moves along, the house feels like another character. I came to see ‘the house’ as synonymous with family - heartbreaks-and heartwarming. Patchett’s storytelling is bighearted and smart. It’s one of those books that seems to be alive.... with a beating heartbeat. Ann Patchett is an expert at exploring psychological depths beneath the surface of her characters. Every character was easy to imagine. Ann Patchett shared what sparked her narrative for ‘The Dutch House’. She said.... “The Book really started with me thinking about a person who didn’t want to be rich. There’s so much celebration around money, and I thought, ‘what if somebody just wanted to walk away from it all?’ I began thinking about the repercussions of one person‘s decision — how one person‘s decision really changes the path of so many lives. When Danny and Maeve lost the house, she couldn’t get over it. And I think that’s true for a lot of us. Something has happened in our lives, and even if our lives go on to be quite wonderful, we hang on to the hurt.”5 fabulous stars! "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,Rating 4 out of 5,"AttachedThe Dutch House is a story of siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy, their obsessive connection with the iconic family house they lived in as young children and how their lives unfolded over the years. The story is narrated by Danny over multiple non-linear time periods. The various time jumps and reflections back to important events felt like a jigsaw puzzle being built, where there is the uncertainty of the next piece but once it is placed, the complete picture becomes clearer and clearer. This is a wonderful skill Ann Patchett possesses as I never feel lost or confused as she managed the time transitions so deftly. The other major hallmark of Ann Patchett is her development of amazing characters and relationships. Maeve is Danny’s older sister of 7 years, she is very intelligent, a diabetic, caring to the extreme for her brother, and a character that fascinates and frustrates at times. Danny is much more emotionally reserved and his development into adulthood is interesting to watch. While he takes advantage of top-class education in medicine he can’t shake his love for his father’s business in real estate. Their mother is a memory, having left them when they were young and the story starts with their father bringing Andrea home to visit. Andrea eventually becomes his wife, their new mother and the force that shapes the future relationships within the family.
 “Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.” 
 It’s not too long before Andrea's own two daughters become her sole focus and ambition, and the existing family and staff are unwelcome reminders of a past she wasn’t part of. Andrea is dispassionate, harsh, and greedy, and heir to the Dutch House mansion. Early in the marriage “It also seemed pretty clear he had married the wrong woman. If we all kept to our own corners it was easier for everyone.”After only a few years of marriage, their father dies and leaves the house and business to Andrea who repays his memory by putting both Maeve and Danny out, to never set foot in their home again. This starts an obsessive periodic pilgrimage for Danny and Maeve where they return to the street to sit in a car parked across from the Dutch House and gaze at it recalling memories and wondering how life would have panned out – if only. The emotional baggage they carry together drives them forward but also restricts their successes and paths taken. The psychological burden of seeking happiness and fulfilment, while tied to past commitments and motivations is cleverly layered throughout the story.What I had difficultly with was that I didn’t feel any great pace in the novel and at times wished it would move along in a more compelling rate. The house, while a connecting point, didn’t really have any character and increasingly the story is told away from it. It may be suggested that the house is the central aspect of the story but I would disagree feeling it more appropriate to consider the deep, caring, loving and supportive relationship between a brother and sister growing up with only each other to depend on and if that connection in itself had a restricting effect on how their lives developed. Their real mother returns to the story very late in the book and I just found her motivations, and supposed wisdom, very difficult to accept and jarred so much that it left a frustration with the novel.I would recommend this book and I’d like to thank Bloomsbury Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an early ARC copy in return for an honest review."

11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb-vacation-and-off-line-till-mid-october,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars:Danny and Maeve are siblings who can’t overcome their past. Abandoned by their mother at an early age, Maeve, the oldest, assumes the mother role. Everything changes further when their emotionally distant father marries the evil stepmother and the children are cut out of their inheritance. The pain, bitterness, and anger shapes their personalities and their future. How do they move past such a childhood? My questions: What does forgiveness look like? Does forgiveness mean you allow toxic people back into your life? Is that healthy? What is required of the person(s) who did you wrong? I have my own thoughts about these issues but you’ll have to read the book and decide for yourself. Commonwealth is one of my favorite books and this was one of my most anticipated books of the year. The first 75% was riveting reading. But the story took a turn that I found unrealistic and ridiculous. I can’t say more without spoilers but I’m glad I could vent to my reading buddy Marialyce. I’ve tried to discern the author’s purpose in writing this book and it either escapes me or it’s one I can’t buy into. * I received a copy of the book via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review* for our duo review of this and other books please visit https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres..."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a book I had to think about after finishing. I truly wanted to fall into a deep and abiding love for the story and yet I found it so unrealistic that I had to question what if any was the motive behind the story. There seemed to be no overwhelming meaning to the characters. Everyone and everything seemed disjointed and to me a wash of grey characters, not believable and certainly not ones to be emulated. From the dereliction of being a mother, a father who is in all intents absentee, to the relationship of brother and sister and a step family, I could not get a firm grasp on what the author was trying to say. It was a big disappointment for I am one to accept stories with messages not however messages that are murky if not obscure. It was like going on a roller coaster waiting for the biggest and tallest hill and then there was none. Left to a stilted somewhat boring ride, you emerge with no sense of wonder but a sense of what the heck was that and where was my thrill?So here I will sit with a not so favorable outlook on this story. I have liked three of this author's books, particularly the book, Commonwealth, but unfortunately for me this book left be feeling as vacant and bereft as her characters seemed to be. 2.5 stars for me as well. What represents you as a person? Is it the people you know, the clothes you wear, or even the house you live in? Could it be in one's zeal to be acknowledged that the aforementioned things are really what makes the persona a person wishes to put forward. What happens to character, to strength, and to the willingness to help others, particularly family, as the components of what makes a person? In this book, Ann Patchett presents us with a family whose lives are tragic shells of what could have been. But is that enough to know, for in every tragedy there always emerges victors and perhaps in this book there are no victors whatsoever just losers in the game of life.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 HUGE STARS! One of my best of 2019 (definitely the best audio book). I am a huge Ann Patchett fan and this book does not disappoint. It’s a fabulous book, but it was made so much better because of Tom Hank’s narration. The book is described as a dark fairy tale and there is definitely that theme, with an evil stepmother separating two siblings from their father, their house and everything they hold dear. The book just drew me in and I wanted to spend all my hours listening to it. Told from Danny’s viewpoint, we learn of how Andrea appears in their lives and usurps their inheritance. While I appreciated what Maeve and Danny had lost, I also kept waiting to see when they would move on with their lives. As time goes on, and it moves through five decades, the book becomes more about forgiveness and acceptance. While Maeve is often bitter, Danny at times just seems befuddled, a somewhat removed player in his own life. My thoughts about Celeste went back and forth. Maeve and Danny were so used to being each other’s emotional support, I could understood Celeste feeling left out. But her jealousy at times felt childish. Patchett’s strength comes from how she forms her characters. I never felt Danny and Maeve were anything but real flesh and blood people. In both cases, you see exactly how their childhood has made them the people they are. The same events, when seen through the difference of a few years, shapes them in unique ways. And that ending! I loved how this played out and what became of each of the main characters, how they reconciled themselves to their histories. What surprised me was how much humor was in this book. Not laugh out loud, but a subtle, dry humor that more closely mirrors real life. Again, Hanks totally captures the humor here. I hope he takes on more audio book assignments as he is so well suited to the work."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"Patchett is way up there on my, can't wait for next novel, list. Her characterizations, her insight into flawed families and her wry observations of human nature, are always top notched. In this, her soon to be published novel, she follows a family for five decades, a family that is broken apart, for reasons that I cannot at this time share. Brother and sister, Maeve and Danny, are extremely close, not unexpected since they are the only ones that are there for each other through thick and thin. Danny is our narrator, and from a young age, we are let into his thoughts and the actions of the other characters.Dutch House, a house that their father bought to surprise their mother, is as much a character in this story, as are the actual characters. It is the cause of much of what happens here, a house with huge window that allows one to see all through the house. We follow not only the house itself, but the brother and sister as they grow, through their triumphs and losses. Sibling strength and family loyalty.It is a novel of obsession but also of acceptance and forgiveness. The end, in a way comes full circle, but not without much heartache and loss. There were a few things that sparked the doubting Thomas in me, but all in all this is a wonderful read.Another read with Angela and Esil, and though our ratings do differ a bit, we all enjoyed this novel.ARC by Edelweiss."

I am not sure I will follow her, but this novel is absolutely fantastic. What an intriguing idea to tell a story of a family, especially of a strong bond between siblings, and connect it with a story of a house that seems to be in the background but which in fact plays the major role in the characters' lives! I live in a flat in a tenement house which was built over 90 years ago, love everything about it, appreciate the amount of work that went into decorting it and the attention to its quality, therefore the Dutch House at first seemed to me one of the most beautiful houses one can imagine. At the beginning I was confused: how can you hate such an architectural pearl? As the story progresses, we learn more about its former owners, how the Conroys came to own it, how Danny and Maeve were forced to leave it, and most importantly, how it influenced their mother and in consequence, the siblings. Then, I understood Ms Patchett's idea behind her story. And I loved it.For me, this was one of those novels that you start and you think you know what to expect, and then you are given a most unannounced treat."

I previously had only read Commonwealth and liked it, but it wasn't something I would climb to the top of a mountain and yell about. This book is.I'm not going to get into the summary because I went in as blind as I could (I requested an ARC on NG and EW purely on the fact that it was Ann Patchett and I LOVED the cover) and I think that benefited me. I had no expectations whatsoever. Within the first few pages I was hooked. Ms. Patchett's beautiful writing had my jaw on the floor. I am in awe of her talent and it played out so well in my mind that I was in that house with them. I was sitting next to them in the car. I was the fly on the wall. I was there.If you like books that make you feel a spectrum of emotions with a side of laughter for a few quirky characters - than this book is absolutely a MUST READ. I experienced being vehemently angry, to laughing out loud to such utter sadness...If this isn't made into a series on TV or a movie, I don't know what is wrong with people. The characters in this story (my favorite is Maeve hands down) are so complex and relatable and REAL. You hate them, you forgive them, you desperately love them. I cannot say enough good things about it. I love books that make me feel something and this one did, a million times over. Thank you to Edelweiss, Harpercollins and Ann Patchett for the opportunity to read and provide an honest review of this book.Review Date: 09/27/19Publication Date: 09/24/19"

This one is read by Tom Hanks and he makes it absolutely perfect. He has the kind of voice you can listen to for hours and it is ideal for Danny, the character whose point of view is followed throughout the book.The story is about the breakdown of a family and the support its individual members give to each other. Danny and his sister Maeve are the most important characters, and they have an amazing bond. I thought it was very interesting to observe the different ways they reacted to their lost mother. Maeve, who had known her for some of her childhood, longed for her return. Danny, who never really knew her, ended up being very like his father and repeated many of his faults. I have read several of this author's books now and have enjoyed all of them. She has a magic touch with characterisation and her books often read like top quality memoirs because the people in them are so real. The Dutch House is not plot driven or exciting. It moves slowly and beautifully and ends up almost where it began. I enjoyed it very much."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"TOM HANKS NARRATES THIS AUDIOBOOK! I repeat, Tom Hanks narrates this audiobook! I could listen to that man narrate a grocery list but lucky for us, this book was much more interesting than that.Let me first warn you that this is absolutely a character study plot type novel. And by that I mean, don't go into this book expecting this to happen: beginning->story climax where something major happens->ending. Instead, the readers gets to wade through the lives of Danny and his older sister, Maeve. It's like literary voyeurism. This is something I personally enjoy (I even have a shelf for it!), but if that does not sound like the kind of story you want to read, you might want to skip this.Getting into the book itself - I *loved* the first 2/3 of the book, maybe even 3/4. So, as you can probably figure out, the ending is where I dropped my planned 5 star review down to a 4. I don't want to spoil any of the book, because when a book really isn't about anything in particular everything is a spoiler. But I can say that the ending left me wondering if the author was trying to tell the reader something about forgiveness and if so, I am way too much of a cynical grudge bearing asshole to jump on that forgiveness ship, both in books and in real life. So, there's that.But don't let my personal issues with the book ending dissuade you from LISTENING to this book. Because Tom Hanks. *dreamy sigh while I go watch You've Got Mail for the millionth time*"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"A grand house with grand siblings insideA house? Really? I want people, not inanimate objects! I thought the house would be bigger than the people in it, but thank god I was wrong. I ended up loving the place. Hell, I’d go to an open house there any day. Damn straight I’d like to snoop around.The cover and the title scared me. A painting of an uptight, upright woman on the cover, and “Dutch House” as the title—sounds like we might have some snooty going on here. Is reading this going to feel like being held prisoner in a museum? Because I’m here to tell you, museums are famous for keeping it dull, and I definitely smelled a museum. It just hit me that I wouldn’t have been putting on the brakes if the house were some funky, colorful place (with a chartreuse washstand and a periwinkle china cabinet)—in other words, a house I’d like to explore. A rich person’s house—high ceilings, mature rugs, huge art? Yawn city. But let’s face it, I would read anything Ann Patchett writes—uptight, upright, museum-y or not, I was all in. So I sighed and dug in, already mad that I was going to be dropped into dens of description! I needed an attitude adjustment, because of course this huge house, as I predicted, was being described in huge detail. Chill! I sat there all tense, poised and ready to jump ship if I had to. But immediately the writing adjusted my attitude, as Patchett did her typical skillful thing and grabbed me into her story. And we’re talking two pages in. I was hooked.This is the story of Danny and Mauve, a brother and sister who are joined at the hip. Danny is the narrator, and he’s just a kid when the story starts. I liked him immediately. Mauve takes care of Danny, and he adores her. All they have, really, is each other. When two siblings are alone against the world, they are imprinted on each other for life; the bond is greater than any other. Danny and Mauve fit the bill. Watching their devotion to each other was so touching. Their lives change suddenly (and the house is big during this fateful moment) and they need each other even more. The book follows them through five decades. As the kids became adults, I got more and more attached to them; I was invested in the choices they made and cringed more than once at their behavior. Patchett knows how to make you believe them, trust them, love them.The house is at first a grand place but all the sudden it isn’t. The house means different things to different people and it’s a constant in the book, always there for people to react to. Throughout the book, we have Danny and Mauve sitting in a car in front of the house, reminiscing. Right there, Patchett has me in the palm of her hand. Why on earth are they just sitting there? Can’t they go in? Why do they sit there time and again? Slowly the story gets revealed.I’ve been a Patchett fan for a long time, and every time I finish one of her books, I feel so completely satisfied (with the exception of Bel Canto). Yet I always sort of frown and try to figure out Patchett’s secret. Well, of course, there’s the fact that her writing is dynamite. And she creates nuanced characters, has a lot of insight into the human condition, and keeps the story moving along, usually rather quietly (there’s never over-the-top melodrama—never). Her presentation is complicated but smooth. We go back and forth in time, but she sets it up in a way that lets me happily accept the jumps.Patchett’s tone is pretty formal, which always puts me off at first because I worry it will keep me from feeling close to the characters; it will create a distance. But here’s the scoop: Maybe I can’t get super close because she’s got a wall up, but she gets me to peek over the wall to see the fascinating party she’s throwing, and it’s as good as a front-row seat. With all of her books, the formality soon becomes invisible to me and I am all in, attached to the characters and wanting to find out, right that minute, how they are going to fare. I desperately wanted to know how Danny’s and Mauve’s life would turn out. The story didn’t disappoint.In terms of scope, tone, setting, and depth, this book seems like a throwback to masterpieces written in the 1700s and 1800s; there is a classic and epic feel to it. Having a grand mansion as the setting helps. As in classics, Patchett does give lots of details of things that by themselves aren’t interesting, but she ends up painting a vivid picture that sets a perfect stage for the action going down, and you feel like you’re right there.This editor twitches a couple of times. There are a few tiny problems, which might be fixed by publication date:-Mauve’s workplace is described twice. Haven’t I read this before?-Kids don’t talk this way! Way too mature-sounding! Happened enough times to annoy me.-Common error: she said she “could have cared less” when she meant that she “couldn’t have cared less.”The reason I’m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had trouble believing the mom. I just didn’t think what she did was realistic (plus I bigtime didn’t approve of it). Also, there is a theme of forgiveness at the end, which I also didn’t buy (or like). Even though there isn’t a religious theme going on, I think religion is a very tricky undercurrent.All in all, a good read, though. Patchett is a master.Thanks to Edelweiss for the advance copy."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""Siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up in The Dutch House, a lavish home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Once the home of a Dutch family that owned most of the area, their artwork and interior decorating still remain throughout the infamous estate. While their real-estate-investor father loves the house and sees it as a jewel in his empire, their mother was repulsed by all the infamous home represented, and she left when Danny was very young.Left with a father generally incapable of doing more than providing the material comforts for his children, Maeve helped raise Danny, with the help of the family's two housekeepers. The two siblings, despite their age difference, formed an unshakable bond, one which became even more crucial when their father married again, this time a younger woman with two young daughters of her own. Their stepmother's dislike of them was apparent to them from the very start, although their father seemed oblivious and/or disinterested in her treatment of them, as he was more interested in keeping the peace in his household than anything else.When their stepmother gets the opportunity, she exiles Danny and Maeve from the house—and cuts off their access to any of the money that should be theirs. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive. And while they cannot seem to get The Dutch House out of their minds, given that it was such an enormous part of their lives, they want more than anything to understand the actions of their parents, which led them to where they are now. While this isn't a suspenseful book, there are a few surprises that are better to unfold as you read it rather than have them revealed. This is a book that was paced a lot slower than I like, but there is a lot of richness to behold, including emotion, nostalgia, family dynamics, and even a little humor. What fascinated me even more is what a major character the house itself played, much like in

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsThis is the third book of Patchett’s that I’ve read, the first being State of Wonder,  the second, Commonwealth, and this is one adds to the proof that she was born to write these complex family dramas where each character equally shares the wounds of all involved.  A little like a fairy tale flipped upside-down, this story includes an imposing, castle-like house, which seems to affect each character differently, as though abiding inside these walls seems to create an entirely different relationship between the house and each character. It begins as World War II is ending, and this then poor young family who have been living in base housing, living a happy, if simple life find their world upended when the father, Cyril, buys a house – unbeknownst to his young wife and young daughter, Maeve. The wife, Elna, is… well, impressed by the house, but the impression isn’t a good one, and she can’t imagine how this house could be theirs when they are poor. Something must be wrong beyond her feeling that this is far too ostentatious for her to ever feel comfortable living in. As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past. Narrated by the son, Danny, it seemed as though these were stories shared by and about real people, and imparted with the grace and dignity offered to cherished loved ones.

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"Awfully close to 5 stars!The Dutch House is full of the stuff I love in fiction. It’s really well written, has great characters, is original and feels like a big meaty story I could get lost in. Danny is the narrator. He grew up in the grandiose Dutch House with his sister, Maeve, and his father. What happens to his mother is a mystery that unravels over time. But the fallout from her disappearance is a very strong bond between Danny and Maeve, and a cascade of emotional and other consequences for everyone. At the centre of the novel is the house — loved and reviled depending on the character. In the end, there is a symmetry to the story that is emotionally wrought and complex. This is not an easy story with straightforward characters. But it’s very readable. I read this one as a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and it definitely works well as a buddy read because there’s much to discuss — especially the end. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

From the masterful beginning until the perfect ending, and everything in between; the characters who feel like family, the Dutch house itself, the story which loops around and circles in upon itself, surprises, unexpected opportunities and also the letting go of hatred and revenge when there's no point in them anymore. I'm still not sure how I feel about the Mother, but I'll be dwelling on her for quite some time.I don't know exactly how Ann Patchett keeps on getting better and better, but she has taken grand storytelling to a new level."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I haven't read all of her books, but I have read many of them that I love with my whole heart; Bel Canto, Run, Truth and Beauty are my favorites by her. The Dutch House is a five star read too. I was completely in love with her characters, especially Maeve and her brother Danny, who are essentially made orphans and paupers by the death of their father, the desertion by their mother, and their wicked stepmother who kicks Danny out of her home when he is only 15. Maeve has to take care of Danny and herself and she does an outstanding job. This is a novel about siblings who love each other and take care of each other which is something that is very rare in books.Another theme of the book, besides family devotion is the importance of working hard and studying hard. Maeve and Danny are hard workers and believe in education for its own sake. This is another reason why I love this book. At the heart of the book is their home, the one their father bought as a gift for their mother, that she rejected. The children survive despite the loss of their home and even their wicked stepmother is toothless at the end."

For me, having had a bad childhood and a bad marriage, “Home” has always been a place. Now that I’m divorced, the first home that I created for myself after my divorce was the first place that I ever truly felt safe in my entire life. Now, having moved, I have strived to create that same feeling of “Home” elsewhere. For others, “Home” may be the people you surround yourselves with.In “The Dutch House” by Ann Patchett, “the house” as such, plays a huge part of the story and everything revolves around it. For some of the characters in this novel, I believe that home is definitely a place.Danny and Maeve Conroy are siblings who live in The Dutch House with their parents until tragedy strikes and then the unthinkable happens and Danny and Maeve’s life changes drastically. Thereafter Danny and Maeve visit The Dutch House frequently albeit from the confines of Maeve’s car. Reflecting and reminiscing. Though their lives go on and decades pass, Danny and Maeve’s lives always revolve around The Dutch House, what has transpired over the years and what goes on inside on a daily basis. Thought provoking, engaging and heartbreaking, “The Dutch House” includes a whole host of complex characters and emotions. There are several themes in this book, including: acceptance; dysfunction; family; friendship; forgiveness; love; obsession; reconciliation and perseverance, to name a few. This book will evoke emotion, whether you like it or not. Frustration, anger, disgust, joy and/or love. I was wholly engrossed in the storyline and in the characters and every time a “shoe dropped” my jaw just about dropped as well. I grabbed the audiobook of this from my library and was delighted to find that TOM HANKS was the narrator! TOM freaking HANKS!!! He did a phenomenal job narrating and completely drew me into this story. What I can say is that I truly enjoyed this story and loved the characters of Danny and Maeve. I found certain aspects of the story to be a bit unbelievable given my personal background but I enjoyed the book nonetheless. While I preferred “Commonwealth,”I did enjoy this and would recommend it to fans of literary fiction. A huge thank you to my local library for loaning me a copy of this audiobook! Thank you to Tom Hanks for the stellar narration!Published on Goodreads on 10.18.20."

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett rarely disappoints and The Dutch House is no exception. This story spans several decades, beginning with siblings Danny and Maeve, in their childhood, growing up in the Dutch House, outside of Philadelphia. The story is told entirely from Danny’s perspective. He’s very close with Maeve, his older sister, as their mother, Elna, left when the children were young. The family was well-off and their father, Cyril, though not particularly warm, provided for and raised his two children, who couldn’t got a straight answer as to why Elna left, just hearing bits and pieces through others. I was frustrated on their behalf for the lack of answers. Cyril remarries Andrea, a woman with little regard for Danny and Maeve, even though she has two daughters of her own. When tragedy strikes, Andrea kicks Danny and Maeve out of the Dutch House, redirecting the course of their lives. The siblings grow even closer as they deal with the devastating blow of being thrown out of their home and try to forge on with their new life. Is a house really a home? Does karma exist? At what point, if ever, does forgive and forget happen? These are all questions indirectly posed in The Dutch House, where the house itself is a central character in the story. I liked both Danny and Maeve though at points, I recognized why their fierce loyalty to one another could be frustrating for others. Danny bent a bit too easily to Maeve’s wishes at times. I did enjoy the subtle sarcasm of Danny’s adult POV in the story. It never ceases to amaze me how talented of a writer Ann Patchett is - I’m a big fan and continue to marvel at how she writes such great stories, none of which are alike. I appreciate the variation of settings, different characters, and that her stories do not follow a set formula. While I didn’t love The Dutch House quite as much as Commonwealth or State of Wonder, I still really liked it and found the book to be a worthy read."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are some novels where I instantly feel connected to the narrator as if he were an old friend. Something about the way Ann Patchett presents her central character of Danny Conroy in her new novel “The Dutch House” hooked me to his consciousness. Maybe it's the tone of his wide-eyed innocence and ignorance as he looks back at his childhood, family life and the home he was cast out of. It's a sensibility I can relate to now that I'm in my early 40s and think back to the mysteries of my early life wondering why certain decisions were made. Danny and his sister Maeve grow up in a grand house with a prosperous father, but their mother abandoned them in their childhood. When their father marries a new woman named Andrea who brings her own two daughters into the house, the Conroy children feel themselves growing even more estranged from their aloof father. In their teenage years they are unceremoniously ousted from their family home and must fend for themselves. Danny recounts this story and the haunting way he and his sister often linger outside the house they've been cast out of ruminating about the past and the truth about their family. In a way, every adult must feel this way reflecting on what Joyce Carol Oates calls “the lost landscape” of childhood. Patchett also poses a number of tantalizing mysteries about this particular family which kept me gripped and I admire the subtle way she raises lingering questions to do with the meaning of family, belonging and home.

I've read a number of her books, saw her speak a few times, even went to her bookstore while on a work trip through Nashville. Needless to say, there was no doubt I would read this one and like it. I've yet to read anything that she writes and not like it. I still have a few of her books to read (that I have copies of, even signed copies of books) but feel like I don't want to rush. I always want to have one of her books available to read. I know it's odd. But on to The Dutch House.The Dutch House is a slow moving family story, a sad family story. The story goes back and forth in time, over five decades, telling us about the lives of Danny and Maeve Conroy. Danny and Maeve grew up, to a point, in The Dutch House. As with any Ann Patchett story, I wanted it to end a different way. Perhaps that's just me. You hear from the time when Danny and Maeve are small children, until very much later in life, and that house. The Dutch House plays such a strong role in the story, but also in the lives of anyone who has been in that house. It has this pull, this allure, that Danny and Maeve are almost, many times, living the in past and remembering their time in that house. Even though the story is one of such a fractured family, the bond between Danny and Maeve are so strong. It kept me pushing to finish to hear more.As soon as it was available, I begged my library for the audio version. I was the first to get it! Yeah! Tom Hanks narrated the story. At first, I thought I might not like the narration. I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) but was afraid it would just not work. I thought he did a good job, sometimes I thought maybe a bit much. But I was so drawn into the story. I often listen while working in the kitchen and was looking for things to do, just so I could hear more. The story was quite slow at times but I liked it (hence 4 stars). I can't say this is my favorite of hers. Bel Canto will forever be my favorite. One I should probably re-read, or perhaps one of her's I'm savoring on my shelves will be next in line."

I loved all the characters (including the house) and how Ann Patchett portrayed them in all their humanity. Even though the story, told by Danny, the Conroy son and brother to Maeve, goes back and forth in time over five decades, I found it quite easy to follow.

With The Dutch House it took me nearly two weeks to work up the ‘courage’ to review it. The fact is that I loved The Dutch House so much that I find hard to see it as a ‘mere’ work of fiction.This is the eighth novel that I’ve read by Ann Patchett and she has yet to disappoint. It is difficult to ‘pick’ a favourite, even if I can see that throughout the course of her writing career she has really honed her craft. Yet, I wholeheartedly loved her early books (especially her unjustly underrated 1997 novel, The Magician's Assistant), so to imply that she ‘keeps getting better’ would be doing her a disservice. Regardless of the scope of her stories (whether they take place in a short period of time in a particular city, such as in Run, or move us between two ‘extremes’, in The Magician's Assistant we move between Los Angeles and Nebraska, or take us on even longer journey, for instance in State of Wonder we follow Dr. Marina Singh’s as she leaves Minnesota for the Amazon Rainforest) Patchett tends to explore the same themes: there is a focus on familial relationships, especially between siblings, and these established dynamics are often changed due to some ‘major’ event (often the death of a loved one/relative/colleague). Although The Dutch House is written in Patchett’s signature prose, which can be described as being deceptively simple it features a first-person perspective, which is a departure from her usual third-person point of view. Being inside Danny Conroy’s head makes for an immersive experience and within the first pages I was captivated by his story. Through an act of retrospection Danny looks back to the past and what follows is a narrative that could be described as a bildungsroman. Danny’s childhood in the Dutch House—a large, if not incongruous, mansion in a prosperous suburb of Philadelphia—is clouded by the absence of his mother (a woman he cannot clearly recall but whose absence he nonetheless feels) and by his relationship with his remote father. It is Maeve, Danny’s older sister, who takes on the role of ‘parental’ figure, and their relationship is very much the underlying thread of the story. The Dutch House, weighed down by its history, inspires fascination in Andrea, the woman who will go on to become Danny and Maeve’s step-mother. The novel begins in fact with Danny’s memory of his first meeting with Andrea, one that seems to have almost a fairy-tale-esque quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change.Throughout Danny’s narrative we will also see the way in which the Conroy siblings remain drawn to the house, a house which seems to acquire an emblematic role in the lives of those who have lived in: it represents their childhoods, their father—his career, his marriage(s)—and the rather unfortunate VanHoebeeks. Patchett renders this house without loosing herself in extensive architectural descriptions, rather she brings to the foreground some of its features (Maeve's windowseat) and some of its objects. The paintings within the house (Maeve's portrait and those of the VanHoebeeks) also seem to hold a certain function in Danny's recollection of his past.“Maybe it was neoclassical, though with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts. The house, complete with mantels, had been finished in 1922.”In his remembrance Danny frequently makes vague, if not downright oblique, allusions to later events or revelations, which in turn creates tension between his past and present. Also framing Danny's recollection of his youth are a series of scenes in which he sits in alongside Maeve in her car just outside the Dutch House.Danny also questions the veracity of his memories: “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” He reassess certain moments and figures of his past, finding hidden complexities in what had at first appeared to be seemingly unremarkable occurrences.“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”While the novel is narrated by Danny he never paints himself as the ‘hero’ of his own story. He often wonders whether he should have acted in a different way towards someone or something, trying to understand why things unfurled the way that they did. While the motivations of other characters might escape him-and possibly us-they are never reduced to a certain role/function. The each have a story even if we are not always made privy to it. An although there is an awareness of the limitations provided by Danny's narration, the story never feels restricted to his experiences and worldview. “Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.”My edition of The Dutch House includes an essay in which Ann Patchett says that “for a long time I had planned to call the book Maeve as it was her story.” The novel, in fact, very much pivots around Maeve but it is her brother who is telling her tale.We see the way in which their experiences in the Dutch House makes them determined to fulfil their desires or to take a certain path in their life: for Danny that is to become, as his father before him, a real-estate developer, while Maeve wants to carry on working a job she loves even if many consider her to be overqualified to do. While to some degree Danny's vision of Maeve influences our perception of her, we are always aware that she may have hidden qualities. What is certainly undeniable is her love for her brother. Their bond is portrayed with such frankness and poignancy as to become vividly real in the reader’s mind.This a story full of beauty and sorrow. There are regrets, wonderful reflections on memory, moments that are brimming with love or sadness...Patchett spins a tale in which families fall apart or come together. It is an intimate depiction of the bond between two siblings. Time and again Danny draws strength from his relationship to his sister, and even when he begins to feel unmoored from his own life, and as he struggles trying to reconcile himself with his past, Maeve provides him with a sense of belonging.Patchett's sense of place is as detailed and evocative as ever. She seamlessly renders midcentury America through Danny's narration, evoking within me a sense of nostalgia for a country I've never even been to. And while Danny's story spans decades, it maintains its focus on the same group of people, painting an intimate portrait of Danny's friends and family....to put it simply I fell in love with it. Patchett's harmonious prose made the experience all the more beautiful, and I was so enthralled by her story and her characters that to I struggled to think of them as works of fiction.What more can I say? I think this is a masterpiece.“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm relieved to get this over and done with. In England we're very familiar with novels about enchanted houses. Off the top of my head there's Brideshead Revisited, Howard's End, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, To the Lighthouse, The Tenant of Wildfall Hall, I Capture the Castle. All of them much better than this American take on the theme. A brother and sister are left by their mother. She leaves to help the poor in India. An utterly unconvincing plot device which was never given credence. Their father remarries a nightmare woman. The evil stepmother was by a country mile the best character in the book but unfortunately she doesn't occupy much of it. Mostly we see the brother and sister as adults, both of whom are dysfunctional where relationships are concerned, something they share with every other character in the novel. They share an incestuous relationship in all but deed. Neither has a glamorous or creative job. And the problem for me was they simply weren't interesting. We learn little about them of interest. Why didn't Maeve, the daughter, ever have a love relationship? There's lots and lots of mundane domestic detail in this novel but little insight. There was at least one whole chapter that could have been taken out without losing any relevant information. There's also no humour. Patchett's prose is neat and tidy but without risk or adventure. The resolution was hackneyed. Objectively, it isn't a bad book (I don't think it's a particularly good one either) but when characters you're supposed to sympathise with bore and irritate you there's no getting past it."

I only understood what I'd lost."" With The Dutch House, Ann Patchett has created a story that jumps off the page. Fully realized characters and one of the BEST sibling relationships I've ever read about in 337 short pages. And it didn't need to be any longer. It was absolutely perfect.This is the story of a house and its inhabitants. It's really Danny's story most, which I loved. When I read Patchett's previous novel  Commonwealth, which I really enjoyed, I wished it had a bit more focus. It spreads itself across many more perspectives, and while the writing is strong—just as it is here—the pacing waxes and wanes as the stories unfold. In this novel, however, we only ever hear from Danny. He's an endearing, empathetic, but not always to be trusted narrator. But his qualms are understandable as he's been through childhood trauma that reverberates through decades as we follow him and his sister Maeve grow up and away from their childhood home.In ways this reminded me of  The Goldfinch—thematically, stylistically, but also with this inimitable quality of feeling. This book was a book of feelings: rage and sympathy and small joys and sorrows that make up a complicated life.Patchett has her pulse on human emotion unlike many authors, and in this novel she's both prodded the wound and provided the salve. It's quite a feat and one I'll be contemplating for a long time."
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 5 out of 5,"I cannot explain why Ann Patchett is so good because while I read her books, I am so engrossed and involved that I do not have the capability to figure it out. That would mean letting go of the story, slowing down or stopping, not letting myself get pulled along deeper and deeper. Her prose and her plots are often (though not always) simple. I cannot tell why I am absolutely mesmerized, I just am. It is simply something to be accepted, and something to be treasured.THE DUTCH HOUSE left me with an emotional hangover I still haven't quite recovered from a day later. It worked its slow, sneaky magic on me until I was at its mercy. At first I did not quite see where it would take me, a few plot twists surprised me, but by the last third even when I knew exactly what was going to happen I felt helpless, watching, weeping, carried along by its tide. The themes of the novel are ones that hit me very deeply, which certainly added to my experience. The mystery of parents to their children, the way we see others' mistakes so clearly and then make the very same mistakes ourselves, the way the experience inside a single family can feel drastically different to everyone in it. And on top of all of that is a question of forgiveness, its blessings and its limits. Forgiveness is something I think about a lot, as I am very very bad at it, but this story is not entirely sold on it either and the sometimes-arbitrary way we deem some people worthy of forgiveness and others absolutely undeserving is one of those tricks of human nature the novel uses to full effect.Danny, our narrator, begins the novel as a child. His mother has left so long ago he barely remembers her. His father is distant. His sister Maeve, seven years older, is his parent and his closest confidant. Their father is in real estate, and they live in the titular house, an architectural marvel in the Philadelphia suburbs in the mid-20th century, filled with the belongings of the prior inhabitants, the kind of people who have giant portraits of themselves hanging on the wall. As the novel starts, their father brings home a woman, bringing a massive change to the small family. Maeve is the center of the story, and she remains throughout Danny's life the center of his world. As their family changes and then crumbles, Maeve is all that Danny has and she is devoted to his success. While Maeve loves Danny deeply, she also uses him as a tool to take out her revenge against their stepmother, something Danny is not all that interested in doing, but he doesn't put up much of a fight. Over the years they try to learn more about their closed-off father and their missing mother, needing to build up a family mythology and a deeper understanding of how it all went wrong. By the end of the novel, this small story has taken on an epic scale. I love it when a domestic plot can take on the kinds of choices and betrayals that lead to overwhelming emotions. Patchett does that so well in this book, slowly laying the groundwork, making the stakes clear, sketching the characters in minute detail, so when you reach the end you may find yourself unable to stop reading, sobbing on the couch. (Or maybe that's just me.) A rewarding, fulfilling novel.Update: Re-read in 2023 and... it definitely didn't hit the same for me for whatever reason. This time I was so annoyed at adult Danny, rolling my eyes at how he romanticized being a landlord, frustrated at how he is constantly cared for by everyone in his life and never appreciates it. I do like the fairy tale nature of it, and Patchett is so weirdly good at jumping around in time. "

It tells the story of a brother and sister over the course of five decades.At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: ‏‫«خانه‌ ی هلندی»؛ «عمارت هلندی»؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و سوم ماه سپتامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: ‏‫خانه‌ ی هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت‮‬‏‫؛ مترجم منا اختیاری؛ تهران، آموت، 1398؛ در 416ص؛ شاب9786003841628؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ ‏‫مترجم یاسمن ثانوی؛ ویراستار کاوه عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، 1399؛ در 352ص؛ شابک9786222330958؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ مترجم الهام جمالی‌پویا؛ تهران، کتاب مرو، 1400، در 377ص؛ شابک9786227384178؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی (کوتاه شده)؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ مترجم نازنین صابری؛ تهران، آسمان نیلگون؛ 1400؛ در 76ص؛ شابک9786227633375؛داستان برادری و خواهری در پنج دهه است؛ «خانه ی هلندی یا عمارت هلندی» ساختمانی‌ در پارک «الکینز، پنسیلوانیا» در حومه ی «فیلادلفیا» است؛ خانواده ی «فن هوبیک»، زن و شوهری با اصالت «هلندی»، که دارایی خود را از صنعت دخانیات، به دست آورده بودند، آن خانه را در سال1922میلادی ساخته اند، ملّاکی خودساخته و پیروز، به نام «سیریل کانروی»، در سال 1946میلادی، آن ساختمان را خرید، تا همسرش «النا» را غافلگیر کند؛ فرزندان آنها، «دنی» و «مِیو» در «خانه ی هلندی» بزرگ شدند؛ «النا»، «خانه ی هلندی» را دوست ندارد، و آنگاه که «دنی» سه ساله و «مِیو» ده ساله است، خانواده‌ اش را رها می‌کند، تا به فقرای «هند» یاری رساند؛ پس از درگذشت «سیریل»، نامادری بچه‌ها «آندره»، «دنی» و «میو» را از خانه بیرون می‌کند، این خواهر و برادر که دیگر کسی را ندارند، باید به همدیگر تکیه نمایند؛ «میو» با باقیمانده ی ارثیه‌ شان، «دنی» را به مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «چوت رزمری هال»، دانشگاه «کلمبیا» و دانشکده پزشکی می‌فرستد؛ «دنی»، با اینکه علاقه‌ ای به پزشکی ندارد، برای خوشآیند «میو» دانشکده پزشکی را به پایان می‌رساند؛ راوی این رمان «دنی کانروی» در بزرگسالی‌ خویشتن استتایخ بهنگام رسانی 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThe lives of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy are overshadowed by their childhood home, 'The Dutch House', an elegant glass mansion located in Elkins Park - a ritzy suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The house, which looks more like a museum than a residence, was built by the Dutch VanHoebeeks in the 1920s, and purchased - complete with furniture and home décor - by budding real estate mogul Cyril Conroy in 1946. Cyril is delighted to surprise his young family with the house, not knowing it will affect their lives in unpredictable ways. Danny Conroy, who narrates the book as an adult, describes the three-story house as ""a singular confluence of talent and luck that was too much house for anyone"".....but that felt just right to him and Maeve. From certain angles, ""the house seemed to float several inches above the hill it sat on"" and ""the panes of glass that surrounded the glass front door were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought iron vines."" The blue Delft mantelpieces in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were “said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts.” The house also boasted silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, oil paintings, Chinese lamps, marble floors, gilt ceilings, egg and dart molding, a large ballroom, imposing portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek, a swimming pool, and much more. The first casualty of the Dutch house is Danny and Maeve's mother, Elna, a humble woman who feels compelled to do good works. Elna is profoundly oppressed by the opulent house, and runs off to India to help the poor when Danny is three and Maeve is ten.Since dad Cyril is more involved with his business than his children, Danny and Maeve are largely brought up by housekeeper/cooks Sandy and Jocelyn. The women are conscientious and affectionate caretakers, but they aren't mothers, and Maeve essentially steps into this role for her brother. For her part, Maeve is inconsolable at the loss of her mom, and in addition to general malaise develops diabetes - which the family attributes to Elna's desertion. In time Cyril meets a woman named Andrea, who's mesmerized by the Dutch house. Cyril isn't particularly interested in Andrea, but she slyly inveigles herself into his life, marries him, and moves in with her daughters Norma and Bright. The children - Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright - get along like a house afire, but Danny and Maeve never warm up to Andrea.....or she to them. Sadly, as soon as Andrea moves in, she makes it her business to disenfranchise Danny and Maeve.Right after Maeve leaves for Barnard College in New York, for instance, Andrea usurps Maeve's lovely bedroom for Norma and Bright. And when Cyril and Danny plan an excursion to New York to have lunch with Maeve and explore buildings, Andrea invites herself and her girls along AND changes the itinerary to accommodate her own interests. (This doesn't work out so well for Andrea though. 😊)Cyril dies at 53, when 22-year-old Maeve has graduated college and 15-year-old Danny is in high school. Andrea promptly throws Danny out, calling Maeve to come and get him. The angry, hurt siblings set up housekeeping in Maeve's apartment in a nearby town, where Maeve works as an accountant/manager for a frozen vegetable company. Danny and Maeve retrieve very little from the Dutch house, not even family heirlooms or Maeve's portrait, which was commissioned by her father. As it turns out, Danny and Maeve are left with almost nothing. It seems Andrea managed to get EVERYTHING in her name: the Dutch house; Cyril's business; and Cyril's money. (One wonders what Cyril - and his lawyer - were thinking. 😒)Cyril never made a will, and the only thing left specifically for the children (Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright) is a trust fund for their education. Danny had planned to join (and eventually inherit) his dad's real estate business, which Andrea promptly sells. So - out of spite - Maeve insists that Danny attend Choate boarding school, then Columbia University, then Columbia Medical School.....all of which are very expensive schools. (FYI: Combined tuition and expenses would cost more than a million dollars in today's money). Andrea is infuriated by Danny draining the education fund, but is helpless to intervene. ChoateColumbiaThough Danny and Maeve no longer have any ownership in the Dutch house, they're inexorably drawn back. The siblings periodically park in front of the house, lambaste Andrea, and reminisce about their lives there.They talk about their mother, their step-sisters Norma and Bright, the housekeepers Sandy and Jocelyn, their bamboozled father, Danny's future, etc. Maeve wants Danny to be a doctor but - though he's training in the medical field - Danny continues to dream of going into real estate. Even in later years, when Danny and Maeve are adults with numerous responsibilities, they occasionally 'visit' the Dutch house.We follow Danny and Maeve for several decades, during which a lot happens: marriage, children, career advancement, new homes, squabbles, chance meetings, re-acquaintances, illness, death.....the usual drama of life. Through it all, Danny and Maeve remain the most important people in each other's lives. No matter what he's doing, Danny always longs to step away and call Maeve; and the only person Maeve loves more than Danny is her departed mother. The story is by no means a tragedy, and no one is out on the street dressed in rags and starving. In fact, from an outside point of view, Danny and Maeve lead very successful lives. The siblings' own dearest wish would probably be to toss Andrea out on her ear....but, as the Rolling Stones sing, ""No, you can't always get what you want; you can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you find, you get what you need."" The Rolling StonesBy the end of the book, things in Elkins Park come full circle....but in an unexpected way.The book is rather slow-moving for my taste, but I was invested in the story and found the characters memorable, so - for me - the novel was worth reading.

At times, the description of the Dutch House and it’s importance for the characters throughout their lives reminded me of the large old house we grew up in. Our house was known by the name of one of the early owners who became famous, and everyone in our small town referred to it as such. It was a beautiful old home with a ton of character, and one that needed even more work when our family moved in. But, it was the spot for many of our best memories of our childhood, and it’s the only house that I occasionally return to as time goes by. Definitely recommend the audiobook, Tom Hanks was fantastic. Enjoy!"

'The Dutch House' refers to a mansion Meave and Danny live with their parents. We go through the lives of these siblings from their childhood to quite late in their lives. Their mother leaves suddenly without a word one day when they were children, and they never knew why. We go through the next phase of their lives after this event till they are old basically. If you haven't read Ann Patchett before, you need to know that her books are very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the life span of a family and witness their lives. In this book, the focus was the 2 siblings and their tight relationship. Meave and Danny were a delight to follow. I even envied their unshaken closeness and love for each other as an only child :) They go through a lot together and their support for each other helps them achieve in life. Of course there are lots of other characters, but they are revolving around this brother & sister. I love Patchett's writing. It's very slow, but very immersive. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. I . was thinking of the book when I wasn't reading it, and wanted to return to it for sure. For people who love slow, character driven stories that goes on for a lifetime, Ann Patchett is the address :) The Waterstones edition with its sprayed edges is a delight!

With each book I fall ever more in love with the elegance of her writing, it’s the kind I melt into, that carries me along the plot line, which seems simple on the surface, meeting characters along the way that I soon come to regard as family with the range of emotions that implies. And even when I don’t particularly like the ending, I accept that it is as it should be.This is a timeless plot with unforgettable characters, but it is the house that looms large in both its physical presence and in the characters’ emotional and often obsessive attachment to it. Ann offers a perfectly paced and intimate portrait of family, loss and longing and will leave you to ponder the essential question posed, do you think it is ever possible to see the past as it actually was?Love doesn’t begin to cover my feelings about this book.

In my world things go wrong, people make mistakes, people struggle to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved, to pay the bills. Bloddy hell, in my world people even struggle to get out of bed each morning. The thing is, I come from a very big family and life has been hard for most of the time for all of us. Isolation, uneducated and exploited children, too many pregnancies, teenage pregnancies, disabilities, bullying, hunger, financial problems, cancer, depression, drug abuse, Alzheimer’s, suicide (and more). There was always a “story” about one of these topics in my life (sometimes more than one at the same time. Can you believe it?). We, as a family, have seen all of this. We know of these things not simply because we’ve heard about them but because we’ve been there. We know how it feels. Oh, yes, life is hard. Sometimes unbearably hard. And this is why I didn’t believe any of this. Well, to be clear and fair, I didn’t believe in a single world Ann Patchett has written down here. I believe Mrs Patchett simply didn’t know. She heard it all in the news. It’s not her fault that she has been lucky. Luck plays a big role in this game called life, you know…Mrs Patchett might have done some research on real estate and law but for me that didn’t make for a more believable storyline anyway. She’d put her characters in a certain difficult situation and then, because she didn’t really know how things happen in the real world, she jumps forwards in time and (abracadabra) everything’s sorted. Then she jumps in time again, this time backwards and tells us about another difficult situation in the characters lives but only to jump forward again in time and (abracadabra) we’ll find everything is sorted again. When she wasn’t solving things jumping in time, she would add an unbelievable coincidence or create a convenient new character and easily sort things out (again). Clever, hum?! While reading this book, I actually never knew how things played out, I just learned that they did. When Mrs Patchett finally stopped using this annoying literary device its was already too late and I didn’t really give a damn about what happened or not to all these people. Later on, Mrs Patchett went back to her favourite way of sorting things out and she managed to annoy me even more by telling me “two weeks later” that she killed one of the main characters. Ahahah. If all this had happened to real human beings they would have pulled out all the hair from their own heads. They would have screamed and shouted. They would have cried for mercy. It’s human nature. And this takes us to what was missing here and what I wanted to see, what I think was needed to tell a story like this; Humanity. Three stars only because this was a quick and easy read and the writing wasn’t that bad. This was my introduction to Ann Patchett’s writing and I’ve had enough of her already. She definitely adds too much sugar for my taste. No more for me, thank you very much."

Paintings of the Dutch couple, Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek (“Van-who-bake”), dominate the drawing room and a portrait of Maeve, at ten in her bright red coat, hangs on the opposite wall. That’s the cover of the book, which is great.The story is told in a circular fashion. It opens with their father bringing home a woman, Andrea, to meet his children. Their mother had left, returned, left, returned, and finally left for good. The two servants, Sandy and Jocelyn, have been raising the children, who are comfortable with things the way they are. Maeve is fifteen, Danny, eight. Andrea is obviously smitten with the grand house but seems less enthusiastic about Cyril’s children. Maeve is already a head taller than the tiny widow, and later, when they discover Andrea has two little girls, there is even less likelihood she will view them favourably.”Though the story will be remembered that Maeve and Andrea were at odds right from the start, that wasn’t true. Maeve was perfectly fair and polite when they met, and she remained fair and polite until doing so was no longer possible.”Cyril has become a successful property developer and Danny loves going with him to inspect buildings and building sites and collect the rents from tenants. He looks forward to taking over the company one day. He’s learning how to fix taps, patch cracks, work with his hands.“’The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor,’ he said to me when we were eating lunch in the car. ‘That’s the strike you have against you. A boy grows up rich like you, never wanting for anything, never being hungry’—he shook his head, as if it had been a disappointing choice I’d made—'I don’t know how a person overcomes a thing like that.’”He loves his dad, but it’s Maeve who is the gravitational force around which he orbits. They are fiercely loyal to each other, an unbreakable unit against the world. Maeve manages his life.I found Danny completely self-absorbed, worrying mostly about himself and Maeve, but taking little real interest in anyone else. He loves playing basketball with friends, but they aren’t part of the story. It’s interesting to read about children growing up in post-war Pennsylvania and how a war veteran like their father managed to establish himself. It is not interesting to have scene after scene after scene of Maeve and Danny talking about the house and picking at the scabs on the wounds caused by Andrea, and before that, their mother’s disappearance. It’s all about Danny, and I wasn’t that crazy about him. I understand the popular audio book is narrated by Tom Hanks. The voice in my head was a bit petulant sometimes, more like Steve Carell's character from the American version of The Office, when Maeve was talking Danny into something. [I must admit, I haven't heard the Hanks rendition, and he's such a good actor, I know he can complain as well as anyone. But he's better known for being likeable and smart.]I lost interest as time went on. I found the strength of Maeve’s influence a bit much to swallow. I don’t want to give any spoilers, so I’ll just say that the alliances that formed later and the resolution of some of the relationships seemed to tie up the loose ends too neatly and unrealistically, for me. But don’t take my word for it. This is a very popular book, and you may love it as so many others have. I enjoyed it enough to round up to four stars rather than down to three.Thanks to NetGalley and Bloomsbury for the preview copy from which I’ve quoted."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25472453-christy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tom Hanks as narrator... YES PLEASE!! I will listen to anything he reads -- I just love him so much! I feel like the main character in this book is literally the house -- The Dutch House. Cyril Conroy builds an extremely successful real estate business, literally a rags to riches story. His children are Maeve and Danny. Danny is the narrator of the family story. Cyril buys the house as a gift for his wife, Elna, who ends up hating everything it stands for. She later abandons her family when the children are still very young. She can't stand the house, living in it, or being waited on while there are poor people all over the world that need help. When their father later dies, the children are kicked out of the house by their horrible step mother, Andrea. They are forced to rely on one another, and I loved hearing about how deep their sibling bond was for life. The house is literally the downfall for every character in the story at some point, and neither sibling can let it go and move on. They are always coming back to it, even if it is just to set outside of it and reminisce. Unpopular opinion: I didn't love this one like I expected. I typically love family stories that span many decades, but this one fell flat for me. However, it was definitely beautifully written and started off strong. I was super into the beginning, and then I felt myself just wanting it to be over. Much of it seemed so unrealistic and I just got very bored."

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,Rating 5 out of 5,"A HUGE thanx to Netgalley and HarperCollins for a review copy of this book, in exchange for this honest review. I've only read two other Patchett books, but she has already become a favorite author, and I was very excited to be granted this ARC months prior to its publication in late Sept., since her last novel, Commonwealth, made it into my top 5 reads for 2016 - and I am fairly confident this one will do likewise for 2019.The storyline follows somewhat similar ground as that previous book, being, more or less, an intricate family saga covering decades of the ins and outs of the Conroy family, and in particular, how the titular family manse outside Philadelphia impacts and impedes various relationships. The focus is primarily on a pair of siblings, with younger brother Danny doing the narrating, and once again Patchett does not follow a linear chronology, but weaves the stories back and forwards from the late 40's to the early 2000's. I sometimes had trouble following this in her previous book, since there was a plethora of characters to keep straight, but this is an easier go, since there are really only about a dozen characters in total. Although Patchett's prose is not fussy or overtly calls attention to itself, it always flows beautifully and is a pleasure to luxuriate in. Just the kind of lovely, leisurely read one wants/needs for the beginning of summer. I hope it is a tremendous success for her."

This is an intelligent novel that is almost a fable including an evil stepmonster but it’s the house that looms large. A house that represents success, greed, loss, sadness and, ultimately, forgiveness. A wife is desperately unhappy, close siblings are eventually ousted and many lives are deeply affected by the house and what it means to each character. Patchett has a deft touch and now I’ll have the pleasure of reading her other work."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"Now Nominated for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2020This family saga is compulsively readable and highly accessible, but not without depth: While the story is narrated from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the main protagonist is his sister Maeve who, after their father dies and their stepmother throws them out of the house, raises and takes care of her little brother. The title-giving Dutch House is the Conroy's former family home and becomes an obsession for the siblings who associate it with their lost childhood, a manifestation of their enigmatic past. Throughout their lives, the mansion exerts a gravitational pull, both as an idea and as a physical place: Danny and Maeve visit the house, but do not enter it, as their stepmother continues to live there. Patchett follows the Conroy siblings over decades, and the story is pushed forward by the riddles of their family history: What happened to their biological mother after she left the family? What happened to the nanny and the rest of the staff working for the family, what became of their stepsisters? What will become of Danny and Maeve who are now by themselves? Two narrative devices are particularly striking: The author remixes classic fairy tales (the siblings searching for their way home (Danny's wife even mentions ""Hänsel und Gretel""), the evil stepmother etc.) and works with the motif of the double. Characters often form pairs, most obviously the Conroy siblings themselves, and when a third party enters the picture, it gets complicated. Loyalty and selflessness are main topics of the book. The book is most interesting when Patchett hints at the subjective feelings of guilt and anger and at the flaws of the characters: Danny is a victim of the circumstanes, but frequently oblivious to the plight of those who try to help him; Maeve is struggling to find a balance between living her own life and protecting her brother; and many other characters are also torn between conflicting feelings and interests (I don't want to spoil the plot points that keep readers invested in the story). While the language is not particularly inventive or lyrical, it is still addictive and manages to create an absorbing atmosphere. Also, there are some aspects of the story that don't quite ring true and/or have an soap opera-like quality, but the story is so intriguing that it doesn't matter all that much. Patchett plants many ideas and develops them throughout the story (the meaning of a house as a home, illness and trauma, portraits as a means to reveal and capture people, the role of religion/Catholicism, the toxicity of unresolved conflicts, forms of love and selflessness), but the text is very easy to follow and reads quickly. So all in all, maybe not the biggest literary masterpiece ever written, but this book is very intelligent entertainment and fun to read.

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"An Ann Patchett novel is a treasure. She writes about family so compellingly that I always feel as if I know her characters in real life, and I'm drawn into the stories she shares about their inner lives.If you're already a Patchett fan, you've probably heard about how she describes her novels: ""I've been writing the same book my whole life -- that you're in one family, and all of a sudden, you're in another family and it's not your choice and you can't get out.""The Dutch House is a novel about family, but this time the focus is on two siblings, Maeve and Danny. Maeve is our heroine, but her younger brother Danny is our narrator. We see how their lives get upended when their mother runs away and their father picks a wicked stepmother as his second wife.I listened to this book on audio, performed by Tom Hanks, who was a marvelous storyteller. I usually read an Ann Patchett novel several times, and I'm already looking forward to re-reading this one and discovering anew all of her clever descriptions. Highly recommended for readers who like literary fiction.Favorite PassageFor the most part, what I knew about my father was what I saw: he was tall and thin with weathered skin and hair the color of rust, the color of my hair. All three of us had blue eyes. His left knee was slow to bend, worse in the winter and when it rained. He never said a word about it but it was easy enough to tell when it hurt him. He smoked Pall Malls, put milk in his coffee, worked the crossword puzzle before reading the front page. He loved buildings the way boys loved dogs. When I was eight years old, I asked my father at the dinner table if he was going to vote for Eisenhower or Stevenson. Eisenhower was running for a second term and all the boys in school were for him. My father clicked the point of his knife against his plate and told me I was never to ask a question like that, not of him, not of anyone. ""It may be fine for boys to speculate on whom they might vote for because boys can't vote,"" he said. ""But to ask an adult such a question is to violate a man's right to privacy."" In retrospect, I imagine my father was horrified that I might think there was any chance he'd vote for Stevenson, but I didn't know that at the time. What I knew was that you had to touch a hot stove only once. Here are the things I talked to my father about when I was a boy: baseball -- he liked the Phillies. Trees -- he knew the name of every one, though he would chastise me for asking about the same kind of tree more than once. Birds -- likewise. He kept feeders in the backyard and could easily identify all of his customers. Buildings -- be it their structural soundness, architectural details, property value, property tax, you name it -- my father liked to talk about buildings. To list the things I didn't ask my father about would be to list the stars in heaven, so let me throw out one: I did not ask my father about women. Not women in general and what you were supposed to do with them, and definitely not women in the particular: my mother, my sister, Andrea."
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,Rating 4 out of 5,"“It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”For those who’ve read Ann Patchett before, The Dutch House probably needs no introduction. It’s Ann Patchett. It’s a family saga. That’s all you need.For those (like me) who haven’t, it’s a little harder to explain the book’s appeal. It spans decades, following a brother and sister, Danny & Maeve Conroy. They live in a fancy house, then they don’t. The house is THE most remarkable thing about them. It haunts their lives.But it’s the way Patchett tells it that makes it special, the layers, the tapestry of details. We learn about the VanHoebeeks, who owned the Dutch House before the Conroys. When the VanHoebeek family line ended, the house was sold with all its contents, right down to the jewels, and two eerie life-sized paintings of the former occupants. It’s the depth of characterisations, where no one is wholly good or bad, the humanity contained in their flaws and foibles. It’s the fairytale allusions, the way Patchett replaces gingerbread and candy with floor-to-ceiling glass and blue delft mantels, and loses none of the magic and awe.This is a sparkling world of privilege, even after the house is lost, but Patchett avoids writing a ‘rich people problems’ book in two ways:1)	The problems faced are universal. A sudden death or betrayal or abandonment; an unexpected reversal of fortunes; long-simmering resentments and paths to forgiveness. Nothing money could solve. 2)	Chance is a major factor, as much in raising fortunes as losing them. Or call it luck, or fate, these lives are sailing on its winds.It’s an utterly charming, moving, absorbing novel, only slightly let down by some draggy bits and the fact that I deeply, deeply disliked the ending. But I’m definitely a Patchett fan now. 4 stars."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara-catching-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full confession: I love Ann Patchett’s writing. I KNOW I’m getting a solid novel that will cut into me, make me think, build compassion, see understanding. In her new novel “The Dutch House” she explores, again, children who are left without parental interest and supervision. As with “Commonwealth”, she also explores blended families and the bonds of stepsiblings. Beyond her themes, her writing is beautiful, lyrical, easy, like floating on an inter-tube on a lazy sunny day.Can you come to peace with what happened to you in childhood is a major theme? Danny is three when his mother leaves him and his sister Maeve, who is ten at the time. They live in a house that they call “The Dutch House” which is this big striking mansion that is ornate and ostentatious. Danny’s father bought it as a gift for Danny’s mother without her knowing. His parents were poor Irish immigrants and unbeknownst to his mother, his father, Cyril makes money in real estate without ever consulting or explaining their change in status to Elna, Danny’s mother. The family moves into the Dutch House when Maeve is five. The house even comes with a housekeeper, it’s too much for Elna who loves being poor.To add complexity, Cyril is an absent father and the children are basically raised by house staff. Along come an evil woman who has designs on the house and Cyril. Of course, Cyril marries her, and she brings in two girls. As with Patchett’s other stories, the children blend well. It’s the evil stepmother who adds tragedy when Cyril unexpectedly dies, and she bans Maeve and Danny from the house. Not only that, but she leaves the two penniless except for an educational trust left for Danny. By then Maeve is through college and Danny is a high schooler.Danny feels anger at his mother for abandoning them. Maeve feels longing. Their grit and determination get them through life. The story is told through Danny’s eyes and the story is non-linear, much like our thoughts.This would be a fabulous book club read. All the characters in the novel are fodder for discussion. Patchett shows how humans find their way, find their strengths and bonds. She shows through her characters how some can find forgiveness, some compassion, and always gratitude. "
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/630381-susan-liston,Rating 1 out of 5,"Okay, here comes the mean old crab again, unmoved by all the five star reviews. I did hesitate with one star, because it's not a bad book, Ann Patchett is a perfectly good writer, but I did not like this and my ratings are personal. (I've read three of her other books, hated one (Bel Canto) and felt lukewarm about the others.) I thought this had promise at the start. But soon it began to drag, and I began to really dislike our narrator, Danny. I didn't even believe the characters of the mother and evil stepmother. The only likable person was Maeve, and yes, she was good and dependable and kind, etc., everyone should be so lucky to have a Maeve, but how interesting to read about? For me, not very. If you are going to read a novel with pretty much no plot, you better enjoy the heck out of the characters because that's all you're going to get. And I didn't. But, hey, great cover."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37596075-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is a master storyteller and she lives up to this reputation with her latest work - The Dutch House. Her writing is superb and the stories she tells invite you in and before you know it, you’ve developed deep relationships with the characters. This is a story about abandonment, love, family, loyalty, loss, and forgiveness. It is also about growing up and letting go of the past.There are three main characters - Danny, the narrator and younger brother of Maeve, our second character and the House. The Dutch House was first built by the VanHoebeeks, who decorated it in Dutch style and lived there until they died. In fact, all of their possessions had remained there after they had left this world. Life-sized portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeeks adorned the walls of the drawing room and paintings of other relatives hung on walls throughout the house. It was a grand estate with glass in the front that saw all the way through to the flowers in the back. Patchett skillfully gives the House life with vivid imagery and detailed descriptions that you will almost feel like you are there.The VanHoebeeks weren’t the story, but in a sense the house was the story, and it was their house.The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house’s architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived.When they were young, Danny and Maeve’s mother abandoned them and Maeve stepped into that role. Danny expressed concern that no one could do the same for Maeve. The two siblings grew incredibly close and stayed that way throughout their lives. Their relationship was very touching and a very appealing aspect of the story. Several years after their Mother left, their Father married Andrea, who was the epitome of the evil stepmother. Their dislike of her further united them, if that was even possible.We ate the cookies and dredged up every awful memory of Andrea we had. We traded them between us like baseball cards, exclaiming over every piece of information one of us didn’t already know. We dug a pit and roasted her.The Dutch House figures prominently in the story. It drove Maeve’s and Danny’s Mother away — it symbolized to her luxurious excess in a world where others went starving. For their Father, it represented success. The house is what ultimately brought Andrea into their family — she married their Father in order to get it.For Danny and Maeve, the house was a place to grow up as well as to return. It represented their memories and their pasts. A dominant theme in The Dutch House is the siblings’ inability to let go of the past and their emotional baggage of anger as well as regret. The house physically drew them back time and time again, like a magnet. Whenever Danny returned to town, he and Maeve would end up parked across the street from the Dutch House, watching for any activity or news. There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up......like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.Looking and watching the house, they would reminisce about the past and wonder if one can ever truly contemplate the past objectively.But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.I didn’t even know they were sisters, meaning I was a toad. But that’s me layering the present onto the past.Ann Patchett weaves together emotional stories, which capture your heart. She is a fabulous writer: here are a few examples of her masterful use of imagery and metaphors/similes.Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.That was it. Fluffy, who had not stopped talking since I walked in the door, shut down like a mechanical horse in need of another nickel."
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-natalie,Rating 4 out of 5,"If you needed any convincing to read this book, take this next passage as your sign:(it’s a bit long but so worth the read)“Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her. Of course Sandy and Jocelyn mothered us. They made sure we were washed and fed and that our lunches were packed and our scouting dues paid. They loved us, I know they did, but they went home at the end of the day. There was no crawling into bed with Sandy or Jocelyn when I had a bad dream in the middle of the night, and it never once occurred to me to knock on my father’s door. I went to Maeve. She taught me the proper way to hold a fork. She attended my basketball games and knew all my friends and oversaw my homework and kissed me every morning before we went our separate ways to school and again at night before I went to bed regardless of whether or not I wanted to be kissed. She told me repeatedly, relentlessly, that I was kind and smart and fast, that I could be as great a man as I made up my mind to be. She was so good at all that, despite the fact that no one had done it for her.”This rings so true.The feelings evoked in me while reading The Dutch House were reminiscent of my reading experience with books like The Great Alone, Little Fires Everywhere, and A Spool of Blue Thread (both even have the similar ""Oh, Danny""). That is to say, what a journey awaits me. Maeve will be someone to behold.“Five whole days with you at home,” she said, blowing smoke out the open window. “The best five days of the year.”On another note, it showcases the author’s talents that within one page I can hate a character and yet know nothing substantial about them. Ahem, Andrea. You can just tell, like with real people, who spells trouble. Translating that feeling on paper? That’s a magical writer right there.But back to reasons why I love Maeve: “Maeve was pretty enough and popular enough that she would never have had to stay home on Saturday nights, but for the most part she did, and for the first time I realized it was because of me. She would never have left me alone in the house.”Big sisters. That's it. “and the way the last bit of light fell over her, she looked like a painting.”She looked like a … painting!! She has long black hair! The painting of the girl on the cover is MAEVE. I knew it held something more about it. 

I couldn’t stop staring at the cover when I first got my hands on the book. And so I kept feeling drawn like a magnet to it until I finally caved in and picked the book up. Like, it wouldn’t leave my head until I had it in my hands. This book was calling to me. Or rather, Maeve was calling to me. I'm intrigued now.“Now that she wasn’t around to help me with my homework, I wondered for the first time who had ever helped her when she was young.”I never realized just how much my soul needed to read a book about appreciating older sisters as stand-in mothers until I stumbled upon The Dutch House. This is healing. It’s the little things no one notices when it comes to taking care of younger siblings, like helping them out with their homework, or those simple moments that arise to remind them of how good they are so those values are instilled from a young age.“You only think you want to get rid of your sister,” Jocelyn said, clapping her hand on my shoulder in a firm manner so as not to embarrass me. “Then when she’s gone it turns out you miss her.”I wonder if this feeling has a name. It evokes the most acute emotion.Not only does this book represent the part of an older sister fully committed to her younger sibling, it's the loss of a childhood home that cannot go unnoticed. It reverberates throughout your life. The hurt these next passages encompass cannot be overstated:“The idiocy of what we took and what we left cannot be overstated. We packed up clothes and shoes I would outgrow in six months, and left behind the blanket at the foot of my bed my mother had pieced together out of her dresses.”“and there were some other things—yearbooks, a couple boxes of novels she’d already read, some dolls she was saving for the daughter she was sure she would have one day, all in the attic under the eaves and behind the tiny door in the back of the third-floor bedroom closet. Did Andrea even know about that space? Maeve had shown it to the girls the night of the house tour, but would they remember or ever think to look in there again? Or would those boxes just belong to the house now, sealed into the wall like a time capsule from her youth?”You'll forever think about the things you didn't think to take. “I always imagined the house would die without us. I don’t know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?” The longwinded realization that at the end of the day a house is just that, a house, came to me after years and years. The house stays the same for the most part. You’re the one who changes through the years.What a powerful story. Like I said earlier, The Dutch House reminds me distinctly of The Great Alone. It's that sense of togetherness and loyalty you feel as the reader to these book characters. Maeve was the star of this book for me. The quiet star that shines the brightest but is set aside too often. She never got quite what she deserved. She worked the hardest of them all and was never fully redeemed, especially with a character like Celeste to remind her of that. And who is Celeste to say those things? Her name says all you need to know about her character.Celeste wasn’t listening. Where Maeve was concerned she didn’t listen. “At what point do you say to her, Okay, it was an awful childhood, it’s a terrible thing to be rich and then not be rich, but now everybody has to grow up?”People like her are why people like Andrea exist.Celeste never fully understands the sacrifice Maeve had to make to ensure Danny’s well being. Celeste never thinks about why Maeve took on that job she thinks is beneath her (to stay closer to Danny) or why she lives where she does (to stay closer to Danny). Maeve served everyone but herself, and it upsets me to think someone so privileged - so entitled to their privilege they aren't even aware of it- has the audacity to judge Maeve. It reminded me of this brilliant line in the poem, ""To this day"": When a kid who could still go home to mom and dadHad the audacity to tell him “get over it”Though my hatred wasn't Andrea-level, it felt pretty close. This passage hits it right on:“Those are my two choices? I love her or I hate her?”“Well,” my sister said, “you’re telling me you didn’t hate her, so I just want to know what the parameters are. I think it’s a ridiculous conversation to be having in the first place, if you want my opinion. Say there’s a kid who lives next door, a kid you have no particular friendship with but no problems with either. Then one day he walks into your house and kills your sister with a baseball bat.”“Maeve, for the love of God.”She held up her hand. “Hear me out. Does that present fact obliterate the past? Maybe not if you loved the kid. Maybe if you loved the kid you’d dig in and try to find out what had happened, see things from his perspective, wonder what his parents had done to him, wonder if there wasn’t some chemical imbalance. You might even consider that your sister could have played a role in the outcome—did she torment this boy? Was she cruel to him? But you’d only wonder about that if you loved him. If you only liked the kid, if he was never anything more to you than an okay neighbor, I don’t see the point in scratching around for good memories. He’s gone to prison. You’re never going to see the son-of-a-bitch again.”I love her.If anything, Danny’s lackluster relationship and medical education were worth for this one scene:“Do my spine,” she said.She hadn’t taken her shower yet and she still smelled like the ocean, like the wind coming over Brighton Beach. I reached my fingers beneath her hair and felt the base of her skull. “Atlas, axis, first cervical vertebra.” I pressed each one like a piano key, touch and then release, counting all seven. “Thoracic. You’ve got to do a better job with the sunscreen.”“Hush. Don’t ruin it.”“Thoracic.” I counted out the twelve, and then I got to the lumbar. I rubbed deep circles in her lower back until she made soft, cowlike sounds.”I'm so attached to Maeve that seeing her receive the bare minimum was beyond painful to read. Give her a break! Not only did Maeve have to deal with someone like Andrea in her youth, on top of taking care of her younger sibling, she now receives someone like Celeste in her adulthood to battle with. Needless to say she did not receive the ending I thought she deserved. This book is depressing, too much like reality. I'm already hurt in real life. Give me at least some semblance of a happy ending for characters that deserve it the most in books. This, too, reminds me of my experience with The Great Alone.Join me and read the opening chapter for yourself. You’ll be hooked.

Can hardly think of the last time a historical fiction including so many mundanities of everyday life entranced me so fully. And this isn't a story I've read before. In one sense it carves out a place in the annals of true Americana, exploring the dichotomy of greed and abnegation across generations. In another it's a sweet, small family drama exploring the bond between two siblings. Patchett paints characters that are as full and recognizable as the inimitable Anne Tyler's, if not necessarily as charming, for better or worse. I have a very short list of must-read-every-new-book authors, and after my first Patchett, she has tentatively made the list.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

Many parts of it lived up to my expectations, but there were too many pages that seemed to drag along without advancing either the story line or the character development. I also found it difficult to stay emotionally involved with characters whose decisions keep making their situation worse for themselves with no good reason or perceived benefit. Finally, the ending seemed tacked on rather than flowing from the story. The writing, as always with Ann Patchett, was often beautiful and occasionally stunning."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,Rating 2 out of 5,"I always look forward to a new Ann Patchett novel, having enjoyed all the ones I've read so far. I listened to this one on audio, narrated wonderfully by Tom Hanks. While listening and enjoying the narration I kept wondering where this story was going. I also had questions about choices made and agreed upon by the main characters and about the stereotypical evil step mother, but knew that I was in the hands of a great storyteller and trusted that Patchett was just taking her time setting up the story for a terrific denouement . But by Part 3, which took up the last 2/3rds of the novel, I saw that I was mistaken. This part didn't explain what I needed explained (can't say more without spoilers) which was really frustrating, and took the story in a direction that I couldn't buy. It just didn't make any emotional or psychological sense and was very underwhelming as an ending. In fact, I was taken by surprise when the book ended. I was still looking for something more, something deeper, more meaningful. I kept feeling ""What? That's it? "" There had to be a more satisfying conclusion to everything that happened in the first 2/3rds of the novel. But there wasn't. I felt the need of a book group to discuss this novel and to vent my frustrations. While listening to the book I thought that this was going to be a 3 star read for me (or 4 stars if Patchett pulled the story together in a satisfying way). Given the ending, it was a 2 star read with 1 star added for the Tom Hanks narration. I see from most of the current GR reviews that I'm in the minority on this one. That makes me pause to wonder why I had such a different experience. Again, I feel the need for that book group.On a different note, I greatly enjoyed the several references to the Hungarian Pastry Shop near Columbia University in NYC. I went there often when I was a student and worked and lived in that area. That brought back memories."

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that I might find it harder to connect with a new story in audio form. Luckily it only took me a few chapters to adjust, aided by my returning the reading speed to normal, as Tom Hanks reads much faster than Stephen Fry.I loved listening to this and got completely caught up in it. I found the characters fixation on The Dutch House more relatable than I had expected. Maeve was a wonderful, occasionally frustrating character. Her brother was less dynamic and I'm actually not sure I would have liked him that much but his love for his sister, his appreciation of her and his dedication to her did endear him to me.I found the situation of them losing their father and being banished from the house by their stepmother understandably difficult, and sympathised to a point with Maeve's desire to bleed the education trust dry. It was amusing at times and part of me got the point, but it also felt so self-indulgent, petty, wasteful. They were put in a tough spot, her more than him, but why not use that free education to build toward something rather than just prove a point? If they were real people I would have little time for them I think, but as characters they were fascinating.I might like to read this one again one day as there was something quite beautiful about it. It was a gripping story, and I enjoyed it, even when I was feeling deeply frustrated with the two siblings and the decisions they made.I love the cover, its what made me want to read the book. I don't always appreciate a fictional book having such a specific image of the main character as I prefer to imagine them for myself, but this one is so perfect that I don't mind. It's another reason why I want a physical copy, so I can see the image in full, and take it off the shelf to look at whenever I want to."

It felt dark and depressing through most of the book and described such a sad family life for two children to live through, I felt like I had a dark cloud over my head every time I sat down to read it.With so many readers touting how great it was, I felt a bit bewildered as to why I didn't feel the love here...!? What was I missing? I did like the way the book ended and was glad for that but to have to travel the entire book to get to this one favorable destination I liked? Hmmm...? I'm told the Audiobook is much better so I plan to listen to that version sometime in my next lifetime. Perhaps Tom Hank's voice will have an influence on my rating.

69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79324789-nzlisam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Haunting, innovative and poignant, The Dutch House demonstrates compassion and understanding.Sister and brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy grew up in The Dutch House.Their mother left when they were small, sneaking away from The Dutch House in the middle of the night.A few years later, their father brings Andrea (their future stepmother), along with her two young daughters to live in The Dutch House.When their father dies, their evil stepmother banishes them from The Dutch House, to fend for themselves, alone and penniless. But, no matter how far they travel, or how many years pass, Maeve and Danny just can’t let go of The Dutch House.An epic generational saga of family dysfunction, neglect, abandonment, stolen inheritance, and a troubled relationship between siblings. Maeve and Danny’s impenetrable unbreakable bond was warm, supportive, and loving in some respects, and I was sympathetic to their plight. However, it was also unhealthy and destructive, capable of sabotaging and undermining any other relationship they had, or formed, and tended to be controlling, co-dependent, and demanding. Furthermore, their inability to come to terms with their past invaded every facet of their lives and affected every decision. The story was influenced by both fairy tale and folklore. There were references or similarities to Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, and the Nutcracker ballet, among others. The Dutch House – named after the nationality of its original owner’s the VanHoebeeks (whose portraits were on prominent display above the fireplace) – was a character in itself and took on a eerie, ever-present life of its own. The three-storey mansion, built in the 1920’s, was grand, imposing, sprawling, and contained a cellar, attic, multiple bedrooms, and even a ballroom, and let’s face it, you can’t get more fairy tale than that? Danny always referred to it by its title, never just house or home.Our sole POV was a middle-aged Danny (first person) reflecting back on his childhood and early adult years and how they shaped the man he became in his late forties/early fifties. The story opened in 1956 when Danny was eight (Maeve fifteen) with the arrival of Andrea into their lives, stepping across the threshold of The Dutch House for the first time. Events encompass the next fifty years, somewhat chronologically, but also contained flashbacks and flash forwards smack bang in the middle of any given chapter. Meaning, there were one or two occasions where I had to remind myself what stage of life Danny was narrating from. But, Ann Patchett, did include little reminders which got me back on track, so all good. The book art, the painting of 12-year-old Maeve in her Red Riding Hood coat is probably my favourite cover of all time. I just can’t stop staring at it! Mesmerising!The Dutch House was a sensational novel that entertained, informed and amused. Deserves pride of place on your bookshelf."

I missed a few of hers pre-Bel Canto and while I haven't yet gotten to them, it comforts me to know that they're waiting for me for when life slows down (I've heard that happens; one day you wake up and you're older and retired and you can read all the time). When I heard The Dutch House was coming out and saw its distinctive cover (Who IS that girl? I wondered) I put it on my TBDWIR (To Be Devoured When It Releases) list pronto.And then it released and people were talking about it, and it was popping up on bestsellers lists all over the place and audio book lovers were swooning over this tale being read to them by the venerable Tom Hanks. I hurried through the other required reading I was working on, and made space in my life to enjoy The Dutch House. I had already bought it, it was just there on my cluttered nightstand awaiting me.I hadn't read much about the novel, which is my usual thing. I don't read the back copy of books I know I am going to want to read. Sometimes there are mini spoilers there. So I didn't know what The Dutch House was or who lived in it or what it meant to them. I didn't know what the evocative painting on the front meant and I certainly couldn't know how I would be affected when Patchett revealed the significance of that painting, and this at a time in the story when I had already fallen in love with these perfectly drawn characters. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to get back to, not because I just had to know what happened next, but because I just had to know what happened to these characters next.  Here is just one of the beautifully composed thoughts penned in its pages.“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”I was going to use the back cover copy to tell you what the book is about but I'm not going to. I will just say it's a book about a brother and sister, and their childhood home, and everything that the word ""home"" might and should conjure up in your mind when you hear that word spoken.  I loved it so much I am going to use one of my Audible credits and have Tom Hanks read it to me. I hardly ever read books twice because, you know, so many books, so little time. So you know it's a good one when I tell you I'll be ""reading"" this one again. Soon.Highly recommend."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the story of a family, and a very distinguished house, and the ways in which that combination played on everyone’s lives and relationships. It is also a story of the ways in which a person’s life can be altered, hemmed in, defined, expanded, most definitely changed, for good or ill, by significant others and even a place. Also a story of fighting, or not fighting, those influences to live one’s own life.And a wonderful story it is. Ann Patchett is an excellent writer, able to capture her characters and settings so well. Some we learn about quickly; others develop or evolve more slowly. The Dutch House is itself a character in this novel as its presence is a factor in much of the major activity throughout. It is an old mansion purchased by Mr Conroy as surprise for his wife who had no idea he had somehow become rich.In the beginning, there were Maeve and Danny Conroy, children of Cyril and Elna Conroy. Elna has been gone from their lives since Danny was a toddler, leaving him with no memory of her. Maeve, being older, has fond, loving memories. Family rumor is Elna apparently left for India years before. Father seems a somewhat standoff type man, showing occasional moments of warm emotion. True warmth comes from support staff needed to care for the house and children, Sandy and Jocelyn, who provide motherly care. Danny narrates the novel.Beyond that well...then it is how life develops. I do not want to walk you through the ups and downs and sometimes odd decisions made during the years as Danny and Maeve mature and make life choices. That’s for you to read. And I do recommend you read this book. It’s a primer on the directions and misdirections life can take as people try to deal with the remnants of their childhood. It’s also a very vivid portrayal of the relationship of a brother and sister from the teen years into adulthood, as their lives change.4.5* - 5* A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

It's familial. The best way I can express it is to say that if The Dutch House and my first novel (Plan Z by Leslie Kove) and my mother's first novel (The Trouble with the Truth) were sisters, The Dutch House would be our middle sibling. This book makes me miss my long-dead mother because I feel as if she should know about it. And I should be able to talk with her about the fact that I read it just after learning that the new new-owners demolished the house my mother built, which always seemed to me like a live being with roots deep in my psyche, even long after we gave it up in 1968. Even though I and my siblings had terrible memories of our life there, during the 48 years that the people we sold it to lived there, we each individually made pilgrimages to visit or just look at the house. And it just seems unfair that now my mother and I cannot mourn the demise of her creation while reading and admiring The Dutch House—while as writers, we marvel at everything from the gorgeous cover art by painter Noah Saterstrom (what a daring artist) to the story about a family and a house, which is so reminiscent yet completely different from both of our work that I have a very hard time believing we are not all related. I wish we were. "
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-cantrell,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is the man! And of course, I mean that in more ways than this flippant complimentary term carries. That Tom Hanks, of all people, was the one to narrate this audiobook might just be a testament to how great it is.My first confession, though, is that she is probably my favorite writer ever. I own and have read every novel she's penned, not because of the high drama (although there is always some of that) or the quirky family situations (a ubiquitous inclusion) and the thread of lies (again, a constant) in all of them. Patchett has a quiet grace and slicing analysis that are rarely found in the writings of one author. She has never failed to surprise me, so each time one of her novels comes up for sale, I join the purchase queue in total faith.With that mea culpa out of the way, Patchett is one of the few writers I've read who speaks believably from the point of view of a protagonist who is of the opposite gender. The author and poet Ron Rash can pull this off well. The ""grit lit"" writer Daniel Woodrell and the unique Donna Tartt are also masters. But for this reader. those folks form a small, extremely talented club. They make gender almost seem immaterial - we see the person inside - but at the same time, the little clichés about men not being overly verbal about their emotions and that women are vociferously protective of family are still there. So, yeah. Patchett - in this case - is the man, fully and entirely.You've read the blurb, probably, and know that the story revolves around a pair of adult siblings with a dysfunctional childhood. Their longest stretch of stability was spent with their parents in an enormous and gorgeous old home, and over later decades, the two occasionally park across the street from the grounds and think about the days that were and the people that were.I don't want to spill any more than that because Patchett's stories are best left with little surprises for the reader. For those who are already fans of her work, you'll again bump into the idea that some people are considered to be ""saints"" even though one of the characters nails them as garden variety narcissists. You will find people that love one another like family but who have no biological ties. There is forgiveness in here. And long held grudges. Laughter and love and pain.Lastly, if you've ever had a parent abandon you in some way or share a devoted relationship with a brother or sister, this is going to resonate. Patchett grew up in a blended family, so her wisdom and insights have been a lifetime in formation. And every time her novels close, it feels like they do so with a benediction for us all.Five stars. Favorites shelf."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Anne Patchett is a fabulous book.The story is told through the eyes of Danny Conroy. He takes us on an incredible journey involving his parents, his sister, various housekeepers, step-mother, step-sisters, children and many, many others. The story starts not long after the end of WW2, and revolves around an old mansion, previously built and owned by the VanHoebeek family.There’s no need to tell you much about the story other than it’s a complex, layered and believable family saga covering 3 generations. This is my first book by this author (yes, where have I been?) and she just doesn’t miss a beat. Patchett paints such a rich picture, using just the right amount of words, placed exactly where they should be - I felt I was actually there. Even her descriptions of personal features, expressions and body posture, movement – were so accurate I felt like they were better than actually seeing the people myself. This one had me hooked from the beginning, and I was so sad it finished. In fact, I finished it only 30 minutes ago and feel quite emotional about the whole bloody thing. Why did it have to stop now? How can a book just jump into our life, take us on an incredible journey and then leave us, just like that? This was one of those books. I can compare it to my feelings of attachment to the Joad Family in Grapes of Wrath, I still wonder what they’re up to. I cared that much about them. Well it is the same here.Such precise passages like:“We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it is the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”For those of us who spend much of our time looking over our shoulder, this is really a passage to make us stop and think. Yes, memories, regrets, the past, feature heavily in this book.Also this little gem:“Thinking about the past impeded my efforts to be decent in the present”How good is that?This book will make you gasp, laugh and cry. For anyone who has been a father, mother, brother, sister…..or let’s just say a ‘human’. There will be something in this book that will resonate with you. This was my first audiobook and Tom Hanks’ narration was first class. Sorry this is such a gushy review but it is what it is.5 Wonderful Stars"

In a twist on the evil stepmother story, we follow the lives of brother and sister Danny and Maeve through their life journeys as seen through Danny's eyes. Each character is fully-fleshed out and the writing is neither too ornate nor too flat. The story is interesting and not over-bearing. I really liked the flow of the text and the use of the Dutch House as a motif throughout the book. The book is written in a retrospective manner which also leads to some introspection as well:But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. (loc. 635)Reflections on being a son:He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of. I had never thought about him as a child. I had never asked him about the war. I had only seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.(loc. 1384)Reflections on life's long journey and out choices - a theme in this book regarding Danny's choices between what he wants and what is expected from him:There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself. (loc. 1702)I like this metaphor:We had stepped into the river that takes you forward. (loc. 2640)And this analogy:When she walked away, she turned back to look at me so many times she appeared to be going up the sidewalk in a loose series of concentric circles. (loc. 2793)Danny discovers his mother late in life, but is unsure how to tell Maeve about her:After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow become miraculously unstuck, moving forward in time just like everyone else. To tell Maeve our mother was out there, to tell her I wasn’t sure if our parents had ever divorced, meant reigniting the fire I’d spent my life stamping out. (loc. 2874)A nice reflection on bringing up kids in the city and getting them used to empty spaces of time:In the city of constant stimulation, we had failed to give them the opportunity to develop strong inner lives for those occasions when they would find themselves sitting through the second act of The Nutcracker. (loc 3372)A very typical dream of many fathers, myself included>When Maeve knocked on my door, she woke me from a dream in which I was trying to swim to Kevin. Every stroke I took towards him seemed to push him farther out, until I was struggling to see his head above the water’s chop. I kept calling for him to swim back but he was too far away to hear me. I sat straight up, gasping, trying to make sense of where I was. Then I remembered. I had never been so happy to be awake. (loc. 3473)When she does appear near the end of Maeve's life, Danny sees his mother initially as an agent of death:but she was there now, at Abington Memorial Hospital, like the Angel of Death. I said nothing to her because one should never initiate a conversation with Death.

78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah,Rating 1 out of 5,"I knew fairly early into this book that I was not the right reader for it. That I finished it has more to do with the format in which I consumed it (the audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks) than with any hope I had that it would get better. To be fair, there were parts in the middle that worked better for me - but overall, this is just not my type of book at all. It has been described as a modern fairy tale and that is true only in the worst sense: the story is neither magical nor lyrical but the characters are all as flat as the characters in Grimm's fairy tales - they are Patchett's puppet's moving the story along, not always in ways which made sense to me.To illustrate why I am not the right reader, here a few things I dislike in books, in no particular order: family sagas (check), historical fiction (check), evil step parents (check), flat characters (check), undeveloped female characters (check), incredibly detailed narration (check), people being treated unfairly (check), women hating women for no good reason (check), horrible parents (check and check). The structure could have worked for me as it jumps back and forth in time, which is something I often enjoy, but the storyline mostly just bored me. The rambling nature of the narrative worked best for me when there were the smallest emotional stakes: when Danny talks about his education or his real estate dabbling. Whenever the stakes were higher, I became increasingly frustrated. Part of that has to do with Danny being an omnipotent narrator while still being only in his own head, part has to do with how one-note these characters all were. For other people, this book has worked brilliantly (and I can kind of see why if I squint and look at this sideways), for me this was a frustrating slog following a character I found boring and self-involved.Content warning: Death of a loved one, heart attack, abandonement, Alzheimer's DiseaseYou can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog."

80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76203549-nika,Rating 2 out of 5,"Having just started this book, I expected to enjoy it but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.If the first chapter kept me somewhat interested, starting from the second chapter I felt disconnected from what was happening in the novel.The characters and plot left me completely indifferent. The main idea around which centers the plotline did not speak to me. At the core of the story is the Dutch House, a monumental and cold building. It can seem a forbidding place, but, despite its aloofness or perhaps due to it, the House holds a hardly explicable power over those who inhabit it. The Conroy family bought the house from the impoverished Dutch negociants. Now they expect to live happily in their new home but strange things start to happen... I would be happy to say that they did but in fact nothing special happens. This uneventfulness is typical of the novel.Mrs. Conroy - the mother of two children - develops a strange relationship with the house. It looms so large and terrifying in her imagination that she leaves her children and husband to move to India. We are to believe that Mrs. Conroy can no longer cope with the Dutch House. Well, in my opinion, this explanation does not look credible unless certain details are given.The woman's decision triggers a series of painful events. Soon, another woman appears on the scene and in the Dutch House. Maeve and Danny Conroy - the children of the Conroys - will be the most affected. Their relationship with the house is that of 'love-hate.'The house is probably a metaphor for the problematic past that could be so difficult to overcome.It may also be interpreted as a symbol of childhood traumas that pervade the present and impact the future. This explanation, however, applies to the sister and brother who have been raised in the Dutch House. I can understand this idea but it is difficult for me to connect with it. According to Ann Patchett, the house is ""just symbolic of the life."" Sounds fine but the narration did not convince me. For me, the Dutch House, formidable as it may look, is only a building made of bricks. There are things much more important than that, such as human relationships, compassion, or hobbies. However, the symbolic meaning of the house hardly explains the mother’s attitude and behavior. Why is she so negatively impressed with the building that she prefers to abandon her children without even saying goodbye to them?I am aware that a lot of people find this story engaging. My opinion of it probably belongs to a minority but I must admit, this was a boring and unemotional read for me. I am now trying to find something that I liked about it. The only thing that comes to my mind is that the story did not last too long. In addition, the cover of the book is exquisite."
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a story about three generations of a family whose relationships are closely connected to a house outside Philadelphia. Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer who made his money renovating old buildings, bought the Dutch House as a surprise for his wife. Cyril loved old buildings, probably more than people, and was proud of his acquisition. His wife, who felt that she had a mission to help poor people, never felt comfortable in a home that looked like a museum and had a ballroom on the third floor. Their children, Maeve and Danny, were left motherless for reasons we find out later in the book. Maeve takes on the role of protector of her little brother, and changes her whole life to care for him.Cyril later meets the manipulative Andrea who covets the Dutch House, and they are soon married. Andrea's interest lies with the house, and not with her stepchildren. The Dutch House is an important part of both the sense of loss and the strong bond shared by Danny and his sister.Narrated by Danny, the story tells about childhood trauma and family relationships. It goes forward and backward in time, slowly showing us the events that molded Danny and Maeve into the people they would become. The close relationships between the siblings was special, and they could always count on each other. Ann Patchett's writing is captivating and humorous. I expect The Dutch House to be an especially good story for book discussion groups. 4.5 stars."

Because I get a lot of her books as donations, and they go as quickly as they come. She is an interesting author, who in my mind, embodies compassion.How would I describe this tale? Paradise Lost dusted with a sprinkling of Cinderella, The Little Princess and perhaps a bit of Hansel and Gretel thrown in?Two bonded siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy have only each other after their mother leaves them when they are only 10 and 3. Their home is called the Dutch House, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia owned by their father, Cyril, bought fully furnished when Maeve was 5. His wife hated it, and flees to India to support the poor. Her family suffers by this loss, and are left with a father who only cares about his real estate. The lust of it. And then...Enter the wicked stepmother with 2 kids of her own. The story is told in first person from Danny's adult POV. Because Danny is by design a clueless tight-lipped character, as readers we aren't sure he really is the best one to be telling this story. His older sister may have been a more interesting character to have told the story. Or better yet, an unbiased narrator. The story focuses on unconventional families - motherless children, blended families and children left too much to their own devices. Does it work?Still...You can feel the themes of gratitude, compassion and forgiveness and a sentimentality throughout. A sense of warmheartedness, too. It's just hard to find sometimes."
83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy turns to real estate investment at the end of World War II and transforms his family’s circumstances from impoverishment to wealth. When he surprises them with a move to the Philadelphia suburbs and the purchase of a great mansion called The Dutch House, it also alters the course of everyone he cares about, and not in a good way. Their stories are told through his son Danny and spans several decades, providing a view of how their futures are shaped by the ensuing events. Tom Hanks narrates the audio version of the book and felt like the perfect choice for Danny Conroy. The character was fairly dispassionate, a creation of his upbringing as he was shielded from the wreckage of his parents’ marriage and history. He was too young to recall much of it and his sister Maeve protected him beyond adulthood. Hanks’ performance was outstanding in that regard as he personified Danny. But Maeve was the more complex character and we only see her through his eyes. But, that made her all the more enigmatic and tragic as her world seemed to evolve around his. This is a long saga without a lot of dramatic moments but does have significant, pivotal events that permanently define Danny and Maeve. They sometimes served them well but also stunted their ability to form deep relationships as adults. I enjoyed their journey and was captivated by the story. I didn’t always like Danny but understood him. But it is Maeve who got my admiration and empathy, someone I wanted to know more about but love that she’s left to my imagination. And, The Dutch House was always in the background. It’s an ideal story for book group discussions.Posted on Blue Mood Café"
84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,Rating 3 out of 5,"Elna Conroy sheds all her worldly possessions—leaving her husband behind and young children Danny and Maeve adrift in the tranquil suburbs of Elkins Park, Philadelphia—to dedicate her life to the impoverished in all corners of the world. It is circa 1950, and also left behind is the breathtaking three-story mansion that is the Dutch House, replete with a ballroom, marble floors, gilded ceilings, vast windows, and the arresting portraits of the previous VanHoebeek residents. Ann Patchett has masterfully injected life into the relics of the Gilded Age New England mansions, children and nannies and cooks flitting through these lavish halls in a fairy-tale narration by Danny. Reflecting most on his youth and the aftermath in decades later, this story relives a past populated by Mr. Conroy, remiss to warm his children with nurture and compassion, and the clear villain, Cinderella’s stepmother come to life in the form of his second wife Andrea, a package deal with two daughters not much younger than Danny and Maeve. The Dutch House is concerned of course with the repercussions when Danny and Maeve are unceremoniously ousted from their childhood home after Mr. Conroy passes away, straight back into the poverty their father had escaped from. A window into this progression of events invokes the kind of pulsing anger that eats at your chest, as you must also swallow the bitter pills of snubs and cold silence and inaction that children never should. It is the kind of change in a childhood that leaves little gray area to debate, distinctly horrible yet unstoppable nevertheless. And so, these myriad traps are primed in the past even as the Dutch House becomes a distant memory and Danny and Maeve both forge successful paths into adulthood. So inevitably they return, no longer welcome in the House but parked in a Volkswagen, the Oldsmobile, the Volvos, inhaling cigarette smoke with nostalgic memories and a past-present mirage about the unanswered questions of their childhood. 
There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.
I would never trade away Patchett’s magnificently executed quippy dialogue, dark humor, and effortless descriptions, but I needed this to be matched by equal development of the characters. I was desperate to crack open their skulls, to carefully examine their true thoughts and motivations. A reticent father and an absent mother are aspects I could come to accept of a childhood fraught with maddening experiences, but dangling all this potential only to have such a reticent protagonist in Danny just felt unfair. What did come through was Danny’s self-absorption and, frankly, petulant monologue. He is a rich boy muddled into unfair circumstances, soaking up a rainshower of tragedies but resistant to the responsibility of taking off the coat. He is at least self-aware enough to admit his faults, though does next to nothing to address them, so I couldn’t even blame him for ignorance. From childhood to adulthood, he is a boy in a world that demands he grow up too soon—except he doesn’t really grow up. At each step of the way, his older sister Maeve has provided a steady and unconditional love that his parents never did. Danny’s unfettered adulation of his sister filters through his narrative lens, and I couldn’t help but champion her brilliance, humor, and pragmatism. His regrets, then, also shine through, as he acknowledges an imperfect understanding of her innermost desires despite their closeness. Always from his perspective, I never could see her as much more than a sacrificial lamb. Wholly dedicated to caring for him, just as later his wife is characterized. There are so many passive moments and no real heroes throughout this family saga in The Dutch House, and if I must come to terms with how people reconcile the past and choose whether to forgive amid the more eyebrow-raising plot points of this fairy tale, I at the very least can’t afford to miss a deep connection to the central characters."

Warning lovers of this book - I'm about to get unapologetically vicious. Remember, this is all my opinion, even if I structure sentences so that they read as factual. I would never have read this book were it not my next book club read. I should have known from the blurb that there would be nothing good about this book. It consisted of merely seven lines of text in what I can only assume is size 20 font. I haven't seen such a blurb since I was five and read picture books. What a vapid and empty book. I'm baffled by the popularity of it. It was as insightful and enlightening as watching reality television for five hours. There's no purpose (let alone poetry) behind anything that happens in this book. The characters are as basic as those in a creative writing class for eight-year-olds, as is the novel's drive. The Dutch house is special. Why it's special, we don't know. Their mother hated it so much that she abandoned her family to leave it. What was so horrible about it, we don't know. People hate other people. Why they hate other people, we don't know. We're supposed to care about the main characters. Why we should care about the main characters, we don't know. Everyone wants to be part of this damn house. Why they want to be, we don't know.There's nothing emotionally tangible about this book. There's no atmosphere, no connection, voices or emotion. People marry just for the sake of having a marriage and baby as part of the plot - why they married who they married, we don't know. We don't get to know anyone. Their voices are entirely uniform, and there are no identifying markers, real backstory or essence or soul. Why does everyone either love or hate this house? Why should I care? Everything was just so primitive. It was like Pratchett just knew the fundamentals of writing that everyone is taught at school and wrote them out in the most vacuous way. People get sad when there's a death, so let's have some death. People like marriage and babies, so let's have some of that too. People like everything to end up happily ever after even if it's not realistic, so let's make that happen. There was so little artistic prowess in this novel that I wouldn't have been surprised if she ended the book with ""and Danny woke up, and it was all a dream'. It was THAT level of sophistication. "

Just him reading the chapter headings was thrilling, and he gave so much MORE! My biggest regret is getting SO into the story that I mostly stopped realized that Tom Hanks was reading to me. Bravo Ann Patchett and Tom Hanks. This is a story about a house that several families have lived in and the lives that have been touched by residing in this house at one time or another. It is about the coming of age and the adult life of a boy named Danny. Danny's life is inexorably influenced entirely by the Dutch House, with memories both good and bad and the reverberations of many things set into motion by both love and hatred of the house. This one was quite enjoyable, a solid 4 stars. I really liked it. And I REALLY hated Andrea."
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Danny Conroy and his older sister, Maeve, sit in Maeve's car across the street from their childhood home, watching, waiting, reviving the ghosts of their memories. They catch an occasional glimpse of their stepmother, Andrea, who turned them out of the house soon after their father died, when Danny was in high school and Maeve was in college, but they leave her be. There are deeper wounds than an evil stepmother to contend with, and even though the mansion they spy upon has enormous windows that provide views from front to back, the source of their pain — and their healing — is not visible. The Dutch House, so named for its Depression-era builders, the VanHoebeeks from the Netherlands, is a bizarrely baroque edifice, purchased in secret by Danny and Maeve's father, Cyril, in 1946. Maeve was five and Danny would be born two years later. Cyril Conroy had been quietly amassing a small fortune by speculating in New York City real estate, and came upon this mansion in the countryside near Philadelphia, falling for its in-your-face declaration of wealth. Cyril presents it to his wife, Elna, who recoils at its opulence and the servants Cyril has hired to help manage the estate. Elna, so disturbed by a life that feels imposed on her by Cyril's grasping ambitions, eventually abandons her two young children and vanishes, supposedly settling in India to minister to the poor. A few years later, Cyril marries Andrea, eighteen years his junior, barely older than Maeve herself. Andrea has two little girls of her own and quickly takes charge of The Dutch House, her resentment of Cyril's first family building to a near-unforgivable vindictiveness that results in Maeve and Danny's expulsion. The Dutch House is grounded in Danny's first-person perspective as he gently unknots forty years of familial entanglements. In contrast to Danny's matter-of-fact memories is a shimmering fairy tale nostalgia of gingerbread houses, a wicked stepmother, the Hansel and Gretel bond between brother and sister, a long-lost mother, even the Rapunzel-like quality of Maeve's long, dark hair. Some Ann Patchett novels have taken my breath away (Bel Canto), others have left me less moved. The Dutch House succeeds for me because of the strength of its characters, who are allowed to grow and reach, creating a story in their wake. Tales of fortunes won and lost over decades, a panorama of post-war American culture, unhappy families, the ebbs and flows of marriage — these are all familiar themes that become fresh and urgent by the strength of Patchett's Danny and Maeve and their voices. Told with reflective compassion, gentle irony, and vivid nostalgia for an America long-gone, The Dutch House is a deeply satisfying family drama."

The business-savvy Cyril Conroy buys the house and everything in it to surprise his wife, Elma and their young children, Maeve and Danny. Overwhelmed by the huge change from living frugally in a very small house to living in a grand old house, with a cook, a cleaner and a nanny, the young mother eventually abandons her family.Written from Danny's point of view, this is a novel about family, abandonment and its effects, hanging on the past and not letting go. Danny's sister, Maeve, seven years his senior, becomes his mentor and protector, while the two sisters working as cook and cleaner, respectively, take on the caring roles.When things get worse for the two siblings, their relationship is what gives them strength, their intelligence and ambition what propels them further to outward success.The Dutch House features prominently throughout the novel. Detested, loved, admired, longed for, the house pulls at the hearts and memories of those who lived in it.Spanning over five decades, at times, the story sags as it becomes quite mundane. But it's very readable; the details, the little scenes and recollections make it very lifelike. You know how it is, you're a teen, then you study, begin your grown-up life and then, bam! you wonder what happened to time, when did you get to be forty, fifty etc. The last quarter picks up the pace, quite a lot happens.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, the characterisations were excellent, the descriptions, of the house in particular, were quite vivid. The siblings' relationship was incredibly tight and unique.This was different, in a good way. Highly recommended. I've received this novel via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review."
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the latest novel by one of my favorite authors Ann Patchett. This character driven family saga centers around the powerful relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy as well as their strong connection, and almost pathological ties, to The Dutch House. This beautiful mansion was built by the VanHoebeeks in the suburbs of Philadelphia in 1922 making their fortune in cigarettes; their life-sized portrait so much a part of the Conroy family in many ways. I must interject that the cover of the book that is a portrait of Maeve is priceless. There is a message here. Their father, Cyril Conroy, a real estate mogul able to capitalize on a lot of real estate deals in New York City enabling him to purchase this iconic house where Danny and Maeve spent their childhood. Without any spoilers, what transpires over the years is the exploration of the bonds between Maeve and Danny as they grow into adulthood and how The Dutch House impacts their lives over a lifetime. Told in the point of view of Danny over the years, it is subject to memory and is very non-linear in its unfolding as we jump to different periods in their life. All in all, it is a very heartwarming book that I enjoyed.""The stunning success of the house could be attributed to the architect. . .""""It could be that one or both of those dour VanHoebeeks had been sort of aesthetic visionary, or that the property inspired a marvel beyond what any of them had imagined, or that America after the First World War was teeming with craftsmen who worked to standards long since abandoned.

The 1920’s mansion comes complete with staff, life-size portraits of the original Dutch owners, a third floor ballroom, and a perfect window seat. Elna, who grew up poor, hates the extravagance of the house. She runs away to serve the poor, abandoning her 10-year-old daughter, Maeve, and three-year-old son, Danny, to the hands of their rigid and cold father.Five years later, Maeve and Danny are called downstairs to meet Conroy’s soon-to-be second wife, Andrea. The second Mrs. Conroy adores the house and all the money that goes along with it. When Cyril dies, she keeps the house and the money and dispossesses Maeve and Danny of any inheritance except for funds for Danny’s education. Danny and Maeve creatively use the education trust fund to send Danny to Choate, Columbia, and medical school, despite the simple fact he has absolutely no desire to become a doctor. REVIEWTHE DUTCH HOUSE is a perfect blend of characters, setting and story. It’s undoubtably my favorite book of the year. ANN PATCHETT has long been my favorite author, and this book is one of her best. It’s masterfully written to capture the poignant relationship and unbreakable bonds between Danny and Maeve. A grown Danny narrates the story casting his sister as his unwavering friend and protector.I didn’t want the book to end, and deliberately savored it a little slower that usual. The Dutch house vividly comes to life on the pages. We can see all the way from the driveway through the house to the conservatory, and we can see the little blue kitchen table where Danny frequently had his meals and did his homework and it is so easy to picture the large portrait hanging on the wall of the drawing room of a bright-eyed Maeve in her red coat, with her long thick black hair laying over her shoulders.The story thoughtfully explores abandonment, inheritance, obsession, family relationships, love and forgiveness. PATCHETT is a lyrical storyteller and her characters development is first rate. My favorite part of the novel is the shared moments between Danny and Maeve, sitting in Maeve’s car in front of the Dutch House long after they had been expelled from the only home they had known. THE DUTCH HOUSE is a beautiful and strong testament to sibling bonds. Thanks to Edelweiss, Harper Collins and Ann Patchett for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Despite the fact that Patchett is an author I’ve wanted to read for a long time -- I’ve had most of her previous works on my TBR for quite some time and even own physical copies of several of her books -- I unfortunately have not had the opportunity to actually crack open any of them. Of course, all that changed last week when I saw that the next book on my seemingly never-ending ARC list would be Patchett’s newly released eighth novel 
The Dutch House
 (published in September 2019) – I was thrilled that I would finally be able to experience one of her works for myself, though at the same time, that also meant I would be going into this one with relatively high expectations. Luckily, this one ended up being a wonderful read, even better than I expected, which honestly doesn’t happen often.The story is narrated entirely from the perspective of Danny Conroy, who is only a boy of 8 years old when the story opens. His sister Maeve, herself only a teenager at 15 years old, took Danny under her care after their mother Elna left them 5 years ago. Both children live in the Dutch House, a see-through glass mansion of sorts that their father Cyril, a real estate developer, had bought as a surprise gift for their mother. Cyril is a distant father who is always consumed with his work and aside from providing his children with the necessities — a cook to prepare food for them to eat, a housekeeper to tend to the household duties, a nanny to tend to their day-to-day needs — he could never be bothered with much else beyond that. But Maeve and Danny had each other to lean on and along with the love of their housekeeper and cook (sisters Sandy and Jocelyn who had been hired by their mother back in the day), they were relatively happy and content with their lives. All that changes however when Cyril decides to marry a young woman named Andrea, who moves into the Dutch House with her 2 daughters in tow — the profound impact that this decision ends up having on Danny’s and Maeve’s futures becomes the basis upon which the entire story revolves.This story is billed as a family saga spanning 5 decades, which initially made me think that it would be so epic in scope that it would take a longer time to read, but in actuality, I devoured this one, not wanting to put it down once I started. Patchett is a masterful storyteller and her writing here absolutely captivates — I was hooked from the very first page, not just to the story but also to the characters. It’s extremely rare for me to already like and connect with a story’s characters within the first few chapters, but that’s exactly what happened with Danny and Maeve — two characters I loved from the beginning and who continued to grow more endearing as the story progressed. While all of Patchett’s characters in here were nuanced and well-developed (even most of the minor characters), what made me gravitate to Danny and Maeve the most was the unshakable bond that these two siblings shared throughout their lives – a bond that continued to exist despite everything that happens, no matter how many times their relationship is put to the test. Needless to say, I was genuinely moved by their relationship. Speaking of characters, of course the Dutch House itself also existed as a “character” central to the story, however the beauty here is that, even though its presence was continually felt throughout the story, it never once overtook the other characters. Despite the house’s significance to the plot, it was quite clear from beginning to end that the story itself belonged to Maeve and Danny. In this regard, the house serves as a connection to their past and while this past is what shapes who they eventually grow up to become as adults, it is also how they deal with this past that forms the crux of their story. Here, again, the brilliance of Patchett’s writing comes into play, as the transitions between past and present throughout the book were seamless – no easy feat given the extensive timeline that the story covered plus the fact that the plot jumped around from one situation to the next in no particular order.Up until the last few chapters, this actually had all the makings of a 5-star read for me – the reason I eventually decided on 4.5 stars was mainly because I wasn’t fond of the ending and also didn’t like how a few plot points played out in the lasts few chapters. Though I must admit that I also had some issues with the character of Elna Conroy (Danny and Maeve’s mother) – things that made her character come across too unrealistic for me and made it difficult for me to wholeheartedly accept some of the situations that happen because of it. This small complaint aside, I still consider this book a masterpiece – not quite perfect, but a masterpiece nonetheless. While I eagerly wait to see what Patchett has in store for us next, there’s no doubt that I will be exploring her backlist of previous works very, very soon!Received ARC from Harper via Edelweiss. "
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121021140-ushashi,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a family drama. It's not high on the plot. It's a study of characters and exploration of relationships. It's a dysfunctional family, neither the characters are perfect, nor are their relations. And yet there is something charming and relatable about them. The main focus here is on the relation between the narrator Danny and his elder sister Maeve. I often felt that a modern brother-sister relation is not that well represented in literature, and this was just delightful. The Dutch House is also fairy tale-esque, with a palatial mansion, evil stepmother, orphaned children. This is story-telling at its best. Tom Hanks' narration was just perfect. If you are into audiobooks or like Mr. Hanks (who doesn't!), consider listening to this."

Such an important word, one that conjures both memories, dreams, and nightmares. So many phrases have used this word: A home is where the heart is, A house is not a home, A woman's place is in the home (Elna and I do not agree with this one),You can never go home, A home is a man's castle, and so many more. Most, however, do not become obsessed by a past home. For many reasons Mauve and Danny do, and this obsession continues with Danny's daughter May. I think Mauve and Celeste's reciting of Philip Larkin's poem Home Is So Sad is very significant and paramount to this obsession.There are so many important elements in this book that have been beautifully detailed by other reviewers. Love between siblings in this book and siblings throughout history, loss. forgiveness, hope, and following your dreams, or not, among others. I think timing, both good timing and not so good is also an important element. Elna enters their life again by chance timing. Danny after finishing medical school says, ""I'll have to go out and find a job and that won't be the right time. I can say that for the rest of my life, can't I? This isn't the right time."" Danny meets Celeste due to a missed train. He works hard to finish his medical training, not because he enjoys it but because he doesn't want to get drafted. He believes Celeste was ""the ultimate victim of bad timing, thinking that because she was good at chemistry she should marry a doctor instead of becoming one herself."" But was that really what Celeste wanted? Did Mauve really want to further her education? Danny is just like Celeste and Mauve. They all thought they knew what was best for someone else. A doctor was not Danny's dream profession. He followed his dream of buying and fixing buildings. He was successful at this but he could not fix the past.Anne Patchett has long been a favorite author of mine This book is yet another example of her fine writing style. Her characters are so real with their strengths and flaws rawly exposed. No matter how dire or solemn a situation is that Patchett describes there is a grain, a dash, of humor, enough to bring a smile to the reader's face.This is an October bookclub selection and I am anxiously anticipating our discussion of this enjoyable, complex book.

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to stand on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”When I read this sentence in The Dutch House by Ann Patchett, my adoration for her writing was again reinforced, and I almost needed to read no further. Her ability as a wordsmith at times is so poetic, cuttingly painful and spare in its description of the most traumatic moments caught in ordinary time, in ordinary lives... But of course I continued to read, to discover more of Patchett’s wondrous offerings. Danny and Maeve suffer through interminable losses, which begin at an early point during their lifetimes and The Dutch House figures prominently throughout as a figurehead of that loss. “The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn’t even understand what she was saying. ... I could feel the entire house sitting on top of me like a shell I would have to drag around for the rest of my life.”The delicacy of this novel’s writing is found in how these siblings nurture each other, try to find a sense of home in each other while the world outside of them with more “normal” upbringings and trappings live somewhat on their outskirts and truly cannot fathom the need for their bond. Patchett manages in her books to describe relationships which are on the outskirts, wrought by trauma and the people who try to survive them as well as possible - and describe how beauty might be wrought from the ruin nevertheless. The Dutch House is a gorgeous example of Patchett at her best. The ending is hopeful and a trifle more fairytale than truth. The Dutch House, though, is fictitious too, so who am I to split hairs with this otherwise heart healing fable? An exquisite tapestry of imagery, characters whom I came to love dearly and a sigh of contentment at closing the final page. It doesn’t get much better than this. Five gracious stars. "

It was very enjoyable.It is the story of Maeve and Danny Conroy narrated by by Tom Hanks, told in the voice of Danny.Cyril Conroy buys this amazing house to surprise his wife. It is called the Dutch House. His wife dislikes it from the beginning. She abandons her husband and children to help the poor. Maeve and Danny have a strong bond to one another. Cyril remarries and the ugly stepmother tells Danny he must leave, after the death of his father.Maeve was already on her own.As the years go on Danny and Maeve reflect on their lives at the Dutch House. They even go and park the car in front of it and just watch it, when they are no longer living there.This book is beautifully written. The descriptions of the Dutch House are magnificent.This is the story of family and relationships. What is felt like to be abandoned by your mother and forgiveness."

It’s a building with huge, wide windows, giving every passerby the opportunity to look inside. A function reflected by Danny’s narration. He offers a way in, clear-eyed but still intensely personal. It’s a story about everything and nothing, detailing how family dynamics are affected by the Dutch House and each other. It’s a dream for book clubs, full to the brim of characters that affect you in ways that are as much due to the real people of whom they remind you as their roles within the story. It’s full of questions that invite judgement and decisions that demand reactions. Overall, it's effectively done, more gripping than the details of the plot might suggest, and with a genuinely affecting sibling relationship at its heart. ARC via Netgalley"

The cover was the best part, that's what.Everything else was a Humpty Dumpty of a story, balancing on a pile of hard to believe premises for this quiet family drama. Actually I was thinking of the list of stuff that I find utterly unbelievable in this book, but I don't want to spoil on one hand, and on another - I am not going to not recommend this book. I think that just maybe it's not for me. I believe that someone might actually enjoy it, maybe people who can relate to siblings' problems, I don't know, Cinderella, Snow White? Hamlet???And I'm going to be fair - the beginning was interesting, attracting at least, so was the final twist (quite a weird one), but between those two was a vast sea of BOREDOM. I was wondering if it was done on purpose as a metaphor to show us life that Danny and Maeve were living after the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, I mean - the Dutch House. Not like their life was too exciting before the expulsion... I couldn't see it this way at all.Well, thanks gods I can deal with boring if it's well written. And it was well written, otherwise I would probably drop it somewhere on page 100, but... Like one of my teachers used to say - constructed by all the rules, but no spark of life in it. I would probably prefer it as one of those Hallmark movies - while equally forgettable it would be much more merciful to the time spent watching it.All in all - you might actually end up liking it.

I think this is a classic case of it's-not-you-it's-me. I found the writing adept but prosaic; fine for a plot-driven novel but this was more character-driven, and in these sorts of novels I prefer more ""literary"" fiction (even though I tend to avoid that term because of various reasons) with devices such as stream-of-consciousness, poetic prose, etc, especially if written in the first person, which this is. The writing wasn't bad by any means, and there were a couple of deft turns of phrase, but overall i just think it didn't fit with the character-driven nature of the book. This is just my preference, though, and a lot of people really enjoyed this. I'd keep away if you prefer more flowery writing in your character-driven books, but if you hate that sort of thing (which a lot of people do) then you might like this. But it just fell flat for me.

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well, this book needs another review like Tom Hanks needs another Oscar... ...wait a minute...HAS Tom Hanks won an Oscar?? One sec......Ok, we’re cool! Thanks for waiting! He does have one, whew. Two, in fact!* Although, to be fair, it’s been a while. Anywho, my point here is that: Wouldn’t it be absolutely amazing to be one of those artists of some sort - literary, or of stage and film or whatnot - who retain integrity and exemplify skill while also remaining palatable, nay, even pleasurable, and in general kind of infallible?As an inconsistent hot and cold ADHD-riddled late-bloomer (still waiting!), I’m absolutely enthralled by those artists/scientists who embody and exceed solid consistency, the ones you’d always choose to safely land the plane of your precious, goose-addled attention in the torrid, soiled Hudson of your human consciousness.How, in the actual fuck, are there artists who are so good at that, and whose souvenir gold lapel wings you’d gladly not only sport on your most carefree weekend warrior red eye getaway, but also strive to safeguard for the ages and confer to your descendants? What I’m trying to say is, Ann Patchett, along with Tom Hanks (recent audiobook Beatrice to the Dante of her prose, and that’s why he’s here): I mean, they just don’t seem capable of significantly quantifiable missteps. Take a gander (ha! I’m sorry - just kinda obsessed with Sully) at the lists of their works. Sure, you may not like them all. You may have your favorites. For instance, I’m more of a Commonwealth gal myself. But, as their records presently stand, you’d be hard pressed to majorly sway either popular or critical tomato-meters in their general disfavor. They.are.just.good. That ship has sailed... and! ...Captain Phillips is at the helm! sorry couldn’t resist!!But, you would be reading this review to learn more about The Dutch House, not about my preoccupation with transportation-centric Hanks films. So, here is a quick recap of some specific identified reasons why this book is good:-It’s Goldfinch-adjacent/reminiscent, as other far wiser reader/reviewers have also confirmed. But, minus the explosions and international art thievery - omissions which can ONLY improve a book written by anyone OTHER than Donna Tartt!-The whole House as Character thing, and who does not have a big fat red carpet Welcome Mat for that??-I mean seriously, it’s like you’re not even “reading” a Patchett book when you are reading it; it’s not even like you are watching a movie (not even a Tom Hanks movie!): this crazy phenomenon happens with her effortless prose where you are just somehow “living” the book. I personally felt like I aged thirty years or whatever while reading this, in the best possible way, and that I enjoyed this is especially shocking because aging is my most actively coming horribly true by the millisecond fear.-Super character driven, but, like, just enough stuff happens also?-Families and money, parents and siblings, Fa la la la la, la la la la! Happy holidays! :-)-That kind of historical fiction that’s just baaaarely on the cusp of being historical (just like many of us readers, har har!).-People who simply cannot let go of grudges, and the havoc wrought on self/other by both these grudges and the intractable retention thereof. This book portrays nothing if not the giant grudge match that is immediate and extended family, whether via passive aggressive virtue signaling or outright vengeance plots.-Like baroque wallpapering, people are destined to endlessly and elaborately repeat the often nonsensical behavioral and relational coping patterns of their ways, or of the ways others have modeled for them. Do I have anything bad to say about this book? - unlike The Goldfinch, I didn’t rate it a 5, after all? Sure, I could compile a shortlist of questions, continuity errors, and conspiracy theories, including but not limited to the ending of the book, which increasingly felt like I was reading a different book and, ultimately, something more worthy of the Lifetime or CW (the daughter May stuff? Come ON!) networks rather than the big screen? Plenty of other reviewers have already commented on all of this, and so I’ll let them tell you about it.I think some even great authors just have trouble landing a book sometimes - let’s not forget that even The Goldfinch ended with basically an essay, and I’m sorry, love the book, but that IS cheating - and The Dutch House is definitely not a Sully-caliber landing (no, I can’t let it rest). But even though I think it would have been better with an explicitly more bittersweet, Cast Away-style ending, this book, and Patchett, still remain...in a League of Their Own. :-)*Best Actor for Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994)"

When each and every aspect is amazing in and of itself, but then the whole is even GREATER than its parts. You can't explain why, but you know you just read something incredible. That was what this book was like for me. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the story, the audio narration, the book cover... EVERYTHING! For me, this book was sheer perfection, and I adored it! Patchett creates a feel for this story that is both real-life and dark fairy tale at the same time. The characters feel real, with all their flaws and quirkiness, and Patchett explores real themes, like familial love, sibling relationship, abandonment, inheritance, obsession, forgiveness, and more. But there's also this hint of a dreamy, dark fairy tale feel to the story, with a long-lost mother, an evil stepmother, and a brother and sister cast out. The result is a highly enticing narrative that draws you in and keeps you turning pages.Patchett is a master storyteller down to every single microscopic detail - the house/mansion really comes alive as a character itself, inseparable from the story. Even the gorgeous book cover of the painting that was in the house... Patchett had an artist friend actually create the painting specifically to use for the cover. And, finally, using Tom Hanks as audio narrator was a brilliant touch for this book! The story is told first-person narrative by the brother Danny, and Tom Hank's portrayal of him was just perfect, elevating the book to TEN STARS for me! This experience is one that is resonating with me long after I listened to the last word."

The Dutch House is a journey through life that focuses on the terrible consequences of miscommunications, and how intentions are so easily misunderstood; how it is nearly always impossible to repair trust and pride when it has been damaged; how the seeds of discontent and regret are quick to grow, and how bad memories can haunt a house for generations. This is also a story that is tender and touching, a homage to all the siblings who step up to care for their families, all of the love that endures ongoing hardships. Thoughtful and wistful, this saga of misfortunes and perseverance is a sentimental walk thorough time and memory. "

I often find it very hard to get into audiobooks and end up stopping and moving to an actual book, but he really just brought the story to life. This book was very well written. The characters and their relationships were done exceptionally well and were extremely relatable. The story is very much about the love and connection between siblings, which I really related with, and the meaning of home. It also has a strong message about how much the decisions we make affect others. It can often affect them more than we even know because it can be hard to come to terms with the repercussions of a decision that affects you so much but that you had no say in. That loss of control can be hard to reckon with.Overall, I thought this book was really beautiful and I definitely recommend it!"

Date: September 24, 2019After reading a mystery, a feel-good story, and a psychological thriller, this reviewer felt overjoyed to sink my teeth into literary fiction once again. I can and do appreciate some contemporary reads, but this mythical novel felt like coming home, especially since the story explores the meaning of home itself. It is not a spoiler to point out that this is a family-saga disguised as a dark fairy tale revolving around a house. The author breathes as much life into the house as the characters. It is not farfetched to say that the house itself is the main protagonist.The book begins in 1946 when a real estate mogul buys a fully furnished, Gatsby-like mansion, as a surprise for his wife. Turns out that she hates the house, but his five-year-old daughter loves it. Their son is born 8 years later. The narrative jumps around in time through the son’s voice. When the boy is three-years-old, his mother deserts the family, leaving the siblings devastated. This is how his older sister becomes his main caretaker. The bond between them is unwavering, even when the boy is a grown man. Their closeness puts a strain on his marriage. When the siblings are 12 and 19 years old, their father marries a young widow with two little girls of her own. The wicked stepmother has arrived. When the older sister visits home during a college break, she discovers that her stepmother has given her bedroom—which is the best room in the house—to her little stepsisters. An unused room in the attic is now her bedroom.The author does a good job of showing rage through humor throughout the novel. When the older sister learns about the room change she laughs and says, “It’s just like ‘The Little Princess!’ when the girl (Shirley Temple in the movie version of the book), loses all of her money and so they put her in the attic.” She demonstrates this skill with all of her characters, including the loving and long-suffering nanny, cook and housekeeper. The only small room in the house is the kitchen. As the cook says, “that was because the only people ever meant to see the kitchen were the servants.”It would be wise to remember that you are reading a fairytale, if not the book will feel unrealistic. Put in the fairytale genre, the story is as fascinating as the author’s 2011 novel, “State of Wonder,” which also has a mythical feel. “House” stayed with me after I finished the book. I deliberately did not read the initial reviews. (I missed the ARC reviewers’ suggested deadline on this one). I came to believe that the book is mostly a coming-of-age story, as well as a reflection on one’s childhood as an adult. The author seems to ask the question, ‘Why do we repeat the same mistakes as our parents?’ In addition, she wonders, ‘Why do some of us have childhoods that could have been written by the Brothers Grimm?’ Finally, ‘What might one may need to accomplish to change our life story’s ending?’I received this Advance Review Copy (ARC) novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my book reviews at: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...https://books6259.wordpress.com/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review...https://www.facebook.com/martie.neesr...https://www.instagram.com/martie6947/https://www.pinterest.com/martienreco...\https://www.amazon.com/https://twitter.com/NeesRecord"

Y pensándolo ahora, después de terminarlo, creo que es cierto.Tiene muchas cosas que te recuerda a los cuentos clásicos: la falta de la figura de la madre, una madrastra mala(¿?), un padre que apenas aparece por la vida de sus hijos, los niños que finalmente son apartados de su hogar...Obviamente no todo es como en los cuentos, y creo que la autora ha creado una trama bastante realista, y por ello bastante cruda.Quizás lo que más llamó mi atención, y no para bien en este caso, es que los protagonistas (los dos hermanos) empiezan y terminan igual, o al menos su forma de expresarse y de hablar es igual; no importa que tengan 15 y 22, o que tengan 45 y 52.Aun así tanto ella como él caen bien y eso ayuda.Un libro entretenido, con una trama que te hará cabrear, que te hará sonreír, que te hará pensar, que te hará sentir."

The Dutch House has a ballroom on the third floor, a swimming pool and too many stairs for a man with a bad leg. Conroy is a man obsessed with buildings; his wife, uncomfortable with the wealth – a woman who desires always to help the poor and referred to, more than once, as ‘a modern day saint’ – flees the house and leave behind her husband and children, Maeve and Danny.The novel is told through the point of view of Danny, for whom The Dutch House becomes the centre of his life and, later, the symbol of what he and Maeve has lost. For Cyril remarries the cold, calculating Andrea, who moves into the house with her two daughters. Soon, change comes to the house – Maeve is moved from her beloved room, with the window seat. Later, the two, find themselves outside the house and, as time moves backwards and forwards, they find themselves drawn back, again and again, to sit outside the house, contemplating their changed lives.This is a story about family and what that means. It is about the relationship between Danny and Maeve, and the stresses his relationship with his sister, later causes with his wife. It is about two wives; one who left a house, one who coveted it. Of course, it is about the house and what it comes to represent to those involved in it. An excellent novel and a good choice for reading groups, with much to discuss. "

She was a woman that needed to be needed—to give back to those less fortunate. Her children weren’t enough, so she ultimately left them and her husband.The second Mrs. Conroy loved the house and everything in the house—except her husband and the children from his first marriage. So, when Cyril passed away, she kicked out 15-year-old Danny and 22-year-old Maeve. Andrea also absconded with all of their inheritance except for an education fund for Danny. All they had left was each other!Patchett follows the brother/sister relationship for the next five decades. Maeve assumes the ‘mother’ role for her younger brother. Danny is a stubborn guy—often oblivious to his sister’s and wife’s needs. The rejection by their biological mother, and their step-mother haunted them for years. They often made pilgrimages to the Dutch House—the last place they knew their parents.Patchett’s ending seems disjointed from the rest of the novel.

I enjoyed Commonwealth, probably more than the Dutch House, because years later I can still recall the characters and that forbidden kiss that opens that novel. For me, there is less that is memorable about the Dutch House - but this is not to say it isn't equal in its ability to enmesh the reader fully in the story, which is altogether more disturbing and darkly themed. Twisting and turning across five decade, this is emotionally turbo charged family drama. Set around the odd but iconic ""Dutch House"", it is principally a story of two siblings, intrinsically linked by the pain and frought memories of their bleak childhood. It is about opportunities forgone, abandonment and reminiscence, but mostly, it is about reconcilliation. Patchett invites us to ponder, what we are prepared to live with and what we are prepared to forgive, and at what point do we walk away from those that continually hurt us? It reminded me of the Buddhist mantra, ""without forgiveness we have nothing..."" but what happens when in offering our forgiveness we are ultimately rejected? Patchett craftily weaves a story based on memory and forgiveness, where the characters (and the readers) are frequently faced with these questions - we may forgive what is done to us, but we will not forget it."

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"Maeve and Danny Conroy are an inseparable brother-and-sister pair. Their mother left when Danny was little, so his older sister played a maternal role, too. And when their father dies, they become like Hansel and Gretel (or Cinderella and her little brother): cast out into the wilds by an evil stepmother who takes possession of the only home they’ve ever known, a suburban Philadelphia mansion built on the proceeds of the VanHoebeeks’ cigarette empire.It’s interesting to see Patchett take on a male perspective in this novel; she does it utterly convincingly. I also loved the medical threads running through: Maeve is diagnosed with diabetes as a teenager, and Danny spends many years in medical training even though his only ambition is to follow in his father’s footsteps as a property developer. There was a stretch in the middle of the book – something like 46% to 58% – when I was really bored with Danny’s dithering (‘but I don’t want to be a doctor … but I don’t want to marry Celeste’), and the chronology is unnecessarily complicated by flashbacks, though this is, I think, meant to convey Danny’s desultory composition of his memoirs.In the end I didn’t like this quite as much as Commonwealth, but it’s a winning exploration of family secrets and memories. As the decades pass you see how what happened to Maeve and Danny has been turned into myth: a story they repeat to themselves about how they were usurped until the narrative has more power than the reality. Readers, meanwhile, are invited to question the people and places we base our security on, and to imagine what it would mean to forgive and forget and start living in a different way. Patchett is always so good on the psychology of complicated families, and her sharp prose never fails to hit the nail on the head. The Goldfinch comes to mind as a readalike – not least because of the significance of a piece of art: the cover depicts a painting made of Maeve when she was 10 – as well as Nick Hornby’s How to Be Good."
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsThis is another of Patchett's books where you simply go along with the flow and gradually become deeply involved with the wonderful characters and their histories. Some may question what was the point of it, but like other Patchett books, she tells her story and you take from it what you will. Maybe it's about family connections, complications of divorce and step-parenting, or maybe it's about kindness and forgiveness. This one was entertaining, and I felt the house itself that lends its name to the title was not the main character, yet very much a part of it all. Certainly the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, in more than a few ways. I appreciated the relationship of Danny and his sister Maeve after their mother leaves them and their father remarries the wicked stepmother. It should give one incentive to have a will in place to protect the children of such a marriage, yet even that may not be enough. Thoughts on the audio version:Well, it was as if the male character Danny was written expressly for Tom Hanks to perform, that Ann Patchett had Hanks in mind the whole time. Sardonic reads sardonic well. Hanks does a super job with the story and added so much to my enjoyment of it. BTW, I understand that Tom and his wife Rita are friends of Ann.A couple of complaints, though. First he didn't even try to change his voice one iota to distinguish the guys from the girls, the men from the women. Everyone sounded the same... like Tom Hanks. It was confusing a few times, but really, not bad. Second, why do comedians have to try to make reading ""Part II, Chapter 8"" into something cute or funny? Ellen Degeneris did it in her Seriously book, and I hated it. Just read the frigging words already. Minor distractions, though. He did an awesome job with an awesome character. And... the fact that there was a Maeve and a May in the book does not work well in audio!"
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 3 out of 5,"This novel is about a house and it's grandeur. The majestic old mansions was the product of the aesthetical work of the people who commissioned, built and turned it into a family home for people who cold afford the skilled work of masters at work.The original owners cherished it. The second owner, Cyril Conroy, a long-hours, extremely hard-working builder and developer himself, appreciated the house when he bought it, and wished for his family to live there happily ever after. However, it did not turn out that way. Somewhere along the way, greed, tragedy and disloyalty crept in and for over several generations the old mansions would watch them struggle with themselves and their feelings towards Cyril Conroy's legacy and the part they all played in their own destinies. I won't describe it as a modern fairytale at all. Nobody really lived happily ever after, despite the effort to write a villainous stepmother into the tale. Oh wait, no, it really might be the case. In postmodern idiom, everything is rewritten, and in this case being 'modern' and all, there dare not be a prince who rescues the princess and gallop away into the sunset. Nope, romance is frowned upon.Two dogs fight for a bone, and a third runs away with it: would you call that a modern fairytale? I would.WHY A LOWER RATING:I did not feel comfortable with the underlying plot winding through the story line. But overall I enjoyed this family saga up till the end of the second part. The third part: was it really necessary? It did not convince me of anything. In fact, I lost interest, scroll-read through it. Predictable. Boring. That's just me. Don't fret.Nevertheless, it is a wildly successful novel, one rating won't matter. It was written for another audience. And this author is really really good at her craft. "

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39878874-laura,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the most BORING book I have ever read. And I'll happily read books that are just like ""British people visiting eachother and being polite"" for 600 pages. I especially love family epics with no plot. You'd think this would be perfect for me, but no. This was only 300odd pages and it was agonizing to get thru each page bc I did not give a fuck about a single character. I read this because my mom's neighbor gave it to us from the library, which meant I was on a deadline bc I don't want it to be late on her account. That lead to the feeling of school assignment which probably made me enjoy this less. She said the waiting list was over a thousand people long which is why she let us sneak it in before returning. I can't fathom why it's so popular! I don't really get the ann patchett hype but I'm by no means a hater. Bel Canto was fine, albeit overhyped. I remember enjoying Commonwealth even though my review is totally incomprehensible and I seem to have been having a mental breakdown while reading it. This on the other hand, was just unbelievably dull. the inside cover says ""t is filled with suspense"" BITCH WHERE! what suspense! ""Danny and Maeve will stay with you a long time"" the two most boring characters ever??????? I don't think so!!!! The dad was so boring. His only personality was buying out buildings in poor neighborhoods. Which like, whatever, I don't moralize too much about characters. I mean who doesn't like reading about immoral rich people antics. But this doesn't even have salaciousness or cruelty. The dad, and almost everyone else, was aggressively practical.  The housekeeper/cook/nanny were super nice but pretty much indistinguishable. Andrea was simply an evil stepmom with no complication, and I couldn't buy that her infatuation with the house was enough to convince the dad to marry her! The Med school trust fund scheme was dumb, because why waste a decade of life just as a fuck you that you don't even care about! And it definitely did not hurt Andrea & co financially! They waited too long to have any meaningful confrontation. Sure you can interpret their eventual meeting as ""old age robs us all! Time is its own revenge!"" but that was just so unsatisfying. The Evil Stepmom and the Bio mom's abandonment were the two confrontations/mysteries I'm waiting for the whole book and they were BOTH non starters. BOTH!!!!! Give us at least one! The narrator was the most boring and emotionless person of all. He was so boring that he dedicates a paragraph to talking about how much he likes the game monopoly, which is famous for being the most boring and greedy game ever! How apt. His kids were just place fillers. His wife was--you guessed it-- BORING! Her beef with Maeve was flimsy, idk I feel like in-law tension esp jealousy over close sibling relationships is super common and it was not explored in an interesting way. I know this is just a product of the times in which this book is set, but it was annoying how all the women's lives revolved around taking care of Danny, who was not even that appreciative or aware. I also can't get over the fact that his ONLY PASSION IN LIFE was buying out FORECLOSED BUILDINGS in Harlem. Then the whole Mother Abandonment. I have read a few books lately that have that plot element, and all of them answered my questions satisfactorily about why they left and why they didn't/couldn't try to contact their child later in life (Crawdads sing, Cutting for Stone). I know people leave their kids all the time and this happens in real life, but this was literally the dumbest reason. She felt so guilty about living in a big house she wanted to save the poor in India? Why wouldn't she leverage the considerable wealth she had access to via her husband and make a way bigger material impact rather than just being self serving? Swing Time by Zadie Smith does a MUCH better job of exploring the nuances of a parent-child relationship where the parent cares deeply about improving society at the expense of her family life. She fuckin left completely and then not even ONCE over 50 years try to contact them?? wtf??? and then the reunion was just so anticlimactic!! And don't even get me started on the fact that she starts being Evil Andrea's caretaker! The disrespect.Seriously what am I missing here that everyone loves. I guess I'll find out when I read the reviews. I liked the descriptions of the house, which were so much more vivid than any of the humans living in it. But as much as I enjoyed the sense of place the house had, I still could not muster up a fuck to give about Danny and Maeve's and everyone else's obsession with it. I also liked that the cover was the exact painting in the story, bc I hate when book covers have absolutely nothing to do with the content. Anyway yea I was bored to tears by the characters relationships to eachother. Their motivations and reactions were deeply unsatisfying. And if this book was trying to make points on class it was not doing so very well. I'm glad it's over!"

The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house's architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived. Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back across the wide lawn. Maybe it was neoclassical, though with with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince's gambling debts.
When I was a young mother, my parents completed the construction of their dream house, two thousand kilometres away from me and my brothers (and my kids) and they took early retirement and moved away. Over the years and as our families grew, if me and my brothers wanted our parents to know their grandkids, we would need to make the long drive to their home by the lake and thus spend every summer vacation. Inevitably, every year, at some point when everyone's kids had been tucked into their beds, my brothers and I, sitting around the campfire and a few beers in, would start to complain about the kind of parents we had had; let's just say that it wasn't totally surprising for them to have been able to leave us as they did. And one year at the campfire – I don't even remember which one of them said it – one of our spouses griped, “Here we go, the Jones kids unearthing their miserable childhood again.” And that was fair, but we couldn't stop ourselves – I know that for me, everything I had ever felt about our parents had become tied up with that faraway house by the lake and I, year after year, resented being there and it brought up everything long-buried all over again. And so it goes in Ann Patchett's The Dutch House: Having been raised in a uniquely opulent house, siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy so identify the Dutch House with their parents (and their parents' individual relationships with the house) that every time they get together in their hometown the pair inevitably drives to their old neighbourhood and park outside their former home in order to rehash the past and try to figure out the puzzle that was their parents. This is a family drama and a finely observed character study, and although some surprising events do occur, I was mostly surprised by the very human (often conflicting) ways that Patchett has her characters react to these events. I loved every bit of this and will make this review spoiler-free. (Note: I read an ARC and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
“Jesus,” Celeste said later when I was trying to tell her the story. “It's like you're Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”
The Dutch House is narrated by Danny over the span of fifty years, moving backwards and forwards through time. I liked that this was told only from Danny's POV: as a much younger sibling, he had always been protected by his sister, and maybe it was because he was sheltered or maybe it was because he was a boy, but he had been so incurious about his parents as people when he was growing up that he learns many things late in life and these details become surprising to the reader as well (although they had always been known to Maeve, Danny only needed to ask). In a way, each of the siblings grows up to be like their parents (Maeve big-hearted and charitable like their mother, Danny acquisitive and emotionally walled-off like their dad) even if they don't recognise it, and although Maeve eventually learns to let go of her resentments, Danny nurtures his and refuses to forgive (and again, it's interesting to wonder whether that's because of his sheltered upbringing or intrinsic to his nature). 
We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. 
Much that's magical about this book lies in the nature of memory and knowing and acceptance. Many parts made me smile and a couple of parts brought me to tears; I recognised myself in these pages and I enjoyed the whole thing."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Literary Fiction + Historical FictionAs the title suggests, this is the story of the residents of the Dutch House. A father and his two children are living in this house. After his wife left him and his two children, Cyril marries Andrea. This stepmother kicks both Danny and Maeve out of the house when their father passes away. The story is about these two siblings and how they survive life’s difficulties. It spans around five decades and is told from Danny’s perspective. I’m always fond of stories that revolve around dysfunctional families. Although the dysfunctionality, in this case, was not too obvious it still was appealing enough for my taste. I think the author did a great job with the characters. They are varied and have their own personality. The relationships between these characters are well thought out. The fascinating thing is that the Dutch House itself plays like a subtle character in the background along with all the human characters.This is the first book I read by Ann Patchett and I’m genuinely pleased by her writing and storytelling techniques. However, I don’t feel this book will be a cup of tea for everybody. I consider myself as one of the target readers for whom this book was written. The story is complex and thought-provoking which makes it captivating. I will be looking forward to reading more of Patchett’s work in the future. "

It is a readable and sometimes moving family story, and is beautifully crafted. So why didn't I give it five stars? Perhaps because for me it is just a little too polished, and a little too predictable, and I am not a huge fan of books in which all of the loose ends are tied up. These are minor criticisms, as I enjoyed reading it."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I find this one a tough book to review because while there is a plot and one some people will find of interest, it hardly captures what this book really is. It's a novel about place, a house in all its history and architectural oddity, and one bitterly stolen too. And a book about a life, a younger brother telling his own life, growing up without his mother and losing his father to a heart attack, but really he is writing about his older sister. It's, in a way, a love letter to that strong-willed sister who somehow filled-in as a mother figure. This is a nice story, but it's not what makes this book so special to me. But how to capture what does?This is my fourth Patchett book, 3rd novel and I've learned to appreciate her effortless clean prose that carries a story largely by filling in all the stuff that isn't happening with some self-driven thought space and with atmosphere. Here it feels like someone on role, it's a very natural feeling book. As best I can see it, Patchett has captured a pacing, one that takes its time, builds room for space and time, that can bring that reader into that moment without any need to carry on. She brings in some detail that would grab my attention...not my interest exactly, but my attention, I'm listening and I'm wanting to know more about then, and there. And then within that set-up our narrator, Danny, tells his bittersweet story of a normal life with some striking odd scars, like a missing mother and a lost house, one he and his sister miss so much that they spend time together in a car on the curb outside the house they don't live in or own. There is another element here of the author of The Patron Saint of Liars (a book i haven't read). Patchett seems to thinking hard about sainthood, as in the Catholic tradition, or really all traditions. Danny, and his sister Maeve have a living mother they don't know, and they keep being told she is a saint. How can a saint leave their family? But, flipping through the imaginary pages of history, what saint hasn't abandoned their family? It's a curious thing that comes in the novel as a late addition that makes you realize afterward it was there, as a theme, throughout the entirety of the novel. Sainthood, self-sacrifice, selfish sacrifice. Does selflessness always come with a self-interest? And it makes for some interesting comparisons and contrasts, especially between mother and daughter - the daughter whose life defines the book that maybe isn't about a house.Anyway, that last paragraph is idle thought. I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the storytelling and how I was always involved and because of how much I looked forward to listening to more of it. And it doesn't hurt that Tom Hanks reads on audio, and becomes over the course of the book the only voice Danny could possibly have. I do recommend this one to anyone interested. -----------------------------------------------27.

Слушах автобиографична книга на авторката (прочетена от самата нея) и историята за трудния и професионален път, докато дойде времето, в което труда и да бъде признат страшно ме заинтригува и от там се породи интереса ми към книгата. Пробвах се да я слушам в storytel и колкото и възхитително да четеше Том Ханкс, на 5тата минута знаех, че това е книга, която искам да изживея четейки я. Определено мога да кажа, че си струваше чакането! Книгата е великолепна и ме впечатли изключително много. Сигурна съм, че ще е сред любимите ми книги за 2021 и не само.Семейна сага от най-любимите ми - сложни психологически взаимоотношения между родители и деца и брат и сестра. В центъра на историята са Дани и Мейв, които живеят във внушителната Холандска къща близо до Филаделфия. Загубата на майка им като деца, вторият брак на баща им и прогонването им от дома им от “мащехата” им завинаги белязва живота им. Повече няма да разказвам, защото без да искам ще има много спойлери.Най-уникалното за мен в книгата е психологическата, дълбока свързаност между Дани и Мейв и образа на Холандската Къща, която е цял един герой в историята. Както и образа и ролята на майка им. Оставям един цитат, който ме накара да настръхна:“Бяхме превърнали нещастието си във фетиш, бяхме се влюбили в него. Гадеше ми се, защото си дадох сметка колко дълго сме поддържали това си състояние, а не защото сме решили да сложим край.”"

143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15265939-lynn,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I’m not sure where to begin with this book. It is so complex on many levels. Told from Danny Conroy’s POV, it is the story about how the acquisition, and eventual loss of the mansion known as The Dutch House, has a disastrous effect on the Conroy family. Purchased by his father Cyril as a surprise for his mother Elna, the house becomes a fixture and fixation in all their lives. Elna can’t stand living there, and eventually leaves her husband and two children, including Danny’s older sister Maeve, and disappears from their lives. Cyril, an emotionally closed off father, eventually remarries a woman, Andrea, who only cares about the house, and nothing and no one else. After Cyril’s untimely death, Andrea banishes Danny and Maeve from the house. Maeve takes it upon herself to make sure Danny gets a good start in life, while trying to screw over Andrea. At times, Maeve and Danny park outside the house and ruminate on their lives, trying to make sense of it all. For most of their adult lives, it’s Maeve and Danny against the world. Even Danny’s wife, Celeste, cannot infiltrate their bond, much to her frustration. Eventually secrets are revealed, pasts are reconciled and forgiveness is offered and accepted. This story takes place over 50 years, with some characters giving the backstory which explains the present. The story sometimes jumps around in time, but the reader generally knows where they are in the story. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, although not all are likable. Danny and Maeve are totally human and are shown for who they truly are, warts and all. Danny doesn’t realize how much like his father he is as a person, although he is a better father to his kids than his father was to him and Maeve. Maeve is a joy to read. She never pulls any punches with anyone. I have to say I really disliked Andrea, who is almost too easy to hate, and Celeste, who had one expectation of her life and became bitter when it didn’t happen as she wanted. Frankly, I couldn’t understand why Danny married her, other than it seemed convenient at the time. I never got the impression that they really loved each other. Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy remind me of the three fairy godmothers in Cinderella, always showing up at the right times and waving their magic wands to try to make things right. The story explores the themes of forgiveness, obsession, family love, self sufficiency and self actualization. Both Danny and Elna had to be true to themselves in order to live their lives. Both were also quite self absorbed, seldom seeing beyond their own needs. Maeve’s only purpose in life seemed to be to help Danny, although she did find her own niche and was seemingly happy. I sometimes wondered about her relationship with her boss, if maybe there was more there than Danny knew. The book is beautifully written and flows along almost seamlessly. Mostly it is well paced, although the last section seemed to be a bit rushed. But overall, this is a great read that I could not put down. A definite recommend. "
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7912849-kerrin,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a very complex, interesting saga about a sister and brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. Danny is the narrator. (Everyone who has listened to Tom Hanks read the Audible version rants how wonderful he is as Danny.) When Maeve was a little girl, their father Cyril bought a mansion known as the Dutch House. Their mother, Elna, who had wanted to become a nun, never felt comfortable in the house. When Danny was a small child, Elna abandoned the family and went off to “be a saint” by helping the poor.Soon thereafter, Maeve becomes a Type I diabetic. The children are cared for by the household staff after their mother disappears. Cyril later marries Andrea, a truly horrible woman, with two young daughters. Cyril shared his love of real estate and owning buildings with Danny. Cyril dies unexpectedly while Danny is only a Sophmore in high school. Andrea kicks him out of the house and demands that Maeve, who recently graduated from college, become his caregiver.Danny’s devotion to Maeve is very deep throughout the novel. For example, Danny wants to follow in Cyril’s footsteps and become a real estate maven, but he goes to medical school just to please her. Maeve never marries, and never seems to fully live up to her potential.For many years, Maeve and Danny would park across the street from The Dutch House and have meaningful discussions. When they are much older, they realize they “had made a fetish out of [their] misfortune, fallen in love with it.” They both had a powerful attachment to painful experiences and relationships of their childhood. It was more difficult for Danny to be “dislodged from suffering” and become unstuck from the past than it was for Maeve. When it came to forgiving their mother, Danny only did so to make Maeve happy.My biggest complaint about this book was the lack of continuity in the timeline. Danny could be talking about his two children, then next about when he was dating his wife, followed by coming home from boarding school in high school. While many others have praised Ann Patchett for being able to craft together a jigsaw puzzle, I found the style a little annoying. For that reason, I rate it 4-Stars."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter,Rating 3 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer, secretly purchases a striking three-storey mansion on the outskirts of Philadelphia. When he presents it to his wife Elna, she is appalled by its opulence. It gets to a point where she can't stand to live there any longer and she runs away to help the poor, leaving 10 year-old Maeve and toddler Danny behind. Some time after, Cyril marries a woman named Andrea, who already has two young daughters. Andrea's arrival brings major upheaval to the Conroy household. The story is narrated by Danny years later, looking back on a time when he and his sister had their lives upended, reminiscing about the ways he and Maeve coped with their misfortune.This is my first time reading Ann Patchett and I can see why she has so many admirers. She is clearly a keen observer of human nature. Her writing style is unhurried, always in complete control. My one complaint here is that not all the characters are fully developed - Andrea in particular felt like a two-dimensional villain. But I suppose that can happen when you use a first-person narrative - it's Danny's version of events that we are told. I liked how the story explored how a person can become preoccupied with the past. And I was moved by the sibling bond between Maeve and Danny, the sacrifices they made for one another, the heartbreak they shared that drove them closer together. An absorbing and poignant family drama."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 4 out of 5,"“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.” ― Ann Patchett, The Dutch HouseQuiet character-driven novel about siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy, whose mother left home when they were children. Set in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, their father is reserved, and their stepmother despises them. They go through rough times, experiencing the ups and downs of life over the course of fifty years. They rely heavily on each other. They constantly revisit their past, repeating destructive patterns, making it difficult to live a fulfilled life. The story is told from Danny’s adult perspective. It explores the childhood trauma of abandonment, how memories get tangled over time, and how acting on a sense of obligation or duty can change a life. There is a subplot related to materialism. Some characters chase money or status, and these are contrasted against altruism and a desire to minister to the poor. The writing is elegant. The characters feel authentic. The house is a recurring image throughout the book. I listened to the audio book, read by Tom Hanks. He is a fantastic reader. His phrasing patterns are unique, and it flows well. I am rapidly becoming a fan of Ann Patchett. This is the third of her novels I have read – the others are Bel Canto and State of Wonder. I very much enjoyed all three. "

There are so many brilliant 5 stars.Unfortunately, although beautifully written, I did not feel engaged.It started very promising, but the plotless storyline dragged for too long.I don��t mind a plotless story, as long as the characters are giving me back something.I found that the characters were all too passive, flat and unreal. Even some situations sounded unrealistic.I also did not like the timeline structure. Oh, wait, there is no timeline. In one paragraph you are all of sudden married and with two kids, next paragraph you are back to your younger age and trying to figure out what you want in life; in another paragraph you are destitute and on the following you are buying properties.I found the whole book uninteresting and boring.I even tried listening to the audiobook as I read, and Tom Hanks, as a narrator, did not help to hold my interest.I love a good family drama where there are no forgiveness.I really did not care for any of the characters.This book was too bloodless.It left me cold.Oh, yes, this book is considered as a modern fairy tale.

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83419690,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of those few. who can bring banal everyday life to the meta-level. He draws the heavy dark water from the wells of the collective unconscious, after drinking it, everyone becomes a part of history himself, and brings a piece of himself into it. What has entered into flesh and blood is already your pain and joy forever. However, this immersion is far from pathos and seems to be intentionally devoid of clear links to the political situation of ""the fate of the family in the fate of the country"", previously mandatory for the genre of family saga. Patchett's stories remain private, even with the case of the extremely social ""Bel Canto"".""Dutch House"" is about the nouveau riche who moved into a beautiful three-story house bought by his father with all possessions. The story is about how the mother did not like this mansion and left it, and the second wife drove the children out of there. About how the fates of the brother and sister developed further, how, without being dazzlingly lucky and cloudlessly happy, both managed to live their lives with dignity and in harmony with the world. And the evil stepmother lived her life with less dignity, but surrounded by beautiful expensive things in the palace, which, unlike the mother of the heroes, she loved immediately and for life. More of a spouse, more of her own daughters and her immortal soul.Потерянный рай или Дом, где разбиваются сердца?Мне казалось, что дом - огромная раковина, которую я обречен таскать на себе всю жизнь.Энн Пэтчетт из тех немногих. кто может вывести банальную повседневность на метауровень. Черпает тяжелую темную воду колодцев коллективного бессознательного, испив которой, всякий становится частью истории сам, и вносит в нее частичку себя. Что вошло в плоть и кровь, то уже навеки твоя боль и радость. Однако, погружение это далеко от пафоса и словно бы намерено лишено четких привязок к политической ситуации ""судьбы семьи в судьбе страны"", прежде обязательной для жанра семейной саги. Истории Пэтчетт остаются частными, даже с случае предельно социального ""Бельканто"".""Голландский дом"" о нуворишах, вселившихся в прекрасный трехэтажный дом, купленный отцом со всем имуществом. История о том, как мать не полюбила этот особняк и ушла из него, а вторая жена выгнала оттуда детей. О том, как складывались судьбы брата и сестры дальше, как, не будучи ослепительно удачливыми и безоблачно счастливыми, оба сумели прожить свою жизнь достойно и в гармонии с миром. А злая мачеха прожила свою менее достойно, но в окружении прекрасных дорогих вещей во дворце, который, в отличие от мамы героев, полюбила сразу и на всю жизнь. Больше супруга, больше собственных дочерей и своей бессмертной души.Ну какая же это банальность: жена уходит от богатого любимого мужа, оставив десятилетнюю дочь и четырехлетнего сына. Не к любовнику, заметьте, а вообще непонятно почему. Отец женится снова на красавице с двумя дочерьми, младше наших героев. Мачеха понемногу прибирает к рукам все в доме, оттесняя родных детей от жизненных благ, а после смерти мужа и вовсе выгоняет их из дома. Много вы такого видали? А то нет? Половина сказок об этом, ""Крошечка-Хаврошечка"", ""Золушка"", ""О мертвой царевне и семи богатырях"", ""Гензель и Гретель"". Мамы в них не уходят, а умирают, а так все то же.Дальше: сестра отдает все силы на то, чтобы спасти брата - ""Гуси-лебеди"", ""Снежная Королева"". Забота о его образовании остается за рамками большинства сказок, в пользу принцев-изгнанников, как правило, не учреждают образовательных фондов. Ну так ведь и у нас не сказка, а реальная жизнь, в которой фонд играет ту самую роль, какую добрая коровушка или фея-крестная - то, что позволяет не сгинуть в самом начале, хотя дальнейшее зависит только от тебя. Даже сказочные условия, вроде ""никто не должен знать"" и ""вернуться до полуночи"" соблюдены. В нашем случае, это: ""утратишь право пользоваться, если успеваемость снизится до троек"".Жесткое условия. Особенно когда чувствуешь призвание не к медицине, которая даст самую престижную из профессий, а к куда менее почтенным спекуляциям недвижимостью, для которых учиться не нужно. Но разве у мамы не та же самая история? Она тоже всего-то и хотела, что помогать бедным, вместо того, чтобы жить не своей жизнью в этом барском доме. ""Голландский дом"" - это еще и о том, как мы проецируем свое понятие счастья на других, как искренне дивимся, отчего лучшая, в нашем понимании, доля, которую дарим ближним, воспринимается веригами и кандаламы.И о том, как по-разному подходим к принятию судьбоносных решений, с какой готовностью порой приносим в жертву ближних ради дальних. И о том, как наступать на горло собственной песне, как выдерживать годы занятий нелюбимым и не своим делом. Как честно отработанная карма позволяет наконец обрести счастье со своим и любимым.Энн Пэтчетт, безусловно, мастер, у которого a финальные прощения-примирения не выглядят патокой (ну, почти не выглядят). А ""Голландский дом"" одна из лучших переводных книг 2021 в российском книжном пространстве."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115229580-justin-chen,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsA solid 4 stars story with an added star for Tom Hanks' vibrant narration, which really should be the definitive way to consume The Dutch House. This is a sentimental story masterfully told: a cross-generational tale revolving around a brother and sister, their decades long relationship with each other, as well as their strange obsession for their childhood home. Ann Patchett managed to weave a complex familial drama without swerving into sappy generic territory, instead focusing on deconstructing the lifelong implication of reckless, in-the-moment decisions, with a flair for levity and sarcasm.The nonlinear structure is a surprising choice for a story that's typically told either chronologically, or through a series of flashbacks. The added complexity definitely enhances the overall experience, like a half-finished puzzle, the reader gets to experience alongside its characters, overlaying the past with the present, and decipher how their previous decisions impact the future. The Dutch House is a novel of typical length, yet emotionally it feels like an epic, due to its extended timeline (covering at least 50+ years) as well as the frank depiction of the protagonist's family dynamics. Filled with observational charm, The Dutch House elegantly captures the lasting effect of one's upbringing; this is an easy recommendation."
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34980639-april,Rating 1 out of 5,"I feel like this book will likely be lauded as ""good literature"". It will likely be something that people who read really important books will talk about for the next few years. But, it was not a book I enjoyed. I heard Ann Patchett speak over the summer, and she mentioned that Tom Hanks would be narrating this audiobook. Since, I love Tom Hanks, I decided to give it a listen, even though I also received a free ARC of the book during Ann's talk. Not even Tom Hanks could save my interest in this book. I kept listening really hoping at some point I would begin to enjoy it, but I never did. The book skips around a lot, and that didn't translate well to audio. I was confused as to when certain things were taking place. I assume I am supposed to cheer for Danny and Maeve, because they are abandoned by their mother and then kicked out of their home by their stepmother when their father dies, but I don't. I don't care about them, or their obsession with the house they grew up in. I just don't get the appeal of this book. This was the first book of Patchett's I've read, and I am definitely not inspired to read anymore. However, I will say that hearing her speak was fantastic. She's witty and charming. Too bad she doesn't write that way."

I started listening to it without knowing he was going to be the narrator and as it went on the voice sounded so familiar, so likeable, then I realized it was him and he did such a great job, it really took the book to the next level of greatness.This novel is not so much about the story as it is about the characters, and the house, which is a character in itself. The Dutch House had a magnetic pull on the characters and and the descriptions of it were were vivid and detailed. Overall, it was a delight to read.Loved it and recommend it!"

Though this was not what I was expecting, I did find myself thinking about it. This is at its heart a family drama that revolves around a house. Honestly, the house was a more interesting character than either Danny or Mauve. I kind of wish the POV had alternated between them both instead of only Danny. Think it would’ve added an interesting perspective and more depth to the story. I listened to this and realized it was being narrated by Tom Hanks. Wasn’t sure how I’d like him but he slowly grew on me. I spend it up a bit from my usual 1.25 up to 1.35. In the end, this novel struck a cord in me and for this reason the added star is deserved."
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14389832-mary-lins,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Ann Patchett’s “Patron Saint of Liars”, when it came out almost 30 years ago and loved it so much that I wrote Ms. Patchett a letter praising it, and she wrote me a lovely note back. I became a fan for life, reading every one of her marvelous (and unique!) novels. So yes, I was primed to love “The Dutch House”, and I did! Not just because it’s my habit to rave about Patchett’s novels, but because it’s GREAT; it’s my new favorite!“The Dutch House”, (itself as much a character as any of the humans in the novel) is in a suburb of Philadelphia. Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn. “The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely related-by-a-string, family. I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life. At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8530205-marty-fried,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tom Hanks seemed perfect for narrating this book. His voice made it easier to keep going when the going got slow, which it did off and on. While it won't win any awards for action and intrigue, like going to school, it does award the reader for being there and paying attention.It was occasionally hard to follow because it suddenly skipped around in time, but not for long. Perhaps that was just a way to make us pay attention, by jolting us awake now and then.Some of the lessons I learned were family is important so don't shut any of them out, and don't hold a grudge and try to get even with someone who you don't really even know. Even though their mother abandoned them when they were young, I think she deserves forgiveness more than the father, who didn't really seem to care about his children very much. And the evil stepmother probably didn't deserve to be hated, especially to the point of abandoning her children as part of the family, or as friends. They were victims as much as anyone.Personally, I liked the father least, but he tried to do what he thought was good. Unfortunately, the house seemed to have evil intent or something. It was too strong for its occupants, and perhaps their mother sensed it more than others. It certainly seemed to have a bad influence on many lives.All in all, a very good book, but a little slow for me at this time, hence the 4 stars."

A história foi muito bem escrita e a autora demonstra uma facilidade muito grande em transitar entre as cinco décadas de vida desses personagens.

Estive, o tempo inteiro, muito interessado em tudo que acontecia na vida desses personagens e onde a autora levaria eles ao longo dessas cinco décadas. Esse é mais um livro que vai discutir família e dinâmica familiar e, pra ser honesto, é muito difícil eu não gostar de um livro que propõe essa discussão, que mostra as diversas facetas de uma família e que mostra como a família tem o poder de moldar um indivíduo pra sempre. Com isso, a narrativa explora a história daqueles que escolheram o passado como presente, daqueles que não conseguem seguir em frente e viver sua vida, propondo, indiretamente, uma reflexão sobre o que aconteceria se tudo o que aconteceu na vida daquelas pessoas fosse deixado no passado. O livro foi lindo, inteligente, esclarecedor. Recomendo!Gostaria de fazer uma observação: o audiobook desse livro é muito bom, quem puder ler junto com o audiobook vai ter toda uma experiência."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"According to the book jacket of The Dutch House, the novel is a “dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”And indeed, the two main characters – the supremely self-confident and protective older sister Maeve and her younger brother, Danny – are obsessively connected to the lavish estate purchased by their father in the Philadelphia suburbs. Their mother has left them to their own wiles and in her place, a younger wicked stepmother and her own two daughters have moved in with their father. It is only a matter of time until they are exiled. And although they follow different paths, it is only when they come together that they are complete.I had a little trouble tapping into the male voice of Danny at first (for several pages, I thought the first-person narrator was female), but gradually, I accepted his voice because I was caught up in the narrative. Ann Patchett is a natural-born storyteller and here, like in her last book, Commonwealth, she ambitiously traces a family through a couple of generations.Both books center around an action (the exile in Dutch House, an illicit kiss in Commonwealth), and both deal with “blended families” that in reality do not blend. At the time Commonwealth was published, Ann Patchett called it her “autobiographical first novel” and I suspect that some of Dutch House is mined from those same murky areas of childhood – the complications of extended families, the theft of certain memories of childhood, the borders between realities and how we remember.It’s difficult to review the way I want to without spoilers, so I’ll just say this: I also saw parallels to religious parables. In a sense, the Dutch House is Eden – that wonderful paradise of childhood of which teens and young adults are eventually cast out. There is a central character who sets herself up to be a saint with an aberrant desire to be “of help”, and Ann Patchett nails it when she says that saints are generally despised by those who really know them. And, there is a quest for redemption.Although I have quibbles – the male voice, the somewhat rushed ending (along with certain aspects of that ending), I do think this is one of Ann Patchett’s better books. It’s not quite as good as Bel Canto (which, to my mind, is her best) nor is it as unrealistic as State of Wonder (which many readers enjoyed and I did not). It’s definitely worth reading and I give it a 4.5 rating."

That's a high bar ... and (alas), maybe my expectations were too high, but ... given how much I've enjoyed some of her work, I just can't put this one in the same category.But it's classic Patchett. Easy (and a pleasure) to read. Convincing characters that play their roles well. A complex ... and not entirely predictable (and peppered with sufficient twists and turns) ... drama spanning a lifetime ... all packaged nicely with efficient, appropriate, appealing prose. Family ... and relationships ... and love ... and loss and disappointment ... and more than a dollop of bitterness and spite ... and life ... and loyalty ... and expectation ... and, in the end, ultimately, the human condition.I'm somewhat intrigued by Patchett's decision to narrate through a male voice, but ... it worked (at least for me) and made sense, in context, given the way the story played out.I'm pleased I read it (and spent my money on it - Patchett has earned my reading dollars many times over), and I'm glad I got to it relatively quickly before I became biased by others' perspectives. And, in retrospect, if I hadn't read (and loved) so much of her other stuff, I almost certainly would've rated this one 5 stars...."

It is even mentioned in a book, that they are like Hansel and Gretel.After 30 years mothers appears. With no explanation, nothing. That was the most undeveloped and unreasonable character. No reason for leaving no reason for coming backs and no reason for behaving like she did in the end, which I am not gonna spoil. Everyone gets their punishment in a way.

No twists and turns that keep you up thinking about them but people that you keep thinking about because you feel like you know them. Tom Hanks is the narrator for the audible book (totally recommend) and you truly feel like he is telling his story. You believe this story and the relationship with him and his family especially his sister. You go through loss, anger, shock, grief, forgiveness, love, parenthood and many other emotions with this story but all the while enjoying this, well at least I did. I would absolutely recommend this book to friends but can't give any defining moments, just that when you are done....you will miss them.A re-read for me.

Fixated by the house, they revisit it through the years, and so the past and how it shapes present and future is examined. And later forgiveness, justice and penance.I think the writer is a marvelous storyteller, I went on reading even at times sheer stubbornness being the primary motivator. The sole reason to finish the book being to find out how it all ends. I'm not so sure if I liked the journey or what we find in the end. I think it all comes down to distrust. Life makes it allowances, I admit, but nothing is ever as simple or neat and cleanly cut as the way a lot of things seem here."

But the Dutch House checks all the boxes for what I consider a great book. Characters that you want to hug, slap, or invite over for dinner. Or all of the above. A story about a family and a house that demonstrates how that house can be so much more than a structure. It can represent the bones of the family, a symbol connected to love or loss or achievement or abandonment. And a bringing together of people who were flung away and then return to the fold, for comfort, understanding, closure. What a pleasure to read."

But even with just a few weeks until this glorious day, I could not focus on the scares and frights of the holiday. Instead I could only think about Ann Patchett’s wonderful new novel, The Dutch House. All seasonal thoughts of the macabre and the supernatural disappeared, replaced by ruminations about this heartfelt and beautiful novel. The characters haunted me like ghosts inhabiting a malevolent old manor. The story filled me up like Dr. Frankenstein filled up the head of his monster with the brain of a murderer. The pages flew by like bats, disappearing like a handful of candy corn until I was left with only sticky fingers (and a persistent tooth ache) to remind me of the journey. There were emotional moments in this excellent novel that crept up on me like a salivating werewolf hunting its prey in a pumpkin patch. They left me in tears as if I was a child whose parents ate all their trick-or treating candy and then filmed it to send in to late night TV talk-show host Jimmy Kimble for some cruel and inhumane comedy bit. The conclusion was both pensive and satisfying, not unlike a midnight visit from the Great Pumpkin herself. No, no, no there were definitely zero thoughts of Halloween floating around in my brainpan as I devoured this book, like some kind of Creature from the Black Lagoon. The Dutch House gives us the pairing of Maeve and Danny Conroy. You can add these two siblings to the vast and sweeping pantheon of brother/sister duos that have won the hearts of America. They are like Michael and Janet Jackson if Michael and Janet could neither sing nor dance, or like Warren Beatty and Shirley McClain with 100% less Academy Awards. Think Donny and Marie without the purple socks or Olympian skaters the Shib Sibs if they fell every time they put on ice-skates. The Conroy’s live outside Philadelphia in a large and fancy Netherlandish dwelling. The Conroy children first lose their mother, increasing their bond as older Maeve takes it upon herself to care for her younger brother. Their suffering only increases when a few years later their father dies and they are evicted from their home by their truly awful stepmother. Themes such as the circular paths our lives take (history repeating), forgiveness, and unreliable memories permeate this story like a trick-or-treating bag full of way too many Necco Wafers and Smarties (seriously, folks, what the hell??!). Patchett writes with a sense of compassion that coats her characters like the sweet sweet chocolate that coats a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. Patchett has the sense of empathy and sensitivity of someone who lives far north of her Tennessee home. This dazzling book is a must read and it is sure to illuminate your soul like a jack o’lantern stuffed with massive pillar candles. "
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95284601-jetmira,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House”, (itself as much a character as any of the humans in the novel) is in a suburb of Philadelphia. Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment, and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn.“The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely-related-by-a-string, family.I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life.At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,Rating 3 out of 5,"Danny & Maeve are siblings that live in the Dutch House. The house is in main character it itself. They move into the house fully furnished and the items in the house are specific and nuanced, creating a unique reading experience.The story is told from Danny's perspective and goes in and out changing from past to present and jumps around a little bit in the timeline. This took a little while to get used to for me. The Dutch House is a character study of one family, fading in and out and as different life events change the outcome, however the house always maintains a strong sense of place and a sounding board which these characters constantly rotate around. Patchett does such a wonderful job of illustrating lives of normal families and a mini universe into one novel. This one just didn't connect as deeply with me as I had hoped. I never fully believed the story coming from Danny's perspective. I think Patchett attempted something, but it didn't work for me. I never truly cared about these characters and really only found myself interested in Maeve. She was the most interesting and I really wish the novel was from her POV. This is my second Patchett, Commonwealth being my first, and I liked that one much better than this one. I will continue to pick up more by her and while I appreciate her writing, I'm not sure how much I will take with me over the years."

Tom Hanks narrates the audio and does a terrific job! I don’t even know how to explain what this book is about without making it sound uneventful because there really isn’t much to tell. It’s about a house and a family. It’s also kind of about relationships, hurt, pain and forgiveness. I feel like different readers will come away with different meanings and messages depending on one’s own experiences and interpretations. It is a straightforward story with many layers weaved into it. It was simple yet complex. Told through the eyes of a man looking back at his family history and complicated family dynamics growing up in The Dutch House. The writing was warm and inviting. The characters were impeccably developed. A beautiful heartwarming story that will captivate and charm most readers."

But then in the last sections of the book it hit me and I loved it. Danny the narrator is so un observant half the time, or at least he only sees what he wants to see or how it affects him, whereas all the female characters around him seem much more complex and I would’ve loved to hear their voices and their reasons for their actions. Maeve in particular is a wonderful character. Parenting, (especially how we view mothers)the roles of women in society, memories, forgiveness seem to be the main themes to me. The story jumps around a bit in time but was easy to follow."

179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard---golden-reviewer,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book due to its longlisting for the 2020 Women’s Prize.The book is narrated in the first person by Danny Conroy. He largely grew up in a household with his property developer Father, his 7 year older sister Maeve and two servants, his mother having left, for India, when he was young. They lived in an ostentatious house in a Pennsylvania town, something she never reconciled herself to, given her altruistic/charitable mindset. The house was originally commissioned by a Dutch family who made a fortune in cigarettes after the First World War. When their family all died out, and the house fell into disrepair looked after by Fiona (the daughter of their driver and cook) before being purchased by Danny’s father shortly after the Second World War (using money he had secretly amassed in some speculative but informed property deals). Danny’s parents took on Fiona as a nurse for Maeve and the soon-to-be-born Danny. Fiona left when Danny was young (not before an affair with their father) after striking and injuring Danny with a spoon one day.The book opens with Danny remembering the day his Father bought home another divorcee – Andrea (to whom Maeve in particular took an immediate dislike), later followed by introducing Andrea’s two children, with marriage and further alienation from Maeve then following. When their father dies of a heart attack, and Andrea is almost the last to know, Danny now 15 and Maeve (working as an accountant in a local frozen vegetable manufacturing firm, a job Danny considers beneath her) realise they have effectively lost both the house and their role in continuing their father’s business (something Danny had set his heart on) – as Andrea had persuaded their father not only to give her joint ownership but also not to write a will – their only provision an educational trust fund for Danny and Andrea’s two children. Danny ends up at boarding school and then expensive medical school, at Maeve’s insistence as a way to spend as much of the fund as possible, his own dreams of property speculation and development deferred.The book, narrated in the first person by Danny, jumps around time (although with a largely forward impetus). Danny marries and his wife Celeste (who largely builds her life around caring for him) and Maeve grow to dislike each other over time – so that he effectively meets them both separately, although there is a warmer relationship (and physical relationship) between Maeve and his daughter (an ambitious dancer turned singer turned actress).Maeve remains obsessed with her hatred and resentment of Andrea – and frequently, over many years, she and Danny wait in a car looking at the house – in fact much of their relationship is forged during those times, as Danny finally realises (many many years after Celeste and around 250 pages after the reader) “We had made a fetish out of our misfortunes, fallen in love with it”.
“Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside”
Although narrated by Danny and (in its final incarnation) named after the house, the book is really about neither. The real key character at the centre of the book is Maeve (and I believe that was the author’s preferred title, “The Dutch House” being picked more for commercial reasons, that the author, as a bookshop owner, could appreciate). It makes sense that a picture of Maeve, which is important to the book, is on the front cover, rather than the house. The author has also said that this was deliberate (and the description of the house in the book is left limited) as the author really wants readers to think of a house that they have seen.Maeve herself is a complex character. A life-long sufferer from diabetes, but with a partly reckless attitude to her own health. Having to witness her mother leaving home (without perhaps ever really understanding why at the time). Her own attempts to stand on her own two feet (by forging her own career rather than taking money from her father) are simply ignored by him (he is too busy involving Danny in his business). Her father’s relationship with Andrea is just for her another rejection. She never comes to terms either with Andrea being worth to marry her father (something Andrea’s behaviour hardly disabuses her of) and then later that Celeste is worth to marry Danny – someone whose life until then she had effectively used as a petty instrument of her own revenge. She also becomes obsessed with her own loss of the house. We do see some hope in her life though – a strong series of hints that perhaps she had a hidden lover for many years. Themes include:-	Fairytales – with of course a wicked stepmother, a magical but cursed house and two siblings. There are links also to “Nutcracker” and “Turn of the Screw” which both feature in the narrative.
It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminsicing?
-	Self-centredness – particularly of men Danny is someone who spends most of his time reflecting on the irrationality and selfishness of the women around him (his mother who he does not remember but cannot forgive for her desertion; his sister and wife who thinks are both unfair on the other leaving him to pick up the pieces) while seemingly unaware they (and others like the ex-Dutch house servants) are largely doing nothing other than supporting him.-	The unreliability of memory, and particularly competing versions of family memory, some of which simply comes from different ages and experiences. Maeve still loves her mother’s memory but hates Andrea; Danny resents the first and is more indifferent to the second.
Do you think it’s ever possible to see the past as it actually was …….we overlay the present on to the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered
-	The superficiality of an obsession with wealth, particularly property wealth. Ann Patchett has said the book was partly inspired by how this idea seemed to dominate the last presidential election – a candidate should be elected simply because he had more (property) wealth. -	Sainthood/altruism – and what affect a rejection of riches and embrace of poverty relief has on your family – and why that is considered acceptable for a man but not a woman, and particularly not a motherAs the book gets closer to a conclusion, relationships long buried or conducted at a distance suddenly are forced into resolution (particularly Maeve/Danny with Andrea, Andrea’s children, Fiona and their own mother) or in the case of one relationship (Maeve and her lover of many years) revealed to us (although oddly it seems not to Danny). The ending of the book I initially found difficult – some people have called it a little twee or a surprise happy resolution, for me it was a continuation of a family tragedy – and obsession with property over people.Overall an extremely competently written and thoughtful book – if not one where I really empathised with any of the characters (which is always a limitation"

Dabar pagalvojęs, sakyčiau, kad stokojome vaizduotės.“5/5Magiška knyga, savo pasakiškumu primenanti geriausius vaikystės kūrinius, bet santykių sudėtingumu ir kompleksiškumu, gyvenimo tėkmės įvairialypiškumu galinti pretenduoti į Pulitzerio aukštumas. Nė akimirkai ne politiška, kuo dažnai ši premija kaltinama, bet tiesiog gyvenimiška. Buvau girdėjusi nuomonių apie siužetinius posūkius, kuriais kiti skaitytojai nepatikėjo, bet širdimi išjaučiau kiekvieną: motinos išėjimą, tėvo patriarchalinę tylą, pamotės pyktį ir žiaurumą, namo žmogiškumą, brolio ir sesers meilės pasakiškumą. Dar autorei nespėjus to paminėti, jau romanas suskambėjo ir kaip „Mažoji princesė“, ir kaip „Jonukas ir Grytutė“, tačiau čia nėra nė lašo infantilumo, o tarp skausmo – labai daug grožio. Veikėjai tikri iki menkiausios veido išraiškos, o tikriausias pats namas, valdantis visus ir kiekvieną, apsėdantis taip, kaip Shirley Jackson Hill House galėtų tik pavydėti. Galima būtų sakyti, kad moterys romane sudaiktintos, tačiau įsižiūrėjus akivaizdu, kad susidaiktino tik tos, kurios nė akimirkai nežiūrėjo į ateitį, negaudė jau pradėjusio pūsti feministinio vėjo – net jei jautė jo gūsius, dažnas pasiekdavo nebent iš literatūros, ne iš tikro gyvenimo. O gi paprasta, praktiška moteris žino geriau, nei tikėti knygomis – jose per dažnai būna „ilgai ir laimingai“, kad taip lengvai pasiduotum – ar bent akimirkai gali jas kaltinti? Nors čia moterys gana aiškiai pasiskirsto vaidmenimis, net ir menkiausi veikėjai yra įvairialypiai – negalima jų guldyti į vieną konkrečią lentyną. Tėvo veikėjas, toks tylus, veiksmais kalba tiek daug, o jo istorija nepaliauja vyniotis už siūlo galo net po to, kai jo paties jau daug metų nebėra gyvo – tai tik dar kartą įrodo autorės istorijų pasakojimo talentą. Vietomis iki skausmo norisi kiekvieną purtyti – tai dėl vienos priežasties, tai dėl kitos, tačiau kaip ir gyvenime – lengviausia paleisti gyventi. Romanas pasakojimo lengvumu ir teksto plaukimu skaitosi kur kas lengviau nei autorės „Vieningieji“ ar net „Nuostaba“, tačiau tai gali būti ir nuostabiosios vertėjos G.G.-Bernotienės nuopelnas – jos rankose Patchett tekstas sužiba papildoma magija, o Olandų namo auksai įgauna tokį gylį, kad gniaužia kvapą.

I am so very grateful to have been able to escape into a brilliant novel these past few days as reality has been too much to bear.I think what I appreciate most about Patchett is her surgical precision in cutting into family dynamics. It’s the pervading theme of most of her novels and yet her approach, her characters, her storytelling is always fresh. For instance, the longing, bitterness, mistrust and loyalty of the Conroy Family in her latest novel may feel familiar, but the additional character of a house adds a whole new layer to Patchett’s writing. I could picture it, and feel both its grandeur and its oppression. ""The point, I wanted to say, was that we shouldn’t still be driving to the Dutch House, and the more we kept up with our hate, the more we were forever doomed to live out our lives in a parked car on VanHoebeek Street.""The relationships between three generations of this family, against the backdrop of this house, just felt incredibly “right.”“I had only ever seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.”I’m a sucker for broken families, but ultimately, what ties me to Patchett is always her strong writing. I stopped many (many) times to read a paragraph 2 or 3 times, because I am in awe of how she cuts to the emotional truth so effortlessly.""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""There are too many favorite lines and moments for me to type, but one that will stick with me for a while:“She might have packed her original disappointment away in a box, but she carried the box with her wherever she went.”Ann Patchett is simply an American master.

As much as i like Tom Hanks for sure i did not want him reading to me, reallly. But the more i listened the more i fell in love with the character's and the story. It's a story of family happiness, joy , sadness and so much pain but it all worked for them in such a good way that as a reader you realized that the pain and sorrow was meant to get them to a good place in their life. As a narrator Tom Hanks kept the story so calm and at peace so that i never saw the pain coming. Kudos to the author and Tom Hanks you got this one right. This story will only work for readers of love, compassion, empathy and understanding of different moral compasses, and for that i loved it❤"

185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest tale demonstrates another complex family dynamic in which a very unique and extravagant house is a metaphor for family secrets, personal desires and personal priorities. Cyril Conroy, a man with little manages to make a timely business decision that allows him to quickly achieve substantial wealth. He loves architecture and buys a grand home for his wife and young daughter, Maeve. Unfortunately, his wife does not hold the same values and feels uncomfortable with this vulgar show of wealth and opulence. Ultimately, the house represents their very different values. Which impacts their marriage and the health of their other relationships. Later, Cyril marries his second wife, Andrea, a woman, who adores the home. However, they learn that they don't seem to be able to parlay their shared admiration of the home into a thriving marriage. It doesn't compensate for the other values that they don't agree on. The pain each party feels is significant and becomes toxic in ways, they don't really understand fully. Sides are chosen and battles ensue. Bitterness rules so many of their interactions within the family that vengeance is what motivates much of the important interactions, putting peace and happiness as a nearly non-existent preference. It then becomes a pervasive force in Cyril's son, Danny's and Maeve's key life choices. Their poor priorities rob them for decades forward.Patchett is more than adequately equipped in her analysis of family dynamics. Yet, this doesn't make give any significant revelations to the reader, we haven't seen in so many other books. Though the house is a character, we have seen that done as well. Though her writing is above average, for me I don't think that alone makes it that more readable and certainly not profound. I will add that I observed two structural errors in the story that the editor should have caught and changed before the book's release (this was a published final copy not an ARC).I appreciate the lessons and insights that Ms. Patchett wishes to convey to her readers. Even today, this modern retelling of ages old parable is needed. However, I don't find it wholly original. I have read this story with different character's names, different cities, in different decades and even different countries. I was just not as excited about it as others have been. I am not saying it isn't a valuable story. I am saying I liked other's versions more (although I can't think of a title of any off top of my head (due to my traumatic brain injury)). The publisher acknowledges the nod to F. Scott Fitzgerald and it is a pretty obvious analogy to those familiar with his work. Though in many ways there are differences and I thought Fitzgerald did such a better job conveying his observations. There is a reason others copy good literature. It works. That's summarizes my opinion. This is another variation on ""The Great Gatsby"" and other novels focused on misplaced priorities in relationships. If you like that, you will probably find this likable tale.Bye the way, Charles Dickens did a bang up job in his novel using the house as a metaphor in ""Great Expectations"". This is my second book by Ms. Patchett, I may give her one more try."

One of those books that I bought on a whim because firstly, I liked the title, secondly the publishing house was Bloomsbury and thirdly the familial aspect to it.The first page had me entranced through to the end of the book and what a fascinating array of characters.The book is narrated by Danny Conroy who ""grows up in the Dutch House, a lavish folly in small-town Pennsylvania taken on by his property development father."" His parents, Cyril and Elna, had been poor but the father had done very well indeed in real-estate and their standard of living had improved tremendously. They were now very, very rich. His mother however hated the house so much that she kept coming and going and then finally disappeared. Both Danny and his elder sibling Maeve were really upset with this and finally the father told them Elna had gone to India. They never heard anything more about her until years later, five decades, and what an incredible story that proved with a most unexpected outcome.The book is fundamentally about the fixation of Danny and Maeve for the Dutch House caused by his father getting divorced and marrying Andrea who had two young girls. When Cyril dies, Maeve had already moved to her own apartment but Danny gets literally tossed out of the family home at the age of fifteen as Andrea has no wish to bring him up. There was no will but Andrea kept the house and all the businesses of her husband as she had ensured that she legally shared all the properties involved.The sections that really amazed me was that the two siblings used to sit outside the Dutch House, in Elkins Park, in Maeve's car smoking and looking in. Perhaps hoping to see Andrea? I don't know. I actually felt like a voyeur myself and when they both finally gained access to the house, well, I confess that I've never read anything like that before in my life!Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.

Your books, the last three in particular, have gotten me so deeply involved with your characters that I have felt bereft when they’re over. “Wait- I’m not done with you!,” I wail. And then I mourn a little and am unable to really get into other books for the next couple of days. You know this feeling? I call it a book hangover.Nobody writes about the interior lives of families like Patchett. The inside jokes, the resentments that go on for years, the little rivalries and the deep, idiosyncratic, lasting connections. This book pulls you right into its world, and I just finished it this morning (when I had other things I was supposed to be doing), but I’m sad not to have that world anymore.In this family, the mother leaves- when her son is 3 and her daughter is 10- and the father marries a wicked stepmother. The Dutch House is an amazing, one-of-a-kind mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs, and it’s called the Dutch House because the father in this family purchased it, fully furnished, decorated, and stuffed full of the former owners’ clothing and other possessions (and even a library full of Dutch books) from the Dutch family who owned it before. There are even paintings of the matriarch and the patriarch of the family on either side of the fireplace, and up they stay through the years.The stepmother is very wicked, and the repercussions of what happens to the son in this family, who is also the narrator, and his sister Maeve, who I absolutely ADORED, go on through the decades. Decades of surprising conversations, alliances, returns and departures.I don’t know how she does it. She not only creates the people, she creates this whole world. Late in the book, the narrator remembers a secret drawer in a table and finds quarters he knows have been stuffed away there for decades, and I could actually feel the slightly warped drawer opening with some resistance, smell the old wood and long abandoned change. This is delightful. Just what I want from fiction. There aren’t many writers whose ages I google, greedily, wishing for their good health and a lot more books. (Oh, good. She’s just a year older than me. Eat your green soup, Ms. Patchett.)"

Στην αρχή είχα δυσανασχετήσει με όλη αυτή τη θύελλα αναρτήσεων στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης, ειδικά από τη στιγμή που το βιβλίο δεν είχε προλάβει καλά καλά να κυκλοφορήσει. Είχα φοβηθεί μην μου συμβεί το ίδιο με τις καραβίδες και για το λόγο αυτό εσκεμμένα πρόσεχα να αποφεύγω τα σχόλια που το αφορούσαν γιατί για εμένα ήταν ένα βιβλίο το οποίο εποφθαλμιούσα πριν ακόμη μεταφραστεί στα ελληνικά και δεν ήθελα να επηρεαστώ ή με προκαταβάλει κάτι που μπορεί να έχει γραφτεί είτε με θετικό είτε με αρνητικό τρόπο. Αρχικά, ξεκινώντας από το εξώφυλλο χαίρομαι πάρα πολύ που οι εκδόσεις Δώμα αποφάσισαν να κρατήσουν αυτό της ξένης έκδοσης, καθώς πιστεύω πως δύσκολα θα βρισκόταν κάποιο άλλο να το ξεπεράσει. Κατά δεύτερον, όταν ξεκίνησα επιτέλους να το διαβάζω ενθουσιάστηκα πάρα πολύ που η αφήγηση γινόταν σε πρώτο αντρικό πρόσωπο, αφού από την περίληψη είχα την εντύπωση ή ότι θα ήταν σε τρίτο ή πως θα γινόταν από τη μεριά του κοριτσιού. Και τρίτο και βασικό είναι ότι αγαπώ να διαβάζω ό,τι μοιάζει ή έχει σχέση με οικογενειακό saga ακόμη κι αν το συγκεκριμένο αφορά μία διαλυμένη οικογένεια, αφού πολύ γρήγορα στο βιβλίο τα δύο αγαπημένα αδέλφια, η Μέιβ και ο Ντάνι, μένουν μόνα και μάλιστα εξοστρακισμένα από την πατρική τους οικία. Η άτακτη κι άδικη αυτή φυγή θα γίνει και το σημείο αναφοράς τους όσα χρόνια και αν περάσουν, με το παρελθόν να μοιάζει σαν αναπόδραστος παράγοντας για τη μετέπειτα ζωή τους. Το Ολλανδέζικο σπίτι γίνεται κάτι σαν εμμονή, αφού μέσα σε αυτό έζησαν μαζί με τους γονείς τους και είναι αναπόσπαστο κομμάτι από την παιδική τους ηλικία που σαν να τελείωσε απότομα την εποχή που αναγκάστηκαν να το αποχωριστούν κι ας μην είχαν όλα τα μέλη της μεγάλο θαυμασμό για αυτό όσο καιρό ήταν κάτοικοί του. Είναι ένα πολύ τρυφερό στην ουσία του βιβλίο με μία από τις πιο δυνατές κι αξιομνημόνευτες αδελφικές αγάπες που έχω συναντήσει σε μυθιστόρημα.

I can’t write a balanced review of this book, even though I’ve read and absorbed the whole story and retained more than enough of it to do a writeup on it. It’s just that, thinking back on this novel, which I listened to on audiobook, and also while I was listening to it, all I can/could focus on is how much Tom Hanks’s voice got in the way. This is entirely on me. I’m used to listening audiobooks in general and to famous voices too, and it’s never happened before. The famous person always faded into the background and became just a voice. Here, it was Tom Hanks overlaid on every scene. He never just became a narrator telling a story. This is one of those cases where I would’ve enjoyed eye-reading a lot more. Less interference. I don’t know why I didn’t realize this early on and just pick up another format immediately because it spoiled the story. It’s no longer “A Story”. It’s “The story told by Tom Hanks”. And that colours every single part of it. And it’s extremely annoying. Because I’ve only read Bel Canto so far, and found it brilliant, and loved Ann Patchett’s writing, and have a couple of books by her in physical form in a pile or shelf somewhere. And I had to pick this one, and Tom Hanks, of all people, ruined this one for me. Which is so strange to say, because I love Tom Hanks as an actor. Very much. I’m actually very distraught about this. I did think it was a very odd casting. And the only way I can make sense of it is he must’ve bought the movie rights and will be in the lead role? I’m just surmising. It all quite odd. TO ME. I’m sure other listeners will be fine with it. I’m an odd fish. I mean, how many people do you know who write non-reviews about why they can’t write a proper review of a book by an author they like and have actually read?! "

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” There’s not much I can say about The Dutch House that has not been said yet, so I’ll keep it short and sweet. The audio book narrated by Tom Hanks is perfection, without “doing” any voices he becomes every character and infuses the story with some added humor. I thought this was well-written, not necessarily beautiful and flowery, but Ann Patchett has a way of saying something in just the right way, so finally something that you have always known now has words to express it. I really liked Maeve and Danny, but felt that many of the other characters, especially Celeste, could have been more developed. The ending also wasn’t as strong as the rest of the book, but still worth your time.Oh, and that cover! think it’s my favorite for 2019."

194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved Ann Patchett's last novel and that caught me by surprise, because I had liked some of her earlier books but she had never been one of those authors I felt I must read and must look out for a new book.Not until that book made me look out for this book.When I first caught a glimpse I saw that it was a beautiful object,  when I read the premise of the story I was intrigued, and when I started reading I was captivated.I thought of it for some time after I had finished reading, and I realised that it was a book that I had loved on a number of different levels.It's a book about people. Many books are, but this is one of those books that make you feel that that you are reading about real people, that you might have mutual friends, and that a friend might have told you some of this story, because there are a great many people in the world who have stories that are more than worthy of retelling.I believed in the people in this book. I believed they lived and breathed and that their stories were true.This is also a book about a house.Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.The Dutch House was named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks, who had built it when they prospered in the twenties. Their home boasted Delft mantels, marble floors, ornate fireplaces and gilt ceilings;  it was adorned with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans and oil paintings; and it was a house like no other.By the late forties the Van Hoebeeks had lost everything, and so they sold the Dutch House to Cyril Conroy, an ambitious property developer who had risen from humble beginnings. He acquired everything - the house, the grounds, the furnishings, the staff - and only when he brought his family to see the house for the first time did he tell them that he owned it and it was their new home. His wife, Elna, and their children, Maeve and Danny, were transplanted from a small apartment to a grand, ready-made new home and lifestyle with no warning at all.Cyril saw the  Dutch House as a the ultimate symbol of his success, but Elna saw it rather differently. She saw it as a work of art but she knew that she could not be happy there, that it would never be her home; and her spirit faded, she began to spend more and more time away from the house, until that day came when she didn't come 'home' again.It wasn't long until an attractive young widow with two daughters found her way into Cyril's life, and into the Dutch House. She would become his second wife, she would take possession, and when the children of the first marriage would be pushed out. They would return to look at the Dutch House, but they would keep their distance and they would have to make their own way in the world.All of that had lovely echoes of fairy tales. These echoes were strong and yet that story felt utterly real and natural.The story unfolded beautifully. It had a clear path, and there were many interesting developments along that path. Some of those developments I expected, but some I did not. There were times when I thought that the story was going to go one way but it went another, and so I was always interested, and though I had an idea of where things might be going I was never entirely sure.Those stories had the untidiness of real lives. Mistakes of the past were repeated, but maybe that is inevitable.“We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”The evolution of the characters and their relationships was fascinating. As the younger characters grew up and the adult characters aged some things changed and some things remained the same; and though some of their actions seemed improbable their lives all felt utterly real. My perceptions of characters didn't change too much but as I spent more time with them I came to understand them much better.They weren't characters to love, I didn't want them to be more that friends of friends, but I did want to learn their stories.This stories had much to say, they were written with intelligence and insight, and they were a joy to read."
195,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"First, a confession (of sorts). I was ill when I was reading much of this book. Not a serious illness, happily, but one of those viral things that cloud vision and mind alike. Hence, I'm not clear on which reactions come from the book and which from my befuddled state. That said: I liked the book a lot. The story was addictive and the characters engaging. It's probably the most accessible of the author's books I've read, but beneath its pellucid surface lay matters of great depth. I'll leave plot summaries to readers far more capable than I.The book bears within it an implicit question that expands over the course of the story. Patchett might have given it any number of titles, but naming it after the house itself can't help but intrigue. ""Dutch House"" as in ""Bleak House""? The ""House of Usher""? What is the building meant to signify? And why does it have such remarkable power over the characters, drawing them irresistably toward it again and again, and then propelling them away? What the Dutch House means to each person in the book is the engine that drives the story. ""I was still at a point in my life,"" a character thinks, ""when the house was the hero of every story, our lost and beloved country."" But elsewhere, the same character will observe:  The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn't even understand what she was saying. Time in ""The Dutch House"" is not linear. The story moves from past to present to future and back, and more than a few major revelations are made in an offhand manner (as in, 'many years later, when I was serving a life sentence for murder' -- NOT a real example, just meant to give an idea of what I mean: it's not central to the plot, but it's not nothing either). The effect of this temporal fluidity on the reader is less a matter of confusion than it is a lens that draws attention to how our perceptions change over time. What a young mind perceives as meaning one thing, the same mind looking back decades later understands to mean something entirely different. Even in adulthood, things are not necessarily what we take them to be.Indeed, ""The Dutch House"" is at its heart an examination of how flawed our perceptions can be, how mistaken our memories, how complicated our relationships and motivations, how surprisingly little we know about ourselves and the people around us. Time and again the protagonist will discover how wrong he was about something he was certain he ""knew.""  There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.  Such moments resonate, sometimes touchingly --  After so many years I thought less about [my father's] unwillingness to disclose and more about how stupid I'd been not to try harder.  -- and sometimes with wry but insightful irony --  The truth is I have plenty of memories of her being perfectly decent. I just choose to dwell on the ones in which she wasn't. And this:  'God's truth,' Maeve said. 'Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.' There is much in ""The Dutch House"" to be pondered and (though I hate the word) unpacked. There are echoes of Gatsby and Dickens here, but I suspect readers will respond more with a slowly building sense of recognition in Patchett's depiction of memories, families, and motivations. I can't imagine a reader who will not pause for several moments and wonder (critically? understandingly?) at a character's behavior or decisions. (I could give some examples that I'm sure would intrigue readers of this review, but I don't want to risk sharing spoilers.)""The Dutch House"" will find a broad and eager audience. It deserves to."

А потом клокотать от несправедливости стало меньше, сказочная шпаклевка начала осыпаться, пока в руках не остался просто спокойный тихий роман про людей, которые живут свои спокойные тихие жизни. Они постоянно оглядываются на прошлое, но это им нисколько не мешает добиваться своего. Они грустят о том, что у них отобрали, но это не становится психотравмой. Они заботятся друг о друге, но не так, чтобы читатель обзавидовался или получил сахарную кому. Например, книги Энн Тайлер для меня немного чересчур добрые и милые, а у Энн Пэтчетт всего в меру, без патоки и разбитых сердец.Казалось бы, в истории про отобранный дом и исчезнувшую мать должны стремиться вернуть дом и найти мать. Нет, тут будут заниматься замороженными овощами и нелюбимой медициной, потому что «так надо». Тут нет погони за счастьем — Мэйв и Дэнни уже по-своему счастливы, а новые обстоятельства лишь делают их жизнь еще чуточку лучше. Энн Пэтчетт, в легком стиле и крупными мазками, уместила в 300 страниц жизнь целой семьи. При этом, как было при чтении «Щегла», все вокруг будто бы залито золотистым светом — драма приходила внезапно и без нагнетания, на хороших событиях мы слышали пару диалогов, а затем камера отдалялась, чтобы не нарушать интимность момента и позволить семье побыть наедине друг с другом. При этом автор как будто немного отстранён от персонажей и вроде бы не сильно о них заботится. И это понятно, поскольку в своем желании насолить Мэйв становилась не самым приятным человеком, а ее успешный брат лишь переживает, что хочет скупать дома и сдавать их в аренду, а не вырезать аппендиксы и говорить семьям больных, что у пациента обнаружен рак. Но несмотря на все это, книгу невозможно отложить в сторону — ты проваливаешься в историю, мчишься по ней, поражаешься естественным диалогам и логичности всего происходящего. Ты радуешься, что никто не забирается на трибуну, не вещает о пластике, загнивающем искусстве или демилитаризации, тут умилительно смотрят невыносимый балет «Щелкунчик» и говорят о вечном и важном. Да так хорошо и складно, что и читателю потом останется «на подумать». Особенно хорошо посмотреть на историю Мэйв и Дэнни глазами Нормы и Брайт — сводных сестер, оставшихся в Голландском доме. Про них нам ничего не говорят, но там есть чему сопереживать, поэтому обратите внимание.Эта книга отличный повод никуда не пойти и остаться дома. Ее можно поставить на полку, а потом перечитывать раз в несколько лет, как пересматривать любимый фильм, который знаешь наизусть. Может, «Голландский дом» чуть слабее «Своих-чужих», но, знаете, всем бы такие книги. Энн Пэтчетт для меня точно главная писательница 2021 года!"

You know that feeling-warmth, trust and the belief the other person genuinely cares. Ann Patchett’s uncomplicated narrative flows off the page-it is beautiful in its simplicity. This novel is about a complex American family. There are characters to love and to despise. It was so easy for me to lose myself in the story and I believe the simple but brilliantly written narrative was the reason. Patchett did not overuse any literary techniques or tricks. Let’s talk about the book’s cover. It is stunning in its simplicity just like the book. In addition, it does not include two figures with their back to the reader, so overused recently. The cover actually has a strong connection to the book-again rare in today’s publisher’s art departments. This cover alone, the expression on the girl’s face, will intrigue potential readers who may never read Patchett previously. Loved, loved, loved this novel. Rush to your local bookstore or library and pick up a copy. Put it on your book club’s list, purchase copies for Christmas gifts and sit back and enjoy this book just as you would getting together with your oldest and best friend. "
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett writes like another of my favourite American authors - Anne Tyler, with character-driven plots revealed through convincing dialogue. In this novel, fairytale elements and archetypes abound, along with references to many characters in literature: we have the perennial wicked stepmother, the banished or abandoned children, plus the ghost stories or a haunted house as in Henry James’ Turn of the screw, and the thwarting of love and ambition in Great Expectations. There is even a curtained window seat reminiscent of another orphan tale, “Jane Eyre.” Despite these mythical aspects, Patchett manages to make the narrative plausible enough to suspend disbelief, although the reason for disappearance of the mother stretched my credulity.The story unspools and loops backwards and forwards, so that we see it from the differing perspectives of the narrator as he grows up and recollects on the past which, as we now know, is not only another country, but one where the landscape alters when seen from the distance of time."

Ms. Patchett's style is unadorned, fluid, and breathes with confidence and assurance. I have often said, that aspiring mystery writers should read all of Agatha Christie's novels, and learn how to truly write a mystery.In the case of Ms. Patchett, I would say that all aspiring, serious writers of drama should read this wonderful writer's works. This is the third book I have read by her, and each one was wonderful and a lesson in how to write fluid, lucid, enthralling novels with great characters.Maeve, the main female character in the book, is so perfectly developed through five decades of her life that you feel like you know her intimately, as though you have lived next door to her your whole life. The story is told in first person narrative by her younger brother Danny and it is the relationship between Maeve and him that is so inspiring and loving. It is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I highly, highly recommend."

I always imagined the house would die without us. I don't know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?

Look at the three of us, undone by a house. It's insane.

Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,Shaped to the comfort of the last to goAs if to win them back. Instead, bereftOf anyone to please, it withers so,Having no heart to put aside the theftAnd turn again to what it started as,A joyous shot at how things ought to be,Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:Look at the pictures and the cutlery.The music in the piano stool. That vase.(Home is so Sad, Philip Larkin)
It doesn't take long for the reader to grasp that 'the Dutch House' is going to be a character in this novel; the title is a big hint, and then the novel begins with a description of the house's features, including the life-sized portraits of the VanHoebeeks - the creators and first owners of the house. The VanHoebeek story is portent and cautionary tale: a fortune suddenly made, a house built to be a family's crowning glory, then a series of tragedies and losses. But it wasn't until I neared the end of the story that I realised that The Dutch House reminded me of Manderley (in Rebecca) - surely one of the most famous house-as-characters in all of literature. The house is a shifting symbol : a place of safety, or a prison. Its ownership is contested. Its caretaker loves it best. It falls into decay and then is restored. It is the paradoxical shuttered heart in Larkin's poem: it holds the family's memories, but when the family no longer exists, those memories become unutterably sad.Memory, and our reconstructions and misunderstandings of the past, are major themes of this book. The idea of a house as a repository of memory is the cornerstone of the plot. The book takes place during the post-war decades (late 1940s to early 1990s) when America was experiencing a huge economic expansion - the 'golden age' of the middle class. The era in which home ownership, for the many and not just the few, was an achievable dream. The Dutch House is an exemplar of a house, but the importance of property and home ownership recur again and again in the plot. Both Danny, the book's narrator, and his father are property developers. Home ownership, and its opposite - homelessness - play a variety of roles in the plot. The story is told from the point-of-view of Danny Conroy and he's an interesting sort of unreliable narrator. I couldn't quite decide if he was unreliable, or only limited. Danny often gets the wrong end of the stick. He doesn't know everything, he doesn't always ask questions, he wasn't around for some of the most important developments and furthermore his understanding is hampered by what my mother has always referred to as 'male obliviousness'. The story jumps back and forth in time, and the reader can only piece it together when Danny does. In some novels, the reader can see and understand plenty that the narrator does not grasp; this novel is not like that. Instead, Patchett skilfully builds up the story by feeding pieces of it to the reader via Danny. There are several fairy-tale tropes in this book: there is Andrea, the wicked usurping stepmother, and there are Maeve and Danny, the children who have been displaced from their home and cursed to wander in the wilderness (in the style of Hansel and Gretel). Maeve has the colouring of a Snow White, and also that of her Irish mother - who has been missing for many years. The past tends to repeat itself, and it was satisfying as a reader to see the missing parents of Maeve and Danny come into focus as they themselves grew up. This is not only because they begin to learn more about their parents, but also because the two main characters replicate personality characteristics and patterns of behaviour first set in motion by the older generation. Danny exemplifies that well-known quotation by George Santayana: 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'
There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.

The problem, I wanted to say, was that I was asleep to the world. Even in my own house I had no idea what was going on.
The plot turns on a hinge which wasn't entirely believable to me, but allowing for that, it was a hugely enjoyable and satisfying read. Patchett writes such clear, elegant prose, and the book was beautifully constructed and held my attention throughout. Although Danny narrates the book, Maeve was the stand-out character - truly one of the best characters in Patchett's canon. A solid 4.5 stars"

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the seventh novel by NYT best-selling American author, Ann Patchett. It had been Danny’s childhood home. Cyril Conroy had bought the incredible Dutch House, there in small-town Pennsylvania, in 1946 for his young family: his wife Elna, and five-year-old Maeve. It was just as the last Van Hoebeek, the original owners, had left it: furnishings, fittings, even clothing. Danny was born a few years later, and lived there until his step-mother threw him out at fifteen.Danny’s mom had left when he was three; he was eight when Andrea Smith first came on the scene, but he and Maeve dismissed any idea of permanence. Andrea persisted, though; Andrea was fascinated with every detail of The Dutch House and Van Hoebeek family, who had made their fortune in packaged cigarettes. Had Maeve and Danny paid more attention, they might have seen the signs, they might have predicted, but not prevented, it: just three years after she had first stood in front of the Van Hoebeek portraits in the drawing room, Andrea married Cyril, and took up residence in The Dutch House with her daughters. No longer were they the comfortable Conroy trio, lovingly cared for by Sandy and Jocelyn. Danny had counted on following his canny father into real estate and construction; instead, Maeve insisted he study medicine at Columbia: their father’s trust, grudgingly dispensed by Andrea, was covering the not-inconsiderable cost. And on visits home, the siblings would park on Van Hoebeek Street, regard The Dutch House, and fume over their stolen inheritance, their self-made father’s fortune.Maeve, aware Cyril’s humble beginnings, was the most resentful; Danny had “never been in the position of getting my head around what I’d been given. I only understood what I’d lost.” Not until a career had been gained and discarded, and a marriage and children made, some twenty-seven years after they had been ejected from The Dutch House, did Maeve and Danny finally acknowledge what their obsession had done to them: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long”While Danny’s wife seems resentful of his close relationship with his sister, it is not until a certain, somewhat familiar old woman turns up at Maeve’s hospital bed that he realises: “I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn’t miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen… ‘Danny!’ she would call up to me. ‘Breakfast. Move yourself.’”This is very much a character-driven story, and it clearly demonstrates Patchett’s literary skill: her characters are interesting and allowed to grow and develop, to display insight and utter wise words. The bond between the siblings is so well portrayed, it’s impossible not to feel for them. Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5★, rounded up.I was thrilled to receive an advance copy of this book from Bloomsbury, as Ann Patchett is one of my favourite authors. While reading it, I couldn't help but compare it with her previous novel, Commonwealth, which I liked but didn't love. This one, I loved. Both are strongly character-driven stories about family, but somehow The Dutch House also has more plot and was therefore more satisfying as I turned the final page.Told in the first person, from the point of view of Daniel Conroy, this is the story of 3 generations of the Conroys and their relationship to the Dutch House in Elkins Park. The house is such an integral part of the story, it's like a family member in its own right. Built by cigarette-distribution magnates, the VanHoebeeks, the house has become ridiculously opulent in what became suburban Philadelphia, but was probably considered more tasteful or understated as part of the vast Elkins Park countryside of the pre-war era in which it was built. When the last of the VanHoebeeks died, Cyril Conroy was able to buy it lock, stock and barrel, for a good price. The house came fully furnished and decorated with all the VanHoebeeks possessions including clothes, ornaments and paintings. The life-size twin portraits of Mr and Mrs VanHoebeek continued to oversee the life of the house long after they were gone, from their position in the drawing room. Mr & Mrs VanHoebeek, who had no first names that I had ever heard, were old in their portraits but not entirely ancient. They both dressed in black and stood with an erect formality that spoke of another time. Even in their separate frames they were so together, so married, I always thought it must have been one large painting that someone cut in half. Because the house also came with one of their former staff, Fiona, the stories of the Dutch family stayed with the house and it was almost as though the VanHoebeeks became an older, more remote generation of the Conroy family.However, the purchase of the Dutch House was the beginning of the end of Cyril's marriage to Elna (Danny's mother), and therefore an early catalyst to his unhappy second marriage, to the much younger Andrea Smith. Both of these events necessarily shaped the close relationship between Danny and his older sister Maeve, as their father became more distant.Although the story jumps back and forth from when Danny was about 4 years old, to his late 40s or early 50s, Patchett skilfully brings the reader along and there is no danger of getting lost. There is a very recognisable arc that proceeds in a traditional linear direction over the top of the detours and meanderings. Towards the end, some threads of the story even come full circle and for me this was particularly satisfying.Danny's narration has a friendly, almost confiding tone that really draws you in and makes you care about his family. He admits to being a funny (i.e. odd), unobservant kid - such as the time he suddenly realised the housekeeper and the cook were more than just workmates - and this serves to highlight the exceptional traits of his beloved sister. Due to their closeness we also get to know Maeve pretty well, or perhaps I should qualify that and say we know her family life pretty well. We don't know her personal life, although there are hints and we can speculate about what's going on there. But when I think about my own brother and me - with a similar age gap - I think that's realistic!Despite being banished from the Dutch House while Danny was still at high school, the house continues to be a magnet for Danny and Maeve long into their adult lives until they consciously decide to give it up. And then after a major disruption in the family, the Dutch House once again takes centre stage. I thought this was the perfect ending, providing the opportunity to get over so many regrets for so many characters.I could go on - there is so, so much more. Suffice to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the past few days, being immersed in the richly detailed, warm world of the Conroys and their Dutch House."

I did this as an audio book and am so glad I did, Tom Hanks was the perfect narrator and addition to this story. For the most part it ends up that most books I read or listen to have a female protagonist. I somehow ended up having both my physical book and audio book both be a male protagonist this time around. That for sure doesn’t happen often for me. It was a definite bonus for this particular book. Our Goodreads synopsis informs us that “At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”“Disappointment comes from expectation.”It was amazing to me how the recollection of the same events differs between siblings, just as in real life. Being an only child I always find the dynamics of siblings fascinating. Between the story following the siblings and the rest of the family sagas this book checked all the boxes for me. I loved the time span of the five decades and how seemless it was. It flowed wonderfully and never felt disjointed or confusing. I was completely immersed the whole time. I particularly liked Danny questioning so many things about growing up and his family that he never took the time to ask or wonder about previously. I also enjoyed how his character struggled with what he wanted to do with his life. Do you choose to do what you like to do or do you choose to do what your loved ones expect you to do, when you are successful in both? He also has the dilemma of where does your loyalty stand, with your blood or with your spouse or significant other? Can it be both?There were so many enjoyable characters in this book. Not just the primary ones. There were bits of humor scattered throughout and lots of thought provoking events. I felt so many emotions during the course of this book and that is always a sign of a good book to me. It was descriptive and when I wasn’t listening to it I was looking forward to when I would be again. This book has many amazing reviews and they are very well deserved. I’m very glad I finally got to this one, and I am already missing it. "
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 5I listened to the audiobook of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett which was narrated by Tom Hanks and it really just heightened my experience with this book! What it's about: Danny and his older sister Maeve live with their dad on a large estate known to everyone as the Dutch House. Their mom leaves when Danny is young, and the siblings are eventually kicked out of the Dutch House by their stepmom when Danny is a teenager. Set over five decades, The Dutch House focuses on two siblings that can't let go of their past, and the course their lives eventually take. They say the narrator can make or break an audiobook and I definitely agree. I could listen to Tom Hanks all day and I loved that he was the narrator of The Dutch House. He spoke the words with the heart they deserved and emphasized the beauty of this novel. This is my first experience with an Ann Patchett book, and it will definitely not be my last.I saw a couple reviews that mentioned The Dutch House might not be the best book to read first if you are new to Patchett, but I was instantly consumed with the story and all the pain of this family saga. I loved Danny and Maeve even with all of their flaws, and I ended up loathing their stepmom (like any good person would do). Patchett really knows how to move you with her words and characters, and this was a very emotional book. I thought the writing to be both beautiful and eloquent, and I am kicking myself for not reading one of Patchett's books sooner! The Dutch House took me on a journey through Danny and Maeve's lives, and all the pain and heartaches this family endures. There are happy times that made me smile and chuckle as well, so don't worry - this book isn't all just one sad journey! Song/s the book brought to mind: 100 Years by Five for FightingFinal Thought: The Dutch House was my first time listening to a fiction book as an audiobook and I absolutely loved my experience with it. The audio is just shy of 10 hours but the minutes pass quickly and Hanks makes for an excellent narrator. If you are into family sagas with beautiful, descriptive words I highly recommend picking this up ASAP!"

I was not disappointed.THE DUTCH HOUSE is told by Danny Conroy, looking back at his life that began in an old mansion that his father had bought to impress his mother, who instead grew embarrassed by its over luxuriousness, eventually choosing to leave her family. Danny and his older sister, Maeve, became wards of a less than loving father and eventually an ambitious step mother. What follows are decades of calamity, uncertainty, close bonds come and gone, with Danny and Maeve always drawn back to the house that made them, forced to wonder why certain events occurred and whether they could forgive the adults who did them wrong.Pratchett is a quiet writer but her pride is elegance and entrancing, the plot shifts subtle but moving. Hanks' narration is pitch perfect, never too dramatic, but with enough depth to capture the emotion of Danny's story.Definitely one of my favourite reads of the year, a perfect gift for parents looking for a book to capture them."

All three are able to take an everyday life and turn it into a novel. If you need spectacular or uber exciting, this may not be what you are looking for. But if you like life-like, steady and richly written this Patchett novel is for you. I listened to this novel on audio. It was narrated by Tom Hanks and he did a fabulous job of it. His pitch and tone and inflections were great. You could feel the characters some to life under his reading. Two siblings are stuck! Stuck in the time they lived in the Dutch House. This novel moves through five decades and you see the growth of both siblings. The growth, influenced by the Dutch House. We are able to walk through the lives of both Maeve and Danny, seeing it from their perspective, seeing it from the each others perspective and also from the outside by additional characters. Inheritance, loss and disappointment, our appearance to others, our appearance to ourselves, truth and lies, hopeful thinking, and realization of the truth are all themes throughout this novel.As I said, not a flashy novel, just the simmering life of siblings, as they both obsessed over their lives as associated to the Dutch House.

The book is pretty good, and interesting and feels real and all that, OK. BUT and this is a HUGE BUT - what would this book be, without the voice of Tom Hanks?! And I can't stop wondering why on earth haven't I fallen for his voice and him so far? I mean, I would recognize his voice, always, but I haven't listen to it like that in a movie, or anywhere else for that matter! I haven't been crazy about the sound of it. Holy Jesus, I am in love with a voice and I want, no, I NEED to listen to Tom Hank's voice till the end of the world, and maybe two more bonus tracks after that.

He allows the story to be told without making himself a character in the novel.Ann Pratchett clearly is a natural storyteller so this was definitely worth reading yet I don’t think this will be one of those books I think of in months to come.The fixation on the Dutch House, representing everything that Maeve and Danny had lost, was presented in vivid imagery and I also really enjoyed the strong bond portrayed between the siblings. Their love for each other endured throughout illness, parental abandonment, familial displacement, and an evil stepmother.The book addresses forgiveness and the choices we make in life that has a ripple effect not only on ourselves but others for decades to come.Recommended for readers who like complex family dramas."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, like the rest of all my friends who read this back in 2019-20, I LOVED this book. The Dutch House introduces us to a single parent family living in a gigantic historic mansion. The two children, Maeve and Danny, are the focus of this character-driven story which really is about family dynamics and how wealth can impact a family in very unexpected ways. Patchett is so clever in the way in which she reveals her stories. I think she really understands human nature, grudges, forgiveness, and love, and finds a way to reveal the truths behind these emotions to her readers without ever telling them what to think. And I think every reader will find a character or two to relate to in this particular story. If you haven't read this one yet, I highly recommend it. I like an Patchett in general, but I enjoyed this one more than Bel Canto and State of Wonder."

All I can figure out is that I was swept away by a master storyteller. One who can make a house into a major character. One who can develop characters with a fine brush. One who can move at a snail’s pace and I’m perfectly content. Each word seems to be right exactly where it belongs. I’ll come back to edit this review if my thoughts become more cohesive with time. I just finished it today.
216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this sweeping tale read with aplomb by Tom Hanks. He was believable as Danny, the brother and narrator of the story. What stood out to me was the strength of the bond between Danny and his sister, Maeve, and their strength of character. I remember being taken by surprise one day when someone pointed out that our longest lifetime relationships are those with our siblings. This is a wonderful example of a dedicated sibling pair. As for the house, which also appears as a character, I would love to have a window seat with the drapes that enfold you creating a quiet den for reading. "

The two siblings then wade through poverty and share a very special bond as they move their way through the murky waters of their lives.Although not lengthy, it is a slow paced book.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the seventh novel by NYT best-selling American author, Ann Patchett. The audio version is narrated by actor, Tom Hanks. It had been Danny’s childhood home. Cyril Conroy had bought the incredible Dutch House, there in small-town Pennsylvania, in 1946 for his young family: his wife Elna, and five-year-old Maeve. It was just as the last Van Hoebeek, the original owners, had left it: furnishings, fittings, even clothing. Danny was born a few years later, and lived there until his step-mother threw him out at fifteen.Danny’s mom had left when he was three; he was eight when Andrea Smith first came on the scene, but he and Maeve dismissed any idea of permanence. Andrea persisted, though; Andrea was fascinated with every detail of The Dutch House and Van Hoebeek family, who had made their fortune in packaged cigarettes.Had Maeve and Danny paid more attention, they might have seen the signs, they might have predicted, but not prevented, it: just three years after she had first stood in front of the Van Hoebeek portraits in the drawing room, Andrea married Cyril, and took up residence in The Dutch House with her daughters. No longer were they the comfortable Conroy trio, lovingly cared for by Sandy and Jocelyn.Danny had counted on following his canny father into real estate and construction; instead, Maeve insisted he study medicine at Columbia: their father’s trust, grudgingly dispensed by Andrea, was covering the not-inconsiderable cost. And on visits home, the siblings would park on Van Hoebeek Street, regard The Dutch House, and fume over their stolen inheritance, their self-made father’s fortune.Maeve, aware Cyril’s humble beginnings, was the most resentful; Danny had “never been in the position of getting my head around what I’d been given. I only understood what I’d lost.” Not until a career had been gained and discarded, and a marriage and children made, some twenty-seven years after they had been ejected from The Dutch House, did Maeve and Danny finally acknowledge what their obsession had done to them: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long”While Danny’s wife seems resentful of his close relationship with his sister, it is not until a certain, somewhat familiar old woman turns up at Maeve’s hospital bed that he realises: “I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn’t miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen… ‘Danny!’ she would call up to me. ‘Breakfast. Move yourself.’”This is very much a character-driven story, and it clearly demonstrates Patchett’s literary skill: her characters are interesting and allowed to grow and develop, to display insight and utter wise words. The bond between the siblings is so well portrayed, it’s impossible not to feel for them. Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I very nearly gave it a 5 star review. And it's close, but just not quite there.After some ponder time, I believe this is tied for my most favorite Patchett. And that's saying it's GOOD. I liked State of Wonder as much, but this one is probably more ""universal"" as combined families have been for decades, and are also becoming- the near count majority. It's one of the largest and prime reason that I lived the non-remarriage serial monogamy route. Serial monogamy marriage being closest to ""normal"" since about 1975. In the USA and other places it was even earlier. I've seen too many kids get the shaft from their parent's marriage partner. Worse than this couple of siblings. Marriage laws are, IMHO, intensely unfair- and not only in the inheritance frames either.But Ann Patchett has hit superbly upon the siblings of ""us"" vs ""them"". And defined the Father who walked the oversee line without really ""seeing"" any true essence reality for/ of ""after"" at all.A great siblings story that is probably far outside of median, but purely and supremely nuanced beyond any I think I've read in decades. Also that Mother who thinks of herself (and others seem to agree?) as ""saint fodder"". I think Ann Patchett performed a miracle in positing her as she did. What an impossible task she accomplished to equate her values and her actions in the prose language of subtle flow and calm. I could hardly read about her in any semblance of the same. Of such priorities are the most highly duplicitous and do gooders who gush their superior sensibilities made. Save us from their ""know better than others"" examples and screen us, PLEASE from the fall outs of their values' actions.Andrea is supposed to be the heavy in this one. The wicked step-mother personified? She was a welterweight evil, IMHO. The real Mom was the heavyweight brand! Gag me.Read the book to find out what I'm posting. No more review. Take the crux of this plot without more knowledge.It lost a point in the jumps of ""eyes"" and back-biting time flows. They were too abrupt and put there to cause unknowns to heighten the tension. They weren't needed. Maeve and Dan only need to sit in the vehicle across the street from the Dutch House while smoking their ""last"" cigarette. Sit, talk and smoke; once, once and once again. That was sufficient tension. Constant and lifelong sort of which only those who have lived in it or have seen it up close (like our household help here at the Dutch House) know. Maeve's portrait on the hardcover is GORGEOUS. I do not think at all she looked grim- she looked exactly like Irish girls I have know who are SO trying to be a ""good girl"". Also loved the wall paper."

I grew up in the Ditch House, and Sandy and Jocelyn and Celeste were my family, and nothing else.This book is fantastic. It's easy on the heart and somehow so heavy, so demanding of my emotional abilities and inner self, that there were moments when I, quite literally, couldn't breathe. It's very well written, and the story flows from one chapter to the next, Danny being a reliable and wonderful narrator. (And the audiobook? I hear Tom Hanks is FANTASTIC). Every character was dynamic and compelling in their own way, even The Dutch House itself, deserving of as much attention as any other character due to all the power it exerts over each one of them.This book is also delightful, but not too sappy. A family saga of sorts, it moves through the decades from Danny's point of view, as he tells the story of his life and the house that represented so much to so many.

I would not have read it otherwise based on mixed reviews and the cover. After listening, I completely understand the cover and it is the perfect cover. I listened to the Audible version narrated by Tom Hanks who does a masterful and memorable job.If you appreciate literature and have enjoyed books read in literature classes, then I strongly suggest The Dutch House. The house is truly central to the story, and in my opinion, the main character. All of the relationships in the story are viewed through/impacted by the Dutch House. All of the characters are flawed. Each character has aspects I connected with and others that rubbed me wrong. Though it appears Danny is the story teller (and he is not the most observant character), Maeve and the Dutch House permeate every aspect. The Dutch House must be mentioned well over a hundred times, but the time I found most impressive was during The Nutcracker. That scene was absolutely brilliantly written.I loved Danny’s relationship with his father. His father reminded me so very much of my grandfather. Danny wants nothing more than to walk in his father’s footsteps, and he even repeats the same major mistake that his father made. Maeve was the most memorable character for me, but then there’s Fluffy! WOW! The many layers of Fluffy! Who would have thought! Loved the development of this character. No spoilers. Just words. Chemistry. Frozen vegetables. The train. The Painting. The car. Cigarettes. What a powerful story of loss and redemption. Everything comes full circle. Everything was resolved. An impressive literary masterpiece."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,Rating 4 out of 5,"A good writer doesn't need explosions or stabbings or scary monsters to tell a story. A good writer can take a poor family and an old mansion and make a mesmerizing tale of love and loss, of misunderstanding, of struggle and gain, of searching and finding. A good writer can create the family and the mansion and put them together and see what happens. A good writer can take simple things and make a story of great complexity and emotion. Ann Patchett is a good writer. The Dutch House is the story of the Conroy family and their relationships over time with each other and with the mansion, the Dutch House. People do as people do. People give others surprises and the surprises are not what the others want. People leave and offer no explanations for their disappearances. People meet and come together for what appears to be random and unexplainable reasons. In short, The Dutch House is the story of the lives of a few people, unremarkable lives, perhaps, but also lives of depth and fascination. (Oh, and the fact that I listened to this story as an audiobook read by the great Tom Hanks did nothing but add bonus points to my rating of the novel.)I was entranced by this story of a boy and his sister, abandoned by their mother, orphaned by the loss of their father, put out in the world, with the strength of having each other to rely on, with the eventual and inevitable weakness of having only each other to rely on."

Rather I was hooked right from the start. Ann Patchett's writing was brilliant. She brought to life a version of a Hansel and Gretel with a modern day approach. It was centered around the themes of a loveless childhood, banishment and a very controlling, plotting and cruel step-mother in a most believable way. The Dutch House was about a special bond between siblings, a sister and a brother, the house, the Dutch House, where they grew up and the effects their pasts had on their present day lives. I was able to listen to The Dutch House on Audio CD read by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks' narration really put it over the top for me. This was definitely my most favorite book by Ann Patchett.Danny and Maeve's father surprised his wife and mother of his children, Elna, with a gift one day. After taking a long drive, the family arrived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at a very unique house. As they pulled up to the house, Cyril (Danny and Maeve's father) told their mother that he had bought The Dutch House for her. When they entered the house Elna's reaction was not exactly what Cyril expected. To Elna, The Dutch House was more of a museum with all its ornate furnishings than a home. Elna never felt comfortable within the walls of the Dutch House. The only room that she felt at ease in was the kitchen. Beside the ""stuffy, ornate furnishings"" Elna was gifted household help. These women became her allies and confidants and for Danny and Maeve they became their ""fairy godmothers"". Cyril was not a warm, loving, fuzzy father. He was strict, successful, and hard-working but lacked the ability to show his love to his own children. Elna had always had the calling of being a nun or helping those in less fortunate circumstances. Living at the Dutch House began to put pressure and discontentment at the forefront of Elna's life. Although she loved her children, this discontentment was too strong for her to ignore. Not long after moving into the Dutch House, Danny and Maeve's mother abandoned them. The two siblings forged a very special bond with each other. Maeve almost took on the role of mother to Danny. Danny relied on his sister completely. Their father retreated into himself even more after their mother's disappearance. Sandy and Jocelyn, the housekeepers, become more involved in Danny and Maeve's day to day lives. Then the very unexpected happened. Cyril brought Andrea home to the Dutch House. From the very beginning Maeve and Danny do not like Andrea but their father seemed to have fallen for her and went along with all her conniving ways. Andrea brought her two daughters to the Dutch House to live with them when Cyril and Andrea got married. The first thing Andrea contrived was to take Maeve's room away from her and give it to one her daughters. Maeve was banished to the attic. Cyril allowed this to happen. Andrea's worst acts were only about to take shape. Neither Maeve nor Danny could have seen these things coming. Andrea was the all encompassing stereotype of the evil step-mother.The Dutch House by Ann Patchett moved me greatly. I was absorbed from the first page and did not want it to end. It was and remains rare to witness a bond so strong between siblings. It was beautiful and yet some may have felt that it was not natural. The house, the Dutch House, held that bond together at its core and would not let go. Even when Danny and Maeve no longer lived there a magnetism from the house pulled at them and brought brother and sister back to it. The Dutch House was told through the voice and memories of Danny. It took place right after World War II and spanned over five decades. The one constant throughout the book was the love that Danny and Maeve shared for one another. I loved the ending. All good things come full circle. I highly recommend The Dutch House by Ann Patchett for all those who have not read it yet.I received a complimentary copy of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett from Harper Collins Publishers through Netgalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own. Thank you Netgalley, Ann Patchett and Harpers Collins Publishers for this opportunity to read The Dutch House."
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109502514-bookmonkey,Rating 3 out of 5,"Rating: 2.75🍌Like the majority of contemporary American literary fiction, you can be pretty confident that you know what you're getting into with an Ann Patchett novel: polished if unassuming prose, an immersive character-driven narrative, and a plot arc punctuated by poignant moments that resolve into an equally poignant conclusion. These traits are largely on display again here in THE DUTCH HOUSE, a Pulitzer Prize finalist that traces the dissolution of the Conroy family vis a vis the eponymous home they once lived in. Cyril Conroy is a self-made real estate baron who, shortly after WWII, purchases a Pennsylvania mansion known as the Dutch House as a gift for his wife, Elna. When the novel opens, though, Elna is out of the picture -- the mystery of why she left the family is not immediately revealed -- and we learn that Cyril is now a single father who largely leaves the raising of his children, Maeve and her younger brother Danny, to his servants.The novel is told through the retrospective perspective of Danny, who grows up in the shadow of his mother's absence and the larger crisis that occurs when his father marries Andrea, a young mother of two with an unhealthy obsession with the Dutch House itself. We follow Danny as he goes away to boarding school, attends Columbia for university and med school, gets married to Celeste and has kids while embarking on his own real estate business. The story of Danny's life events is not especially compelling -- he’s another self-absorbed white guy capitalist -- but Patchett employs an interesting chronological structure to texture it just enough to keep you going. What really drives the book is Danny's relationship with Maeve, who took on a maternal role for her younger brother after their mother left; the relationship between the siblings is largely forged through the crucible of their memories/relationship to their parents and the house in which they grew up. Indeed, their touching and well-wrought relationship was the only thing that kept me reading to the end of the book, which loses steam and direction after a very engaging first third. The major problem with THE DUTCH HOUSE is the lack of texture and dimension to the characters and their relationships. Andrea, the stepmother, is an over-the-top witch without a shred of empathy; Celeste and Maeve hate each other for absurd reasons; the father -- a war veteran and real estate mogul -- is an irredeemable wimp who refuses to stand up for his children; the oft-repeated explanation for Elna abandoning the family is unbelievable. Even Maeve and Danny's relationship, by far the strongest element of the book, begins to feel a bit flat and repetitive by the end of it. Because Ann Patchett is an accomplished writer, I tried to convince myself that this was on purpose, perhaps as part of an intended fairy tale structure -- the enchanted house in the woods, the wicked stepmother, and, if that wasn't clear enough, at one point Celeste even complains to Danny that he and Maeve are ""like Hansel and Gretel"" -- but if this was the intention it requires too much generosity from at least this reader to work. Yet Patchett manages to pull it together enough to deliver an ending that evokes genuine emotion, tying the characters and plot threads from throughout the novel into a (perhaps too) tidy conclusion. I’m just not sure whether it’s worth reading 350+ pages to get there."

Accanto alla casa olandese vi è una protagonista femminile, Maeve Conroy, il cui destino è indissolubilmente legato a quella casa in cui la sua famiglia si trasferì quando suo padre Cyril improvvisamente divenne ricco grazie a giusti investimenti immobiliari: la casa olandese ha visto, impassibile e fredda nella sua eleganza e sfarzosità, il disfarsi di una famiglia, devastata dalla fuga della madre di Maeve e di Danny, il narratore, il fratello minore legato ossessivamente alla sorella. Quanto accaduto all’interno di quelle mura superbe e bellissime ha segnato l’esistenza dei protagonisti del romanzo, che per questo motivo ne sono rimasti avvinti come da un incantesimo, tanto che, per anni, dopo che da quella casa sono stati cacciati via, i due fratelli torneranno abitualmente a sostare, nascosti all’interno della loro macchina, di fronte alla maestosa costruzione, per spiarne le luci e le ombre, per ricordare un’infanzia triste e dolorosa, per non dimenticare l’abbandono, ma anche per consolarsi del dolore patito insieme abbandonando il passato per tuffarsi in un futuro che sempre ha le sue radici in esso.Un romanzo particolare, sia nella scrittura, con continui salti temporali, che nella narrazione, asciutta, che non cade mai nel sentimentalismo tanto da far pensare a una freddezza di fondo dei personaggi, che vivono emozioni profonde senza che la scrittrice calchi la mano. A volte mi ha lasciato sconcertata, però la lettura è risultata nel complesso piacevole e coinvolgente."
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74844479-wyndy,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars.‘The Dutch House’ is my sixth novel by Ann Patchett and frankly one of my least favorites. This book started out so strong with Maeve Conroy and younger brother Danny soldiering through the desertion of their mother Elna, the aloofness of their father Cyril, and the life-changing second marriage of their father to a truly sinister woman named Andrea who adds her two young daughters to the mix. I enjoyed the stories about the history of the Dutch House and its former owners, and the early days of Maeve and Danny’s parents’ relationship, and Cyril Conroy’s rise to success in real estate, stories mostly shared by “the help” at the Dutch House - Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy. These loyal, hard-working women were the threads that bound all the characters in this book together. What I did not like: The changes in timeline within the chapters was confusing and eventually annoying. The “stalking” of the Dutch House by Maeve and Danny for years and years became tiresome. The waste of such huge sums of money on Danny’s education was unconscionable (yes, I understand why, but still . . .). And Part Three was unrealistic and almost Hallmark-hokey for me. But then again, I’m a pretty unsentimental person. I will continue to read anything Ann Patchett writes because she is an outstanding author. I just didn’t love this particular novel like most readers did.“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”~ Danny Conroy"

Aquele tipo de história simples, sobre relações (neste caso, entre dois irmãos) que costumo adorar 🙌🏼---------------------Demorei um pouco a publicar opinião sobre este livro, porque senti necessidade de refletir sobre ele e de o absorver completamente... Gostei tanto de o ler que está, sem dúvida, entre os melhores do ano!! 😍Danny (o narrador) e Maeve são dois irmãos que vivem numa deslumbrante casa que, outrora, pertenceu a uma família holandesa (daí o título). A casa tem uma presença muito forte, ao longo de todo o livro, e mesmo quando os irmão são expulsos pela madrasta, continua a ter um simbolismo e um papel relevante nas suas vidas.É daqueles livros em que a história não parece ter nada de extraordinário, mas é tão envolvente que é impossível não nos rendermos. Adorei a relação e as dinâmicas familiares (mais do que das personagens em si) e acho que é esta a grande essência da história. A escrita também é maravilhosa. Já tinha lido outro livro da autora, ""Comunidade"", que provocou em mim o mesmo efeito magnético e, definitivamente, Ann Patchett entrou para a lista de autores de quem quero ler tudooo. Vale mesmo a pena! 🥰"

Well yes, me too. A bit realistic fairy-tale (the wicked stepmother, Hansel & Gretel), where this scores is in the characterisation, especially of Maeve, part sister, part maternal figure to the narrator. I'd say this will appeal to readers wanting a traditional family story. For me, I found it frustrating that no-one could get beyond the past with this constant circling back to what has gone before. The writing is unobtrusive, plain and simple prose, nothing inventive. An undemanding read but with a tangible sense of warmth and love between the brother and sister protagonists."
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie,Rating 4 out of 5,I really loved this book. This is the first book that I've read by Ann Patchett and I can't wait to try something else. I loved her writing and her characters. I was able to be absorbed by the story and was engaged the entire time. This book really made me think about kindness and forgiveness. There were a couple of characters that I honestly felt were incredibly selfish and some of the other characters were very forgiving of and caring towards them. I'm not sure how I would have responded to them if they were in my life. I listened to the audio narrated by Tom Hanks and he was excellent. I felt he was the perfect choice to represent our MC. 4.5★

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36193941-tanzila-tabassum-zisha-annabel-lee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nominee for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. This is a complex and impressive family drama/ historical fiction revolving around The Dutch House. The house that becomes a character itself, that decides the actions of the characters throughout their lives as they find themselves coming back to its doorsteps again and again. Prepare to feel yourself crushed under nostalgia and melancholy when you read this. Even though the writing isn't manipulative, Danny's gloomy reminiscence is enough to cast a shadow over the reader's heart. The story is mainly focused on Maeve and Danny and their sibling relationship - the bond that sprouts from sharing a mother that abandoned them and a distant, lonely father. The bond that goes through the fire of being evicted from their own inheritance, and strengthens. It's about an evil stepmother straight out of the pages of a fairy-tale. All basic elements, twisted in their heads just a little. It follows the sublings, Danny and Maeve, throughout their lives as they keep going back to the house, park in the street in front of it, and think back on various incidents in their lives. Intermittently, we see those incidents playing out in flashback.At one point, they realize how they wasted all those times sitting outside the house, holding onto the hatred for a life that would never be theirs again. 
“Just imagine if she’d come to get the paper sooner,” she said. “Say, twenty years ago.” “We could have had our lives back.” 
Sometimes forgiveness is unbearable. Especially when one finds themselves wronged by someone who is family. Maeve finds herself unable to forgive her stepmother, just as Danny can't accept their own mother's return, each getting resentful of the other's intolerance. Something I found interesting is that all of the characters - however benevolent or compassionate - had a streak of cruelty to them, and for good reasons. There was no character that could be purely blamed as a villain. I liked the first portion of the book better. I loved their formative years and sibling interactions. After they got older and especially after their mother came back  I started feeling disconnected from the story and the characters apart from Maeve. To be honest, I just didn't want to continue reading after  Maeve died. That was where the book ended for me. Maeve was indisputably my favorite in the whole set of nuanced, realistic characters. Her wasted brilliance, her sisterly affection, kindness, anger - all of it cemented her place in my heart as one of my most cherished female characters.Throughout the book, we see many times references to Maeve's red coat. Though I was sure she didn't wear the same coat all her life, it felt odd that she'd always wear red. And then after reading the part where she was recounting the days when her painting was being done, I saw the connection - that it was because Simon told her to. This was such a nice little touch. A lot can be said about this book. It's really what you'd call a multifaceted story. Each of the characters had their own reasons to act in a certain way, maybe that way was a mistake, but who doesn't make mistakes? Reading this book made me feel like being wrapped in a blanket of homesickness. At some parts I just had to put down the book and drift back to my own childhood. 
“I remember at night we’d turn out the lights and bring a lamp into the bedroom closet, and push out the shoes so we could sit on the floor and read. Dad was on air raid patrol. You had to pull up your knees so you could fit and then I’d come in behind you and sit in your lap.”""We had changed at whatever point the old homestead had become the car: the Oldsmobile, the Volkswagen, the two Volvos. Our memories were stored on VanHoebeek Street, but they weren’t in the Dutch House anymore. If someone had asked me to tell them very specifically where I was from, I would have to say I was from that strip of asphalt in front of what had been the Buchsbaums’ house, which had then become the Schultzes’ house, and was now the house of people whose names I didn’t know.""“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""
On another note, I was excited to see that the audiobook narrator was Tom Hanks. But as much as I love this guy's acting I didn't love his narration."

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 5 out of 5,"The worse thing about reading a five star book is--you can only read it for the first time once. I was sad to finish this book but I have to say the last 1/4 are what sealed the deal for me. I love Patchett's books, have read them all and wait expectantly for the next. Still some reads are better than others. It is hard to put my finger on exactly why this one was a home run for me. The story is about too siblings, older sister, younger brother (he tells the story) who weather several storms together and are very close. Their mother leaves the family when the younger is 4 and the older sister is 12. Father who is building owner (rentals apt. buildings in NYC) eventually remarries and the new wife (with two young girls of her own) is less than kind to her step children. How this effects their lives going forward is the meat of the story. Patchett has written about combined families previously--most recently in Commonwealth-- and it is a theme she is drawn to in her stories. I've heard reviews saying the Dutch House is like a character in this story--I did not feel that. The house provides a context but actually I found it played less of a part than I expected. That said I did not love this book till near the end. I did listen to it on audio as I do at least half of my reading--and I must say as much as I love Tom Hanks I felt he was not the best choice for the narration. It was not his reading (in that he was exceptional) it was the fact that his voice goes with his face and the story is being told by a young boy in the early stages and knowing Hanks age and looks it really drew me away from seeing this central character in my mind. Would have loved a great reader without the baggage of being a known famous person who doesn't quite fit with the book's described narrator. That said the book felt a little whiney to me at first but these characters are so well drawn and the story while it has few revelations is so well told and has such a great ending I know I will be drawn to read it (in print form) soon again. I could gush and try to pin point why it was so good but if you love family dramas and character driven stories don't let this one pass you by. I envy you your first reading. Hope you find it as engaging as I did."

In  The Dutch House  we meet Cyril Conroy, who through the luck and some real estate knowledge came into great wealth. Through this new found wealth Cyril was able to purchase The Dutch House which was previously owned by a Dutch family who came to ruin. Cyril purchased this sprawling mansion in the countryside of Philadelphia as a surprise for his wife- this began the down fall of the Conroy family. The book is told from the perspective of Cyril's youngest son, Danny. Danny gives us an in-depth look into his relationship with his older sister Maeve and what becomes of The Dutch House and those who lived and worked in the house. A five decade long narration that will keep you utterly enthralled the entire way. The Dutch House is the grounding point of the book because this is where all the relationships, conflicts and problems arises. From the housekeeper being thrown out, to the Danny and Maeve being told to leave with just their clothes and no inheritance to speak of... but this is where the story begins. I absolutely loved this book. Ann Patchett did an amazing job of showcasing sibling relationships, mother daughter-son relationships, sainthood and forgiveness. The characters were well formed, you knew exactly who Maeve and Danny were and their character motivation. Reading this book will have you rooting for these siblings. The book goes between the present, the past and the in-between so seamlessly and this is a testimony to Patchett's writing. There is this suspense that keeps building because of the unanswered questions- but everything comes together in the most organic and beautiful way. If you love family drama this is your pick. If you are looking for a truly heart warming sibling relationship- this is it. If you are a fan of Ann Patchett- just know she delivers with The Dutch House. Highly recommend- I am still nursing my this hangover"

Then at age fifteen, after his father dies unexpectedly, his step-mother-from-hell kicks him out of the house. His older sister then fills the psychological role of mother in his life, but when the long-ago-disappeared biological mother shows up after forty years and his older sister is more interested in visiting with her than with him it is experienced as another loss. The drama of lost mothers is supplemented with the haunting memories of the big house that our protagonist was forced to leave as a fifteen-year-old. As one would expect from the book's title, the house becomes very real by the end of the book.One question I asked myself as reader was what sort of mother leaves a family of two children ages 3 and 10 with zero contact for over forty years? And when she reappears we learn that she has spent her life being a saint serving the poor. Serving the poor is an admirable then to do, but cutting off a relationship with your children to do so? The book's narrative does remind readers that throughout history there have been many men who have abandoned their children--some of whom were thought of as being great men.The portrayal of the step mother in this book must be a modern day recreation of a character from Charles Dickens. Some step-mothers are wonderful parents and love their step children, but not in this book. The older sister in this book has type 1 diabetes, and the story contains one vignette when the blood sugar is out of balance. This segment of the story can serve as an educational experience to readers like me who have limited knowledge of what diabetics have to deal with.The above mentioned items and many others are combined to provide the readers with an interesting and compelling reading experience.

I loved the characters even though I wanted to slap all of them at some point. I was worried for a good portion of the book that there wouldn't be a resolution, that it would just sort of drift into a ending, the way the lives of the main characters were currently drifting, but Patchett very skillfully steered this story into a resolution that was both unexpected and yet perfect. Also, Tom Hanks reads this audiobook. It was amazing. He was perfect for it. Warm and funny and very Tom Hanksian. He didn't do the women's voices in a high, wispy voice or anything weird or condescending, as male readers sometimes do. He read the chapter headings with various levels of exuberance which was just . . . so Tom Hanks!And listen, I want to post a bit of a spoiler, without marking the whole review as a spoiler.

This is the story of a family and a house and how the decisions taken inside that house affect all people that live there and how it keeps affecting them all thought their lives. The main characters are a pair of sister and brother. You could argue that the Dutch house is a character too because it always looms in the back permeating all of the main characters decisions. I love the normalcy of this novel after reading so many books in different genres. While this was a good novel I still don’t understand why this book had over a 100 holds in the library I work at.

These people weren't as fully fleshed out or as original as others. The beginning was strong, and it held my rapt attention up to a certain point, but by the end I was struggling. Still, liked but didn't love."

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,Rating 4 out of 5,"Overall: A beautifully written novel about an unconventional family with strong characters. Themes of forgiveness, compassion, and family are strong throughout and this is a difficult novel to put down. 7/10Summary: The Dutch House is the story of two siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy and their lives over several decades. The two are inseparable, bonded very tightly after their mother leaves home when they're very you. The Dutch House is their home, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia that their father, Cyril, a real estate mogul, bought fully furnished in an estate sale as a surprise for his wife. His wife hates everything about the house and flees to India to dedicate her life to the poor. Cyril remarries and there is a strained relationship between the stepmother and Maeve and Danny. The story follows their lives for over fifty years.The Good: I listened to this book as narrated by Tom Hanks and it was amazing. Probably the best audiobook I have listened to and he was the perfect voice for Danny's character. This novel reads almost like a modern day fairytale; it reminded me a lot of Hansel and Gretel. The characters are very well developed with lots of unique personality and the writing is wonderful throughout. Some suspense and sharp turns along the way and I had a hard time putting this one down.The Bad: There was a plot throughout but at the end I found myself wishing for more. I thought there would be a twist, some major surprise, or just a bit more plot so felt slightly let down when I finished. And though I felt like I got to know all the characters very well, I did not particularly love any of them.Favorite Quotes: ""Do you think it's possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.” “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” "
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160592927-kristi-c,Rating 5 out of 5,"I rounded Dutch House up to 5 stars based on Tom Hanks narrating the audiobook. He is an amazing storyteller whose voice seems like home, so the story seemed more enjoyable. Excellent choice for the narrator! I probably would have rated the story itself a 4 or so had I been reading the book.This was my newest randomly chosen audiobook (thanks #27 💕) for my dog walking and ironing. I normally miss turning pages in a book, and while I obviously cannot do that while walking, this time I was happier listening to the book and would recommend the audiobook.It was a bit slow at first, and often wondered where the story was going, but by the time I was further in, I didn’t care where it was going. I just enjoyed the storytelling and was connected to the characters. My heart broke for certain characters. It was a good read if you enjoy family dramas."

Anna Gralak) to miejscami wzruszająca, chwilami brutalna bajka, wspaniała opowieść i doskonała lektura.""Wszyscy w Elkins Park wiedzieli, co się dzieje w Domu Holendrów"", pisze Danny, narrator nowej powieści Ann Patchett. Znajdujący się na przedmieściach Filadelfii, Elkins Park na początku XX wieku stał się popularną miejscówką wśród biznesowej elity stolicy Pennsylwanii. Olbrzymie domy, jak neoklascysyyczny Lynnewood Hall z ponad setką pokoi robią wrażenie, choć też dają do myślenia o tym, jak kształtowały się gusta amerykańskiej klasy wyższej. Bardzo ważna dla nich było znalezienie swojego miejsca na ziemii, które będzie odwoływało się do ""wielkiej"" historii, stąd zamiłowanie do klasycyzujący form ale też nawiązań do stylu Tudorów, czy holenderskiego stylu kolonialnego, ale też pokazujące, że świat się zmienił, przez co domy te często pełne były najnowocześniejszych sprzętów i rozwiązań.Dom Holendrów zawdzięczał swoją nazwę jednak właścicielom, “Holendrom z niemożliwym do wymówienia nazwiskiem”. Ukończono go w 1922 roku. Siedem lat później ""bankierzy zaczęli wyskakiwać przez okno"".Tuż po II wojnie światowej posiadłość pełną stylizowanych na flamandzkie portretów rodziny VanHoebeeków kupuje Cyril Conroy, potentat na rynku nieruchomości, człowiek o niezbyt rozbuchanej emocjonalności. Jego pasji do Domu nie podziela Elna, żona Cyrila. Dwójka dzieci, Maeve i młodszy od niej o siedem lat Danny, choć wychowani w tej zaskakującej posiadłości, też mają do niej stosunek dość krytyczny, zwłaszcza, że nie mogą przyjmować szkolnych przyjaciół. Co nie znaczy, że nie jest to ich dom, centrum świata, axis mundi.To mógłby być bardzo przewidywalny dramat rodzinny, może z jakimś rozwodem w środku, zabraniem dzieci od ojca, tułaczką po mniej okazałych rezydencjach, dramatem zdradzonej żony, dzieci wychowywanych bez ojca, ale nie jest. To Elna zostawi rodzinę, dzieci i postanowi wyruszyć w świat. Przez długi czas osoby czytające książkę Patchett nie będą wiedzieć ani gdzie się podziała, ani jakie były przyczyny porzucenia przez nią rodzinnego chłodku. Matka marnotrawna, której odruchowo zaczynamy kibicować.Po kilku latach do Domu Holendrów i życia Cyrila wprowadza się Andrea z dwójką swoich dzieci. Maeva i Danny muszą zająć się sobą, a raczej to Maeva musi zastąpić matkę Danny'emu. Dorastają, idą na studia, ojciec umiera, a Andrea przejmuje władzę absolutną nad rodzinną rezydencją. “Każda oglądana z dystansu konfiguracja luksusu wydawała mi się oknem z widokiem na moje dzieciństwo” pisze Danny oglądając “Dziadka do orzechów” w jednej z najlepszych scen tej książki.Zachwycające jest to jak Pattchett opowiada historię Conroyów i ""Domu Holendrów"", nie spiesząc się, powoli buduje napięcie, szczegółowo opisując relacje między bohaterami, pokazując ich emocje i dojrzewanie. Grają tu zarówno oczywiste symbole jak portrety holenderskiej rodziny wiszące na ścianach, czy “W kleszczach lęku” Henry’ego Jamesa (w przekładzie Jacka Dehnela, “Dokręcanie śruby”) czytane przez Maeve, która była miłośniczką angielskiego pisarza.Patchett umiejętnie buduje portrety postaci drugoplanowych, wprowadza je w doskonale wybranych momentach, a to jak precyzyjnie komponuje książkę przypomina dzieła Fitzgeralda. Nie da się pewnych skojarzeń też uniknąć, bo zarówno autor ""Wielkiego Gatsby'ego"" jak i amerykańska pisarka piszą o kryzysach etyki w zamożnej, nowej klasie mieszczańskiej. Patchett również niezwykle inteligentnie nawiązuje do amerykańskiej i brytyjskiej prozy opowiadającej o dzieciństwie, ale mit, który buduje nie jest tkliwy, nostalgiczny. Nie przypomina “Małej księżniczki”, a raczej historię znaną z “O czym wiedziała Maisie” Jamesa, powieści może niezbyt udanej ale będącej dla pisarza ćwiczeniem w pisaniu z dziecięcej perspektywy.To proza konkretna, twardo stąpająca po ziemi. Nie ma u Patchett tandeciarstwa emocjonalnego, nikt nam nie karze rozpaczać nad upadkiem domu bogatych białych ludzi, nie prosi o litość, a pokazuje mechanizmy które za tym stoją. Jest tylko jeden irytujący swoim banałem moment - gdy Andrea po śmierci męża i ojca dwójki głównych bohaterów przejmuje dom i finanse Conroyów, okazuje się, że dla Danny’ego przeznaczony jest fundusz na studia, którego Andrea nie może ruszyć. Patchett nie pozwala swoim bohaterom upaść zbyt nisko w hierarchii społecznej. Samo rozwiązanie narracyjnie jest dość prostackie, ale jakoś to trzeba było wyjaśnić.Patchett opisuje życie ludzi bez zbędnych emocji, na spokojnie, powoli budując dramat. Jest to powieść, która przywodzi na myśl holenderskiego malarstwo, bo z precyzją, światłem jak u flamandzkich mistrzów, którzy lekkie sceny rodzajowe przerabiali na wielkie symboliczne opowieści. Elkins Park wkracza do literatury i zapewne stanie się celem wycieczek fanów i fanek “Domu Holendrów”. Patchett zaś pokazuje się nam jako współczesna klasyczka, doskonale łącząca tradycyjną powieść, przewrotną bajkę z nowoczesną narracją, która pozwala bohaterom, a zwłaszcza bohaterkom robić rzeczy, których do tej pory nie mogli robić.Bardzo podoba mi się fakt, że wydawca nie poszedł po taniości i książkę wydaje w twardej oprawie, większym formacie i dobranej kolorystycznie kapitałce, bo to jest książka, którą warto traktować trochę lepiej. Polecam Państwu."
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33448518-kansas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Esta novela está contada a la manera de los cuentos de hadas y que a su vez gira en torno a una mansión, fastuosa, colorida y casi encantada, una casa que es habitada por los Conroy, la familia que la ocupa cuando empieza la novela, aunque la novela parece que empieza de cero una y otra vez. La Casa Holandesa es una mansión construida en 1922 por una antigua y rica familia holandesa que cuando cae en desgracia y se arruina, es comprada con todo lo que hay dentro por Cyril Conroy como sorpresa para su esposa. Los Conroy habían sido pobres hasta que Cyril empezó a hacer dinero con la compraventa de edificios, así que la casa es una especie de simbolo de estos nuevos tiempos de riqueza para él. Sin embargo, su mujer, Elna, con una mentalidad completamente diferente, no es capaz de acostumbrarse a esta nueva riqueza, a esta casa que la supera estéticamente y no puede entender que con tanta pobreza haya gente capaz de vivir en un lugar tan ostentoso, así que muy pronto abandona a su marido y sus dos hijos pequeños, Maeve y Danny dejándoles en la casa holandesa.""Cuando se presentaron en la Casa Holandesa aquel primer dia, se creían gente pobre. Ella lo obligó a contarle como había conseguido el dinero. Lo obligó, de verdad. Estaba convencida de que había hecho algo ilegal. En esa época nadie tenía esa cantidad de dinero"".Este impactante abandono de Elna a su familia, es lo que marca el resto de la novela. Los niños crecen en un principio en un ambiente cálido pero la ausencia de su madre les marcará ya definitivamente porque una especie de misterio o interrogación define sus vidas...¿porqué si eran una familia feliz, su madre los abandona??? La figura de Elna, ausente durante casi toda la novela, es también al mismo tiempo un personaje siempre presente, nada invisible, porque continuamente se la está nombrando. La novela está contada desde el punto de vista de Danny, el hijo menor, testigo de todo lo que ocurre en la casa, sin embargo el personaje que en mi opinión marca toda la novela, el personaje guia es Maeve, la hermana mayor, que inmediatamente después de la marcha de la madre, se convierte en la madre de su hermano cuando es casi una niña todavia. Maeve es luminosa, responsable, como un faro guía que marcará para siempre la vida de Danny. ""Se lo debí decir a tu padre como cien veces; que Maeve se corte el pelo. Pero no me hacía caso. Le daba igual. Yo siempre he querido que lo supieras, por tu propio bien. Llevas un pelo espantoso. Él no me lo permitió nunca. Siempre decía que era tu pelo, y punto"".Pasado, presente y futuro se yuxtaponen una y otra vez bajo la visión de Danny de los acontecimientos de su vida, que como he dicho antes, es contada como un cuento: los niños huérfanos de madre, la madrastra mala malísima, los niños desterrados..., un sinfín de acontecimientos siempre contados con esa elegancia nada dramática ni sentimentaloide de Ann Patchett. Es una novela espectacular en ese sentido porque el lector se ve inmerso en una historia perfectamente organizada, e incluso los momentos más devastadores son los más luminosos, dónde la presencia de Maeve es un pilar majestuoso. Admito que es un personaje femenino que me ha impactado y maravillado. La Casa Holandesa es un edificio que ha significado diferentes etapas en las vidas de quienes la han habitado pero a los niños Conroy los ha marcado obsesivamente y hay maravillosos momentos en torno a la casa evocados por los hermanos una vez que no viven en ella, porque no pueden olvidarla en el sentido de que los momentos más tristes y más felices de su infancia se encuentran enquistados en la memoria de Danny y Maeve a través de esa casa. ""Si alguien me hubiera preguntado antes de aquella cita cuáles eran mis sentimientos al respecto de mi madre, le habría jurado que ninguno en especial. Me costaba entender la enormidad de mi ira"".Me encanta Ann Patchett; es una escritora cuya escritura fluye casi sin esfuerzo para el lector, tan sútil y etérea en lo que cuenta, hace fácil lo más complejo.Y qué bien habla de los lazos emocionales, de los traumas de infancia y de como superar esas marcas del pasado. Me ha recordado mucho a El jilguero de Donna Tartt, porque toca todos estos temas y porque son dos novelas que me han emocionado muchísimo.""Yo, sin embargo, no podía dejar de pensar en el retrato al óleo de Maeve, colgado en el salón, sin que ninguno de los dos viviéramos en aquella casa. Maeve aparecía en el cuadro con diez años de edad y abrigo rojo, una mirada directa e inteligente y la negra melena suelta""."

Although the story is character driven, something which I usually love, and although Ann Patchett writes beautifully, I kept hoping and waiting for a strong ending. There was none. A few loose ends were tied up, but that’s it. While reading this, I imagined the home to look something like this. "
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95957485-ekta,Rating 3 out of 5,"You know the kind of books that you read as a young, excited over enthusiastic reader?. when books were devoured with a frenzy that is totally true of that age! Well, The Dutch house is definitely a reminder to me of those kind of books! The kind of book, that, as an 18 year old, I would have probably given five stars..It checks all the boxes you see. Family drama with high octane emotions spilled all across the pages. Extremely likeable characters who have strong filial ties, and a sad poignant ending that as a kid I would have bawled my eyes over. Well then what’s the problem you ask?The problem simply is that I’m no longer 18! At a time when my understanding of emotions has catapulted from the highest gamut to the lowest abyss, I look at relationships a bit differently! With the cynical side eye of maturity behind me, I don’t feel as easily moved at 29..The Dutch house has a Hansel and Gretel vibe to it, with an overprotective older sister, an adoring younger brother, an evil step mother and a helpless rather pathetic sorry excuse of a father. The evil step mother wants all the money, and The fantastic mystical palace (in this case The Dutch house), but she wants nothing to do with the by products of her husbands first marriage. Sounds familiar doesn’t it? That’s because it really is! An ode to the fairy tales we listened to as kids, with unwavering attention, wrapped in a cozy quilt, secure in the knowledge that none of the vile could possibly touch us, that we are loved, wanted and safe.The Dutch house is a breezy invite into those cozy nights of your past. Fantastical yes. Memorable? I doubt it!"
265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54033599-will,Rating 5 out of 5,"Within an hour of finishing The Dutch House I received the NYT Book Review with a front cover review of the book. Perfect timing and an excellent assessment of the novel. However, as I was putting my thoughts together here, I worried about appropriating ideas from that review (since I agreed overall and it was so fresh in my mind). Therefore, I’ll stick to the basics.I’ve been reading Ann Patchett for many years, going back to her debut novel The Patron Saint of Liars, which I received as a gift (a thoughtful one indeed). She immediately became an author to watch and after these many years has always been a pleasure to read. I have rarely been disappointed and certainly not with this new one. Patchett is not unlike many of her contemporaries (McDermott, Strout, Kingsolver, etc.) in that she isn’t a ‘flashy’ writer. Her writing feels effortless, honest, grounded; lovely, solid prose that lures the reader in with story and believable characters. Characters are, in fact, her real strength - three dimensional, rarely stereotypes. She makes you care about her protagonists and this new novel is no exception with its depiction of the bond between a brother and sister from childhood to middle age. I could quibble over a plot turn in the later part of the novel, but, again, it was such a pleasure to read that it didn't alter the overall experience for me. Might I add - a beautiful jacket cover."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76100631-holly-r-w,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Dutch House"" is a wonderful book. At the heart of it is the relationship between an older sister and her brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. As children, their mother (Elna) left them. Maeve was 10 years old at the time. Danny was about 2 years old, so young that he could barely remember Elna as he grew older. For all intents and purposes, Maeve became both a sister and a mother to Danny. Their father, Cyril Conroy, was a self-made business man, who became wealthy through real estate. Buying, selling and rehabbing buildings excited him. In a romantic gesture, he bought an elegant mansion for his young wife Elna. The house had belonged to a wealthy Dutch family. Unfortunately, the modest Elna hated the house on sight, thinking it to be too lavish. She was more comfortable helping the nuns run a food pantry. Cyril could not understand Elna's distaste for the house. Throughout the book, the house takes on various meanings for all of the characters. It plays a major role in the story. As the story unfolds, we watch Maeve and Danny grow up. Maeve chooses not to marry and Danny becomes a husband and father. There is tension between Maeve and Danny's wife, Celeste. I will stop explaining the plot further. I loved how the author gave us such rich characters to think about in a story that is so engrossing. I appreciated how seamlessly she told the story. Her writing flowed so naturally. This is one of my favorite books read this year."
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3574699-jennifer-lane,Rating 5 out of 5,"Touching Family DramaI love stories that dive deep into family function and dysfunction, and this novel is one of the best. The narration by Tom Hanks adds humor and depth to the sibling story.Danny grew up without a mother, but his older sister, Maeve, filled that role beautifully. Maeve is one of my favorite characters: strong, sarcastic, sacrificial, smart--just so real. Many of the characters, including the house, feature layers of emotional wounds and believable motivations. It may seem appalling for Danny to endure the difficulty of medical school, then choose a different career path, but the author's nuanced explanation makes that choice seem like the only one that makes sense. Danny and Maeve are such lovable, accessible heroes that it's a pleasure to observe their journeys through life.However, I do not accept the choices made by Danny's mother and stepmother. I don't have children, but I can't imagine leaving your children in order to care for the masses. How about trying harder to resolve a disagreement with your husband before abandoning your family? There's a level of narcissism in that decision that is hard to forgive. I also want to know what motivated Andrea's cruelty. She's a wonderful villain but her backstory is lacking. I have to admit that the unsettled feelings these characters elicit are part of the charm and conflict of the story.A deeply satisfying exploration of family, love, letting go, and inviting in."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska,Rating 5 out of 5,"Does a house make a home? I think when you're a child, it most certainly represents ""home"" and that is what the Dutch House was to Maeve and Danny Conroy. It was a beautiful house - more than a house, it was a mansion outside of Philadelphia, a very special place indeed. And then, like getting a rug pulled from beneath their feet, it was taken away from them. It was unimaginable to them how suddenly everything changed.My family did not live in a mansion by any stretch of the imagination. It was a 1400 sq ft house in a suburb of Los Angeles. But it was home and we loved that house. We didn't talk about it the way Maeve and Danny did, but throughout our adult years there were references to the house at 708. And so, on one level - the love of how a house represented love and home - I could relate to them. The story of their lives is told through reminiscence and sharing of memories. As in any family, some stories are known by one member and not by another. This is told in the first person by Danny. We know what he experienced first hand and what he is told. The story is not chronological by any means. Sometimes the time shift isn't obvious and I would go back and read a couple of sentences for it to make sense. In another author's hands, this might not work, but Patchett handles it beautifully. I loved this book from the first pages. The story never flagged, the narrative never weakened. How could I not give it 5-stars?"

I often have eyes pointed somewhere but my head is only seeing the thoughts churning behind my eyeballs. Thus it was that I listened to this audio book thinking how much the narrator sounded like Tom Hanks, only to discover at the end that it was, indeed, him. Forehead slap. His narration was like listening to someone reading a script, complete with all the changes of intonation, pace and volume that adds an enjoyable dimension to the experience. I suppose it doesn't hurt that I like Tom Hanks. I can say he read me to sleep now. Well, maybe that's a stretch. :)I enjoy novels that focus on all the messiness of human relationships, especially family ones, and this story was all about that. Yes, it's been done lots of times and ways, but I still found this an interesting read, with characters who struggle to understand and free themselves from early influences--made more difficult when critical information is missing or distorted. A novel where each main character pursues his/her own needs to the detriment of others, it raises questions about how to balance our needs with the needs of others, and how additional maturation and understanding can change how something affects you.Overall an enjoyable book, just not a great one, in terms of what catches my fancy."

This latest novel seemed shorter than usual, but did not lack for interesting characters and situations.The protagonist and narrator is Danny, who is recounting his difficult and unusual childhood, including his intensely close relationship with his sister, Maeve. With a distant father and an absent mother, the two of them have always looked out for one another. This is the story of their relationship first, and also the way each of them view and cope with the past. The Dutch House is the eccentric mansion that still symbolizes their childhood to both of them, but it is a place they cannot go home to. It's complicated--I'd recommend not reading too much about this book before starting it.I enjoyed this very much, and would recommend it! The one topic I'd like to discuss: Elna! Danny is very angry with her, while Maeve is over the moon to have her back--only to be left again. If Andrea is supposed to be the evil stepmother, I do not think she has a foil; Elna abandoned her children. Also, could Andrea have legally kicked a minor out of his home? And I'm curious about how poor Bright and Norma got on.Later note: I recently read Patron Saint of Liars, and--Rose reminded me somewhat of Elna. Two women who married too young?"

I'm shocked by my reaction to The Dutch House because I've read Patchett's novels (Bel Canto is a favorite) and much of her nonfiction, and I greatly admire her as a writer, and maybe I'm missing something here, but this novel that I was fully expecting to love, I don't. I found it only partially interesting and rarely compelling, and it missed for me at both the story and sentence levels. Family angst, yes, but everything felt at a remove. Why was Andrea as she was? Why the great animosity between Maeve and Celeste when they started out liking each other? Why was Cyril so bland? And the Dutch House itself, yes, it figures, but not in a way that made me care about it even an iota. The structure was somewhat interesting, as were two points made very late in the book and touched on only briefly: the truth that men are often congratulated for leaving their families while women are not, and the notion that families of saints don't particularly like their sainted family members. I'm very sad that The Dutch House left me mostly cold."

Bel Canto and State of Wonder are two of my top reads ever. And The Dutch House didn't disappoint. The relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny is so intense and intertwined. They're quirky and funny and good for each other and not (reminiscent of many Anne Tyler characters). It's an amazing thing for a writer to create a relationship so believable in the context of the novel yet so unlike anyone the reader personally knows. Maeve nor Danny are perfectly flawed, and they know it. They're trying so hard to make things okay for each other that they make gigantic mistakes during the course of their 50+ years together. The book slowed down during the last 70 pages (is it okay to admit I skimmed those?), but overall, it's a lovely read. We are so lucky to have Patchett among us."

The other brooding presence throughout is the Dutch House. Built in 1922, in Philadelphia, the imposing, three story glass building is the home that represents the dreams and conscience of the Conroy family.Family dynamics, the stresses and strains, the accusations, are what Ann Patchett writes about so expertly.The stepmother in literary history is well represented. She represents a challenge to the natural order of things that provides great stories of confrontation. Andrea, the second wife, is cast as the knowing interloper. She identifies a weak, lazy man (Cyril) and has no qualms about directly asserting primacy in everything that revolves around her and her children. Throw in some Machiavellian financial plotting and the reader is witness to actions of huge injustice.Do Andrea’s actions seem a bit far fetched and unbelievable? No they don’t.HighlightsPart One, which centres on Andrea, is an absolute master class in writing about vitriol, and the consequences of the pathetic non actions, and lack of assertiveness, by a father and husband as he flees to the safety of his workplace and abrogates his responsibilities in the domestic home.Maeve, who is fifteen years old at the start of the book, was my favourite character. The dynamic between her and Andrea is magnificently described.Maeve doesn’t scream and shout. Her cool, composed response to flagrant injustice is fabulous: her room is effectively annexed“It’s just like The Little Princess. They put her in the attic and make her clean the fireplaces. She turned to Norma (the young, newly ensconced step-sister  ” no big ideas for you miss. I will not be cleaning your fireplace”  (56) “She drew herself up like Saint Joan” they’ll hate you , she said, her voice matter - of - fact. Your daughters will hate you even more than we do. They’ll hate you after we’ve forgotten who you are” (93)The second and third parts of the story, Books Two and Three, don’t quite sustain the excellence of the start. Patchett structures the book in a deliberately non linear fashion, and in Book Two the back story described by Danny (the narrator throughout) is pretty unexceptional. Danny isn’t the most interesting of the characters. The third part of the book throws in a number of twists, and risks sacrificing the mostly subtle emotions aroused by the white elephant, the Dutch House itself.LowlightsMaeve is presented as a girl, and woman with abundant skills, and compassion. The absence of a life in a wider world (she is seemingly popular, and has numerous, (unnamed) friends), seems implausible.Historical & Literary•	Sibling love: I had expected to find other books in which brother/ sister are the essential focus of a story. Ones that have no sexual element. Some stories concerning twins concentrate on the essential, central bond. That’s what exists between Danny and Maeve. Danny’s wife, Celeste resents the unique bond (though, interestingly their children, and especially May, do not).•	The House. The books opening line: “The first time our father brought Andrea to the Dutch House” evokes Daphne du Maurier’s  Rebecca  “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again”Gone with the Wind  (Margaret Mitchell) and Scarlett O’Hara’s ‘Tara’“Initially, it is a thing of pompous but shallow beauty, then a place of desolation but nevertheless still standing when the neighbouring homes are not, and finally as beautiful as ever but bereft of life and happiness” (Sound familiar?)Questions “you know Nell? She’s doing art restoration. She went to London three years ago. I don’t think she’s ever coming back”.  Not only is Professor Able a fringe character, his daughter Nell is even less featured. Why was she even mentioned?Recommend Yes, this book has some superbly crafted characters (the women especially). I’m surprised the book hasn’t been recognised in any book prize lists, as yet. I regard Ann Patchett as among my very favourite chroniclers of whole life stories."

And I've told some people that I was listening and added—pretty much always—that it seemed like cheating to have Tom Hanks narrate. We know Tom Hanks, actor, so well, don't we? We've seen him so often—once a year, maybe more—in one way or another. I'm pretty certain I've spent more time with Tom Hanks' characters than I have with members of my own family. I have watched him age, fight wars, help others, lose his way, fall in love, get sick and die. I know what his face looks like when he makes certain sounds with his voice. I know that hint of cynicism is frustration that will turn to endearment. And so, in reading THE DUTCH HOUSE which is a first person reminiscent narrator looking back at his life growing up in the eponymous house after his mother abandoned their family, sharing details of this house, and his love for his sister and his difficult father in what, throughout the novel, felt like aftermath, well, I knew him right away! I knew this Danny Conroy and so I could settle in. So is it cheating (I'm using this word very loosely and do not mean for it to imply wrong-doing by anyone involved—keep reading) to have a beloved author and actor and a much-anticipated novel come together this way? I don't know. Would less known but equally well-crafted novels benefit from having this kind of star power narrate the audiobook? I'm guessing yes. But not all books get this kind of marketing or support and so they will fall short by default. There are only so many Tom Hanks-es in the world. So, I had to put the cheating scandal aside and base this review on my listening experience. And, it was exquisite. (So, absolutely yes to the audiobook.)The novel itself, the story, was so beautifully written. I haven't read any other reviews and haven't actually heard an awful lot about this book other than general buzz about Ann Patchett's latest novel. So I don't know if Ann Patchett chose the name Conroy as an homage to Pat Conroy but listening to the sentence craft, those touches of melancholy in the language, were beautiful to me in the same way that Pat Conroy novels always touched me. I'm sure I would have gotten to THE DUTCH HOUSE in my TBR eventually but what this wonderful audiobook did is make me want to pick up the book because I want to see the words on paper and contemplate them more. Years ago I tried to read THE ENGLISH PATIENT and just could not get what was happening on the page. I loved the movie and went back to the novel with a new understanding and it opened up the book for me in a way I couldn't access before. I have a feeling listening to this audiobook first will open up the reading for me in the same way.Okay. So is that cheating? To make me fall in love like that? I don't know but it's dark now and I've just finished listening and I am on the lawn of the Dutch House. My feet are bare and I'm smoking a single cigarette, admiring my pink-painted fingernails. Beautiful people are in the glass house, holding champagne glasses, their laughter and the music and the stars are all crystals and it's clear and fragile and I'm crying a little because good fiction and a good story and a good storyteller will do that.Three years later, second reading. This time in paperback. Tom Hanks’s voice lingers but Patchett’s dignified and assured prose is the star, eclipsed only by the Dutch House itself. “My god, I love this so much.”"

Έχει ίσως το πιο όμορφο εξώφυλλο που έχω δει και κάθε φορά που το έπιανα στα χέρια μου το χάζευα και το χαιρόμουν! Τώρα όσον αφορά το περιεχόμενο, μου άρεσε αλλά το περίμενα καλύτερο είναι η αλήθεια.Οι πρωταγωνιστές του βιβλίου είναι δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, ο αδιάφορος πατέρας τους, η μητέρα τους που τους εγκατέλειψε για να φύγει στην Ινδία να βοηθήσει τους φτωχούς και το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, μια πολυτελής έπαυλη με τεράστιες τζαμαρίες στην πρόσοψη. Ναι, θα μπορούσαμε να θεωρήσουμε και το σπίτι σαν ήρωα του βιβλίου αφού παίζει κεντρικό ρόλο στην ιστορία της οικογένειας και συμβολίζει κάτι διαφορετικό για το καθένα από τα μέλη της. Για τον πατέρα είναι η απόδειξη της οικονομικής του δύναμης, για τη μητέρα είναι σύμβολο πλουτισμού για το οποίο πρέπει να ντρέπεται αφού υπάρχουν τόσοι φτωχοί άνθρωποι στον κόσμο και για τα παιδιά είναι το μέρος που μεγάλωσαν και ένα είδος πατρίδας από την οποία τα εξόρισαν.Μετά τη φυγή της μητέρας τους, ο πατέρας των παιδιών παντρεύεται μια στριμμένη γυναίκα, η οποία έρχεται να μείνει στο ολλανδέζικο σπίτι με τις δύο κόρες της. Μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα, όλη η περιουσία του περνάει στα χέρια της μητριάς και τα δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, χάνουν σχεδόν τα πάντα και εκδιώχνονται από το σπίτι. Στο εξής έχουν μόνο ο ένας τον άλλο και αναπτύσσεται μεταξύ τους ένας βαθύς δεσμός νοιαξίματος και φροντίδας. Συχνά μέσα στα επόμενα χρόνια πηγαίνουν με το αυτοκίνητο και παρκάρουν έξω από το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, διατηρώντας μια «εμμονή» για το παρελθόν που τους εμποδίζει να προχωρήσουν στη ζωή τους.Η περίπτωση της μητέρας που εγκαταλείπει τα παιδιά της μου έφερε στο μυαλό την μητέρα της Κάιας από το «Εκεί που τραγουδούν οι καραβίδες». Έλεγε κάπου στο βιβλίο ότι τίποτα δεν είναι υπερβολικά απρεπές εφόσον βοηθάει να συνεχιστεί ο κύκλος της ζωής, εννοώντας, μεταξύ άλλων, ότι το μητρικό ένστικτο μπορεί να υπερκεραστεί σε περίπτωση που πρόκειται για ζήτημα ζωής και θανάτου. Η μητέρα της Κάιας κακοποιούνταν από τον πατέρα της και έφυγε για να γλιτώσει αφήνοντας πίσω τα παιδιά.Στην περίπτωση της μητέρας του Ντάνι και της Μέιβ θα μπορούσαμε άραγε να τη δικαιολογήσουμε με τον ίδιο τρόπο λέγοντας ότι έφυγε ακολουθώντας την κλίση της να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους; Ότι ήταν κάτι σαν αγία, όπως αναφ��ρεται στο βιβλίο, που αν δεν ακολουθούσε το κάλεσμά της η ζωή της δεν θα είχε νόημα; Ή μήπως ένας άνθρωπος που θέλει γενικά να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους ενώ δεν μπορεί καλά καλά να βοηθήσει τα ίδια του τα παιδιά και να αντιληφθεί το μέγεθος του κακού που τους προκαλεί, είναι απλά ένας ναρκισσιστής που βοηθάει κυρίως για να αισθάνεται μεγαλόψυχος; Τείνω προς τη δεύτερη εκδοχή, ειδικά μετά από αυτό που συνέβη στο τέλος του βιβλίου, το οποίο ομολογουμένως με ξένισε και μου φάνηκε τραβηγμένο. Σαν να έδωσε η συγγραφέας αυτή την τροπή στην ιστορία για να γίνει κάτι σοκαριστικό στο τέλος.Γενικά, μου άρεσε η γραφή της Πάτσετ αλλά κάπου στη μέση βαρέθηκα λίγο και δεν καταλάβαινα που το πάει. Μου φαινόταν ανούσιες όλες οι περιγραφές της ζωής των δύο αδερφών και οι αναδρομές στο παρελθόν, ενώ δεν γινόταν κάτι ουσιαστικό. Νομίζω πως θα μου άρεσε περισσότερο αν δεν είχε απλώσει τόσο την ιστορία και ήταν πιο μικρό το βιβλίο.Υ.Γ.: Κάπως έτσι φαντάζομαι το δωμάτιο της Μέιβ (αν και αυτό δεν έχει κουρτίνα):"
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8037048-erin-glover,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's work and The Dutch House does not disappoint. The book is named for the 1922 home where Danny and Maeve, an inseparable brother and sister, grow up. The house becomes a character in the story with its see-through windows, and appearance of floating on top of the hill. Yet, even though the landscaping reflects the changing seasons, The Dutch House never changes. It's filled with treasures left by its previous owners who left during the depression, furniture and drapery that are never changed after Maeve and Danny's father buy the home at an auction. While all the other characters change and grow, The Dutch House remains a constant.Their mother is overwhelmed by the house and its ostentatiousness. After nine years, she up and deserts the house and her children, bringing Danny and Maeve even closer together. Eight-year-old Danny doesn't really know what's happening when their father introduces them to Andrea, a woman who will become their stepmother, bringing her own two daughters. In the world of bad stepmothers, Andrea is right up there as one of the worst, surpassing even Cinderella's stepmothers.Danny says, ""The only thing our father really cared about in life was his work: the building he built and owned and rented out. He rarely sold anything, choosing instead to leverage what he had in order to buy more."" So he left Maeve to tend to Danny. And he let Andrea take over the house, who went so far as to give Maeve's childhood bedroom away to her daughter while Maeve was at school, on top of firing the help the children had grown up with.When their father dies, through a system of wills and trusts their father bungled, Maeve and Danny are kicked out of The Dutch House by Andrea. They become acquainted with poverty for the first time in their lives. The only silver lining is an educational trust. Danny is basically forced to go to medical school by Maeve to use up as much of the trust as is possible, leaving little for Andrea’s daughters, a seeming act of revenge. The trouble is Danny only wants to follow in his father’s footsteps, buying up old buildings. He has no interest in being a doctor.The intensity of Maeve and Danny’s relationship is the highlight of the novel. For those of us who aspire to such relationships or know they are not possible, their tender care for each other over the years will tug at your heartstrings. Ultimately, this is a story about how a brother and sister’s love for each other transcends circumstances that would cause others to break. Death, revenge, illness, and socio-economic status all play a part in holding the story together. The surprise ending will pull your heart in all directions.Ann Patchett is a genius at dissecting family relationships. Her characters are rich and complex. You will hate some of them and love others. The rub is deciding if a particular character deserves hate, love, or forgiveness—or all three."
283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the 1940s, Cyril Conroy surprises his wife, Elna, by secretly buying and then giving to her the Dutch House, a mansion in Elkins Park, Philadelphia, so called because of its original owners (the VanHoeBeeks), whose huge portraits still hang in the house along with all their other possessions: Cyril didn't just buy the house, he bought everything in it.Elna hates it. She hates it a lot. She hates it enough to take some drastic actions.Many years later, Cyril and Elna’s children, Maeve and Danny make repeated trips to sit in a car outside the Dutch House and talk about its influence on their family. Danny is our narrator for this story that jumps around over a 50 year period and gradually reveals the history of the Conroy family (which I am not going to discuss here - read the book!).The non-linear timeline of the story keeps the reader alert. I have to acknowledge that there were times when it took me a few pages to work out exactly when I was reading about (I had a similar experience when reading Commonwealth: Patchett doesn’t date stamp all her sections and it can sometimes take a while to place them in the overall timeline. That’s not a complaint as it adds to the fun of reading).As we read Danny’s recollections of his family, we also begin to see that he is unsure about some of it. He tells the story of how he met Celeste, whom he went on to marry, but it quickly becomes apparent that Maeve has a different memory of that. At one point, Danny asks ”Do you think it is possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” and later he says”Oh, would that we had always lived in a world in which every man, woman and child came with a device for audio recording, still photography, and short films. I would have loved to have evidence more irrefutable than my own memory…”Not only is memory suspect, but learning new things changes both Maeve’s and Danny’s perceptions of the past. At one point, Maeve says”I’ve always had it in mind that I hated Fluffy, that she had hit you and she had slept with Dad, but it turns out I don’t hate her at all.”This uncertainty about memory added to the changing perceptions as truth is revealed leads to a feeling of shifting sands beneath the narrative. Patchett isn’t writing a story full of action and drama - it’s a family saga telling the story of a somewhat dysfunctional family - but she is writing a story that makes the reader wonder what else was going on behind the scenes.The writing here is very easy on the eye. Patchett writes with a lightness of touch and sensitivity of observation that makes the pages flow by. There are insightful comments about human nature that are dropped in so casually they almost slip by. It all feels very accomplished. I enjoyed it a lot.My thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing for an ARC via NetGalley."

If you like deep dives into character driven narratives, this one is for you. Definitely a slow burn, a lot like her previous Commonwealth (although I liked this one way better), this story reminded me of Ask Again, Yes and The Most Fun We Ever Had. A complex, dysfunctional family takes center stage, focusing on a brother/sister pair and following from a life-changing event in their younger years through adulthood. I loved these characters. I loved their authenticity and how real they felt to me. The only thing that would have made it any better was if I had listened to Tom Hanks narrate the audio - which I do plan to do sometime in the future!This book was MADE for reading with a cup of tea/hot cocoa/coffee on a long, lazy weekend. I wish I could read it again for the first time!"

Siblings Danny and Maeve live in the house for a short period of time, but they are drawn to it like sailors to sirens. The Dutch House (so named for the original owners that are Dutch) comes to represent the turn in the road for the brother and sister. Their mother hated the home. She abandons the kids when they are young. Their father remarries, but their father’s choice pits the children against their step-mother. This book swept me into the lives of Danny and Maeve and I like how real this relationship feels. This is the type of book that unfurls slowly and gives vignettes of the lives of the characters that then paint a full picture. I’m glad I finally got to this one."

Przedstawia doskonały portret rodzinnych powiązań, których samoistność wychodzi poza schematy świadomości. Tytułowy Dom Holendrów jest miejscem, które upodabnia do siebie wszystkie postacie z tej książki i chroni je przed wizją zapomnienia; jego ściany przechowują w sobie pokolenia niespokojnych dusz, a on sam jest żyjącym stworzeniem, które karmi się retrospektywną wizją świata. Dużo tutaj resentymentowania i dużo odmian ironii przeszłości, która droczy się z bohaterami tej powieści - jest w końcu manipulantką ludzkiej pamięci."

I loathed Bel Canto, but liked Commonwealth, so I wasn’t sure how this would go, but I freaking loved it! Beautifully painful yet painfully beautiful. It’s a family saga that feels so real it could be anyone, anywhere. I thought it was going to follow the evil stepmother trope, but it’s much more complex. It’s about Danny and Maeve and how they rely on each other and navigate the shit show that is life."

293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my favorite genre of book. A genre that I have trouble defining. Contemporary fiction with multi-generational families that are just simply trying to get through life. Is that a genre? I say yes. And this is a standout amongst the crowd.Many people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is, not surprisingly, The Dutch House. A 1920s monstrosity build by a Dutch couple who made their money in tobacco then purchased by Cyril Conroy in the 1950s at a foreclosure sale. Cyril moves his wife and two children, Maeve and Danny, into the house and things begin to unravel. Many other people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is Danny. Our narrator and tour guide and we witness the unraveling--and survival--of the Conroy family. The mother leaves, Cyril remarries, and eventually Maeve and Danny grow into adulthood. And we see it all through Danny's eyes.But I say that the central character of The Dutch House is Maeve. She essentially raises Danny, she is his best friend, and his telling of the story always revolves around Maeve. And I cannot overstate how much I loved Maeve. I loved her and, maybe even more, I loved her and Danny's relationship. They were more than just siblings. They were each other's only family, best friend, constant relationship. I also hated characters too. Not that they were poorly written, but that they were wonderfully written and I was supposed to hate them. Both Danny's mother and step-mother were cruel, horrible, selfish people. I think I was maybe supposed to actually end up liking the mother, but I didn't. By the time this wonderful story came to a close, I didn't want it to end. I listened to the final chapters with tears in my eyes and the ending was about as close to perfect as I could have imagined. My only complaint is that I wanted more. I could have listened to another 10 hours of this story and devoured every second. After being completely let down by Commonwealth a few years ago, Patchett comes back with a vengeance, publishing my hands-down favorite of her books to date and restoring her to my good graces.Added bonus: Tom Hanks narrated the audiobook. I'll admit, it took me a few chapters for it to stop feeling like Woody from Toy Story was reading me the book, but he really was an excellent selection. And I wonder how she snagged him....Easily a Top 10 book this year."

Erzählt wird die Geschichte zweier Geschwister über fünf Jahrzehnte und mehrere Generationen hinweg - ich sage doch, familiär richtig ""satt"" ;) Maeve ist zu Beginn elf Jahre alt, ihr jüngerer Bruder Danny sechs. Sie wachsen mit ihrem Vater in einem riesigen, geschichtsträchtigem Gebäude auf, eben jenem Holländerhaus. Die Mutter hat die Familie verlassen - ihr Verschwinden wird über die Jahre immer wieder beherrschendes Thema bei den Geschwistern sein (ebenso wie das Haus).Ohne Mutter (dafür mit sehr liebevollem und schön gezeichnetem Personal) im Haus hat Maeve schon früh die Rolle der Beschützerin für ihren Bruder übernommen - eine Rolle, die sie im Laufe der Jahrzehnte immer wieder unterschiedlich interpretiert. Danny ist sich seiner Rolle und der seiner Schwester bewusst, und die enge Bindung und Loyalität der Geschwister zueinander stellt sich nicht immer als gänzlich konfliktfrei dar.Ich habe mich sehr gerne in diesem Setting aufgehalten. Die Geschichte plätschert nett dahin, und ich meine das ausschließlich positiv! Es gibt schon einige Gimmicks: Die Geschichte wird nicht gänzlich linear erzählt sondern springt zeitlich hier und dort, das Märchen-Thema von Hänsel und Gretel ist recht offensichtlich, aber dafür auch sehr charmant umgesetzt, es ist angenehm und interessant, mit Maeve und Danny zu ""altern"" und das Drama, die vielen tollen emotionalen Momente, können sich durchaus sehen lassen.Was mich bei diesem Buch letztlich besonders begeistert hat, war, dass es eine TOPP 1A herrlich hassenswerte böse Stiefmutter gibt. Hach, wie lange hatte ich keinen Charakter mehr, den ich so leidenschaftlich, mit so viel Hingabe, verachten und mental ausbuhen konnte. So was muss auch mal sein, und da hat Ann Patchett hier für mich 100% ins Schwarze getroffen."

I wasn't sure about this book, but having seen before where Tom Hanks narrates this book, it sounded more interesting and I decided to give it a try. This was an interesting story of a brother and sister who grow up in The Dutch House really find out who and what family is when they are adults. Having grown up only knowing their mother ran off, a mysterious nanny named Fluffy, a step-mother brought in who has no feelings toward them, a housekeeper and cook who are really more family than not, and a father who decides that questions unanswered are best. But after the death of their father, and being asked to leave the Dutch House, the only home they have ever know really, does Maeve and Danny really find out who their family is. After Maeve becomes ill do all these people come back into their lives and really show them, they were more family than they thought. That the Dutch House had more meaning to them than they even cared to admit.Tom Hanks brought so much life to this story, that it really made it interesting for me to listen.

Patchett puts as much care and color into her characters as an artist puts into each brushstroke of a painting. If you told me she also created the portrait of Maeve on the cover, I would believe you.There’s no great twists or action-packed plot, just wonderful writing about complicated family dynamics. So many times I was filled with anger or resentment that mirrored a character’s, and sometimes surpassing it. Only to, by the end of it all, have it evaporate away and leave me wondering why I felt so much. To those with your own familial tensions: expect to be confronted with them as well.It’s not a sad book; it’s sad the way life is. Or beautiful the way life is. Or unfair the way life is. I really didn’t mean to write such a melancholic review, but I guess this is where I ended up. But in case there’s any confusion, I recommend picking up The Dutch House.*Thanks to HarperCollins & Netgalley for an advance copy!"

I could not see the pages at times for the blind rage I felt at the mother. I think about Danny and how he was so self-involved, so unable to see anything, so neglectful of his wife and kids…just like his parents. He doesn’t break the cycle, we never break any cycles, and what I thought was a stilted and anticlimactic ending was probably just realistic.

So why only two stars?Because of two fatal flaws:1.. The main character was a male who never sounded like one. The thought patterns, internal dialogues, and even the way he arrived at conclusions were decidedly non-male. I am generalizing, of course. There are probably men out there who think/act this way. But if the main character was one of these outliers there should've been a way of understanding his uncommon behaviors.2. The house, which is supposed to be a character in and of itself, was boring and two-dimensional. Patchett spent a ton of pages describing it and how it affected its occupants over the years, but it was hard to see how something so blase could have such a lasting impact. Again, it was not convincing.It is always interesting to read the work of gifted writers. It's just that this one left me a bit flat."

But mostly, it is an analysis of a brother and sisters support for one another during a time of great upheaval and dismissal. I have never read this author before but I am going to check out more books by her now. The character development of this story is some of the deepest I have ever read while simultaneously keeping character motivations at arms length from the reader. It requires the reader to decipher a lot of character motivation through their decision making. I truly enjoyed the ending and may have experienced a small tear drop fall from my eye."

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,"*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.com4.5 starsRespected American author Ann Patchett released her eighth novel in 2020. The Dutch House is a poignant story of humanity, relationships and family ties. A remarkable and meditative read, The Dutch House is a moving story for those who appreciate character focussed tales.Opening after the Second World War, we witness a family move from financial concern to economic stability as the patriarch of the Conroy family makes a business move that will change their lives forever. As a result, Cyril Conroy buys the Dutch House, a sprawling estate in the Philadelphia area. But the acquisition of this mansion will have far reaching implications for Cyril, his wife and his children for years to come. Narrated by Danny, Cyril’s son, we follow this family’s exploits as they deal with the ebbs and flows of life. Despite the setbacks and the difficulties this family faces, the two Conroy children forge a strong bond. The Dutch House spans over five decades, revealing much about the state of family relationships, sibling bonds, expectation, success, loyalty, abandonment, self-belief, confrontation, ire and protection.I’ve heard only good things about Ann Patchett, the author of The Dutch House so I was really looking forward to experiencing my first book this highly regarded writer. I chose to listen to The Dutch House on audiobook format via the candid storytelling approach of Tom Hanks, who was perfectly cast as the main narrator Danny. Although I loved this one on audiobook, I’m confident that the print or e-book version would be just as engaging as the Audible text.The Dutch House is a book you need to savour and tread lightly with. I’m glad I listened to this one over a longer stretch of time than usual and I wasn’t tempted to rush through. The Dutch House is heavy on everyday life musings. It is not a strong action-packed novel. Spanning over a number of decades, it was a blessing to follow Danny, his sister, wife and family through the sands of time. With Patchett’s introspective focus on character, each protagonist is presented at their very optimum thanks to Patchett’s skilled prose. This is a remarkable novel. The Dutch House definitely made its mark on me.Special mention needs to directed towards the Dutch House itself, a formidable building with a life of its own. Patchett’s detailed and descriptive word formation allows the reader to believe that they are an essential part of the walls of this memorable estate. I could easily picture the paintings, furniture and room space of this structure. Patchett is able to express the sense of place in The Dutch House perfectly. I also need to highlight the relationships interrogated in this novel. Patchett accurately portrays the complex relations between parents and their children, siblings and partners. Every human connection in The Dutch House is relayed with understanding, compassion, honesty and maturity. I’m just so glad to have finally connected to Ann Patchett’s brilliant writing."

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4691420-xueting,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsI became a fan of Ann Patchett since reading Bel Canto, but the only other book by her I'd read is her memoir-essay collection, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage. The Dutch House is much lighter compared to Bel Canto but it also possesses a similar charm and sorta magical quality.This is a character-driven novel and a slow burn; there is a general plot, but it's pretty much established in the first quarter of the book, though I found it very intriguing. At the heart of the story is the relationship between our narrator Danny and his older sister Maeve, their fierce bond and how they take care of each other throughout their lives. We follow them through decades, from their childhood to their fifties. The Dutch House, a grand WWII-era mansion that the family moves into before Danny was born, is like a character because of how vividly it is described and also how significantly it impacts Danny and Maeve's lives. It has a big part to play in why and how their family is shaken up: their mother leaves them when they are just kids (it's a mystery why she leaves), and soon their stern father re-marries another woman who gradually begins to take over the house. What develops after that should be left to the reader to discover, so no spoilers!The writing is very rich in laying out the characters' psyche; all the major characters are complex and human, flaws and all. I just LOVE the storytelling and the narrative voice. It helps me get deeply invested in the characters, so I didn't mind the slower pace and little action. It's a wonderful and moving story about family, the bond between siblings, forgiveness, nostalgia, and how time and emotions colour our memories.I was completely engrossed and captivated by the first half. The second half, though, made me feel like there should be something more and deeper. Ann Patchett was trying to work in something about class and wealth in relation to Danny's family and their dysfunctionality, but she explored the issue on a pretty surface level. Class served more as a plot point than for social commentary. There's some passing talk about ""serving the poor"" and ~going to India~ to do so, and it all bordered on poverty porn and made me cringe. That's my main gripe, but it's a big and important one, so it affected my overall liking of the novel."

Голяма част от историята препускаше хаотично между настоящето( което беше доста плаваща величина) и миналото в рамките на една глава и понякога ми беше трудно да се ориентирам къде съм. За мен лично имаше няколко слаби звена- не можех да усетя нито героите, нито обстановката пълноценно. Имах чувство, че сякаш съм попаднала на основната конструкция на книгата, а ми липсваше завършека, детайлите.

Техните емоции и преживявания бяха преразказани, но не и показани в действителност. Това е сякаш да поискаш да усетиш уханието на парфюм, само от описанието му. Или да целунеш някой през стъкло.

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55950556-elise-schiller,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House has some resemblance to a fairy tale, complete with a mother who disappears, a distant father who falls under the spell of a wicked stepmother, three kind servants who are like Cinderella’s mice, and a beautiful castle-home that acts as the structural center of the novel. Several of the key characters have the one dimensional nature of fairy tale figures—the mother, father, step-mother, and the unlikeable wife of the narrator. Fortunately, that narrator, Danny, is an interesting and complex character, especially when his narration is read in the audio version by Tom Hanks. Danny, who is the son of the household, narrates a story that spans many decades, from the disappearance of his mother when he is about three, to his middle age years. Through dialogue and information he gains from his older sister Maeve, the three servants, and other characters, he also fills in periods from before his birth, from the history of the Dutch House to the beginning years of his parents’ marriage. As a writer, I’m quite interested in why a novelist chooses a particular point of view to tell a story—how does the choice impact characterization, tone, and plot? One of the drawbacks of a first person narrator can be limitations on language, especially if that narrator is a young person. In this case, however, the “present” of the book is when Danny is about 50, so he is quite distanced from the significant early action of the novel which allows for sophisticated vocabulary and use of language without a lack of authenticity. If done well, a first person narrator can achieve intimacy and connection to the reader in a powerful way. The voice of Danny is warm, funny, and shrewdly observant, easily accessible to the reader. Unfortunately, first person point of view can also result in other characters appearing one-dimensional; after all, they can only be portrayed through the lens of the first person narrator. In The Dutch House I see this as a weakness, especially with Maeve, who is so significant to the story that she needs to be a fully realized character and Patchett falls short of that. We are never sure of Maeve’s real feelings and thoughts since they are all filtered through Danny and we suspect their mutual devotion promotes some protective lack of transparency on both sides. Both Maeve and Danny have been utterly abandoned both physically and emotionally and I would have liked a bit more understanding about how this plays into the life Maeve leads. One of Patchett’s significant achievements in this book is the ease with which her narrator moves back and forth in time seamlessly, a widening loop that pulls in new information each time to add to the picture. As Danny grows older he learns about his parents and Maeve’s early years through a variety of sources and we get to hear him processing how a new nugget adds to his understanding of his childhood. This provides mild propulsion that keeps the pace going. Ornate and odd, the house itself is beautifully realized. Its relevance varies from character to character, and it is worthy of each one’s relationship to it. What becomes of the house in the end is just and satisfying, even when we are left with questions about many of the characters. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18967379-bookphenomena-micky,Rating 3 out of 5,"THE DUTCH HOUSE was an epic family saga told over decades, detailing the level to which a family can be messed up. There was nothing predictable about this tale and overall the tone of the story was pretty sad and depressing. However, it was rich in characterisation and description.The story was told from the POV of Danny, at first a young boy, at the end in his fifties. Alongside, his sister Maeve, they navigated traumatic family events that initially revolved around their house (The Dutch House) and later away from the house. There was an amazing cast of side characters, my favourites of whom were Dr Able, Fluffy and Andrea (who doesn’t love a Cruella de Ville character).I spent various points in this book incensed on behalf of Maeve and Danny. Danny had all the potential as a young man to turn out differently from his father but as the book progressed, I did feel he became something of a self-centred cold fish and he definitely had shades of his father. I adored Maeve as a character, she was the rudder to this story and many of her story lines just plain hurt.It sounded so nostalgic when he said it, the three of us, as if we had once been a unit instead of just a circumstance.The return of Elna to the story was not welcome to me and I just knew that she wasn’t going to be great news despite the understandable glee of Maeve. The wrap up to Andrea was a little disappointing as well; these mothers were just awful.I am left reflecting on how much this book made me feel and how involved I became with this family despite my middling rating. I would definitely read Ann Patchett again because she creates such characters that you cannot help but get swept up by them.Thank you to Bloomsbury Publishing and Tandem Collective for the review copy.This review can be found on A Take From Two Cities Blog."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Glowing reviews of Ann Patchett's newest novel The Dutch House impelled me to snatch it up as soon as it appeared on the new release shelf at the public library.The story of siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy whose mother disappears and is replaced by an evil stepmother is like a fairy tale, especially when after their father's death their stepmom exiles them from their home to fend for themselves. The abandoned children, like Hanzel and Gretel, have only each other.The story of family trauma and the inability to move on resolves into a kind of Howard's End moment, and it all centers on the Dutch House. The house is what divided the family. There are those who belong to the house, those who lust for it, those who love it, and those who desire it. Who controls the house is central to the novel.The Dutch House is a historic mansion in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, built in 1922 as a country refuge for a wealthy Dutch family. WWII veteran Cyril Conroy was a frustrated architect who became a real estate tycoon. He bought the Dutch House and all its contents, planning to surprise his wife Elna.Elna was unable to accept a life of leisure, living in a mansion. Cyril had pulled her from a convent to be his wife, dividing her from the vocation that kept calling her back. Elna had to make a choice. It wasn't Cyril and her family.Andrea wanted the house, and married Cyril for the house--and Cyril married Andrea because she loved it as much as he did. The siblings bond with Andrea's young children. Andrea begins the process of disenfranchising Cyril's children, appropriating Maeve's bedroom for her own daughter.Upon Cyril's early death, the children learn that their father left Andrea his business, house, and money. Andrea proclaims that she never signed on to raise Danny and sends him to live with his Maeve.There are a few times in life when we leap up and the past you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.~fron The Dutch House by Ann PatchettCyril left a trust fund for the children's education as well as Andrea's daughter's education. Maeve had already finished college and was ineligible, so she encouraged Danny to use up as much of the money as possible, attending private school and then going to medical school. Danny had dreamt of taking over his father's business; he loved repairing the buildings and the tenants. Maeve had planned on grad school but now had to support herself.The siblings held their anger and resentment close, a deep bond between them.We'd made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.~from The Dutch House by Ann PatchettDanny asks his sister, what kind of person leaves their kids? And Maeve replies,""Men! Men leave their children all the time and the world celebrates them for it. The Buddha left and Odysseus left and no none gave a shit about their sons. They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we're still singing about it.""Each character in the book, including the caretaker's daughter who became Danny's nanny and the housemaid and cook, has a relationship to the Dutch House. It is the house that bonds them.I connected with the characters' attachment to a house; after moving as a girl, for years I hoped to grow up and be able to retrieve my first home for myself. I also appreciated how Elna's vocation disrupted her family life; I have seen several clergy marriages crushed by the conflict of family vs. pastoral obligations. Danny and Maeve embrace unhealthy ways of coping with the past, which makes them unlikeable to some readers. (Also, we lived near Elkins Park, our son born in the hospital there!)Patchett has given us another fantastic book, filled with memorable characters. "

It's about this family and Family. It's about getting stuck in time and, perhaps, attempting to get unstuck. It's about making sense of the failings of the people we love (or don't). Dutch House is a quiet book – much of it taking place in a car in front of the Dutch House, as Maeve and Danny attempt to come to terms with their parents. Yet, it isn't a slow book on any level. I read it in a day and a half and wanted to swallow it whole. As in the books I like best, I've been savoring it as it lingers on my ""tongue,"" thinking about these strong, wounded people well after closing my kindle. Danny spins their story out in present tense over 40ish years, winding back on himself (still in the present), telling us more, and then occasionally discovering a new ""door"" that changes the meaning of everything. Although some narrators deliberately deceive, Danny tells everything he knows at that point in time as he attempts to make sense of the past. He wonders, do we see the past as it was or do we see it through our current, much different eyes? To what extent are our stories about a person dependent on how we feel about them? Or perhaps we choose events that support our favorite narrative, while ignoring others? As Danny observed, The truth is I have plenty of memories of [our stepmother] being perfectly decent. I just choose to dwell on the ones in which she wasn’t” (Kindle 990).Although everyone agreed that Danny and Maeve's stepmother was awful, how do you make sense of a ""sainted"" mother, as several characters described her, if she abandoned you when you were four? We don't have language that makes sense of such an act – it certainly doesn't fit with my culture's motherhood myths. Johnson & Johnson, for example, says ""Having a baby changes everything,"" and their advertisements are all sweetness and joy. There is no story of the prodigal mother. The rich man didn’t call for a banquet to celebrate the return of his erstwhile wife. The sons, having stuck it out for all those years at home, did not hang garlands on the doorways, kill the sheep, bring forth the wine. When she left them she killed them all, each in his own way, and now, decades later, they didn’t want her back. They hurried down the road to lock the gate, the father and his sons together, the wind whipping at their coats. A friend had tipped them off. They knew she was coming and the gate must be locked. (Kindle 3600)Danny and Maeve's mother left them without saying good-bye, but their father abandoned them in a much more conventional way. He was able to do so while avoiding most of their wrath. What's that about?“Men leave their children all the time and the world celebrates them for it. The Buddha left and Odysseus left and no one gave a shit about their sons. They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we’re still singing about it. Our mother left and she came back and we’re fine. We didn’t like it but we survived it. I don’t care if you don’t love her or if you don’t like her, but you have to be decent to her, if for no other reason than I want you to."" (Kindle 4077)Dutch House is a lovely book; nonetheless, I would have bought it just for the cover. I recently read a review about a book where the reviewer commented that the cover had nothing to do with the book. Not so in this case. This painting plays an important role.I read this book with my mother and her book club. Thank you for the recommendation!"

In this case, it is the family home where the narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve grew up. The house is somewhere outside of Philadelphia, where their father, Cyril, builds his fortune as a landlord and property developer. Their mother, Elna, abandons the family when the children are young, taking off for India. She hated the house, and she had a deep wish to help others. The theme of a parent who spends most or all of their time and energy helping others while neglecting their own family is compelling. I remembered a friend from high school who was resentful that her father (there were 8 children) spent much of his free time doing work with the Knights of Columbus. I have met other parents in my adult life who leave their children to “do good work” , often in faraway places. As a mother, I never understood this. There are references to Elna as a saint. No one ever asks about the children she left (perhaps her admirers don’t know). Her rational to Danny and Maeve when they finally find her when they are middle-aged, was that the children were materially comfortable, and lacked for nothing. She completely ignored their need for the love and presence of a mother. Her husband divorced her (he had someone deliver divorce paperwork to her as she disembarked in India) and quickly remarried. Their stepmother, Andrea, is a cold, and yes, evil woman, who arrived with two children.When Cyril dies, in his mid-50’s, Maeve is living in New York. Andrea quickly orders Danny and Maeve out of the house, sending Danny to live with Maeve. She claims everything their father owned, and the only funds available are for Danny’s education. Danny is enrolled in boarding school, thanks to the family lawyer who is appalled at Andrea’s actions. The siblings spend the following years resenting Andrea, and mourning the loss of the Dutch House.Danny studies medicine and becomes a doctor, but his heart is in following in his father’s footsteps as a property developer. He is portrayed as a gentile gentrifier. As he moved into Harlem, buying up property in a calculated way, I couldn’t help but think of the tremendous losses that this gentrification has meant for the African American community of Harlem. Inevitably, the character of many neighborhoods that “charmed” some incomers (the first are often artists), is eradicated, forever. https://www.humanityinaction.org/know...Danny marries and has a daughter, May. This the story includes three generations, and the Dutch House remains part of the family history and legacy.I listened to the audiobook and was initially unsure if Tom Hanks was the right choice. He has such a “homey” approach, and the story of the Dutch House covers some painful themes including child abandonment, and a merciless stepmother. But Hanks won me over and in the end, I thought he was perfect."

Granted I have not read Bel Canto and I really should get to that sooner rather than later.In this novel, the protagonist is a man named Danny but it could be argued that the real protagonist is The Dutch House in the title as it does assume an outsize importance in the lives of the people who have lived there.Danny, abandoned by his mother before he has any memory of her, cleaves to his sister Maeve who assumes that mothering role. His distant father shapes him in ways he doesn’t realize but also fails to protect him and leaves him at the mercy of his stepmother. In fact, this book could be subtitled, Failure to Take Care of Your Children.There is an underlying theme of forgiveness and a feeling that things are righted in the end and yet I can’t help feeling disenfranchised on Danny’s behalf which only proves Patchett’s talent…..she can write sympathetic characters."

Although Cyril purchased their palatial mansion known as the Dutch House for his wife, she hated its opulence. Although Maeve was only seven years older than Danny, she assumed a maternal role to her younger brother with the assistance of a cook, housekeeper and nanny. Several years after Elna left, a young widow, Andrea, who is enthralled with the house, finangles herself in to marriage and she and her two daughters move into the Dutch House. Danny is the protagonist of this character-study with much of the plot focused on the relationship between the two siblings, who are the two characters best fleshed out. You quickly discern that the brother and sister care deeply about each other. The novel follows the two lives almost chronologically with a few time shifts back and forth. I never found any of this distracting.The Dutch House could be a third character in this novel. Like moths to a flame, the two have a fetish-like relationship with the edifice. Their fond memories growing up in the Dutch House is replaced with pining when two two are driven from the mansion. Ann Patchett is one of favorite authors. Her book Bel Canto continues to be one of my lifetime favorite books. If you can, I would recommend that you pick up the audiobook of this novel since the actor Tom Hanks narrates it and brings Danny's character alive. Although this book is not as loved as Bel Canto for me, I really did enjoy it."

The Dutch House is a mature story about imperfect children surviving neglectful parents, and it is splendid. As a reader, you feel like the narrator, Danny, is your brother, and you love him; you feel like his older sister, Maeve, is your sister, and you love her, too. You feel like their antagonistic stepmother, Andrea, is yours, and you are held on the edge of your seat waiting for her comeuppance. Andrea is obsessed with their beautiful house, is money hungry, and is utterly lacking in maternal instincts: “‘It must be a comfort, having them with you,’ Andrea said to him, not of his children but of his paintings” (p. 4). The anchor in Danny and Maeve’s family is a stunning, three-story house that is built on farmland, has a ballroom on the third floor, has remarkable paintings and woodwork throughout, and has a window-structure that renders the happenings inside transparent to the world. This house influences everyone’s lives in complex, divergent, and frequently deleterious ways: “Look at the three of us, undone by a house” (p. 305). Although Danny and Maeve’s biological parents fail miserably in family life, neither is wicked or immoral, and both are realistic examples of how well-intentioned humans can fall short. “The only thing our father really cared about in life was his work: the buildings he built and owned and rented out” (p. 18).“There is no story of the prodigal mother” (p. 264). One of the most entertaining parts of the story is the revenge strategy that Maeve and Danny embark on against their stepmother. What it entails, who it connects them with (“Who knew a chemistry book could act as bait for pretty girls?” p. 144), and how it affects their lives and those of their stepsisters, all comes together seamlessly, providing a perfectly-paced and flawlessly-executed scaffolding for the adult portion of the siblings’ story. “You don’t have to be a doctor, you only have to study to be one … You can be anything you want, as long as it requires a great deal of schooling” (p. 153). 1) Story (5/5) 2) Writing (5/5)3) Originality (4/5)4) Characters (5/5)5) Set pieces (4/5)6) Suspense (5/5)7) Ending (5/5)8) Relationships (romantic or otherwise) (5/5)9) Dialogue (5/5)"

351,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25777210-callum-mclaughlin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Upon the death of their father, siblings Danny and Maeve are exiled from their family home by their stepmother, Andrea. We follow them across several decades that follow, as they try and fail to move on with their lives.Patchett’s prose is pleasant enough and easy to read, and in that respect, this at least never felt like a chore to get through. If you’re willing to pick it apart, there are probably some interesting ideas in here concerning family, privilege, inheritance, and fate. The trouble is, I never felt invested enough to bother analysing it for any depth beyond the largely vapid and stereotype-ridden narrative. The author was clearly going for a fairy tale-vibe with the setup, but the wronged siblings and wicked stepmother tropes contribute nothing when they go entirely unexplored. Indeed, I found all of the characters frustratingly one dimensional.The handling of the female characters was particularly poor. This would bother me in any read, but a novel written by a woman that has been longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction? I definitely expected better. All of the women (Maeve, Andrea, the children’s mother, the staff at The Dutch House, and Danny’s wife) all exist and operate almost exclusively in relation to Danny. Perhaps this was a deliberate attempt to criticise how oblivious men are to the sacrifices women make to ease their lives, but if so, I shouldn’t have to reach to make that conclusion; there should be enough depth in Danny’s narration to make use of such a nuanced theme. Beyond this, Danny’s wife and sister come to detest each other for no apparent reason, and this irritating trope of pitting women against each other also goes entirely unexplored.As for Andrea, there is no light and shade to her character, nor is there any context given to suggest why she is such a cartoonishly cruel stepmother. She is placed in contrast with Danny and Maeve’s largely absent birth mother, who, despite effectively abandoning her children, is repeatedly excused within the narrative since she is a ‘good’ and ‘Saintly’ person, off doing worthwhile charity work in India. Utilising such starkly opposite archetypes felt like lazy shorthand for character development on both fronts. I also found the end of Andrea’s arc incredibly problematic. ***Slight spoiler warning for the rest of this paragraph, though I would say the novel isn’t particularly plot driven anyway.*** Andrea ends up suffering from Alzheimer’s, becoming frail, bedridden, and confused. If this was a push to incite sympathy for the character by supposedly adding another dynamic to her characterisation, it fails, as in no way does it explain or justify her prior behaviour. If, instead, it’s supposed to be some sort of comeuppance or poetic justice, it’s nothing short of tasteless.The characters also act in absurd ways on several occasions. With all of them lacking discernible motivation, rational thought, and relatable outlooks, they never feel believable beyond the confines of the story. As such, I found it impossible to root for – or even care about – any of them.The book is supposedly set in the aftermath of WWII, but aside from occasional historic references that actually served to jolt me out of the narrative more than anything, a sense of time and place are almost entirely absent. Again, this may have been a deliberate move to lend the story a timeless feel – a trait often inherent to fairy tales – or it could simply be another flaw in the book’s construction. Either way, I found it odd and disappointing; an evocative setting could have really elevated things somewhat, especially given the importance of the eponymous Dutch House.In general, I found the whole thing flat and directionless, but the many rave reviews elsewhere suggest others will get on a lot better with it than I did. Patchett’s style is clearly not for me, and I won’t be in a hurry to pick up more of her work."

353,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873473-darryl-suite,Rating 4 out of 5,"FINAL REVIEW: Disclaimer: This review is melodramatic. Do I apologize for it? Nope.The Dutch House comes off in the manner of a Victorian novel, there’s something very old fashioned about the writing. Even the plot, mood, setting, and characterizations seem inspired by the flair of classic literature. That was the first thing that struck me, and my love for the book was immediate because of it. This novel is about a middle class family’s relationship to The Dutch House, the old mansion they call home. This novel was caressing my book-loving soul, everything was going so well; I was getting excited: could it be? Could it be that this book would top the perfection of her previous novel Commonwealth? Oh my, it just might, I could cry...and then Part 3 happened. Oh heavens, Part 3.An event occurs during this section that shifts the tone of the story, and like a petulant child, I kept bellowing: “Are you serious? No one would ever react this way. No way, no way, no way.” I recognize that The Dutch House is a piece of fiction, but the characters’ actions and decisions felt totally unbelievable to me. The moment was supposed to be life-altering, and a character acted as if they were told their shoelaces were untied. Sadly, because of this moment (or non-moment), the book started to fall apart right before my disbelieving eyes. Heavens no, heavens no. I guess what I'm saying is this: in order for The Dutch House to fully work for you, you need to fully believe in these plot points. If you believe in them, the rest of the book will be very rewarding. As for me, the book lost me at this point.Despite this, I did like the book. Even though there are plot points I didn’t agree with and motivations that seemed for lack of a better word, random, I still walked away in awe of Patchett’s talent. The writing style is smooth as freshly churned butter (I’m laying it on thick). Despite my pettiness, Patchett proves that she is a master of the written word.https://www.instagram.com/p/B_S2A6xAF..."

And still I got a wonderful feeling after finishing it...It depends on narrator how he or she presents the story to us... And there is the Ann Patchett's credibility of weaving the this story with simplicity but in very graceful way.. Patchett is not new as a writer but I have felt a freshness in her writing throughout the book...And just like an artist she drew every character so carefully and gave them a appropriate color... No great twist and turn, no mystery, the plot is simple with amazing writing which depicts family relationships, the bond between sister (Maeve) and brother ( Danny) centered with the house where they lived once and after that they were exiled from there, memories of these two siblings ...,how the house made their mother to left them behind in very early age, how the house made impact on their growing up life, on their expectations , career, job and daily life too..There is a humor, there is a crisis , there is a hope, and there is lesson ...If you haven't read any Patchett yet, then I will suggest to give her writing a try with this book, and of course if you wanted to read something simple yet Amazing story-telling with best narration then definitely it is the great choice to read ...Though lil bit slow pace writing ( In part 2 specially) and few jumping between time lines make me give it less than 5 star...My Rating 4.4/5#thedutchhouse #annpatchett #bookreview"

I am a sucker for family dramas, and this one exceeded all my expectations, especially because the audio version was read by TOM HANKS. Can Tom Hanks read all audio books always?! He exquisitely captured the spirit of the book and of narrator Danny, who tells the decades long story of his family, but more precisely, of his sister Maeve, who is so beautifully captured in the cover art. This truly is a must listen, and one of my all time favorite audio books. The lives of the Conroy family are forever changed when they move into ""The Dutch House"" outside Philadelphia, and Danny and Maeve are ultimately left to fend for themselves (without spoiling any story lines), with Maeve essentially becoming a mother figure to Danny as they navigate decades of life and often return to The Dutch House. The story so beautifully comes full circle that I actually had chills in the last few minutes of the audio. My first Ann Patchett book was the most tremendous success! She writes with the subtlety of a world class musician or athlete who makes the craft look easy. I hope everyone decides to read (or LISTEN!) to this book. I had fun with the cover of this book over on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/jules.buono/"

Ann Patchett, that’s who!This book was horrible. Everything from the writing (almost a full page of the narrator contemplating the chance of taking a certain train at a certain moment because of a certain mishap blah blah blah we’ve all read this before so many times) to the fact that not once could I picture the time period (it was supposed to span decades, I guess), the house, or the narrator (who felt very female to me though the first part). And of course there’s the fact that a large portion of the book was set in the Philly area and the author clearly had no idea about the Philly area. She said in an interview that all those northern towns run together for her and she wouldn’t want to write about a place she knows ‘too well.’ So basically I hated it and now have a pretty low opinion of the author. Two stars because I made myself plod all the way to the thoroughly predictable end. "

Some even call this one a ""masterpiece."" Hmmmm.Now, still in the minority, I'm going to step out on a gangplank in saying that I really didn't like Tom Hanks reading this book, nor his narrating style. Don't get me wrong, as much as I absolutely ADORE Tom Hanks [as an actor], I feel like the only reason I should be listening to an audiobook read by him is if it's his autobiography... particularly since it's read in first-person. I've listened to numerous audiobooks read by well-known actors and actresses, but this one I just couldn't past the distinctive voice of Tom, not Danny.For me, 
The Dutch House
 was ok, but not WOW. I didn't feel like I really cared about the characters at the end, an ending which I felt was ho hum. I liked how some of the relationships came full circle at the end in a good way, Brother Danny and sister Maeve's relationship was interesting and the writing was good.

It’s safe to say that The Dutch House was not written for me. I had quite high expectations going in as I’ve heard so much praise for the novel and both the description and cover really intrigued me, but I was sadly very disappointed. Although I’ve finished the book, I still cannot seem to describe what it’s about. It focuses on a highly dysfunctional family and the strange people who live in the house...If an author isn’t going to have a strong plot, I NEED to feel deeply engaged with the characters in order to enjoy it. I couldn’t connect with any of the characters in the novel, and the rambling nature of the narrator did not help the situation. I certainly would have given a higher rating if there was a major plot twist or any shocking shift of events, but it just never came. The book dragged on and I’m honestly shocked I took the time to finish this. Overall, this was a painfully boring read that felt quite shallow and childish, and a sad waste of some real potential! "

It’s an emotional family saga that spans a generation between the 2 main characters, a brother and a sister. One could argue the house was the third main character. Many themes are addressed: unique kinship between siblings, inheritance, dysfunctional family, loss of loved ones, life expectations, the haunting of the past and ultimately, forgiveness. The story didn’t drag and all the characters were well developed. The latter part of the book through the ending continuously surprised me, yet tied things together; highlighting Ann Patchett’s skilled writing.Standout Excerpts: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”“There would never be an end to all the things I wished I’d asked my father. After so many years I thought less about his unwillingness to disclose and more about how stupid I’d been not to try harder.”"

Most importantly, never underestimate the power of forgiveness and letting go of old resentments. Tom Hanks was an absolute delight as narrator and one of my favorite actors since way back to his days on the sitcom 'Bosom Buddies'. Thought extra fondly of him during this time as he was one of the unfortunates who contracted COVID-19 early on, and wish him the best.Ann Patchett is always a joy, and I relish all her novels.

I think Ann Patchett has a wonderful way of building a world through layered stories and moving back and forth in time. This novel, however, really dragged for me. It felt like most of it was spent in an endless loop of the characters' obsession with their childhood home and everything that had happened. I get that the endless loop was part of their experience of not being able to move past childhood resentments, but as a reader I wanted a stronger sense that the novel was moving toward something. The best part of this novel is the last quarter when it starts to pick up momentum."

This defining event somehow provides momentum and urgency to the story so that even when life is ordinary the reader is compelled to keep turning the pages..In The Dutch House two siblings keep returning to sit outside the house of their childhood, the idyllic house where everything went wrong. Through all their troubles it is this central relationship that holds their lives on course. Patchett's exploration of character and her understanding of the human psyche is one of the joys of reading her work, as is the surprising ways in which she resolves her plot. Her characters are very relatable, yet never ordinary and I like the way she takes on the voice of a male protagonist. What an enjoyable book!"

Kažkodėl patraukė dėmesį tas mergaitės portretas ir tie paukščiai, ir net pats pavadinimas – „Olandiškas namas“. Ir pataikiau. Šitas romanas kaip tik toks, koks ir viršelis. Lyg jaukus, bet kartu ir šaltas, įtraukiantis, bet niūrus. Vietomis mielas, vietomis atgrasus. Iš esmės – pasaka apie Jonuką ir Gretutę. Pagrindinis veikėjas ir pasakotojas Danny užauga keistomis sąlygomis. Jo tėvas, buvęs skurdžius, po karo netikėtai žiauriai praturtėja iš nekilnojamojo turto ir su žmona ir dviem vaikais įsikrausto į milžinišką, ekscentrišką, nepaprastai prabangų išmirusios olandų turtuolių šeimos namą. Su visais tos šeimos daiktais (ta prasme net plaukais apsivėlusiu šepečiu, papuošalais, paveikslais...) Denio motina niekaip negali pritapti tame ekstravagantiškame name ir pabėga. Ji taip siaubingai ten jaučiasi, namas ją spaudžia taip, kad ji pasirenka geriau palikti savo vaikus, negu likti jame. Danny ir jo vyresnioji sesuo Maeve lieka su šaltu, tolimu tėvu ir tarnaitėmis didžiuliame, mįslingame name. Name, dėl kurio juos paliko mama. Netrukus į jų gyvenimą ateina piktoji pamotė...Romanas apima vos ne visą Denio gyvenimą. Kaip jis augo name, apie jo nepaprastai artimus ir sudėtingus santykius su seseria, su tėvu ir pamote. Pateikiama visa perspektyva, kaip jį paveikė tėvo šaltis ir motinos nebuvimas, kaip išsirutuliojo jo ir sesers gyvenimai po vaikystėje ištikusių netekčių. Romane daug froidiškų kompleksų, įdomiai, nors vietomis ir banalokai nagrinėjamas brolio ir sesers / vyro ir žmonos santykis. Namas veikia kaip atskiras veikėjas, tarytum jis būtų kaltas dėl visų šeimos negandų. Tačiau Denis su Meive į jį sugrįžta kiekviename knygos skyriuje, sėdi priešais jį mašinoje ir kalbasi apie vaikystę, žiūrėdami į tą namą bando aiškintis savo gyvenimo prasmę. Kaip Jonukas su Gretute jie vis grįžta pas pamotę raganą, į saldainių namelį, kuris iš pažiūros toks dailutis ir skanutis, toks viliojantis, tačiau iš tiesų yra pražūtingas. Romanas kiek snobiškas, vietomis nuobodokas, jam apibūtinti tinka angliškas žodis „pretentious“. Nrpliojami vyrų ir moterų santykiai dažnai (ko gero sąmoningai) pateikiami seksistiškai (na, aišku didžioji dalis veiksmo vyksta 60s-70s), bet tas mane bet kokiu atveju nervina. Tačiau suprantu, čia dalis to psichologinio žvilgnsio – kaip vyras žiūri į moterį, kai yra užaugęs be motinos ir beveik be tėvo ir vienintelė jo atrama vyresnioji sesuo... Žodžiu, kyla visokių minčių, knyga tikrai ne plokščia, yra ir ką pagalvot ir jausmus sudrumsčia.Duodu 4 žvaigždes ir skaitysiu kitus autorės romanus! Rekomenduoju kol kas originalo kalba, bet gal leidyklos susidomės išversti?... O ką jūs jos skaitėt ir (ne)rekomenduojat?"

The main characters of Maeve and Danny are obviously traumatised by the disappearance of their mother. The reasons being only obscurely referred to by the author, ""she didn't like the house"".History has a knack of sometimes going full circle. So it is for Danny and Maeve Conroy. The story is narrated by Danny, the son of a successful investor of residential properties. As a young child his mother disappears and for which his sister Maeve being older than him suffers more from the disappearance of their mother. The father initially is distant towards his children who are mainly cared for by the staff, Fiona (Fluffy) who has been part of the house since the original Dutch owners with Sandy and Jocelyn hired by the children's mother. In due course the father marries again to a woman who seems more in love with the Dutch House and it's potential than her husband. Andrea brings with her two daughters Norma and Bright and as most happens more often than not begins to have her daughters take precedence over Maeve and Danny. The personalities of Maeve and Danny are direct opposites, Maeve is feisty and not afraid of speaking her mind while Danny at first appears as little boy lost, he is compliant, aware of his father's moods. The two have a strong attachment which becomes more and more intense as they grow older even after Danny marries and has a loving wife. As the family history moves on, the father dies leaving everything to Andrea with the exception of an Educational Trust and from this Maeve pushes Danny into his Medical Degree in order to use all the Trust money so as to deny Andrea's daughters such an education. Danny having no desire to practice medicine and with the obscure training from his father begins a similar business investment journey. From out of the blue with a health crises involving Maeve their mother returns. This puts Danny at odds with the relationship of mother and daughter. This is understandable, he has had a very close relationship with Maeve and almost overnight there is a change in the dynamics. For a long time Maeve has had an obsession with the Dutch House and becomes a voyeur of events that take place there even knowing the time of night when the lights will be put on.It's not until the end that the courage to reenter the house reveals the final twist regarding Andrea and Norma. Danny realises that all he harboured he has to let go."

Then I saw on Instagram that the audiobook was narrated by none other than THE Tom Hanks!! When I saw that it was available to listen to on Scribd I immediately pressed the ""start listening"" button!! I could listen to Tom Hanks talk forever, and the way he performed the narration was like listening to one of his award winning films!! Other than loving Tom Hanks as an actor, narrator, and simply as a human...I truly enjoyed this story very much! It had somewhat of a slow start and build up, and at times I didn't really know where the plot was leading. The plot structure was curious but also in a way, fun! I didn't expect going in, to get as deeply attached to the characters as I did by the end. I also didn't expect to feel emotional when I realized the story was over. The main focal point of this book is a beautiful sibling relationship, which has grown so strong by the fact that their mother left them at a young age, to be ""raised"" by their apathetic father. The main setting which the book is named after is the Dutch style house in which they grow up in. This house was used as a fascinating setting, metaphor and paradox. I found it deeply compelling, how Ann Patchett used The Dutch house itself almost as its own character. It has a different affect on each character, making for a very unique affect on the reader as well. Although this isn't the best book I've ever read/listened to, I would easily recommend it!! The plot did feel aimless in places, but it's following a person's life path, which can be irresolute at times. This book is a wonderful testament to the bond between siblings and parents. (I would definitely be interested in re-reading it physically!)"

Κατά την γνώμη μου, οι χαρακτήρες του βιβλίου ήταν άψυχοι και αδιάφοροι και η ιστορία δεν σου έδινε λόγους για να διαβάσεις παρακάτω. Η τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση με έκανε απλά να βλέπω την υπόθεση από απόσταση και να μην ""ζω"" τα γεγονότα (εν αντιθέσει με άλλα βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει που παρά την τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση, καταφέρνουν να σε κάνουν ένα με την ιστορία). Δυστυχώς, δεν συμπάθησα τους ήρωες του βιβλίου ούτε και δέθηκα με κάποιον από αυτούς συναισθηματικά. Με ενόχλησαν τα συχνά πισωγυρίσματα στον χρόνο με αποτέλεσμα να υπάρχει σύγχυση σχετικά με το αν τα όσα διάβαζα εκείνη τη στιγμή αναφέρονταν στο παρόν ή το παρελθόν. Ακόμη, το γεγονός ότι κάποια γεγονότα έσκαγαν σα βόμβα και αναφέρονταν συνοπτικά αντί να αναλυθούν ήταν για μένα ένα τεράστιο φάουλ της συγγραφέως, μια προσπάθεια να επισπεύσεις ανεπιτυχώς τα γεγονότα και τη ροή της ιστορίας γενικότερα. Θα μπορούσε, ωστόσο, να πει κανείς (και το αναγνωρίζω) ότι ο πιο ενδιαφέρον, ίσως, χαρακτήρας του βιβλίου ήταν η μητέρα, η Έλνα, καθώς υπήρχε ένα μυστήριο γύρω από το όνομά της ήδη από την αρχή της ιστορίας και λόγω του χαρακτήρα της κατάφερε να γίνει αγαπητή στο κοινό. Η γραφή της ιστορίας δεν με εντυπωσίασε, ούτε και θεωρώ ότι είχε κάτι το αξιοθαύμαστο. Τη βρήκα άψυχη και με κύριο γνώμονα την παράθεση γεγονότων κι όχι την εμβάθυνση σε αυτά. Έλλειψη πλοκής.

How to even summarize it, let alone draw out a few succinct thoughts? She has such a way with writing families, capturing the way the people closest to you can be simultaneously blind to who you are and yet intimate enough to shatter you.So - what is this novel about? It's about the Dutch House, a beautiful museum of a house with unique architecture (a ballroom on the third floor, a starry sky on the dining room ceiling, a glass hallway that creates a line of sight from one end of the house to the other). It's about a man who buys the house for his wife as a surprise, and what the house comes to represent to each of the characters. Because the house always stays the same, it lets Patchett play with ideas like memory and childhood perception.What also made this a really moving read for me were the ways the story mirrored my own life (No, I didn't grow up in a museum). I had to put it down several times, especially in the beginning: it's intense, it's heartbreaking and visceral. I think much of the power of this story comes from how Patchett destroys everything at the beginning, shows her characters working through grief and unimaginable loss, and brings them out the other side.Read this one for gripping literary fiction with themes about growing up and through."

It will certainly be in my top reads of 2019. I loved it! I can hardly put my thoughts into words. It was one of those books that a fellow reader described as a ""rare literary page-turner "". I couldn't agree more. It is an expertly crafted book featuring complex characters, including a majestic house, whose story is formed through a complicated family history, a dynamic sibling relationship and nostalgia. I absolutely adored the way Patchett incorporated the power of memory. How these seemingly small snippets of time shape who we become and even more importantly, how we remember them. As a Mom I wonder what my kids will remember when they look back on their childhood. I've come to the conclusion that it won't be the big things- it will be these small, impressionable moments. Those moments that I couldn't plan for even if I tried.*sigh* I loved this book.

He read it with the right amount of passion, humour, and emotion. You don't go into a Patchett expecting a major plot. Her study of character and the ability to translate it onto paper is incredible. That is what you find here in The Dutch House 100%. I actually teared up when I was around 75% of the way through it.

Sometimes we cannot move past our past, and this book wonderfully explores themes of family, of love and loss, of sibling bonds, of class and memory. I was sucked in from the first line and loved every minute of it. When I closed the book I felt like I knew and cared about these people. I listened to the audiobook which was wonderfully narrated by Tom Hanks. He had some quirks that reminded me it was Hanks, but he captured the voice of Danny really well. If you are in the mood for a slow burn family tale, I'd highly recommend this one."

Very enjoyable, I often thought about the characters and the story when I wasn’t reading it and was really looking forward to picking up where I had left off and finding out more about Danny and Maeve and how their lives pan out. I thought it was great the way the house was just as pivotal a character as anyone else. In fact, when you think about it, the house was probably the most important aspect of the whole story. It brought everyone together, tore them apart, then reunited them and brought a measure of peace and reconciliation. I wanted more of Maeve’s story, I know it was told from Danny’s perspective so we had more of his POV but his sister was the glue that held everything together. Also, I did feel that everything fell into place a little too neatly in the end otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
384,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263948-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've always loved Ann Patchett's emotional intelligence and the depth of her characters' emotional lives. She's amazing at writing about all the nuances in human relationships and how they affect people. It's so hard to see the good in people after they've hurt you, to hold two warring parties close to you without taking sides, to have a close relationship with someone who is neglectful or abusive to someone else who you love. The Dutch House  doesn't have your stereotypical formulaic plot and I'd have a hell of a time explaining what it's really about, but I can say that I miss the main characters Danny and Maeve already and I know I will think of them often in the years to come."

Sometimes I think “I could write a book, can’t be that hard,” but then I read something as well-crafted as this and... NOPE. The audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks, and I can’t decide if that enhanced my enjoyment or detracted from it. You never quite forget who you’re listening to. Because of this, I’d like to revisit The Dutch House in print form at some point. Also of note, this book isn’t really about anything Dutch. It’s kind of a misleading title. "

It may be Ann Patchett's style; I haven't read any of her work before. The two main characters have been locked out of their own lives or believe that they have been - fortunately for them, there was a trust fund. I read this entirely because it was longlisted for the Women's Prize -- I am compulsively reading that Longlist during social distancing/lockdown. It was worth a read."

Before I listened to this audiobook I would not have thought of Tom Hanks as a great audiobook narrator, but his voice is perfect for this story. There was an unexpected scene toward the end that made me laugh so hard that tears came out of my eyes (which rarely happens when I read or listen to novels). This book is a five stars for me. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"

Maeve Conroy, her brother Danny and their father occupied the space of The Dutch House with their workers. Their mother hated the Dutch House. Maeve took over their mother's role taking care of Danny. Then without warning, their father brings home Andrea Smith who finagles her way into their home with her two daughters. Their father's behavior was odd, and his life was all about his work.After Maeve and Danny's father suddenly passes away from a heart attack, Andrea, the evil stepmother, kicks Danny out of the house to live with Maeve, not caring about what would become of them. Maeve was diabetic. There is something so endearing and emotional about Danny's narrative throughout this story. He meets Celeste on a train as he headed home for Thanksgiving. Maeve didn't like Celeste, and Celest didn't like Maeve. Celeste and Danny dated, eventually got married and had children. They later divorced after Maeve passed away.This book, narrated by Danny, shows a sometimes quirky and rather clueless side of him. His sister Maeve is his heart, and when his mother returns one day, after all of the hardships they endured as children, he doesn't forgive her, but Maeve does. Even as he learned that his mother had been taking care of underserved people all these years in the same city they lived in, he doesn't care because she left them when they needed her. Maeve had taken on the role of Danny's mother figure. She forgave her mother and yearned for her when her mother appears after decades of being absent from their lives. This reappearance surfaces when Maeve becomes ill. After Maeve passes away, I felt sorry for Danny. Home is so sad. After all of the years since they were kicked out of The Dutch House, Maeve and Danny pretended that what they had lost was the house, not their mother, or their father."

Maeve Conroy and her brother Danny grew up in the VanHoebeek mansion outside of Philadelphia. Their home was beautiful, but at a young age they lost their mother and were rejected by their step mother. Both were bright and moved ahead, forging successful lives. But tragedies continued. Danny’s father always said, “The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor.” Danny’s explanation was that “traditionally the first generation makes the money, the second generation spends the money, and the third generation has to go to work again.” He said his father “completed the entire cycle in his own lifetime.” There is a lesson there. This also is a story about the relationship between parents and their children, and what roles each plays. It’s about forgiveness and acceptance. Families are complicated."

406,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,Rating 5 out of 5,"The main character in The Dutch House is the house itself. It looms over the lives of the human characters and haunts them to the very end of their days.The house was built in a suburb of Philadelphia by a Dutch couple, the VanHoebeeks, who had made a fortune in a cigarette distribution business that they started before World War I. The facade of the house was glass; you could look right through it. The lives of the people who lived in it were never so transparent.The VanHoebeeks raised their family there, but it was a family stalked by tragedy and by post World War II years, the only family member left was the mother who was cared for by a servant, Fiona (later nicknamed Fluffy). When the mother died, the house reverted to ownership by a bank and it was sold.The buyer was Cyril Conroy, a man who had grown up poor but through a combination of acumen and luck had parlayed a single investment in a property into an enormous real estate empire. He was a man with a wife whom he adored and a young daughter, Maeve. He wanted to give his wife an amazing gift and the Dutch House just fit the bill.When he took his wife and daughter to see the house and he told the wife he had bought it for her, she was astounded and appalled. She hated it! It was ostentatious, clearly the finest house in the town where it was located, but Elna was a woman who also had grown up in poverty and had flirted with the idea of becoming a nun and following Sister Theresa. She believed in the value of living simply and of serving the poor and needy of the world. She could never be happy in this house.Nevertheless, the family moved in. A son, Danny, was born. But over the years, Elna would be absent from the home for extended periods, leaving the children in the care of their father and the caretaker ""Fluffy,"" as well as two house servants who treated them as their own children. Finally, when Danny was three and Maeve was ten, she left for good. Her note said she was going to India.And so we have the two motherless children and the makings of a fairy tale. Shortly, Maeve develops Type 1 diabetes, which will be another burden she and her brother will bear throughout her life. She is devoted to the care and protection of her little brother, even in adulthood. She essentially sacrifices her life to ensure that he has everything he needs.In time, Cyril marries again to a much younger woman, the odious Andrea. Now we have the evil stepmother on the scene. We learn that Cyril's main attraction for her is in the house that he owns. She desired that house.Maeve moves out of the Dutch House as soon as she can. Danny is left alone with Andrea and her two daughters and his father. But not for long. His father dies at age fifty-three and Andrea is in control. She kicks him out of the house.Andrea is left in control of the business and the house. The only thing provided for Maeve and Danny is an educational trust, so Maeve devotes herself to seeing that her brother receives the most expensive education available.I could go on and on and recite the whole plot for you, but I have to leave something for you to discover!Patchett's prose is so straightforward and one could almost say old-fashioned. It is a very traditional way of telling a story, without tricks or embellishments, and I very much appreciated that after some of the other books I've read recently. (I'm looking at you, Marlon James!) I loved just about everything about her book, except I was a little disappointed with the ending. It seemed to just sort of fade out and I guess I was hoping for something a little more dramatic. I should have known better - no tricks, no embellishments, only real life."

This is a beautiful character driven novels about a family, a house, and how throughout their lives it continues to tear them apart and bring them back together. The main characters are written in such depth that by the end of the book I feel like I really knew them and mourned having to leave them behind on the final page. The house also felt like a whole character. The author describes it so vividly that you feel like you've walked its halls.I really enjoyed this. If you are looking for a book about love, loss, family both found and by blood, with lots of nods to the way of life of the past. This book is for you."
409,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27024624-suelucie,Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, the overwhelming themes of this novel are self-determination (for Danny and Maeve, and especially where Elna is concerned though I hesitate to elaborate for fear of spoiling the story for others) and the bond between siblings that both sustains and threatens to harm them both. Deprived at a young age of the privilege and luxury they were born into, Danny and his sister Maeve are forced to fend for themselves, eventually moving to New York but retaining strong ties to Philadelphia and the looming presence of their childhood home, the Dutch House. Maeve in particular who, a decade older than Danny, can remember their earlier lives, their father and their absent mother more clearly, obsesses for decades over the past and the calamity that exiled them. She decides her role in life is to care for Danny, pushing him in the direction she thinks best for him and putting aside ambition for herself. Their relationship is central to them both. Danny goes along with her plans but yearns for a different life. We follow their paths over many years to a superbly poignant conclusion. I am a huge fan of Ann Patchett’s writing. All the books I’ve read from her extensive back catalogue have been very different, though this one bears most resemblance to ‘Commonwealth’. Characters are key, especially here. Maeve is a terrific creation - brave, funny and utterly determined, if blinkered for most of the novel. Danny’s growing up is a journey I enjoyed very much. A couple of examples:‘That night in my sister’s bed I stared at the ceiling and felt the true loss of our father. Not his money or his house, but the man I sat next to in the car. He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of. I had never thought about him as a child. I had never asked him about the war. I had only seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him.’‘There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.’A great story that just flowed from the page, so beautifully written, and much food for thought here. I’ve no hesitation recommending it.With thanks to Bloomsbury via NetGalley for the opportunity to read an ARC."

A capa é fantástica, sem dúvida nenhuma. Mas não foi o que esperava, confesso, apesar de ser uma boa história familiar, ainda que só no início.É um livro que começa de forma forte e que nos agarra, mas lá para o meio, comecei a perder o entusiasmo… Tudo se passa em torno da casa que o pai dos protagonistas compra a uma família holandesa falida. Gostei da forma como a casa acaba por ocupar um papel tão central na narrativa. Os irmãos Maeve e Danny crescem nesta casa com o pai e as empregadas… a mãe, uma mulher simples mas sufocada pela nova vida e pela casa que quase a envergonha, abandonou a família. Os irmãos vão crescendo unidos, até o pai casar de novo. A madrasta, que se percebe que tinha um fascínio pela casa e não pelo marido, acaba por expulsar os irmãos quando o pai morre. E é nesta nova fase que os irmãos estreitam ainda mais os laços que os unem, acabando sempre por voltar à casa, ainda que só a vejam do lado oposto da rua. Ao longo da narrativa, vamos acompanhando a vida dos irmãos ao logo de décadas, e gostei particularmente da relação cúmplice entre eles – eu, que não tenho irmãos, fico sempre apanhada por estas relações tão fortes, cheias de memórias.Gostei da escrita da autora e fiquei com curiosidade de ler outros livros. Destaco a forma como a casa assume tanta importância: simboliza o declínio da família holandesa e a oportunidade de “crescer socialmente” da nova família. Ao mesmo tempo, foi a mudança para esta casa que fez desmoronar a família de Maeve e Danny, já que a mãe não suportava a nova vida. A casa assume o papel de porto de abrigo mas também de discórdia, sendo foco de guerras e famílias desfeitas.Além disto, o que me ficou deste livro? A partir do ponto de viragem que foi a morte do pai e a expulsão dos irmãos, a narrativa desenrola-se de forma pouco consistente, a meu ver. A vida dos dois irmãos torna-se pouco interessante, cheia de acontecimentos que não acrescentam muito, até ao fim, em que há lugar para reencontros e perdão e que, de certa forma, quase nos faz sentir os dois irmãos “vingados”. Mas o fim pareceu-me completamente inverosímil, confesso…"
411,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415863-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Re-Read July 2023 for Lit Wits Book ClubThis time I read the book instead of listening to it, but could still hear Tom Hanks’s voice as Danny as I read. I was struck again by how much history repeats itself as Danny made the same mistakes with his wife that his father did with his mother. I felt sorry for Danny’s wife because it would be hard to be married to a man who shared all his dreams and plans with his sister instead of his wife. I really enjoyed this re-read and all the details of the beautiful Dutch House. I also think the cover, which I’m sure is supposed to be the painting of Maeve, is beautiful.As I listened to The Dutch House, I couldn’t help but think of Ann Patchett’s previous novel, Commonwealth. Both books feature blended families. But Commonwealth needed a directory of all the different family members and The Dutch House focuses on Danny and his sister Maeve. It would be more correct to say that The Dutch House is a story of an “unblended” family. Danny and his sister decide early on that their father has married the wrong woman when he marries Andrea and brings her 2 young daughters to live at the Dutch house. Every character in the book has strong feelings about the Dutch house – Danny’s mother hated the home and left the family to work with the poor in India; Danny’s father felt it was s symbol of his success; Andrea loves the Dutch House – much more than she loves Danny’s father or his children; Danny and Maeve both love the home and are drawn to parking outside it and talking over old times after Andrea kicks them out of the house.I had hoped there would be some additional information about the Dutch House at the end of book. I can’t help but believe that Ann Patchett based this upon a real home. I would love more details!I admired Maeve for devoting her life to taking care of Danny and making sure he got through college and had a great life. Danny reminded me a lot of his father and I was reminded over and over that history repeats itself. Tom Hanks is the narrator for the audio book and does an outstanding job in telling Danny’s story."

Maeve and Danny who depended on this house with every thread of their being find themselves out of the house after Andrea, their stepmother decides that they are no longer her responsibility. With the recent demise of their father and a mother who ran away to India so she could 'help people' and also because she wanted to put some distance between herself and the house that suffocated her, these kids are left to fend for themselves.-The Dutch House, with all its inherent glory, meant different things for the people in this family. While it was 'home' for young Danny and Maeve, it was more of a status symbol for Cyril, a real estate developer. As Andrea came along, she prioritized financial security for herself and her family grabbing the first thing she could lay her hands on- the house.-As the mystery around the house continues, we get to see the mosiac relationship between siblings. Maeve has always been the responsible, mature and understanding one. She raises Danny like her own child and even sends him to medical school, in order to give him a better life (and to spite her stepmother). As the years pass by, Danny reciprocates this love but in a more fierce manner.-Patchett writes about this family (including the help) passionately. Danny's stubbornness, his way of handling relationships came from a place of suffering and misfortunes, whereas Maeve, always the accommodating one stays put like a rock even in pain and illness. @vivekisms describes this book as 'deceptively simple' and I could not agree more. The story peels off in layers, each layer more intricate than the other. While the pace might bother you a little, I would advise you to stay determined. Because it will be extremely rewarding."
413,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10110896-robert-blumenthal,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a really quiet novel, akin to the novels of Alice McDermott and Colm Toibin. It is very much a character study, with some but limited narrative drive. If the reader does not become absorbed by these lucid characters (hard to fathom), I don't see him or her liking this book very much. There is a story here, one, obviously, involving a house and children growing up in it. But it is a very quiet, subtle story. One thing that the author definitely avoids is any melodrama at all, which is a good thing.Maeve and her younger brother Danny, the book's narrator, grow up with their father and stepmother in an old regal house in a suburb outside of Philadelphia, PA. Imagine my surprise upon learning that it is in Elkins Park, which is in the same school district in which I grew up. Maeva and Danny's mother leaves for good when Maeve is about 8 and Danny is an infant. The father eventually remarries to a woman who is rather cold and unfeeling to the children. After the father dies, she essentially kicks the children out of the house (Maeve is an adult, Danny is 15). They live their lives, Danny marrying and moving to New York, Maeve staying single and living in the same area. They are both still bound to the Dutch House of their youth, regularly driving to it and talking in the car. It becomes a ritual for them.As I said there isn't a lot of drama in this story. The reader is following the lives of these two who are as close as two siblings could be. I appreciated the subtlety and lack of melodrama in the telling and found myself absorbed in their lives. I also appreciated how the author made ""characters"" out of inanimate objects. The house, of course, for one. Also, much is mentioned about Maeve's hair. And there are portraits in the house that take on a life of their own. Patchett has really honed her craft and has settled into a very assured and unassuming place as a writer. The words seem to flow from her easily and with much grace."

I was captivated by the story and the writing. I lent the book to friends and relatives who also loved it. Because of that novel, I knew this one would be equally captivating.I was wrong. I fell asleep almost every time I sat down to read this book. Then I started skimming just to see if anything -- anything at all would happen. But no, just more of Danny sitting with his sister, Mauve, in a car in front of their childhood home (the Dutch house) reminiscing about all the ugly things that happened to them in the house. For some reason, never explained, Mauve does not like Danny's wife which causes a rift between them for several years but finally they get together again to once again sit in front of the house over and over for who knows why to review over and over their terrible childhood in the house ad nauseum.We are supposed to believe their mother abandoned her family when the kids were small because she hated this house. She goes to India to help the poor instead. Then she returns to the states to live on skid row for years. Years later she is 'found' by a former nanny and returns to her 'family' who embrace her unreservedly; in fact consider her a saint. Really? A saint? The step mother (who still lives in the house) has treated the children horribly, kicked them out of the house when they were still children, tricked them out of all the father's money, but in the end all is forgiven and everyone gets together and 'loves' one another because of the saintly mother's return! Happy endings are sprinkled throughout.This novel fell totally flat for me....."

It's just pipped her last novel, Commonwealth, another family saga, to top place as my favourite of her novels that I've read thus far.This is the story of a house. Before I started reading I found it hard to imagine how one house could be so instrumental in impacting the lives of the members of one family, but this is exactly what this novel goes on to explain. We follow the narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve, as they grow up in the Dutch House in Philadelphia. What happens in this house as they grow up shapes the rest of their lives, and I found the resulting story totally captivating. This novel is, for me, Patchett at her best - just when you think the narrative might be losing its way something happens to suck you right back in to the story. One thing I love about books is when they make me view my own life and relationships in a different light, and that's something The Dutch House definitely achieved - namely about sibling relationships and the nature of family. While they're by no means identical novels I'd venture that if you enjoyed Commonwealth you'll find something to enjoy in this novel, too.Thank you Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (UK & ANZ) for the advance copy, which was provided in exchange for an honest review."

But what would I expect from Ann Patchett, she is one of my favorite authors. The character development was perfect as the story so intimately unfolded through the words of our narrator, Danny. The relationship, love and bond between he and his sister, Maeve (a new favorite character of mine by the way) knows no bounds. I can't recall being so affected by a relationship in a very long time. There's so many layers, emotion and depth to this story that I would not even know how to begin to give a synopsis. But if you are a fan of Ann Patchett, I do not think you will be disappointed. You may have many questions and thoughts to unravel after reading this book. I certainly did, and I grappled with how things turned out. My mind changed about a couple of the characters as the story drew to a close. And one of my Novel Ideas friends suggested how easily this could turn into a sequel - one can hope!

No entanto, achei a construção da narrativa um pouco confusa, as idas e vindas no tempo. Num parágrafo, Danny estava a falar da sua adolescência, no parágrafo a seguir já tinha 40 anos e a sua vida era outra. Levou-me algum a adaptar-me a estas mudanças.Sinto que as personagens evoluíram muito pouco, tendo em conta que a história é passada em mais de 50 anos. O Danny de 11 anos era o mesmo do Danny de 49. Basicamente, um banana. E achei bastante estranho que as personagens falassem da mesma forma, tivessem o mesmo discurso tanto aos 15 como aos 55.É verdade que é um livro para sentir e pensar nas coisas, na família, no passado e no peso que ambos têm em nós, na nossa personalidade, na nossa forma de reagir ao que nos acontece. No futuro.Contudo, não consegui sentir uma ligação às personagens, não consegui conectar-me à história. Admito que estava à espera de amar este livro, o que não aconteceu. Não desgostei, nem amei, apenas me passou ao lado. E é uma pena porque eu adoro tanto esta capa, penso que é das capas mais bonitas que eu tenho e talvez queira um quadro destes Como escrevi, gostei muito da escrita e vou querer ler mais da Ann Patchett. Talvez leia o 'Bel Canto', um dos livros mais conhecidos da autora."
418,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am not entirely sure why I enjoyed this book. There were no dragons or space ships in it, nor was it a history or energy book. It was simply a story of a pair of siblings and how they navigated their lives, with its ups and downs and not a little bit of bitterness for their step mother who kicked them out of their home upon the death of their father. The story told their lives both before and after this event and explored their familial and social relationships this event impacted. The non-linear unfolding of the story worked well with various points of tension of self-revelations for the characters, informing the reader how past events influenced their perception in the future. While not a pleasant read at all times (since any narrative worth its salt that covers decades of life is bound to have its low points) I found myself invested in the lives of the characters as well as curious to see how the story would resolve itself. An enjoyable reading experience overall that inly works if you like the main charatcers (which I did). If they don't end up clicking for you this book becomes insufferable."

I think I will need a few days to gather some coherent thoughts about this book, but suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it! Tom Hanks actually managed to improve upon a text that was near-perfect to begin with; if I could I would give the audiobook a thousand stars, but alas, the boundaries of the flesh...By the way, I figured out that this is the perfect representation of the kinds of books that I tend to love - slow-paced, a doorstopper (well, this one isn't, but David Copperfield and War and Peace definitely are), not much plot to it but a story spanning several decades and generations, lots of introspection and reflection upon the bigger revolutions of human life; in short, a Bildungsroman."

A story about a house but also, I thought, a story about a sister who did everything for her brother and her family. When I started this book I was wondering ""why do people like this book so much"" but the more I read, the more I liked the characters and this is something this author does with all her books IMO, she really gets you to care about the characters because she lets you know them so well. By the second half of the book and also by 3rd section, I was in love with all the characters and also by the end I loved the fact that the house had gone full circle with the family.

I have to admit I struggled to get into this book , though I wonder if it less the book than my current reading doldrums. Over all I enjoyed this multigenerational tale of a family home, called The Dutch House.Ann Patchett is a genius at painting a literary portrait that come alive in the reader's mind. I could see the house clearly and all the drama that unfolded there. The middle lagged a little. I found I enjoyed the siblings more as they navigated their adult relationships.

441,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Descriptions of the Dutch House suggest the spirit of the Dutch “Golden Age” with its celebration of worldly success. It was actually built in the 1920's by Mr. VanHoebeek who made his money in the cigarette business. To the characters of this book, the Dutch House is the stage for ever-changing memories and interpretations of the past. Patchett pursues this theme of unreliable memory with poignant vignettes. A pre-pubescent Danny imagines star-crossed lovers as he gazes at the portrait of a young girl. (The house came with its fastidious vintage décor, complete with VanHoebeek family portraits, clothes, and personal artifacts). Danny calls her Julia. Who was she, he fantacizes. His sister Maeve, older by seven years, bursts his fantasy. The portrait is the girlhood version of old Mrs. VanHoebeek. The visible reminder of aging jolts him.  “They were paintings of the same women seated at either end of her life, old Mrs. VanHoebeek and young Julia caught in a breeze. And really, even if it wasn't the same woman, such a likeness made it clear how one day the daughter would become the mother .""(Location 728). There is no worry, however, that his sister Maeve will become her own mother. Their own mother was young, immature and naive. She hated the house, the surprise “gift” from her husband Cyril. She felt lost and shamed by its opulence. She left when Danny was four. Maeve becomes Danny's fierce protector for the rest of her life. Danny, with no memory of his mother, hardly misses her. Maeve has different memories, and finds the familial security and affectionate acceptance she longs for in her job working for Mr. Otterson. Despite graduating first in her class at Barnard with a mathematics degree, she is content to work as his bookkeeper. It's a reaction as much to their mother's absence as their father Cyril's emotional absence. Cyril has one passion, his work as a developer. He loves houses, He loves building and renovating houses. We watch how Danny's indifference toward his mother coalesces into anger. However, it is Maeve who rightly points out Cyril's shortcomings:  “Out father was a man who had never met his own wife.” (Location 2446)When Cyril remarries, his shortcomings will fall on his new wife, Andrea. In one sense, they are a good fit. Cyril is self-absorbed with his work; Andrea is self-absorbed with the house. In every other way, the marriage is a mistake, and Patchett has some fun by having Danny describe how Cyril had to work with the scant material of Sunday mass (Andrea is not Catholic) in order to escape from even more unwanted family time. Patchett's technique is subtle. Since we see Andrea through Danny and Maeve's eyes, she deflects much of the blame for Cyril's faults. It's a pattern that is unconsciously repeated: when Danny marries Celeste he notes that his own faults are often blamed on Maeve. Both Danny and Maeve are stuck in the past, but the narrative is presented in a unique way. There is almost no present-day timeline. Instead, Danny and Maeve recall a remote past through the lens of their past selves. These double-mirrored reflections skip around in time. Recollections about Fluffy (Fiona) their nursemaid who actually grew up in the house, the premature death of Cyril at age 53, and Andrea's usurpation of all of their lives occur as Danny looks back on his youth, his years in med school, and his adulthood as a developer like his father. Danny and Maeve are rooted in an obsession with the past, one that is further represented by their eerie compulsion to periodically stalk the house from curbside, speculating about the lives of Andrea and her two young daughters. Characters absent from their lives exert a powerful hold on their emotions. Danny asks Maeve at one point:  “Do you think its possible to ever see the past as it acually was?....we overlay the present onto thee past. We look through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as people we were, we're seeing it as the peeople we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” (Location 584 ).This is a beautiful book – beautiful in its structure, beautiful in the vulnerable characters it brings to life. It was the selection of our local book club."

I'm sure this is subjective, but there is just something about her writing that is just so soothing and effortless to me. This is also going to be subjective, but it also amazed me how well she wrote a man. Perhaps some of all genders think this way, but some of the lines she threw out oh-so casually seemed so very masculine:Then I remembered what my father had told me, that the things we could do nothing about were best put out of our minds. I gave it a try and found that it was easier than I imagined.AndWhat I wanted was what I had: three nights a week. And to be perfectly honest, I would have been happier with two.Last example of writing that I loved was the unintentionally hilarious sort:""I couldn't tell your sister. I couldn't make her diabetes worse.""""Knowing where your mother is doesn't make diabetes worse,"" I said, trying to apply logic to a conversation where no logic existed.The pleasure of reading it, plus the unexpected pleasure of hearing all my SEPTA stops (I live in the Philly suburbs and work in Philly), made this an absolute treat and a delight to read!The characters were rich and nuanced for sure! She might not spend a lot of time on detailed characteristics, but she makes sure to give you certain very identifiable traits that, at least for Danny, the narrator, define that particular character. The whole thing just felt like a conversation with an old friend.The crazy turns of Danny's life were also a trip to read. He was a very interesting character with an interesting life that I was definitely drawn into. And the way Patchett wrote it, skipping around in the timeline, should have been jarring but it wasn't; again, it was like talking to an old friend where they're telling you a story about when they were 30 but have to add in a detail about when they were 13 in order to inform a part of their story from when they were 30. The whole book flowed like this.I understood and appreciated the bond between siblings, it was incredibly strong throughout, like, outrageously strong. And while neither spent a lot of time talking about how much they loved the other or all the things they were so grateful to the other for doing, you could just feel it emanating up out of the words. That was powerful and moving.However, the book description sets you up for rage and not being able to let go of the past and confrontation and relationships being tested and it was never, ever that dramatic. It did have all those things, but it was never dramatic... Why would you try to make it more dramatic than it is?As I mentioned first off, there was no plot, as such. I feel guilty taking a star off for a book that was beautifully written because it wasn't 'action-packed' enough, but honestly, that's not it. I didn't need action - the coming-of-age and everyday life of these people was awesome to be a part of. It was just hard for me to grasp the point, and as a result, I don't ever see myself reading this again. I highly recommend the book, but I don't feel the need to own it, and revisit it again and again."

Their father remarries, but after he dies, their stepmother kicks Danny and Maeve out of her life and out of the house. Suddenly, all Danny and Maeve have is each other. This story explores their complicated lives and relationships.If you love Ann Patchett and her heavily character-driven stories and beautifully written literary fiction, you will likely love The Dutch House. If you’re looking for a page-turning plot, you might like to look elsewhere. If you love complicated family drama with a great deal of reflection, stick around! Danny and Maeve analyze every aspect of their childhood experiences including the domestic help, their father, the stepmother and her children, and, of course, the Dutch House.Danny is the matter-of-fact narrator and Maeve is the overprotective and, at times, controlling older sister. We feel a great deal of compassion for these siblings as we learn more about their abandonment in various ways by mom, dad, and stepmother.Thoughtful themes in The Dutch House include an incredibly close sibling relationship, the effects of abandonment on children, wealth and privilege, materialism, family loyalty, expectations, revenge, greed, compassion, childhood, and memories. If my book club reads this, one topic I’d like to discuss is the house as a symbol or metaphor for childhood. The most fascinating part of the story for me is when Danny and Maeve return to the house (parking out front) over and over again throughout their lives to reminisce about their childhood and to work through their various viewpoints and feelings. It seems to me that this is the real heart of the story.I listened to the audio of The Dutch House because I couldn’t resist Tom Hanks as the reader! He is magnificent as Danny! Honestly, this story might have been a DNF for me except for the performance of Tom Hanks. I highly recommend the audio version!Content Warning: Medical issues related to diabetesRecommended: I recommend The Dutch House for fans of Ann Patchett, for those who appreciate literary fiction, and for readers who love character-driven stories and beautiful writing.For more reviews visit my blog www.readingladies.com"
444,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,Rating 4 out of 5,"At times I was riveted, and sometimes not. Some of the sections are longer than their value to the story. The characters were well drawn so I read it quickly, mainly to see how it would end.Patchett creates a 1950's life of an upwardly mobile family. You have a ""dad"" who openly favors the son over the daughter, but neither child knows him at all. This dad is becoming wealthy in real estate but still collects his own rents in units where some tenants are struggling to pay. He is no bleeding heart, but is not oblivious to the needs of these tenants.This 1950's family lives in a neighborhood, not an estate or isolated place as is the norm today. Despite the valuable antiques and the swimming pool (today a liability if not secured) there are no gates or alarms. The family has a nanny, cook and housekeeper that relate to them and care for them (and vice versa, with the exception of the dad) as people, not just ""staff"".You also see something not often acknowledged about the 1950's: the way Protestants looked at Catholics. Also, like the 1950's there is no mention of race. The mother of this family is the only weakly drawn character. Her post-war marriage is about the only thing that seems realistic about her and her life.For the 1960's there are some references to anti-war protests, but this family does not seem to have a point of view on this. (While it is not mentioned, most likely a student deferment shelters its son.) After the clarity on the 1950's, particularly on the role of women, I was expecting more as the story moves into the 70's and 80's. Maybe there should have been some helicoptering, boomeranging or even generation gapping or just terms like dad's: ""knucklehead"". While it isn't the best pacing for a work of literature, I'm glad the ending was rushed, since I stayed with it primarily to see where it would go. If not realistic, the ending is satisfying and worth the read."
445,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887880-lorilin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Danny and Maeve have an interesting relationship with their childhood home. Named the Dutch House, their father bought the impressive but imposing house as a surprise when Danny and Maeve were young. Though the children love the house and come to think of it as their magical castle, their mother can’t stand the new home and eventually moves out, never to be heard from again. Their father soon remarries a cold woman named Andrea who loves the house…but never much cares for Danny and Maeve. When their father dies just a few years later, Andrea kicks both children out, leaving them destitute (save for a trust for future educational expenses). Danny and Maeve make their own way in the world—and do surprisingly well for themselves—but they still routinely drive back to the old neighborhood to sit in front of their former home and talk. It’s a way to support each other, but also a way to revisit and process the pain of their childhood.MY THOUGHTSThe Dutch House is all about the internal lives of characters. Told from Danny’s perspective, the reader doesn’t always get an accurate understanding of what really happened. But that is one of the main issues explored in the book, this question of what is real, what really happened, and if we can ever know the “facts” of our past when there is so much emotion layered within our memories. There are so many interesting relationships explored here—between siblings, between children and their parents, between a family and their home. It’s not a book that gives answers, but it does ask the reader to think and to question, and, more importantly, to look into the past, accept people’s limitations, and ultimately to be willing to forgive. The Dutch House is a captivating, thoughtful read, and I think it’s going to stay with me for a good long while."

Period. I don’t know if I would have liked this or finished it otherwise. It is perfection.Hanks puts 110% effort into everything he does. He embodies Danny, all the emotions, perfectly captures his POV, but yet also does an excellent job of narrating Maeve’s and the others’ POV’s as well. Pretty much he needs to make this a second career, but I digress.The book centers on the Dutch House and its main occupants, the Conroy family. Danny and Maeve are about as close as a brother and sister can get, and it was a joy to watch their relationship ebb and flow over their lifetime. Their father raised them after their mother left, and then one fateful day Andrea officially became their stepmother and she and her two children moved into the house. This created an additional strain, and she eventually exiles them from the house when their father passes away suddenly. At its core, this is a story about a family and relationships. The family led interesting lives at times, at other times not so much. What captivated me throughout was to see how both Danny and Maeve matured, and how they each relied so much on each other, because they were all each other had throughout the majority of their life. People came and went and threatened this reliance, but it was always there. I grew to love both Danny and Maeve, and in the end, was not ready for my time with them to end.I do recommend this one, as I still think about it after having finished it over a week ago. However, I highly suggest that you experience this via audiobook, I believe it is a game changer."
447,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jenniferd,Rating 5 out of 5,"this review is for the audiobook edition, narrated by tom hanks.my goodness, this is so damn great! like, seriously excellent. patchett's story and writing are pitch-perfect, and her characters are vivid. the relationship between siblings maeve and danny is the most endearing and lovely brother-sister bond i can ever recall reading - it's layered and nuanced.hanks' embodiment of danny is outstanding. his tones, expression of emotions and moods, and comedic timing are fantastic. (i mean, this isn't a comedic novel, but patchett can be quite a funny writer at moments, through dialogue or observation. hanks certainly made the most of these moments.) i guess for clarity: i am not a die-hard tom hanks fan. of course i enjoy him, and believe him to be a kind and thoughtful guy (god - hope that continues to be true). but i was not predisposed to automatically loving this story because he is the narrator. i guess that's all i'm trying to say. 😊)given our current global pandemic, and coupled with my currently dismal reading abilities, this novel has proven to be the perfect balm during a tough time. so perfect, in fact, that i finished it, then immediately started it again. then again. i am just about finished my 3rd round with the dutch house and i enjoyed each reading/listen as much as the first - perhaps even a bit more each time. it's rare for me to do any re-reading, let alone more than twice.i can't imagine loving any read more in 2020 than this one... for me, it was the perfect book at the perfect time, and a lovely, lovely experience that was very much needed."
448,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38644153-pranjal-joshi,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Banquet of Halcyon DaysPatchett romances Past in her latest work- a trope so ruminatingly written and so delicately marinated in the most exquisite word play of language. The narrative feels like the peeling of one’s own sense of loss and bereavement layer by layer; we all have stories/truncated missing pieces of the past that we find ways to recycle-repatch and share them time and again for it to be embedded in our collective memory of the bygone times like an embroidered motif on an inherited handkerchief that one feels the compulsive need to keep on touching to assure its fading presence –‘taking apart the past with a flea comb.’‘Do houses ever die of grief?’The Dutch House- the pivot of its central characters’ collective emotional past-present life is a work of art in the neo-classical/Mediterranean/French architecture, a magnificent mansion of Maeve and Danny’s childhood and an emblem of their banishment with the advent of their stepmother. It is said that writers have the craft of spinning the same story every time with different weaves and patterns hitherto, Patchett revamps the myth of the evil stepmother throwing the brother-sister duo out in the woods, with a touching story of the shatterproof sibling connection spanning decades- ‘We had made a fetish out of our misfortune….’This book can be judged by its piercing and striking cover….The character of Maeve is so impeccably written and finely detailed that made me stare its cover every time Danny revives the memory of his sister when she was a 10 year old-red-coat wearing Maeve, with a world full of possibilities laid out in front of her…A very fulfilling reading experience!

So much so that I struggle to come up with the right words to describe it, so I'll let this New York Times review do the job for me:""Patchett’s prose is confident, unfussy and unadorned. I can’t pluck out one sentence worth quoting, but how effective they are when woven together—these translucent lines that envelop you like a spider’s web.” There wasn't much I didn't love about her latest novel: the incredible bond between Danny (our narrator) and his sister, Maeve (whom I adored); the remarkable gem of a (Dutch) House they spent their childhoods in until the moment they didn't—a house that became a character unto itself; the smart way Ann hopped narratives between the present and the past in a way that almost, but never quite, lost me; and the way this book felt at once like a modern-day classic.It wasn't the fastest of reads for me, but that was okay ...it just meant that every time I picked it up, I savored anew the setting, the language, and being back with a cast of characters I came to love all the more.A great novel to kick off my fall reads, for sure. Also: I loved reading Debbie's review  after I finished—I agree with so much of it!"

I am enjoying it. There is a huge waiting list!*********************Return to Reading! February 12, 2020The focus of this novel is, as implied, a house. It is a lovely, unique, stately, yet enchanting glass structure. The setting was as fitting ,in the countryside, with few neighboring homes. Of course a home must have its inhabitants, so the reader meets the Conroys and all their associates. This is mainly about Danny and his sister, Maeve, who grew up there and had continued to persist, both in reminiscence and in actual visits to this home well into adulthood. This is something of a fairy-tale, complete with a cruel step-mother. Patchett has introduced many interesting, even likeable, characters. The narrative is told in a thoughtful, careful manner, complete with devoted relationships to friends and family, anger and forgiveness. I have continued to feel that Patchett's, Bel Canto was her best offering. As I read this book I frequently sensed that it would shamble (to coin a GR friend's term!) along pleasantly without offering much stimulation or surprise."

Due to the plethora of amazing reviews I forced myself to the end, to make sure I'd given it my all - but it felt like a chore. I listened to the audiobook and however much I love Tom Hanks (tbh he's why I got it), I can't say he helped the story for me.I normally think ""the book is always best"" but this one reminds me of my experience of reading the Handmaids Tale and being very underwhelmed but blown away by the series. I can imagine The Dutch House making a decent movie or miniseries where the characters could be given some depth, the story brought to life and the padding in the book just becoming incidental, in the background stuff. What am I missing? I am such an eclectic reader and normally enjoy meaty, character driven novels - this just didn't feel ""meaty"" to me, characters felt two dimensional, the story just went on and on and then eventually ended. I breathed a sigh of relief. I'm still interested in other books by Ann Patchett as others, who have rated this book in a similar way to me, have commented on books by Patchett that they have really enjoyed.Time to move on, can't please everyone!"

The cover is gorgeous and it's based on a portrait done of the daughter of ""the Dutch house"". I kept seeing this as a movie. It's a colorful book. Not only the spectacular house, but there would be scenes of India, medical school, home repairs, ballet and New York City which brings a million viewers. My own issue was, I kept expecting some big reveal or plot twist. All the loose ends are tied up, but there's not that many. I was thinking perhaps Maeve was the vegetable factory's longtime mistress. How did the stepmother get so evil? I expected Norma and Bright to do *something* or Sandy, Jocelyn or Fluffy would do something nebulous that bring about a happier result. Who was Elna married to, that she was still wearing a wedding ring? Or as a Catholic did she not believe in divorce? Or was she a sister and took her vows?Not that I know that much law, but I was thinking perhaps Andrea would only have use of the house for her lifetime. That was a weak part of the plot. The father was so keen on business, but not to have a will? Or a prenup for that matter."

Maeve was single and then watching Danny's family grow up. They only had each other after their mother left when they were young and their father died eventually. I know it's not saying much about the book but I'm just overwhelmed at all that was going on and all that happened and how it all came together in the end.

It is steeped in character studies and imagery. It is a novel that readers will get absorbed in, or will not finding engaging. I listened to this on audiobook, and loved Tom Hanks' narration. He took the time to give the characters the unique voice Ann Patchett developed. While, as the title suggests, this novel is about a home, it is more about what makes a home. In this case we have two siblings trying to find answers to that question. The Dutch House is a slow simmer of a read, but well worth the time.***I received a complimentary copy of this ebook from the publisher through Edelweiss.

Nie je to výtka, je to konštatovanie. Práve tým si kniha získava široké publikum. Len kde-tu prebleskli jemné rebelantské vety (opustenie rodín mužmi, poznámka na možnosti uplatnenia sa žien). Samotný dom je spojivom, tak trochu tým pripomína Dom duchov, napokon aj postavy a vzťahy mi Dom duchov niečím pripomínajú. Asi najzásadnejšiu výhradu mám voči postavám. Hoci sa zdá, že sú veľmi komplexné, po dočítaní som si uvedomila, že boli vykreslené veľmi jednotvárne. Prakticky počas celého života sa správali stále rovnako, nedošlo k ani jedinému vybočeniu."

The dynamic between these characters is so absorbing, you will get sucked into this story and look up 80 pages later. I loved all of the dysfunction as well as all the connection between Danny and Maeve and their situation with Andrea. Every single character is fleshed out and believable. There are enough surprises to keep you breathless but the heart of the story beats throughout - the indelible love between Danny and Maeve.

Perhaps Tom Hanks would’ve sweetened the pot, but I’m not an audiobook listener and doubt that I ever will be. In every single character I could not find a single trait that I admired or enjoyed, and the most I got out of this novel were the sweeping descriptions of the house and environment. On the basis of those descriptions alone it earns an extra star- I could even smell the house as it was described to me. However, this beautiful panopticon look at an architectural marvel was somewhat sullied by the throes of family drama, and so, I was left feeling disappointed by what was put forward. "

There was at once fairy tale quality to it and psychological insight conveyed despite and through the narrator's own biases and misreadings. I found Maeve heart-breaking.

475,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina-coop-a-loop,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am no fan of Ann Patchett. The Dutch House is my first read by her and probably my last. When I attended a reading by David Sedaris last November, he couldn’t praise The Dutch House enough. David Sedaris usually tries to bring attention to lesser-known authors when he is touring, but he had recently finished this book and was still caught up in its magic. Well, the magic he felt it had. Being a David Sedaris enthusiast, I too became excited about this book and finally got around to buying and reading it. Meh. Strike two, David. He also recommended Ottessa Moshfegh’s Eileen and I hated that. The Conroys live in a fabulous house, a mansion really, outside of Philadelphia. Dad is a real estate developer who has achieved the American Dream—starting poor and ending up rich through lots of hard work and persistence. There are two children, Maeve and Danny, born several years apart. When Danny is very young, his mother leaves and Danny is essentially raised by his older sister Maeve and the family’s two loyal servants, the sisters Jocelyn and Sandy. To everyone’s dismay, the father eventually remarries. His new bride, Andrea, brings discord and unhappiness to the Dutch House. The modern equivalent of the mythical evil stepmother, she successfully distances Maeve and Danny from their father (and the Dutch House) and stops them from gaining their inheritance. With only themselves to rely on, the siblings form strong bonds to each other and the past—but will these attachments prevent them from making the most of their futures? The Dutch House is brilliantly constructed, weaving past and present events into one seamless narrative. For the most part, the pace of the story is good as well. I had a difficult time putting the book down even though it is not a thriller of any kind. This is a deceptively simple story of the relationships within a family; its resentments, loyalties, acts of cruelty and carelessness, love and selflessness. I didn’t like it. To be clear: there is nothing technically wrong with the book. The prose, while I don’t find it enthralling or sparkling, is competent. Even though there is one narrator, Danny, the author cleverly presents the perspectives and memories of several characters throughout the novel. I think this book would be an excellent pick for a book club. Even though I found myself generally irritated, I wasn’t necessarily bored and some great conversations could be had about the characters. What I like best about this book is the jacket illustration of the girl wearing the red coat. It’s beautiful. When I donate this book, I may keep the dust jacket. My distaste for this novel is definitely personal, so if you want to read it don’t be turned off by my review. I have many reasons for not liking this novel. Overall, I don’t care for Patchett’s style of storytelling. I felt as if she was telling me everything and left nothing for me to discover. When a character has a change of heart, I’m explicitly told this. Patchett doesn’t merely describe the actions of the character and let me decide for myself how that character feels, I’m told flat out: X has decided to forgive Y and move on. I often felt as if I were reading a family newsletter: now the Conroys did this and did this and this is how they felt when doing these things. Maeve and Danny did this because they felt this. There wasn’t a lot of mystery left because all the motivations of the characters were so thoroughly discussed by the characters themselves. Danny’s former nanny is named Fiona. No one calls her that. She is referred to as Fluffy. She is not a dog. She is not a cat. Don’t call her Fluffy. That irritated the shit out of me. Also, adults calling their parents “mommy” and “daddy” puts my teeth on edge. Maeve—even up the age of 50+—calls her mother “mommy” through the whole novel. I formed no connection with the characters. Maeve, Danny, the parents, Andrea the evil stepmother…. I was interested enough to want to know what happened and how the story would end, but I have no strong feelings for any of them. The problem is the stakes aren’t high enough. Sure,  Andrea disinherited them, but in the end, so what? Maeve carried all that anger and resentment and hatred for years, but when their father died she already had her degree, had a stable job and could support herself. Their father, despite his incredible level of carelessness about his children and inability to see Andrea for what she was, managed to establish an education trust that Danny used to get his schooling. That in turn helped him become a successful real estate developer. No one went hungry, no one was homeless. If Danny and Maeve had truly been left penniless and the anger and hatred for Andrea had stunted and ruined their lives, the sentimental and all-too-perfect ending would have resonated more with me. But they were fine. Conversely, what would have changed if they had inherited the Dutch House and all the money? Despite Maeve’s obvious intelligence, she wasn’t ambitious. She was happy with her life as it was. Danny, the person who should have been more resentful because his dream to join his father’s company and eventually take over was completely destroyed by Andrea (and the idiocy of his father), was the most unaffected emotionally. He didn’t hold onto the anger and resentment; however, as a loyal brother who loved his sister, he did what she wanted—which was to put her plan of revenge into play by depleting the trust as much as possible. He got a medical degree he didn’t want and still followed his dream of real estate development. The actions of a jealous and resentful stepmother didn’t affect their lives in any long-term way. History looms large in this novel. In order to piece together a coherent and complete account of past events in the Dutch House, nearly all of the characters from the Conway siblings’ past (including Maeve and Danny) take their turn to relate bits of history. The stories are woven into the narrative as conversations so it’s not awkward, but the constant cycling back to the past eventually becomes exhausting and irritating. Yes, we get it. Do we really need to hear from another character about Days Past In the Dutch House? I guess I just didn’t think it was all so tragic and awful as the characters did. Constant repetition stripped the events of their drama and again—everyone pretty much  turns out a-okay.Despite the book’s title and the constant mention of the Dutch House, I didn’t have a clear picture of it. Of course, the image of the house isn’t important. The house is a symbol of frustrated dreams, hopes and how we deceive ourselves. I also thought of the house as a stand-in for the patriarch, Cyril Conroy. His decision to buy it for his bride demonstrates how little he knew her—a pattern he continued throughout his life. He never really knew his family. He took what made him happy and transferred that to his wife and kids, not understanding (or taking the time to care about understanding) their happiness. Ironically, he eventually does recognize that Andrea married him to become mistress of the Dutch House (and have his money) but he still misjudges her character enough to leave her in charge of his children and his business. I find it odd that Maeve and Danny save all their anger for Andrea and none for their father. It was his responsibility to secure their futures and he didn’t care enough to do that. I see this tendency in Danny—the obliviousness—but I think sometimes this is Celeste’s fault. She was not a young, shy bride and had been vocal about her opinions on other matters so when she tells Danny (years later) that she hated their New York City house, he’s surprised and then feels bad. I call bullshit on that. If she didn’t like the apartment, why didn’t she say so? She certainly didn’t hold back on her dislike of Maeve, so why should a building be a more difficult subject? An interesting discussion could be had on who is the villain of the story. Or does the story have a villain? The father’s lack of attention to his family caused Andrea. Andrea was the quintessential (and considering the prominent place she holds in the novel, she’s surprisingly and disappointingly undeveloped) evil stepmother. Celeste forms a deep and lasting dislike of Maeve, but that’s mostly because she’s unhappy with Danny. Is Danny a bad guy for doing what he wants and not making Celeste happy with his career choice? (I don’t think so; she wanted the superficial social status of being a doctor’s wife so her disappointment and unhappiness is her own.) Did his close relationship with Maeve stop him from being fully committed to his family? What about the mother who abandons the family to go to India to help the poor?  Andrea isn’t the villain. She’s basically a plot device to set everything in motion. Mom is the villain. She causes the most long-lasting damage to the family unit. She abandons her family to be a do-gooder in India. When this doesn’t work out the way she wanted, she travels around the world basically becoming some kind of martyr for good works. When she eventually returns and Maeve forgives her, my sympathy is 100% for Danny’s unwillingness/inability to be as gracious. As the wife of a wealthy real estate developer, she could have stayed and helped the families in Philadelphia—as she was doing before she left. Maeve defends her mother’s abandonment by saying that men does this so why shouldn’t women? “Men leave their children all the time and the world forgives them for it…They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we’re still singing about it. Our mother left and she came back and we’re fine” (297). My problem with Maeve’s argument is she is speaking of generalities—maybe those children abandoned by the fathers aren’t fine with it? We don’t know. Danny is speaking of his personal hurt, not a woman’s right to go on noble adventures just like men. And, really, they aren’t fine. The mother is described consistently throughout the novel by different characters as being a saint. I call bullshit on that too. The mother abandoned her children to the (eventual) tender mercies of Andrea because she felt that she, and ONLY she, could help save the world’s poor. That’s not being a good person or wanting to help the poor. That’s a very specific form of narcissism. Eventually, Do-Gooder Mom abandons adult Maeve for the sick and dying Andrea because Mom felt that Andrea needed her more and again, SHE was the only person who could help her. Do-Gooder Mom’s second abandonment of Maeve hurt Maeve deeply and may have caused her death. This extends the idea presented earlier in the book that Maeve’s juvenile diabetes is caused by the first abandonment. Do-Gooder Mom is despicable.The end of the novel is way too tidy for me. Patchett neatly bookends the story of the Dutch House and Do-Gooder Mom by having Mom, who fled the house when she was young because it was too fancy pants for her, return to the Dutch House to take care of Andrea—the woman who stole the house from her children. Then Danny’s now famous and successful actress daughter buys the house. Sigh. The author wraps this story up with a bow and every copy should have come with a box of Kleenex for the resulting sentimental tears. Blech. I didn’t like this book and wouldn’t read another Ann Patchett novel. Good discussions can be had over the story, but in the end, I’m left shrugging my shoulders. So what? I didn’t take anything from this novel and its exploration of family relationships didn’t present me with any new perspectives on the theme. The narrative was more about telling than showing and too neatly packaged for my tastes. "
476,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845518-f,Rating 2 out of 5,"August 28:Hi, I have been thinking about ""The Dutch House"" and I have realized that the saint-like white woman who only wants to help people and is (boo-hoo!) punished by the world for it is far too egregious for me to ignore anymore. I am lowering my rating.I did not like it when it was a plot point in the book and, thinking back about it for the past week, I REALLY do not think there was any sort of purpose for it in the novel. I am talking about, of course, EVERYTHING about Elna. Ann Patchett's reasoning for Elna's behaviour is to have everyone repeat that ""[Elna] wanted to help people!"". That is LITERALLY all the detail and reasoning that is given for everything Elna does, and somehow I am meant to think that this is saintly behaviour which excuses abandoning your children. The maids, who are hired by Elna, repeat, over and over again, that ""Poor Elna could not live in the Dutch House. She had to leave because she wanted to help people!"". First of all, this book is written by someone who has never been around a nanny, or spoken to someone who is lower class. Please talk to anyone who is required to take care of neglected children because their mother wanted to go ""help the poor"" in other countries.I mention this in my earlier review, but I genuinely hate how vague it is all phrased: ""help[ing] the poor"". You have to forgive your mother because all she wanted was to ""help the poor"". What kind of patronizing bullshit is that? Everyone who has ever met Elna gives her the same excuse. Maeve and Danny's dad seems like the most reasonable person in the book.I can understand how this is written if I felt like the author, Ann Patchett, was also criticizing Elna's behaviour, but I did not get that from ""The Dutch House"". Everyone in the novel is more or less okay with the vaguest, most absurd ""Elna went away from 30+ years because she wanted to help people"" because... everyone in that book is stupid? I cannot say. I absolutely LOVE that Maeve forgives Elna, and has long conversations with her about their past, and Danny, our narrator, is never privy to those conversations. How convenient.I am leaving my original review up, but I have realized that I don't like how the book unfolded or ended anymore. I stand by what I said: it was engaging enough that I did not want to put it down. But that does not mean that it was good, and that does not mean that, once I had finished reading it, I did not feel absolute disappointment. I might also remove ""Bel Canto"" from my TBR list. We'll see.August 22:It’s hard to rate “The Dutch House”. I believe it’s a 3.5 rating but I’m marking it higher because I liked well enough that I needed to finish it as soon as I started reading it.Please be warned, there are major spoilers for “The Dutch House” in my review.You have a self-sacrificing, savior-complex of a mother Elna, who sets this whole thing in motion. You can blame the Dutch House or Cyril but, well, Elna is the one who leaves. You have two kids: Maeve and Danny who are so stunned and stunted by their mother’s departure that it defines their childhood. Their father’s remarriage defines their teenagehood. Being summarily kicked out of the Dutch House by Andrea defines their adulthood. They spend their lives either in the Dutch House or parked outside of it, reliving their times, trying to move on, but kind of failing, and then finally, actually moving on.There is a lot that feels disjointed and unedited in ""The Dutch House"". It moves back and forth in its narrative which I do not mind, and actually enjoy! But the story itself, the personalities and characteristics change a lot. For one, the novel's religious overtones came out of left field. I just don’t buy the reasoning Elna gives for being gone, nor the reasons she gives for coming back. Maeve mentions once that their mother likes going to church, and when she comes back it is her entire personality. It feels sudden and out-of-the-blue because religion is mentioned only in passing, and only barely. I can barely justify it by thinking that, well, Danny is not religious, his sister is, and this is Danny’s story so we do not see the importance of religion in their lives. If that’s the truth, then have the story from Maeve’s perspective.But we don’t. This is what I mean by the book being disjointed and unedited: so much is just up in the air and unexplained and I am supposed to go with the flow. Make the book longer and explore everything you want to explore.I can understand coming back to take care of Andrea. That is, frankly, the kind of batshit nice thing that my mother would do and which would drive me insane. But she did not even know that Andrea was sick? She just decided to come back and see her kids because, I don't know, she has been in the United States without them for too long. But to live in that house again, the house she abandoned her children in, and consider it a penance because now she’s taking care of Andrea? Where did that come from? Nothing in that book made sense.Back to Elna, this mythical figure who drives and causes so much of the novel's action: Elna travels to India, to Mexico City, to other countries wanting to go help the poor. That is literally how it is phrased, your mother has left to go “help the poor”. And Elna is upset and disillusioned when she travels to India and instead of toiling in hospitals, she is sent to the big embassy parties and gatherings to ask wealthy people who live there for money. The Indians/Mexicans who work in these charities and hospitals DO NOT want her in their hospitals fucking shit up for them. They do not need a LITERAL UNTRAINED HAND to work in the hospitals with them. They have nurses for that. They want someone who can booze and schmooze and get them the funds that they needed. And Elna was UPSET about that. She travels from one developing country to another hoping it'll be different. It is ""Eat, Pray, Love"" except the female character only visits countries in need, has abadoned two children at home, and is actually a woman who want to discover herself with the vague notion ""helping the poor""! Ridiculous.I just wish that part was emphasized even more. God, I would hate, and I do hate, knowing that someone with, once again, this savior complex is going to think “Gosh, Elna truly WAS a saint like Jocelyn, Sandy, and Fluffy kept saying! She’s amazing! I should do that!”. For the longest time, I thought Patchett would criticize Elna, not even just for the fact that she abadoned her children, but for the damaging notion she had about developing countries. She just books a yacht, and travels to India one day. Like, that is her grand plan. I thought that a book written in 2019 was building to this big idea about how dangerous these ""old"" white saviour ideas are. And yet, life disappoints once again.Reality check: if you travel to third world countries to ""help"" them, and leave your kids for, you will not get to live in a massive house as penance. Please read any article about the dangers of white peace corps volunteers cause in the countries they visit before you think what Elna did was so amazing. Look up volun-tourism. Really, what I think everyone should focus on is what Maeve and Danny kept saying: were there not poor people closer by? She could have worked in churches, orphanages, rehab centres in the United States. She could have gone to school and studied to be a nurse or volunteered all her time at the church. But no. Going to where the brown people are makes white people feel better, so of course, she left on a boat and was not seen by her kids for 30 years.Also, Let us return to the fact that this took place in the 1960s and Elna was married to a man who was alright with her sleeping out of the house for weekends at a time because she was helping out at orphanages. I kind of forgot to be surprised at that until I ended the book. It really is surprising. Cyril was actually extremely kind for that.Additionally, Elna had two maids at home. If she was that angry at Cyril for, I don't even know, providing for her and buying her a beautiful home, then she could have spent all her time cooking for the vague, unnamed orphanages she apparently went to every weekend. She could have taken her kids with her to teach them to be more helpful and kind. I don't know. Patchett's entire premise is flimsy and reads like a voyeuristic view of what she thinks a well-meaning rich person would do.I am the kind of person who goes through her history with a fine-tooth comb. I find it hard to forgive, and even harder to forget. Forgiving Elna and bringing her back into the fold? Could not be me. But, maybe, if I was 50 years old like Maeve. If I had been like Maeve, 30 years on, and pretty starved for the attention of a mother. Maybe I could understand forgiving Elna and letting her back into my life.It was a bittersweet ending for “The Dutch House”, but I would still recommend reading it. I am giving it 4 stars in spite of Elna, her thinking, her presence, her “selflessness” which, in fact, is merely selfishness disguised as sainthood. Maybe I don’t understand Catholicism enough to judge Elna’s actions."

This book was selected as our August book club selection so I went into it blind, and I was pretty much hooked from the beginning. I read this in one day. The story centers on Danny and Maeve two siblings who had the fortune (or unfortune) to grow up in the stately manor known as the Dutch house. The house is dark and gothic and is essentially a character. Their childhoods center around this house, their mother left because of the house, and when they are forced to eventually leave the house they can't keep away. What is the pull? Why does it matter? Maeve and Danny are two ultimately flawed and relatable characters, both of whom I grew to really enjoy - throughout the book they never grow apart and have a great sibling bond even as their lives change. A fantastic book with great ""villains"" and thoughtful questions. It's a title I will definitely think about often. "
479,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23473417-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book gave me a strange reading experience. Once the book was down, it would be a few days before I would pick it up again and I would have to force myself to delve back in, however, once I had picked it back up, I was completely absorbed and couldn't put it back down! I have never had a reading experience like it before.The book itself was a brilliant study of character; Danny and Maeve were wonderfully complex characters that grew throughout. I liked Maeve at the beginning but, as the book went on, I could see her selfishness amplified through Danny's actions and, at the end, I thought she was just simply a bitter woman without a purpose. I really enjoyed the expanse of time in the book, ranging from childhood up to late adulthood and that it was a good analysis of life itself, however, I did feel that it was a book where not much happened, just life which I guess is a good thing and the point? It was the structure that I felt let it down in places, especially when it came to the flashbacks as I didn't feel they were clear cut enough and I found myself having to go back and reread when I realised that I wasn't reading the same time frame.Overall I think this is a really accomplished book that is one where characters are explored in depth as well as life itself. It is one that will stay with me as it gave me a unique reading experiences that still confuses me even now!"
480,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25352638-theresa-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,"‘There is no story of the prodigal mother. The rich man didn’t call for a banquet to celebrate the return of his erstwhile wife. The sons, having stuck it out for all those years at home, did not hang garlands on the doorways, kill the sheep, bring forth the wine. When she left them she killed them all, each in his own way, and now, decades later, they didn’t want her back. They hurried down the road to lock the gate, the father and his sons together, the wind whipping at their coats. A friend had tipped them off. They knew she was coming and the gate must be locked.’This novel is divine. You know how you can sometimes stumble across a novel and it seems as though it has been written to perfectly match your tastes and moods; a six out of five star read. That is what this one is for me. Perfection.‘But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.’The narrative is character driven, and while there is a plot, it is not something that I could easily sum up if asked what this novel is about. Instead, my answer would be that it is about a brother, a sister, and a lost house and it is utterly fantastic and you should read it. As soon as possible. However, you probably want a little bit more than that. Nevertheless, can I just point out, it is Ann Patchett, and for me, that alone speaks volumes. She writes so well. What she does with words is remarkable and that is why there are so many quotes in this review. Her own words should tell you all you need to know about this novel.‘The idiocy of what we took and what we left cannot be overstated. We packed up clothes and shoes I would outgrow in six months, and left behind the blanket at the foot of my bed my mother had pieced together out of her dresses. We took the books from my desk and left the pressed-glass butter dish in the kitchen that was, as far as we knew, the only thing that had made its way from that apartment in Brooklyn with our mother. I didn’t pick up a single thing of my father’s, though later I could think of a hundred things I wished I had: the watch that he always wore had been in the envelope with his wallet and ring. It had been in my hands the whole way home from the hospital and I had given it to Andrea.’Danny narrates the Dutch House in a hindsight fashion, walking us through his life from infancy to the present day when he is a man in his forties. Yet, this is not just Danny’s story, and such is the skill of Ann Patchett that she is able to convey just as much about Maeve, Danny’s older sister, as she is about Danny himself via his gaze. I really liked both of these siblings, as well as their relationship, and over the course of the novel, I became so invested in their combined fate. What happens to them after their father dies is very shabby, and I have to say, I never accepted or forgave Andrea’s treatment of them. When Maeve and the family solicitor came up with their ultimate plan for revenge, I really got a lot of enjoyment out of it. That Danny went along with it was such a testimony to his love for Maeve. It is a certain type of person who can put his or her own dreams and ambitions aside to fulfil another’s destiny.‘There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.’No commentary on this novel would be complete without touching on the topic of their mother, whose absence was a looming presence throughout, a thorn that could not be dislodged. When she reappears, decades after leaving, Maeve and Danny have very different reactions. I was able to fully appreciate each one’s view, but I was firmly in Danny’s court on the issue. I could not forgive her and her reasons for having left in the first place just gave me further reason to not forgive her. I know what it is like to be living a life removed from what you thought you would be, but when you have children, you press on. You live it anyway, and then you go and do what you want after. The disappearing mother is a bit of trigger for me. Maybe that is part of why I loved this novel so much; I could relate to it so well.‘Making a mistake is not giving the floorboards enough time to settle before you seal them. Abandoning your children to go help the poor of India means you’re a narcissist who wants the adoration of strangers.’Although, I will say, being in a position where your husband just buys a mansion, still filled with the previous occupants’ belongings, even down to the clothes and kitchen utensils, and then presents it to you as a fait accompli; well, that is something else. There is a lot within this novel about the loss of agency over one’s own life. Their father took away their mother’s agency, and he repeated that with Maeve, who in turn took away Danny’s. An interesting cycle that Patchett played out with precision. I love this quote from Maeve:‘God’s truth,’ Maeve said. ‘Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.’So I loved this novel. And obviously, I recommend The Dutch House whole-heartedly. It is one of the rare few that I may read again.Thanks is extended to Bloomsbury Australia for providing me with a copy of The Dutch House for review."

483,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4834343-martha,Rating 5 out of 5,"In this Rags-to-Riches-to-Rags-to-Riches novel, Danny recounts how his life (and every other character's life) has been shaped by The Dutch House, an architectural marvel in suburban Philadelphia. The house has a magnetism that pulls every inhabitant to the brink. Danny and his older sister Maeve are forever impacted by the house and what it means to them individually and as a family.After WW2, Danny's father, Cyril, quietly acquired The Dutch House, despite being essentially penniless. He had been looking for a way to enter the real estate market and this crumbling estate was his way in. When he presented the elaborate home, complete with a small staff, to his wife Elna,  she was repulsed by the grandiose gaudiness of it all. It went against everything she believed and what she thought that they believed together, as a couple.As a result of this non-meeting-of-the-minds, Danny and Maeve were raised motherless. Eventual victims of Andrea, the evil step-mother, Danny and Maeve are banished from the premises. But the Dutch House never really leaves their minds as they regularly park near the house to conspire about their futures and reminisce.For me, Patchett has either left me singing from the rooftops or utterly disappointed. This is the former. I loved every word and I had to slowly dole out chapters to myself so as not to read it all in one go. It is beautiful in all ways. I especially loved Danny as the narrator, too much like his father in his lack of forgiveness and metered doses of affection. But ultimately it is Maeve who will stay fixed in my mind for a long time to come."

486,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2454496-dustin-the-wind-crazy-little-brown-owl,Rating 5 out of 5,"A novel about holding on, and letting go.I'm a fan of the magical writing of Ann Patchett and The Dutch House is no exception. A beautiful story of connections - the significant places and people that impact our life. I was impressed with the legacy of Cyril Conroy - of how he remembered the lessons of being poor, even after becoming rich, of how he treated people and how this legacy particularly affected his son, Danny. Maeve and Danny have a wonderful sibling relationship.I believe that as seen with The Dutch House, certain places can have ""ghosts"", kept alive by memories and stories. Favorite Passages:The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house's architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived. Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on.________Not only could you see into the Dutch House, you could see straight through it.________""The house is a piece of art.""_______""The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor. . . . . That's the strike you have against you. . . . I don't know how a person overcomes a think like that. You can watch these people all you want and see what it's been like for them, but that's not the same as living it yourself.""_______""The biggest lie in business is that it takes money to make money. Remember that. You've got to be smart, have a plan, pay attention to what's going on around you. None of that costs a dime.""_______When I'm in a charitable mood, I look back on this moment and I tell myself that this was the reason things played out the way they did. My father was trying to give me the benefit of his experience.My father was always more comfortable with his tenants than he was the people in his office or the people in his house.________They had all become characters in the worst part of a fairy tale.________Maeve and I were forever under the impression that we were moments away from cracking the code on our life, and that soon we would understand the impenetrable mystery that was our father . . .________The basement of the house was from another century. It bore no relationship to the structure that sat on top of it. In certain corners the walls devolved into piles of dirt. I had once found an arrowhead there. I would have dug around for more but the truth was I didn't like the basement myself.""Why do you come down here?"" Norma asked, half in horror, half in wonder.""I'll show you.""____""Do you think it's possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" I asked my sister.. . .""I see the past as it actually was,"" Maeve said. She was looking at the trees.""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""____The problem, I wanted to say, was that I was asleep to the world. Even in my own house I had no idea what was going on.____There was no extra time in those days and I didn't want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that's where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.____""They put his knee on backwards. You remember that.""Someone put his knee on backwards?"" I shook my head. ""That must have been before my time.""Maeve thought about it for a minute. I could see her scrolling through the years in her mind. ""Maybe so. He meant it to be funny but I have to say when I was a kid I thought it was true. His knee really did bend the wrong way. He used to go to orthopedists all the time, trying to get it to bend the other way I guess. When I think of it now it's kind of horrifying."". . . .""Even if the surgeon put the knee on backwards, which, of course, isn't possible, we should probably be grateful he didn't amputate that leg. That happens all the time in war, you know. It takes a lot more time to save something than it does to cut if off.""Maeve made a face. ""It wasn't the Civil War,"" she said, as if amputation had been abandoned after Appomattox. ""I don't think they even did surgery on his knee. He said in France the doctors were in such a hurry that they didn't always pay attention. Things got turned around. Really, it's kind of touching that he could even make a joke about it.""____A kid with a backpack full of bricks kept turning to say something to his girlfriend, and every time he did he clocked me with the full weight of his possessions. ____The universe might have been expanding but the luggage rack was not.____Maeve looked back out the window to the house. ""Celeste has beautiful children,"" Maeve said.""Thank you.""""They look nothing like her.""Oh, would that we had always lived in a world in which every man, woman and child came equipped with a device for audio recording, still photography, and short films.____""Since when did you ever take a poetry class?"" I asked once we had climbed back in the car.""Since I saw her shove a book of poetry in her bag."" Maeve cranked up the car's useless heater. ""So What?""____On my way to look for a pick-up game at Mount Morris I became the sole beneficiary to an inheritance greater than my father's business or his house. My entire life snapped into sudden Technicolor clarity: I needed a building, specifically the one on 120th near Lenox, in order to be who I was meant to be.____The line was quiet for minute.

As soon as I said it, I understood what we were talking about._________After all those years of banging on a locked door, I found the door wide open._________Maeve and I had been playing tennis over at the high school when she broke up the game after a single crack of lightning. I had an aluminum racquet and she said she wasn't about to watch me get electrocuted during a serve, so we got in the car and drove to the Dutch House, just to check on things before dark.____I had remembered my life very clearly even since Fluffy cracked me open with the spoon.____""There was this horrible, feral smell, like a wild animal and the shit of that animal and the dead cousin of that animal all at the same time.""____""Fluffy said she'd just been passing through and she wondered if we still lived in the house.""""And you said No, I just stalk the place.""____After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow become miraculously unstuck, moving forward in time just like everyone else.____""I was afraid of the house. I kept thinking the VanHoebeeks were still in there, that they were ghosts. I just couldn't imagine the place without them, even if they were dead. I could barely make myself dart in there once a week and look around at the height of the day, so I didn't know the raccoons had eaten their way into the ballroom with all those fleas. They must have just hatched because there were no fleas when the banker came and there were no fleas when the Conroys came to see the house, but by the time they moved in the fleas were everywhere, you could see them hopping around in the rugs, on the walls. I wouldn't have blamed them if they'd put me out on the spot.""________As we stood there shoulder to shoulder, the dishes done and the most frustrating mystery of my life resolved, I remembered that this was the woman who had hit me once when I was a child.

I thought of what a better life it would have been had Fluffy gotten her way.________I could have been in that building every waking hour, every day of the year, and still not made all the necessary repairs: uncontrollable steam heat, illegal garbage disposals, one tenant whose daughter flushed an orange down the toilet to see if it would go, another who left her door open so her cat could shit in the hall, and the terrier two doors down who would always find the shit and gobble it up and vomit on the hall floor.

He said it was because Mr. Otterson's family was Swedish. ""Cold-weather people,"" he said. He saw Mr. Otterson as the Willy Wonka of produce. Once he was satisfied by a day of watching peas being sealed into plastic bags, Maeve would return him to his grandparents, where he would immediately call his mother tell her he wanted to work in vegetables. ________""Let's go to the house,"" Maeve said once we were back in my car.""Really?""""We've never gone over there this time of day.""""We've never done anything this time of day.""________A brigade of nutcrackers could come pouring out of the dark hedges at any minute and be met by a battalion of mice.

Then I realized she was my mother.Maeve's heart attack had lured her out from beneath the floorboards. She had not been there for graduations or our father's funeral. She had not been there when we were told to leave the house. She wasn't at my wedding or at the births of my children or at Thanksgiving or Easter or any of the countless Saturdays when there had been nothing but time and energy to talk everything through, but she was there now, at Abington Memorial Hospital, like the Angel of Death.

She pulled one out then handed me the pack so I could decide for myself, then she handed me the lighter. Soon we were each blowing smoke out of our respective windows.""As good as that dinner was, this cigarette might be better,"" I said.""If you did an autopsy on me right now you would find I am nothing but dark meat and gravy, with maybe a tiny vein of mashed potatoes inside my right arm.""

We had to keep it all in the closet with us.""____I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn't miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen, the ship in the waves of the grandfather clock rocking the minutes away.____There was no distance between them, no recrimination. They were living together in their own paradise of memory.____I was looking at my wife and for just a second I saw her, the round blue eyes and yellow hair. The woman I had known for more than half my life floated in front of me, and just as quickly she vanished.____I wanted to see the past. I got out of the car and stood in front of the Dutch House again, and my mother came and stood beside me. For that moment it was the two of us, me and Elna. I would never have believed it would happen.As for what was coming, we were not made to wait . . .When she saw us there she raised her hands and began slapping them hard against the glass, her mouth opened in a rounded howl. I'd heard that sound in emergency rooms late at night: a knife pulled out, a child dead . . . We were frozen, the two of us outside and Maeve in the car, waiting for the moment when the whole front of the house would shatter into a million knives and she would come for us like the fury of hell itself.____""I had this dream once,"" Maeve said to me, and I started to laugh.____In my dreams, the intervening years were never kind to the Dutch House. I was certain it would have become something shabby in my absence, the peeling and threadbare remains of grandeur, when in fact nothing of the sort had happened. The house looked the same as it did when we walked out thirty years before."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” A slice of life book that touched the right chord with me. Narrated by Tom Hanks - Danny came to life along with Maeve, May, Andrea and Celeste. In life, objects become symbols and grow so much more in importance that it changes the lives of people. The author takes that premise to spin a beautiful melancholic tale of growing up and old - revisiting history through the prism of the dutch house.Danny and Maeve view the Dutch house as their happy place from which they were displaced by their stepmother Andrea. The Hansel and Gretel reference does not go unnoticed in the way they keep picking the breadcrumbs of memory to keep coming back to it at different stages of their lives. Their mother who abandoned them found the house an indulgence that was against her values and their dad saw it as a symbol of love. Andrea, the stepmother, viewed the house as a possession and what she wanted for her children. The relationships are close to reality and it feels as if the brother-sister bond makes everything else a side story. Nothing wrong, but then the other characters don't stand a chance to shine through. Felt connected to the story and hence loved it."

I learned about Ann Patchett couple of years back when her Commonwealth kept coming at me every day on Goodreads. I can only hope that her other books are as compelling as this one, because I may have found a new favorite contemporary author! Speaking of compelling, The Dutch House is just the right amount of drama, mystery and darkness. I was drawn to this book because of its title. Who is the girl on the cover? Is she Dutch? Doesn't look like it. It reminded me of Girl with a Pearl Earring. Is it like The House of the Spirits? So many questions only based on the title and the cover, I knew I had to read it and I was not disappointed. This is a story of a family, but cleverly intertwined with a history of a house. The book follows the perspective of Danny, a young boy growing up with his family in the Dutch house. His father, rich real estate entrepreneur, bought this lavish estate in the suburbs as a surprise for his wife. But the thing is - the wife and mother is nowhere to be found. Danny and his sister Mauve have a strained relationship with their father, which is slowly untangled for us as we learn more about the Dutch house. Danny and Mauve are wonderfully written characters and I had no choice but to sit back and admire Ann Patchett's crafting skills. Danny was sensitive introvert, while Mauve was self-assured, loving and protective sister. I loved their relationship! They often joined in an exploration of the history, craving to learn more and scared of what is true. They had such a deep impact on each others lives that everyone around them felt isolated and less important. Growing up without a mother and a distant father, left the siblings only to each other. Ann Patchett slowly revealed clues and details that Danny's and Mauve's emotional issues have gradually emerged only by the end of the book. Shocking revelations were done so discreetly that I had to go back to read the jaw-dropping sentences one more time. Even if, for any reason, you don't enjoy the story, there is no way that you could overlook Patchett's talent.This is a psychological portrait of abandonment and its consequences. All wrapped in a story of a house. If you enjoy metaphors, looking for hidden meanings and reading between the lines - this should go on your must-read-right-now list!I got this edition through Edelweiss, thanks to Harper Collins!"
492,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44143662-evie-braithwaite,Rating 4 out of 5,"On the simplest level, ‘The Dutch House‘ by Ann Patchett tells the story of a Gatsbyesque mansion and, across five decades, captures the indelible bond between brother and sister. In a rags-to-riches move into a glorious, neo-classical home, it should be the beginning of a comfortable, happy life for the Conroy family. However, the house harbours family tensions behind its luxurious façade. Danny and Maeve’s mother flees without warning when they’re both still young, leaving them with their cold, distant father. Enter evil stepmother, Andrea, and her precious daughters and the end of Danny and Maeve’s childhood follows suit.‘The Dutch House’ is a slow burn, yet incredibly immersive. It begins with Danny’s memory of the first time he met his requisite wicked step-mother, Andrea. This almost has a fairytale quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change. Indeed, she separates the siblings from their father, their house, and everything they hold dear. Accordingly, we see how Danny and Maeve make a ritual of parking outside their former home. For decades, the grand old mansion acquires an emblematic role in their lives: it represents their childhoods, their father, his marriage. Yet, as Danny continues to recall the memories of his youth, he questions the very veracity of them:“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”As he grows older, he reassesses certain moments and figures of his past, discovering hidden complexities in what had first appeared to be unremarkable occurrences. The glass-walled Dutch House may offer every passer-by a glimpse inside, but the truth it contains is obscured.Family sagas never fail to captivate me, and from the first page to last, I’m invested in their characters. In ‘The Dutch House’ I resonated with Maeve in particular: flawed, funny, unapologetic. But all the characters who populate this book are memorable. The house itself even becomes a character in some ways. Patchett doesn’t waste words with architectural descriptions but brings specific features of the mansion to the forefront: Maeve’s window seat, the looming paintings hanging the walls, the grand staircase, she leaves the rest up to us.Overall, Patchett spins a true family epic that digs realistically into false memories, what it’s like to look back on places and people as an adult; a meditation on growing up, forgiveness, and mistakes. A spellbinding book with subtle mystery that anyone who loves family sagas will enjoy.Thank you Tandem Collective and Bloomsbury UK for my free copy in exchange for an honest review!"

Zupełnie nie wiem dlaczego, bo nie przypominam sobie, bym w ogóle o tej książce cokolwiek czytała. Z nieznanych przyczyn nazwisko Patchett spowodowało, że wrzuciłam tę książkę do worka książek 'nie dla mnie'. Zbyt lekkie? Zbyt proste? Zbyt wtórne?Jednak udzieliło się mi oczekiwanie polskiej premiery i postanowiłam sprawdzić nie tylko, czym jest ten Dom, ale o co chodzi z tą Patchett. No i proszę. Skończyłam i od razu wyruszyłam wirtualnie na zakupy po kolejne książki autorki. Czy mogę nazwać się nową fanką? Jeszcze nie wiem. Ale z pewnością Patchett rozbudziła we mnie przyjemność zanurzania się we wciągających książkach, które pisane są swobodnie, jakby opowieści te czekały na spisanie. Książkach, które w zasadzie nie zachwycają warstwą językową (tu nie oznacza się fragmentów, tu się namiętnie przewraca kartki), ale jednocześnie nie ma się w nich za bardzo do czego przyczepić. 'Dom Holendrów' opowiada o dwójce rodzeństwa na tle ich rodzinnego domu, który staje się pełnoprawnym bohaterem opowieści. To w tym domu Danny i Maeve się wychowują. To z niego ucieka ich matka (motyw matki marnotrawnej 👌). To w nim żyją ze zdystansowanym ojcem. To do niego przeprowadza się nowa partnerka ojca z córkami, by wprowadzić nowe zasady (kolejna zabawa motywami). I to w końcu przed nim, w samochodzie, po wielu latach Maeve i Danny przeprowadzają bardziej i mniej ważne rozmowy. 'Dom...' to dla mnie przede wszystkim piękna opowieść o rodzeństwie. Opowieść, w której porzucenie zderza się z lojalnością, chłód z ciepłem, egoizm z empatią, smutek z nadzieja. To historia pełna kontrastów, które nadają jej żywotności.To elegancka, niewymuszona proza, która nie ucieka w tani sentymentalizm. Patchett nie boi się nadawać swoim bohaterom negatywnych cech. Nie boi się włączać w opowieść ich pomyłek. Nie boi się iść czasem na skróty, dopuścić się pewnych uproszczeń. Nie boi się bawić chronologią, jednocześnie trzymając się złożoności i rozwoju relacji między bohaterami. I robi to z dużą świadomością i dojrzałością.Ann Patchett w mojej opinii fajnie łączy literaturę piękną z literaturą obyczajową. Plasuje się gdzieś pomiędzy literaturą popularną a wyższą. Jest świetną opowiadaczką, kreatorką bohaterów i kierowniczką ich losów. Przypomniała mi, czym jest czytanie dla samego czytania, pełnej rozrywki, wnikania w odrębne światy i tej ekscytacja towarzyszącej połykaniu kolejnych stron. Bardzo mi się ta Patchett podoba."

Afterall, who’s family doesn’t have drama? I was unimpressed with the first half. It was slow. Not much happened. It was just siblings Danny and Maeve reminiscing about all the bad times and forming a strong bond due to being abandoned by their mother, then suffering the cliché evil step mother. The one trait almost all characters shared were that they were clamped up. It was layer upon layer of ice. There are all these gaping questions, with plenty of people around who have answers and yet no-one wants to really ask or tell. That made tough reading for me. I need at least a trickle of meltwater to keep me amused. Half the bookclub agreed that the first half was less engaging but the others liked the slow build up of tension. Everyone agreed that the writing was good, the picture was well-painted. The message touched a few notes. I will just state early, the ratings were 4, 4, 4, 3.5 and my 2.5. It could be that I had just had a tooth removed during my uni break and wasn’t in the mood for hating a whole bunch of awful characters (other than the siblings). It could be that abandonment is an issue in my immediate family (I won’t get into that) therefore I couldn’t accept some key turn of events. Having said that there is one Maeve-like and three Danny-like people in my family, (in relation to the original Mrs Conroy). I really don’t think the ending was believable and it spoiled some of the build up. Christians may be more accepting of the ending but I thought “not a chance”. As expected, one of us said that what the kids went through was not good but why do mothers get judged more harshly than fathers who don’t take responsibilty for their children.Another related to Maeve from a diabetic point-of-view. But was sick and couldn’t elaborate too much.The others thought everything was viable and that families do crazy things to eachother and how trauma is generational.So at the end of the day, it was easy to read, I rolled my eyes several times but not as much as usual, the second half was faster paced and more interesting, though became ridiculous, it did get me thinking about the generational abandonment issues in my family (so that could be good or bad but probably more bad as I have moved on from all that and don’t want to go back there). I would suggest it for bookclubs, grief-lovers, and family-drama-lovers. "
495,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889162-marlene,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel presents an intimate portrait of a dysfunctional family including two siblings, Danny and Maeve, who find the sense of “home” in each other when their parents failed to nurture them. Their mother believed that her social responsibilities always came first even to the point of neglecting her family and eventually abandoning her children. Their confusion multiplied when their emotionally distant father brings a new wife and her two young daughters into the house. This stilted situation led Maeve and Danny to find refuge in their relationships with the maids and nanny. They were forced to grow up earlier as they navigated the uncharted childhood losses that bound them together and indelibly changed them forever. The setting of “The Dutch House” begins with a grand mansion, where former residents had died leaving behind their belongings including their portraits hanging on the walls. The house is such a strong and important part of the story that it plays the part of another character. As life moved on and Danny and Maeve thought they moved on as well but they couldn’t. A special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house because it gave them hope that one day their mother might return. Even when they are forced to physically leave, they never actually left and the house never left them but it left a vulnerable scar on their minds and souls. Even as adults it became their routine for years to stop their cars in front of the Dutch House watching for any activity inside or out. The story is narrated by Danny and the audio book is told through the fantastic and perfect voice of Tom Hanks. The subtle jumping between time-lines was confusing at times. Patchett’s insights into the complexities of family and her observations of human nature are exceptional. The author’s smooth writing style, vivid characterizations and amazing story-telling ability kept me totally captivated throughout."

Fast forward three months and here we all are, barely able to leave our homes, much less think of moving across the globe. Joke’s on me. I did move to a new place, though. Now this new pad and I are joined at the hip.This book is also about moving, specifically, the eviction of two young people by their stepmother. I should have been getting Cinderella and Snow White vibes, but it put me more in mind of The Sound of Music (novice reluctantly leaves the convent when love comes knocking), The Royal Tenenbaums (tragic, deadpan siblings), and Franny and Zooey (it’s been too long, but I think tragic, deadpan siblings as well). What it reminded me of most, though, was Kawabata’s Beauty and Sadness, with memories immortalized in a mythology that keeps the nostalgic rememberers trapped, forever looking aft.A page-turner with an easy flow, but what sunk this for me was the dry, unsophisticated writing and mood. This is not the style that I’ve admired in other books by Patchett. I found it monotonous and bland, with the narrator endlessly droning on in an indifferent catalog of the bric-a-brac of his life. The schtick is two adult siblings sitting in a car outside their childhood home, practically stalking it, for decades, nursing their very boring lifelong grudges. So much repetition of fetishized anecdotes, like a dog sucking a bone to nothing, while key and profound questions are left unengaged. There’s no momentum or beauty, and I didn’t believe in any of it.Though I did kind of enjoy imagining that I was getting to see how Edna Pontellier’s children turned out, learning what they really thought of their mother’s abandonment at middle age. But those were my flights of fancy, not the author’s."

Let’s start with a random thought first- it felt a little strange reading a book narrated by a man! I realized that a majority of the books I read are centered on female characters, so I definitely took note of the male presence here.It’s a book about a brother and sister, Danny and Maeve, the house they grew up in, and their family dynamics. The house is such a looming character in this novel and I felt they were obsessed with it, both in the past and the present.I really enjoyed reading about the relationship between Maeve and Danny and the way they took care of each other. She was his main family and he was hers. As the oldest, I’ve always felt like the second mother and guardian of my siblings, and so I could relate to Maeve in that way.The timeline was a little confusing for me as this book takes place across several decades and Danny is often jumping around in time as he’s telling their story. And as much as the house was such an important figure, while I could kind of picture it, I couldn’t fully visualize all of the elements. I think maybe that’s why I struggled a little with this book. While the house did seem wonderful, I found it difficult to connect with their obsession with the house. I found their childhood fascinating and compelling, but as they got older, I think I lost a bit of interest. Patchett does have that cleverly quiet writing style that I enjoy, but this novel didn’t fully grab me the way I was hoping it would. And I’ll end with a quick note about the cover- I love it! It’s so striking and I wonder if it is actually a real painting."

Il padre Cyril si risposa con Andrea, una matrigna degna di Cenerentola. L’unico momento in cui Cyril dimostra vicinanza a Danny è durante i weekend quando se lo porta in giro come aiutante a riscuotere gli affitti nelle varie proprietà, gettando le basi per quello che sarà anche il suo lavoro e passione: le case e la compravendita di immobili. Le case, anzi la casa olandese, presente fin dal titolo, è una presenza ingombrante, opprimente, che sa conservarsi e sopravvivere ai suoi abitanti, quasi una Hill House con una volontà propria.Un romanzo bellissimo, con protagonisti memorabili (Maeve su tutti), che parte in sordina e conquista lentamente e che parla senza banalità di famiglie e dei danni provocati dall’incomunicabilità, dal disinteresse, ma anche della necessità di mettere da parte i rancori quando si è costretti a perdonare, il tutto senza tanta retorica."

501,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,The Dutch House is a gaudy mansion built to announce the newly acquired wealth of a 19th century family. It is the manifestation of the aspirations of an ambitious WWII vet. It is the crushing weight that threatens to destroy his young wife who longs to serve among the poor. It is the shimmer that lures an avaricious young woman into the role of second wife and step mother. It is the magnetic pull that draws and constantly realigns the lives of two aging siblings who grew up beneath its roof. The Dutch House is not so much a character in this family story as it is a force that blindly pulls and pushes the characters who encounter it. The power it exerts does not distort but rather brings into sharp relief the personality and disposition of each character. This is a slow book with an understated emotional voice. The characters do not develop significantly. Most have little to no depth. Those whose behaviors are the most incomprehensible early in the book remain an enigma throughout. 
502,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13040717-louise,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've loved every Ann Patchett book I've read, and this is no exception. It's the story of two siblings, Danny and Maeve, whose mother who has fled to India to help the poor, leaving her children with their successful, property-developer father in an ostentatious house (the Dutch house of the title) to be nurtured by the household help—Fluffy, Sandy and Jocelyn. Their father weds Andrea, who, it soon becomes clear, is a scheming, greedy stepmother. When their father dies, Andrea takes everything to which Danny and Maeve were entitled, including the house. But this is more than a story of wicked stepmothers. It's about wealth, greed and forgiveness, about good men who don't know how to be husbands and fathers, and about women exercising power in the only way they can. Mostly, though, it's a story about sibling love and devotion that will sweep you along to one of the most beautiful final scenes I've ever read in a book."

Some reviewers have said that they felt frustrated “waiting for something to happen”. To me, though, SO MUCH happens in this novel, just not in a fast-plot, big drama kind of way. Patchett’s multi-generational story line gently unfolds, slowly revealing the truth about Maeve and Danny’s abandonment, exploring their relationship through adult life, and finally allowing each of them to let go of their past. Reading this book is a bit like doing a psychological jigsaw.... slowly putting the pieces together and trying to understand why each character behaves as they do. Subtle, gripping and with undercurrents of a fairytale."

Maeve, as the older sibling, becomes Danny’s mother, advisor and protector. As the pair grow up and are exiled from their home, we see how their co-dependence impacts on their adult lives and relationships. In our reading group we discussed that the novel has all of the elements of a modern fairytale. The Dutch House is the castle, the children are effectively orphaned, there is a very wicked step-mother and a revenge of sorts. This is a narrative driven by its characters and the relationships between them. Ann Patchett’s unpretentious writing style lulls the reader into a false sense of simplicity and all the while there are spider webs of emotion being spun to gently entrap you without you ever even knowing."

This is my first Ann Patchett read - and I tell you it won't be the last.

A novel that is beautiful, heartbreaking, fast-paced - I could've easily finished this in one sitting if life didn't get in the way -, immersive and touching. I loved the characters, their bonds and their journey through life. And I loved the Dutch House.I also gotta admit that the audiobook played a role in me enjoying this as much as I did. The choice of Tom Hanks to be the narrator is so on point; he added so much character and life to the story. I throughly enjoyed the novel from start to end. "

""The Dutch House"" is everything an Ann Patchett reader could expect of hope for--deep, real, heartfelt relationships, delicious writing, humor, and a satisfying full circle at the end. This is the kind of novel that you crave to get back to and while you're reading, wish could go on forever. But Patchett knows what she's doing. She leaves us wanting more. I hope she's at her desk right now working hard on whatever she has next for us.I am so grateful to the publisher and Edelweiss for approving me to read and review ""The Dutch House."" In a year of so many fine novels, it is a stand-out.~~Candace Siegle, Greedy Reader"

Principal, como elemento agregador, foco de desentendimento, de ódios e amores de todas os restantes.Este livro é, também, uma forma de nos mostrar como tudo nas nossas relações inter-pessoais é mutável e relativo. É, também, uma forma da autora nos mostrar de como de uma ideia simples se contrói uma narrativa magistral, cheia de vivacidade e onde a caracterização dos personagens joga um papel preponderante que nos permite revermo-nos em cada um deles.Excelente.

In ‘Het Hollandse huis’ ontstijgt ze haar oerdegelijkheid met het schouwspel rond een herenhuis in Philadelphia, een weggelopen moeder, een doortrapte stiefmoeder en een onvergetelijke broer-zusrelatie. Dankzij een verbluffend slotstuk over het diepmenselijke duel tussen obsessieve nostalgie en wrok versus verzoening en genade tilt de Amerikaanse het scenario van dertien in een dozijn naar een familiekroniek uit duizend."

No puedo decir que sea malo, está bien escrito, se lee con facilidad, incluso te llega a enganchar en cierto modo.....pero hay algo que falla: la historia circular de tres generaciones de una familia en torno a una casa familiar no es demasiado creíble, el tema de la madrastra mala está muy manido, los personajes no me acaban de enganchar. No sé, me ha parecido como una historia Neoyorquina de Auster, pero sin intensidad y devaluada. Espero no desanimar a nadie, insisto no es un mal libro. "

535,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2697302-maine-colonial,Rating 4 out of 5,"A sort-of wicked stepmother fairy tale, implicating Patchett’s usual theme of the main character(s) having their lives suddenly disrupted. But the underlying themes are love, hate and forgiveness. Not in big sweeping terms, but these emotions in all their varieties. One person’s love doesn’t look like another’s, and that’s especially true of forgiveness. And even the same person can travel through different phases and types of love and forgiveness. Although these characters are nothing like anybody I’ve ever known, it’s still an immensely relatable book.This would make an excellent book club choice. Although the story is told in Danny’s voice, the story is dominated by women—his mother and stepmother, his sister and his wife—his relationship with them and theirs with each other. There is so much to chew over about these characters and their relationships.About the audiobook: I decided to get the audio version of the book because I was intrigued by the idea of Tom Hanks being the narrator. Actually, when voicing the opening credits, Hanks says the book is “performed” by Tom Hanks, rather than the usual “read” by or, my favorite, “read for you” by. Well alright, I thought, let’s see how you perform.The answer for me is that Hanks’s performance is erratic and too performance-y. I want the narrator to bring the story to life; emphasis on story. Here, you’re always aware this is Tom Hanks. His voicing of Danny is fine, but his rhythm sounds a little too much like the Sam character in Sleepless in Seattle. And he does this very weird thing: at the beginning of each chapter: he goes to town reading the word “chapter” and whatever number it is. Sometimes he acts like he’s surprised it’s a new chapter. For Chapter 17, he reads “Chaaaaaaaapter 17.” This took me out of the story, made me hyper-aware that it was Tom Hanks doing the narration, and I couldn’t help but think he wanted to draw attention to himself in this way.I also got the impression that he didn’t read each chapter to himself before performing. Numerous times his emphases were off. I appear to be in the minority, but I came away wishing I’d gotten the print version of this book rather than the audio."
536,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37980042-andy,Rating 5 out of 5,"I started 2021 well when it comes to reading. There wouldn’t be a thread of continuity in American literature without beautiful contributions like this.“ Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.”“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”“ And so I made the decision to change. It might seem like change was impossible, given my nature and my age, but I understood exactly what there was to lose. It was chemistry all over again. The point wasn’t whether or not I liked it. The point was it had to be done.”‘She shrugged. “I gave up caring where I lived a long time ago, and anyway, I think it’s good for me. It teaches me humility. She teaches me humility.” She tipped her head backwards the way Maeve would do. “You have to serve those who need to be served, not just the ones who make you feel good about yourself. Andrea’s my penance for all the mistakes.”’"

544,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48570258-kathleen,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's interesting why this book is so popular. I had it on hold for four months before it was available to download. When I got it and realized it was chock full of dysfunctional family members, it made me wonder why people like to read about dysfunctional families so much?? Is it because there are so many of them? Or they're from one?? So it makes us feel less abnormal? Whatever the case, this book exemplifies the human condition and despite its flaws, the crazy, mixed-up ways family dynamics are formed. Just for fun, I think we should review this book by dissecting the characters! Cyril Conroy = the most emotionally closed off/unavailable, uncommunicative, passive aggressive man. His strength was building a financial empire. The last people on his priority list ~ his family. We learned very little about his childhood so who knows how that contributed to forming his person? He was absolutely inept at talking to his children (or anyone else for that matter) so everyone was operating in a vacuum about what was going on in the family. He was married but basically behaved as an independent entity. If only he could have brought himself to 
converse,
 a majority of the problems that occurred, could have been resolved.The absolute worst person in the whole book (and I cut her no slack whatsoever) is Elna Conroy, the ""supposed"" Mother. You probably thought I was going to say Andrea ~ the step-mom??? Nope. She doesn't even come close to matching Elna. Elna should never have been pulled from the nunnery. She should have followed her first instincts, navigated her way there and never, EVER left the sheltering confines of those walls. It's almost impossible to believe, but Cyril must have had a brief moment of persuasive glibness to convince her to leave there and marry him?? It will forever perplex me how it happened?? I wish it hadn't. If this selfish woman wanted to help people, she should have helped her children. If she hated the idea of being wealthy, spend the fricking money on the needy. Make Cyril double down and earn more. Distribute it, buy food, buy clothes, donate it, whatever. I can think of infinite ways it could have done good, without her traipsing around the world in the guise of a homeless person, convincing herself she was ministering to the downtrodden, all the while totally screwing up her own family. I didn't buy that she felt any guilt whatsoever when she reappeared in the picture? It was narcissistic to expect mercy for her disappearance or for God's sake, be referred to as ""Saint-like"" for her actions??? Far from it, what a piece of work. Maeve and Danny. Theirs was a complex sister brother relationship but rightly so. The only two real victims of their parents foibles. I understand why Danny felt so compelled his whole life to be connected to his sister. Who wouldn't when that person was your anchor after every other stability was lost. Those two had only each other to count on and that's what they did. Was it unhealthy? Did they cling to each other too much? Probably. But who am I to fault them for it?? I might do the exact thing especially if I was Danny's age when I got thrown out on my own. As strong a woman as Maeve presents, she clearly had a void she'd long disguised (probably for Danny's sake) and lamented the loss of her Mother. I hated that she accepted her back without reservations tho and I know hate is a strong word. In this case, justified. I thought Danny had the more ""normal"" response in his feelings toward his Mother. In the end, I think it truly did kill Maeve that she only got her Mother back, to lose her again to Andrea. The poisonous Elna strikes havoc again, always looking to do good for anyone BUT her biological family. Is it obvious how much I disliked her? Egads. If the woman wanted to live a life of piety, she should never have been a parent. Danny's children and Celeste were the most grounded characters in the book. May was my absolute favorite. In the end, the house ended up in the hands it should have rightfully descended to from the beginning. It just took a huge toll on all their lives getting to that point. As beautiful as 'The Dutch House' was portrayed to be, it should never have had the power it was attributed nor dictated how the lives inside its walls lived. That's the sadness of this story. Everybody placing importance on things except what is truly valuable."

546,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29667871-inside-my-library-mind,Rating 2 out of 5,"More reviews up on my blog  Inside My Library Mind   Actual rating: 2.5 stars Let’s start with the stuff I enjoyed about this one. I found the writing to be really palatable and readable, and this book never was a chore to pick up. This is definitely partially because of the fact that I read this via audiobook, which Tom Hanks narrates. The narration was superb and I am starting a petition for Hanks to narrate every single book in the universe. So I was actually excited to get back to listening this one, and I wasn’t bored, which is something I usually struggle with in historical fiction. This book, however, is not a historical, not truly. This has no sense of place or time to it, and to be honest it could have been set at any point in history, since the point of this was to tell a family story. There were some plot points that referenced stuff that is relevant to the time period, but not many. That was great for me personally because if that was added on top of the issues I already had, I never would have finished this one.One other thing that worked for me (or at least in theory it worked) was Maeve. I found her character intriguing and I liked reading about her, so I could not help but wish we got her perspective here instead of Danny’s.Where the issues start (and end) with me is the characters. For a story that focuses solely on the characters and their relationships, these characters were unbearably flat. There was no character arc that made sense, not even Maeve’s. Not only were the characters underdeveloped (which is truly a feat to accomplish in a 340-page book where nothing happens), but they did not make a lick of sense. I was baffled by some of their actions and I struggled so much to understand their motivation. At times it felt like the author made characters do stuff that made absolutely no sense for them as characters just to propel the story forward.The more I think about this one, the madder I get, because I feel like this book had potential. There was a lot of room to do really interesting stuff with these relationships, but the book never went anywhere. Moreover, it felt into some really stereotypical tropes which I hate – like women hating each other for no reason, or step-parents being actually, comically, almost fairytale-esque evil. Seriously, what was the deal with that? Danny and Maeve’s step-mother was almost a cartoonish character from a Grimm fairytale and made absolutely ZERO sense. I was also frustrated that even Maeve, which I really liked, made decisions and did things that I could not justify. Mind you, I don’t care when characters are unlikeable or annoying, but I really do need to understand them, which this book just never manages to do.It was also frustrating that the house, which the title suggests will be grand and almost be an entity in itself, also never made an impact. I love when places are given meaning and when they exist independently of the characters but because of them, but even that wasn’t an aspect that I think was well accomplished in this book.This also lacked any sort of emotion or heart for me. I kept waiting for something to move me here, but because the characters were so poorly constructed, I could not find it in me to care. I cannot help but compare this with another book from the list that did not work for me – Actress. My issue with Actress was that it was too historical, it had too much description of parties and plays, but I did think it was well written and that the characters were interesting. Moreover, there was heart and emotion there, but I was bored out of my mind at times. The Dutch House was the opposite – I did not have any issue in finishing it, but the characters were mind-numbingly flat. To Sum Up  Sadly, this one did not really work for me. I felt like the characters were really flat and underdeveloped, and it’s really hard for me to care or like a book where I don’t care about the characters at all.

I could not put it down. Unlike Commonwealth, I think this one will stick with me, in no small part because of the cover painting, which was made especially for this book. This novel felt very Tolstoylian to me. "
548,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her fiction and some of her non-fiction - all worth the read. My first Patchett novel was Bel Canto. It was so good, I immediately went looking for her earlier work and now routinely read every new book. She never disappoints me. This book is no exception. I chose to read this one in audible because the reader was Tom Hanks. He was a the perfect choice.This family story is narrated and told from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the son of Cyril and Elna Conroy and the brother of older sister Maeve. The book moves back and forth in time over a period of 50 years. Danny, Maeve, and the Dutch House are the lead characters. Cyril bought the Dutch House while still in the military just after WWII. It was a mansion built by a Dutch family who made their money in tobacco. But the sons were killed in the war, the husband died, and finally there was only the wife. The daughter (Fluffy) of one of the servants from the glory years cared for her and when she died, Fluffy became the caretaker. When Cyril bought the house, he hired Fluffy as a nurse for daughter Maeve. Cyril loved the house. Elna hated it - it was just too opulent. Elna did not know how Cyril had come up with the money to buy it. She did not know he was among the new rich. When Danny was about 2 years old, Elna left to become a missionary in India. Maeve, six years older than Danny, was devastated. Danny did not remember his mother. Maeve pined for her. Two sisters, hired by Elna to keep the house up, are like members of the family and never loose their connection to Danny and Maeve.Cyril marries Andrea Smith, a widow with two young daughters - Norma and Brit. Andrea loves the house. Andrea dislikes Maeve very much and, to a slightly less degree, Danny. Every Saturday, Danny and his father collect the rent from their tenants and, as Danny moves into his teen years, Cyril involves Danny in his building projects. Maeve, super-smart, seems to never have her father's attention. Disaster strikes when in his early 50's Cyril dies. Suddenly, Maeve and Danny find themselves on the outside of the Dutch House looking in. Maeve is the most important person in Danny's live and that causes Danny problems in his relationships, especially with his wife Celeste. Maeve and Danny do not always remember things the same (what siblings do?). Danny has no memory of his mother; Maeve has never stopped missing her. Danny does not hate Andrea; Maeve despises her. And so the years go by. Danny and Maeve are frequently found sitting in a car outside the Dutch House, watching and remembering, and always wanting their house back. But life goes on. Danny marries and has two children who love their aunt, even if their mother doesn't. Then as the story moves into its final part, there is a change. As always, Patchett knows how to build characters. She seems to have an understanding of the messiness of blending families. And she does a great job with memory - how and why it may vary. Excellent book."
549,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074498-carla,Rating 5 out of 5,"I finished listening to The Dutch House, narrated by Tom Hanks and it felt like I was saying goodbye to friends. I am still thinking about this story, it's characters, the themes, and the house itself. This is something very different from anything I have read before. This is a modern day fairytale, complete with the evil stepmother, a father dying young and children exiled from the life they knew. The story is told from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the youngest of the two Conroy children.Danny Conroy and his sister, Maeve, grow up in a huge home that is the Dutch House, a 1920s mansion in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. It’s a building with huge, wide windows, giving every passerby the opportunity to look inside. Danny's narration is a look inside the lives of the Conroy family. Cyril Conroy was a self-made man who bought the Dutch House and all its contents. His wife hated the house, and eventually left, leaving the children behind. When Danny is 10, his father remarries and moves in with her two daughters. Danny and Maeve love the children, they do not love their new step-mother and the feeling is mutual. When their father dies unexpectedly five years later, Danny is thrown out of the house to move in with Maeve, they only have each other to rely on. This is a story about family, decisions, forgiveness, obsession, dreams, and honesty. The Dutch House is as much a character in this book as the human characters as this story shows us how one family's dynamics are affected by it as well as each other. There were times that I loved Maeve and times that I was so angry with her. She pushed Danny to follow a path that was not his, but was for revenge. She also didn't take care of herself like she should have causing a lot of grief. Having said that, the relationship between her and Danny was amazing. This was sibling love that was far-reaching and unshakable. When their mother returns, it is heartbreaking to see how Danny's emotions are brought to the surface for a person that he really didn't know. This book is very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the lifespan of a family and witness their lives. There are a lot of other characters, but they all revolve around Danny and Maeve. The Dutch House is a slow, but immersive story. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. It’s full of questions that invite judgement and decisions that demand reactions. It was a book that was not on my radar until I saw that Tom Hanks was narrating it and I jumped at the chance to listen to it. I was hooked by this story and definitely recommend it to lovers of family sagas, something a bit different, and even those who love modern day fairytales. Tom Hanks did an amazing job with the narration. He was Danny in my mind and I definitely recommend you listen to this one if you have the opportunity. The publisher generously provided me with a copy of this audiobook at my request. The rating, ideas and opinions shared are my own."

I loved her previous, family novel, Commonwealth and she takes steady, aim, on another family here, following the Conroy clan, in the suburbs of Philadelphia. With the son, Danny, narrating, we move through the decades, through heart-ache, joy and loss. Patchett's prose remains clear and effortless. She just keeps getting better."

552,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63602401-leah-agirlandaboy,Rating 3 out of 5,"SHORT REVIEW: This felt like a stranger sat down next to me on the bus and started telling me a series of disjointed stories about his life, but he was only doing it because his therapist told him to and neither of us were getting much out of it. LONG REVIEW: Let me preface this by noting that most of the reviews I’ve seen from people who loved the book seem to reference the audio version, and most reviews of the “meh” variety seem to be in reference the paper version, and so now having finished the paper version I will say: What a coup to get Tom Hanks to redeem an utterly robotic, unfeeling, bitter, distant, emotionless, incurious, developmentally arrested, uninterested-in-anyone-but-himself-and-even-when-he-realizes-it-he-doesn’t-change-at-all narrator! Yikes.I am truly baffled at how much...hero-won tenderness(?) I’ve seen directed toward a narrator who appears to think that by spending his life going through the motions and doing what people tell him, at least on the surface, he’s being a “good guy.” Several times he defends his “decency” in situations when what’s *really* being asked of him is some *humanity,* some honest-to-goodness authentic engagement with his life and the people in it. Instead, he does the “right thing” and then congratulates himself with the words “It cost me nothing,” but dude, the reason it cost you nothing is because you’ve invested nothing and are so detached you can’t even see it. Perhaps the closest he got to figuring something out was when he realized “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.” As a story about how a traumatized child grows into a traumatized adult unable to feel or express emotion, this is okay, but was that the point? (Is Danny himself like the Dutch House—sturdy and impressive on the surface but ultimately hollow save the flea-bitten raccoons upstairs, in the room intended for celebrating with friends and family? #symbolism)Was this all intentional or am I just spinning? I highlighted so much plain evidence of Danny’s...misanthropy(?) or...perhaps clinically antisocial behavior(?) that it *feels* intentional, yet that doesn’t seem to be what other people are taking away from the book, so I don’t know. (I’ve only read one other thing by Ann Patchett and it knocked my socks off, soooo...?) Is it me or is it Tom Hanks? I guess perhaps my frustration is less with the book than with its reception? (Or at least what slices of its reception I’ve seen?) Ha. Classic me. If I write an actual essay about this, can someone read and grade it for me? This is why I’m such a spaz in book clubs. I’ll see myself out now."

554,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7474475-marilyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this easy read. A dysfunctional family that did not share anything, then a wicked stepmother made for an interesting life. Danny, who we hear in the first person and her older sister Maeve really did make memories in Dutch House”. Author Patchett has written a wonderful heartwarming story from start to finish. Great character development as the years go by and their memories all come back together. One of my favourite quotes from Danny” Then, I remembered what my father told me, that the things we could do nothing about were best put out of our minds. I gave it a try and found that it was much easier then I had imagined.” "
555,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4823153-bridget,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my absolute favourite authors. I love her gentle but pointed prose and I look forward with eager anticipation for every new book. This book did not disappoint, the tone is so perfect and she drew me in from the first sentences. It is always such a relief when an author you love delivers you another book that you love.This is the story of a brother and sister, their mother has 'run away to India' as they are told when they are children. Danny and Maeve are left with their father, Cyril, in a magnificent house, a house which has remained largely untouched after the previous owners died, the house has personality, it is glass and from the street you can see all the way through it, nobody else in their town has a house anything like this mansion, but a lovely house doesn't necessarily mean a happy home. The children live there with their largely absent father and the housekeepers and cook who look after them as if they were their own. Maeve is considerably older than Danny and assumes the role of his protector and this continues all their lives. It is this relationship which makes the book so special. When Cyril brings home Andrea his wife to be, she immediately takes against the children, her jealousy and rage permeate the house, poison the atmosphere and when she comes to move in she arrives with two daughters that Maeve and Danny had no idea to expect. Why didn't Andrea mention at any point that she had two small daughters? Why has Cyril chosen such an unsuitable person to marry? Why is Andrea so incredibly spiteful to these perfectly pleasant children? The story unravels these mysteries and the stories of all of the characters.I loved these people, I became incredibly caught up in their lives, this is the gift Ann Patchett passes to her readers, an involvement in their stories and a deep feeling of attachment for these people, some of whom are difficult and prickly, but as you unravel the complex web you come to understand their struggles and trials. This is sitting right up there with my top books of the year. I'm off to buy myself a paper copy because this is a book to keep and to go back to. And I'm sure on the next reading I'll have a little sob in the same place that I did this first reading. Sigh. Lovely. Sigh.Thanks to Netgalley and Bloomsbury for giving me access to this treasure."
556,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21442406-frosty61,Rating 4 out of 5,"As others have said, this story of childhood abandonment and an evil stepmother has been told before, but it's still a riveting tale. The opulent Dutch House is the catalyst for events that forever change the lives of siblings Danny and Maeve. The track of Danny's life is determined by what happens after he and Maeve leave the house and are forced to figure out a different future than the one they'd imagined. His bitterness threatens to ruin any chance of happiness while Maeve orchestrates their future with revenge as the primary motivation. Their love for each other is the only constant in their lives. Memories of their childhood in the house are full of blank spaces and assumptions. As the story moves back and forth in time, the truth gradually emerges and narrator Danny struggles to adjust to the revelations. His life threatens to mirror the past unless he can move forward with acceptance, maybe forgiveness and self-awareness.Full of emotion that's hidden beneath the surface and a lot of symbolism, I found I really enjoyed the story. In my opinion there were a few problems with its structure. I liked the pace of the first 2/3 then it slowed down to a snail's pace until picking up again near the end. The flashbacks were confusing at times and I found I was much more invested in the present time period than those of the past. The descriptions were vivid - I want to visit the Dutch House, take a tour and sit by the pool. :-) However, an implausible event near the end of the story detracted a bit (though as others have said, it is a fairy tale). Though that event seemed far-fetched it certainly helped move things toward a more hopeful and uplifting conclusion. Otherwise, this would've simply been too depressing and dark for my taste. A favorite quote: ""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself."""
557,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3077040-jo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Set in the 1940,s, Ann Patchett has written my faourite read of the year. Its a powerful narrative about family, misunderstandings and betrayal.Real estate developer Cyril Conroy buys The Dutch House an extravagant Pennsylvania mansion without consulting his wife Elna, confident that she'll like it as much as he does.Cyril is wrong, Unfortunately, Elna hates it with such a passion that she leaves it, him and their two children and goes off to do charity work in India, cutting all ties with the family.Danny, who narrates the novel in middle age, was 3 at the time, and so has no memories of his mother – but his distinctly saintly sister Maeve, seven years older, proves a to be a better mother anyway. Their distant father forms a relationship with the materialistic Andrea, who has two children of her own and, although he doesn't love her, he marry s her.Andrea treats Maeve and Danny with resentment and indifference When Cyril dies, she kicks them both out without a penny. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive.As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past.This book is one that I will reread, reminiscent of The Gentleman in Moscow, its absolutely wonderful."

Het is zijn droom om hier samen met zijn vrouw en twee kinderen een nieuw bestaan op te bouwen. Helaas blijkt dit niet zo uit te werken, zijn vrouw heeft een enorme hekel aan het huis en laat het gezin in de steek wanneer de kinderen nog jong zijn. Maar dit blijkt slechts het begin te zijn van het leed wat achter de muren van het Hollandse huis verborgen ligt. Wanneer dochter Maeve en zoon Danny direct na de dood van hun vader verbannen worden uit het Hollandse huis wordt het hen pijnlijk duidelijk dat ze alleen elkaar hebben. 'Het Hollandse huis' wordt verteld vanuit het perspectief van zoon Danny en is opnieuw een prachtig geschreven familiedrama van de hand van Ann Patchett. Patchett bezit het unieke talent om je als lezer slechts in enkele pagina's mee te trekken in levendige scènes en ieder personage zo'n eigenheid mee te geven dat je bijna gelooft dat je ze echt kent en erbij was. Vooral de manier waarop Ann Patchett de traumatische impact van emotionele verwaarlozing naar voren laat komen vond ik erg sterk. Ze doet dit invoelbaar en oprecht, zonder daarin aan te dikken of te overdrijven, en dat is wat mij betreft een zeldzaamheid maar ook zo ontzettend waardevol, omdat juist dit soort emotionele traumatisering vaak niet gezien of erkend wordt. In dit verhaal wordt pijnlijk duidelijk wat voor enorm spoor dit achterlaat in de levens van Maeve en Danny. Maar probeer dit maar eens uit te leggen aan iemand die er niet bij was en die de slangenkuil niet van binnenuit heeft leren kennen."

""Холандската къща"" на Ан Патчет обаче ми хареса. Може би не чак толкова, че да ми стане любима, но е факт, че още я мисля, въпреки че я свърших още преди празниците.Историята ни среща с Мейв и Дани, които са брат и сестра. Майка им ги е напуснала, когато двамата са били деца и те цял живот се опитват да го преживеят. Баща им се жени повторно и това още веднъж преобръща живота им. Десетилетия по-късно къщата, в която са живели и която играе важна роля в решенията на всеки един от героите, продължава да е неизменна част от живота им, макар и от разстояние.Обичам да чета семейни саги като тази, защото са ми интересни отношенията между деца и родители, братя и сестри, съпрузи и новите семейства, които идват след брака. В случая ми беше забавно как Мейв и съпругата на Дани се опитват да си го поделят. 😄 Други теми, засегнати в романа, са тези за изборите на родителите, за спомените, за миналото, от което понякога не можем да се откъснем, за бъдещето, към което не смеем да пристъпим. Оценявам също и оригиналната корица, която от издателството са решили да запазят, защото играе важна роля в историята.

A place that is more than walls and floors. Like a hug from a loved one, it gives you comfort. It gives you security. It shares all your memories, your dreams, and your life - the good and the bad. It is a home that has come to define you. For Danny and Maeve this house was The Dutch House. Like Scarlett O’Hara trying to get back home to Tara during the Civil War, Danny and Maeve spend a good portion of their lives trying to get back to The Dutch House. Exiled from their home by their step-mother after their aloof father dies, Danny and Maeve forage their own way through life while constantly feeling the pull back to the past. Almost to the point of obsession, they return in search of what is missing in their lives from the Dutch House.Padgett has crafted a wonderful story about siblings and the things that bond us to a place and to each other. Great character building and story pace are just a few of the great things about The Dutch House. This novel is worthy of the high ratings it is receiving and, most possibly, will be considered one of Padgett’s finest works.

Danny's life is inextricably bound with that of his sister (and for most of the novel, only living relative), Maeve and with the Dutch House, their childhood home in Pennsylvania.I don't really think I can add much to what's been said in many of the excellent reviews here on Goodreads - this is a fascinating book, and a worthy nominee for the 2020 Women's Prize for Fiction.One thing I did find jarring - and I admit this is only because it's a pet hate of mine - was that, on two occasions in the text, the phrase ""could care less"" appeared, rather than the correct ""couldn't care less"". I sincerely hope that this was an error that crept in at the printing stage, as it's a pretty glaring copy-editing error.All in all, an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Highly recommended."
562,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83900483-ivka,Rating 5 out of 5,"Holandský dom je za mňa veľmi vydarený rodinný román. Príbeh sa tiahne od detstva hlavných hrdinov, súrodencov (brata a sestry) až po ich dospelosť. V prvej etape románu tiahnu dospelí za kratší koniec ako deti. Danny a Maeve vyrastajú s mĺkvym a zaneprázdneným otcom, ktorý si po odchode ich matky nájde novú partnerku. Maeve sa tak stane pre Dannyho najdôležitejším človekom - prevezme úlohu ich matky. Vzťahy a atmosféra v holandskom dome sú čoraz viac napäté a napokon to teda vôbec nedopadne dobre. V dospelosti sa súrodenci stále vracajú k domu, pozorujú ho a spomínajú, kladú otázky a snažia sa prísť na odpovede. Danny toho potrebuje vstrebať podstatne viac ako Maeve. Obom sa to napokon podarí možno trocha iným spôsobom, no predsa len podarí 😊. Z deja nechcem prezrádzať viac, keďže sa v príbehu udeje veľa dôležitých zmien.Knihu Holandský dom určite vrelo odporúčam. Je písaná príjemným a nenásilným štýlom, číta sa sama. Príbeh nesie v sebe akurátnu dávku napätia, drámy a emócií, povedala by som, že je to jeden z tých „silnejších“ príbehov. Autorke sa podarilo veľmi pekne rozpracovať a napokon aj uzatvoriť veľmi dlhé časové obdobie, v podstate celý život hlavných protagonistov. Ak sa rozhodnete nahliadnuť do holandského domu, určite neoľutujete 😉."

I will happily sit down with a cup of coffee and read her shopping list. I’ve read everything she’s written, my favorite being Bel Canto, and was overjoyed when The Dutch House came out.What I like most about Patchett’s writing is that it’s beauty is completely unpretentious. She wants her readers to care, not scratch their heads and wonder if they may be too dumb. All of her characters are multidimensional, with complex personalities, aspirations and motivations. The story is sort of a fairytale in which two siblings are thrown out of their house by a wicked stepmother after their father’s death. They are each other’s world and stick together all of their lives, and even after the boy marries and has his own family, they are both constantly parking outside The Dutch House and reliving their memories of it.Ultimately, their mother comes to them and shows herself to be (in my opinion) as selfish and inconsiderate to the sibling’s feelings as the wicked stepmother.This one is a gem, and I actually listened to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks, who was perfect."
564,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21437715-james,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had never read Anne Patchett before, and The Dutch House did not disappoint as my first foray into her work. The Dutch House follows Danny Conroy and his sister Maeve on a journey from childhood to adulthood, detailing all the trials and tribulations one family faces along the way. Beginning in earnest with their abandonment at the hands of their mother, it is the relationship between the siblings, and the building the called home, that is the beating heart of the novel. Despite spanning such long period of time, Patchett’s narrative picks us up and drops us off regularly enough that The Dutch House never feels too long. The warmth and familiarity that builds as the novel progresses draws one in as the reader becomes a part of the Conroy family, despite its dysfunction.I found myself not wanting to put The Dutch House down - reading into the early hours of the morning, and picking it up promptly upon waking, which is likely the best example I can give to demonstrate my high praise for this wonderful, almost classic work of fiction.

I looked forward to him as I drove in the car. I knew little of this book except that the house itself functioned like a character. And it did. The house lived in the DNA of a number of people who kept returning to it. It never changed, while the people around it did. The house was shared memory, the bond of estranged people coming together. Danny tells the story of his sister Maeve, but he also tells a whole host of other stories, most prominently his own. His father, his mother, Celeste, Fluffy, Sandy, Jocelyn, the Vanhubakes, and his children. The story is at times painful, at times endearing, but always beautiful and heartfelt. Much like this house stays with the people who inhabit it, the house and its story, and these characters stay with us in quite the same way. A five star read through and through. Just loved it, and it made my top ten for the year easily."

Ann Patchett's audiobook narrated by Tom Hank is marvelous. Tom Hank's voice is like a warm hug, satisfying and enveloping. There is a lot of subtly to this novel told from the perspective of Danny the son of a real estate entrepreneur. His relationship to his father and absent mother are very deep and well developed in the story. My favorite thing about this novel is Danny's relationship to his older sister and protector. There are so many layers that can be peeled back for book club discussion. For example, the effect of abandonment, forgiveness, and selflessness are but a few topics to discuss. Danny's sister asks Danny to forgive their mother for leaving them. She says and I paraphrase, I imagine all saints in history didnt make their families very happy either. I love it. This goes on my best of 2019. It is Ann Patchett's best novel to date."

Not really; my favorites are still Bel Canto and Run, but Dutch House is right up there. As always, her characters, major and minor, are vivid, complex, and unforgettable; my favorite is May who, although she appears later in the narrative and is not one of the most prominent players, nevertheless embodies the resolution of the anger, unhappiness, and regret experienced by her antecedents in the story. The multi-layered plot has internal integrity; it has its surprises but is predictable, in a good way, in that events, sometimes disturbing but entirely believable, fit the characters perfectly. Metaphors abound, as the story starts (and ends) with the house itself. To some extent, magical realism has a role in much of Patchett's work, most notably in Bel Canto and State of Wonder; it's here, but is subtle, in Dutch House. A very satisfying and beautiful novel by a master storyteller."

A dark fairy tale, complete with brother and sister, clueless Dad and evil step-mother turns around the setting of an old house, which is both the familial home and the site of its undoing. Fragments of Patchett’s own life and her childhood under a cloud of divorce create the undertones of this story, which begins when patriarch Cyril Conroy buys “the Dutch House,” an elegant estate outside Philadelphia. When their mother takes off and a new stepmother makes the house her own, brother and sister Danny and Maeve find themselves impoverished and virtually cast out, both testing and strengthening the existing bonds between them in ultimate ways. Patchett’s character development and effortless dialogue immerses me in every scene and I always miss her characters when I close the book for the last time.  "

I didn't even notice who the audiobook presenter was, which is good, because I got into the book before looking up this familiar voice so I didn't think of Tom Hanks rather than the character he was reading.I am not going to give you a plot summary, and the basics of this story (as in the basic premise) isn't a new one. What makes this book so excellent is everything else about it. Patchett is at her best here, the characters area all fully developed, there is depth and there are many other good things. However, I also think that Hanks, along with the director and producer, did a superb job with this book. Hanks was an excellent casting choice, and I am glad he agreed to do this.Now that I am finished, I miss this book."
