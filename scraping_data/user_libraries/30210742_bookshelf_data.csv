E più che un romanzo, questo libro è effettivamente un resoconto, una raccolta di impressioni su tutte le storie che la protagonista deve sorbirsi, convidivendo però quasi nulla di sé. Da una conversazione con il vicino di posto in aereo, a una cena con un'autrice, fino al corso di scrittura che sta tenendo, ogni occasione è solo il pretesto per riflettere sulla famiglia, il matrimonio, l'amore, la scrittura, il successo e la notorietà. Un esperimento che mi ha lasciato freddo e distaccato. Mi sono sentito come Sylvia, la ragazza del corso di scrittura appassionata di D. H. Lawrence che, mentre sta leggendo un suo racconto si rende conto che Lawrence non sarebbe riuscito a trascinarmi fuori dalla mia vita. Sarà stata la neve, o la stranezza di quella donna, o il pavone stesso, ma all’improvviso ho sentito che quegli avvenimenti, e l’universo che lui descrive, non avevano nulla a che fare con me, nel mio moderno appartamento nella calura di Atene.

Ed effettivamente, Adorazione raccoglie tutti gli ingredienti ideali a farlo diventare un ottimo prodotto Netflix: un gruppo di adolescenti alle soglie dell'età adulta, l'omicidio di una coetanea da parte dell'ex fidanzato, un'estate torrida e soffocante, il litorale pontino con le sue spiagge, i genitori che non si accorgono di chi siano realmente i propri figli, i dubbi sulla propria identità sessuale e tanti riferimenti a Instagram e ai social network. Insomma, sento già Tommaso Paradiso alle prove con la colonna sonora. Uniche note sfavorevoli sono state la scrittura, che mi è parsa forse troppo piatta e poco incisiva, con le frasi scorrono in maniera fluida senza particolari abbellimenti o orpelli stilistici che ti facciano venir voglia di rileggere interi paragrafi per la loro bellezza. Ma questa potrebbe anche essere una deliberata scelta stilistica. E poi la seconda parte del romanzo, in cui la trama prende una piega che fa della storia quasi un Cento colpi di spazzola prima di andare a Sabaudia.

L'ingiusta ripartizione dell'eredità è solo la causa apparente dei dissapori che dividono Bergljot e suo fratello Bård dalle due sorelle minori, Astrid e Åsa, schieratesi a loro volta dalla parte della madre. Il germe interiore che ha portato la protagonista a un lento e inesorabile distacco dalla famiglia è infatti ben più profondo e trova le sue radici nell'infanzia. E così, Bergljot, martire di un ostinato morbo, ripercorre pervicacemente gli eventi che l'hanno guastata e plasmata nella persona attuale. Un'ossessiva ma potente riflessione sull'infanzia, la violenza, la rimozione, la psicoanalisi e la tendenza a voltare lo sguardo davanti a una realtà troppo dolente e scomoda per essere affrontata. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 10, 2020","Jun 14, 2020","Jun 10, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53439296-eredit

That's pretty much how I felt reading this book. There's no real plot and no clear motives behind the characters' actions.

It feels like being stuck in time, but you want to keep reading and it's agonizing and quite brilliant at the same time, until you turn this satanic record to side B, which is not as good as its other half. Besides, let's be honest here, Krasznahorkai's writing style sure knows how to get on your tits real soon.

The ones in which we have a peak at Knausgård as a father are the most accomplished, such as Father Christmas, where he and a friend dress up as Santa Claus to surprise their respective children, Nikolai Astrup, where he and his family visit his mother in north-west Norway, Setting Limits, where he reflects on the necessity for parents to set limits for their children and Operation, in which his daughter goes through surgery. And obviously, this being Knausgård, a few of his musings have to involve childhood memories, like Toothbrushes, where he hilariously justifies his poor dental hygiene or like Winter Boots, about a pair of boots, inherited from his brother, that he would use to slide down the snow-covered slopes of his hometown along with his friends. Some of these are also clever and bizarre, like Brains, and quite funny, like Q-tips, where he describes his fascination with cotton buds. At times I get an expectant feeling, a sense that something good is about to happen without remembering exactly what, until it suddenly comes back to me on a wave of disappointment: the good thing I was looking forward to was just cleaning the earwax out of my ear.

Lucia Berlin's stories are infused with personal and emotional recollections making the book more similar to auto-fiction. There is probably not a single job she didn't try at least once in her life. Incessantly moving since childhood and marrying three times, she was a nurse, a teacher, a cleaning woman and a receptionist, but what surfaces from most of the stories is her life-long struggle with alcoholism. A Manual for Cleaning Women is raw, unclouded and true-to-life. She's been compared to Carver and Čechov, but what I've seen more than once are strong thematic affinities with Jack Kerouac. We follow Berlin's women from San Francisco, to Arizona, Mexico, Chile, Texas, to New Mexico and Colorado, places in which Berlin herself has lived for years. One of the recurring characters is her sister Sally (not sure if that's her real name) and one of her sons, Ben - we meet them several times through the book in a cross-temporal narration. The only weakness is that sometimes the same characters will reappear but with different names, creating a certain confusion and a feeling of déjà-vu (are Carlotta and Dolores the same person?!). Besides, halfway through the book, the stories become quite repetitive, though an unbroken vigour always spills from the prose. Mijito must be one of the most haunting of them all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 04, 2017","Nov 10, 2017","Nov 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26114212-a-manual-for-cleaning-women

The story begins in Oxford during the blackout days, where a group of friends is seduced by the appearance of David Sparsholt, a new student coming from another college who also happens to be a brawny rower and a flirt. From the second part onwards the novel mainly follows Johnny, David's son, showing how his life has been affected by his father's choices. The first two parts are incredible, especially the first one from whose prose echoes of Evelyn Waugh can be heard.As I knew, it could be easier, once your eyes had adjusted, to walk without the startlements of the torch. Oddly, you moved with more confidence. All the same, we spoke nearly in whispers, as though we might be overheard. Often on those nights you did brush suddenly against other people passing or waiting entirely unseen.Now the lane was a little black canyon, its gabled and chimneyed rim just visible to us against the deep charcoal of the sky. Clouds, in peacetime, carried and dispersed the colours of the lights below, but in the blackout an unmediated darkness reigned. I thought I knew this street I’d walked along a hundred times, but memory seemed not quite to match the dim evidence of doorways, windows, railings that we passed. I asked Jill about her work, and she at once grew less self-conscious. She was reading History, but her interests were in archaeology, and in the remarkable things revealed by the London Blitz. She explained how bombs that knocked down City churches sometimes cut through the layers below, Tudor, medieval, Roman, exposing them in ways no organized human effort could have done. The human aspects of the devastation, the loss of life and home, clearly struck her rather less. She spoke excitedly about coins, coffins, bricks, fragments of pottery. I said it must be frustrating for her that Oxford itself had barely been damaged.I didn't entirely enjoy the third part set in 1974 London, which I found too slow-paced and disorienting with all its art talk, but the last two sections redeemed themselves (the part where Johnny discovers porn on Tumblr was priceless). (view spoiler)[One of the last chapters, in which Johnny sees his father's dead body and sits down to draw him on his pocketbook, was very touching and reminded me of Knausgård's A Death in the Family (hide spoiler)].

The first part of the book introduces us to the secluded world where Cathy, Daniel and Daddy live through a build-up of atmospheric sketches that didn't absorb me completely, due to the disjointed narrative. My main problem, though, was the language. I'm not a big fan of lyrical prose but I can appreciate it when it fits with the context. The issue here is that there was no consistency between the characters' background, their speech and the writing style. The protagonists live in a remote copse in Yorkshire withdrawn from society. Cathy and Daniel, respectively 15 and 14, no longer go to school, don't own a television and express themselves using the Yorkshire dialect, so how am I supposed to believe that Danny, the narrator, could come up with sentences like these:As soon as he had shaken off his boots, his Goliath arms pulled me into an embrace and I wondered what it would be like to touch a real whale, and knew that despite what Vivien had said, Daddy was both more vicious and more kind than any leviathan of the ocean.It was as if Daddy and I had sprouted from a clot of mud and splintered roots and they had oozed from pure minerals in crystalline sequence.Daddy placed both his hands flat on the table, his bowed fingers and knuckles almost camouflaged against the likewise knotted, ecru oak.Seriously, ECRU? I learned that word two years ago. It was nearly 10 o’clock and it was bright. Sharp rays had nudged the hems of the thin poly-mix curtains to the sides and filled the room with a precise light. POLY-MIX CURTAINS.It all just struck a jarring note in my ears and I couldn't get past it, especially when after these flowery sentences Danny would say:‘Yeah,’ I said, simply. ‘But it wandt on your land he shot it.’ or‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘He might have one but we’ve never seen it, and he doendt hunt with it.’Another weak point for me were the characters themselves, who all seem nebulous and undefined. Who is Daddy? Who is Vivien, this woman who tries to help the kids even though it's clear she'd be happy to see them go? Mr. Price is just the cartoonish villain of the story, Cathy is yet another stereotype of the strong teenage girl who won't be bossed around by anybody (see The Power, The Mare or The Bear and the Nightingale). Daniel is the only interesting character with his ambiguous sexuality. Notwithstanding, by the end of the book they all remain out of focus and unresolved....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 19, 2017","Sep 21, 2017","Sep 19, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35711376-elmet

Holly Goddard Jones is really good at building characters.

The story was agonizingly slow and the scary ticks only made a few cameos. Halfway through it became way too political and the ending was absolutely implausible.

I even dreamed we snogged at a literary festival a couple of nights ago. But I can't deny I was expecting a bit more from these essays. They're not bad by any means, but not mind-blowing either, although we know that's not what Knausgård's writing is all about. Similarly to what he does in the Min Kamp series, here Knausgård begins every essay by describing and analysing a seemingly trivial object or situation to his unborn daughter - like plastic bags, chewing gums, beds, telephones - but this is merely a pretence to take a trip down memory lane, reaching unexpected conclusions. Some of these essays are really great (Daguerrotype, War, Oil tankers), some are quite touching (Fever, Rubber boots, Letter to an unborn daughter), some are very honest in a typical Knausgård style (when he describes what he likes to do with his now ex wife's wet labia), while others are quite banal (Eyes, Mouth, The migration of birds, Ambulances).

The unnamed protagonist, a Canadian woman, returns to her native home, a small island by a lake in Québec, to look for her missing father. As her childhood memories begin to resurface, she starts acting in bizarre ways until she loses her marbles altogether and starts blending and disappearing in the surrounding wilderness. I take off my clothes, peeling them away from my flesh like wallpaper. [...] My back is on the sand, my head rests against the rock, innocent as plankton; my hair spreads out, moving and fluid in the water. The earth rotates, holding my body down to it as it holds the moon; the sun pounds in the sky, red flames and rays pulsing from it, searing away the wrong form that encases me, dry rain soaking through me [...] When I am clean I come up out of the lake, leaving my false body floated on the surface, a cloth decoy. Surfacing is also a thought-provoking examination of how women were perceived in the 70s (just the 70s??). Anna, the other female character, can't go a day without makeup because her husband wants her to ""look like a young chick all the time, if I don’t he gets mad"". Also, everybody seems to hate the the pervasive menace, the Americans, who sometimes turn out be actual Canadians. ""I leafed through all the men I had known to see whether or not I hated them. But then I realized it wasn’t the men I hated, it was the Americans, the human beings, men and women both. They’d had their chance but they had turned against the gods, and it was time for me to choose sides. I wanted there to be a machine that could make them vanish, a button I could press that would evaporate them without disturbing anything else, that way there would be more room for the animals, they would be rescued."". So, yeah...that was weird. Definitely an intriguing but not engrossing reading experience.
