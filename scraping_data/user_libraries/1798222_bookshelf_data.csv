His role is that of the er, primarily, of books written in the 1990s, of writers from the last century, and of personalities from antiquity. He covers his writing colleagues at the venerable magazine, such as John Cheever and John O’Hara in more than one place, and the two Williamses – Shawn and Maxwell, editors who shaped and nurtured his writing career.It is his observations on the craft of writing and the life of a writer that stood out for me:-         Writers eye each other with vigorous jealousy and suspicion. They are swift to condemn and dismiss, as a means of keeping the field from getting too crowded.- -         Writing is life and death to writers. An intense competition rages for the pale limelight of literary publicity and for the never-large and presently dwindling body of serious readers.-         The moment when the finished book or, better yet, a tightly packed carton of finished books arrives on my doorstep is the moment of truth, of culmination; its bliss lasts as much as five minutes until the first typographical error or production flaw is noticed.-         The writer’s most important asset is not wisdom or skill but an irrational, often joyous sense of importance attaching to what little he knows; and this is a religious sensation.-         On the Post-Modern Novel: These glimpses of independent personalities, of half-round bubbles allowed to materialize in the turbulent flow of the onrushing monologue, make one aware of how much the postmodern novel has lost in putting aside the objectives of old-fashioned third-person realism.-         The triumph of the nineteenth-century novel, as exemplified by Jane Austen and George Eliot, Dickens and Tolstoy, was to create the illusion of human interaction viewed direct, without undue mediation and manipulation, from a standpoint elevated and detached.He discusses his early hobby of cartooning which he took up in high school; he soon realized he lacked the talent to rise to the major leagues in this craft and transitioned to writing. Updike was fortunate to find success early with his first novel being published when he was only 26. His Rabbit novels pasted him squarely into the fabric of middle-class, small-town, Presbyterian America by chronicling a typical character from that demographic, Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, in a quartet of novels, each set ten years apart, detailing the experiences of an Everyman American during the last half of the 20th century. As the book winds down, he features the many speeches he made when accepting the honours that poured over him after a life of solitary and dedicated writing. He takes the time to reflect on the state of the world, and this final section makes for some great insights, from a man who insists that a writer’s most important asset is not wisdom. I beg to differ.I highly recommend this book not only to writers but to all those trying to make sense of the last 70 years of life on this planet....more",Notes are private!,1,3,1,not set,"Apr 02, 2024","Apr 02, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10297994-more-matter

This was the same theme of At the Mountains of Madness that I read a couple of years ago.Our narrator has a name this time – he is Professor Peaslee of Arkham, Mass, a faculty member of Miskatonic University. In 1908, the professor suddenly suffers an amnesia that lasts over five years, during which he has no recollection of events, but others tell him that he started travelling to obscure corners of the world, spoke in strange tongues, got divorced from his wife and family (although he retained one son, Wingate, who later followed him into academia and on his expeditions), and lived reclusively. At the end of his amnesiac period, he promptly wakes up and resumes his former life, including his job at the university. However he starts to have photographic dreams of places he seems to have visited: buildings with strange shapes, unusual vehicles, and super beings with inhuman shapes who have immense mental capability – he names them the Great Race.Through a series of studies and introspection, he realizes that the mind of a Great Race member had inhabited his body during his amnesia while his mind had been displaced and sent back to the time of that race’s existence, circa 150,000,000 years ago. From there, his mind had been to other places and times, backward and forward, in search of information to help The Great Race deal with a group of aliens, called the Elders, who were trying to wipe them out. All of this is back story and our narrator deals with the subject matter as if writing an academic paper, instead of being mindful of the fiction reader reading this Lovecraft tale. The author himself leaves us copious notes at the back of the book to indicate that he has borrowed heavily from encyclopedias, mythology, demonology, other supernatural writers’ work, and from his own earlier stories.After this elaborate set-up, we get to the mandatory “chase scene,” a Lovecraft staple, it seems. In 1935, after much study and being studied, Professor Peaslee travels to the deserts of Western Australia to gather proof of remnants of the Great Race and find a trace of his earlier presence there. This time, the demons who chase him do not have a form – there is just a howling wind, fear, and doubt in his mind. Is he dreaming this all up like his creator, or is he descending into the bowels of the earth to retrieve a document he wrote while on his 5-year brain-dead sabbatical with the Great Race back in 1908-13? I won’t provide the proverbial spoiler.This was reputably the last story Lovecraft wrote, and I see a synthesis of earlier themes: fear of the outsider, miscegenation, racism (the Great Race!), dreams that fuse parallel universes, mental collapse, and aliens. He was also very lucky; despite the lacklustre success of his work which was mostly published by pulp magazines during his lifetimes, devoted sponsors chose to resurrect his stories posthumously to create a cult that has spawned new supernatural genres and movies....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2024","Mar 25, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/872713.The_Shadow_Out_of_Time

He despises America where he encountered only racism and consumerism. “Consumerism, the triumph of the unnecessary. You stink of French soap. I cannot make love through the smell of our exploiters,” he says to his mistress Kutundu, a woman he procured from a village dung heap on one of his tours about the land, and now installed as his advisor. He visits drought-stricken areas to survey the damage caused and finds a Soviet nuclear silo with its soldiers drunk and debauching. A bit further up the road, he meets an American aid provider with a supply of provisions for the thirsty masses of his country. In a fit of rage, swearing that rain must come naturally and not be produced artificially, he kills the American and destroys the aid shipment. He next visits the northern badlands of his country where there is rumoured to be the stolen head of the former king, whom Ellellou murdered on the advice of Kutundu, who has now become an oracle and is spewing treason against the dictator. Upon his arrival he finds the oracle’s cave has spawned a tourist mecca around it, developed by the ruler of the neighbouring state who is a capitalist lackey. In another fit of rage, Ellellou destroys this centre too. He next visits a remote border town that is rumoured to be also under capitalist siege and finds it has been named Ellellou and become an oil town, replete with that most hated of Americanisms, consumerism. At home his enemies are conspiring to oust him, and Kush is moving under the orbit of America, despite Ellellou’s best efforts to the contrary. His third outburst of rage, in the oil town of Ellellou, does not work for him and he is thrown in prison. But “a peculiar problem of African government is the disposal of the bodies of the disposed,” his enemy Ezana, former Minister of the Interior, says, and so, in an ironic twist, Ellelou is allowed to live because it is easier to propagate the myth that this economic progress is due to their beloved dictator rather than attribute it to regime change. This is a farcical rendition of a fairly realistic situation that has occurred in most developing countries after they got independence from the colonial yoke: a dictator takes over and becomes hostage to one of the superpowers; and when he is not towing the line anymore, he is replaced.Ellelou and his gang spew some great lines of political acuity:“Revenge is an international no-no. We have, instead, realignments.”“International capital has decided that colonies are obsolete.”“A tyrant takes everything personally, an expert doesn’t.”“The battle now is between the armies of necessity (Socialism) and the armies of superfluity (Capitalism).”Despite the important moral of the story, its gravitas was lost in the endlessly flowery descriptions and beautiful sentences that I suspected Updike was revelling in, to the point of pretension. The more the pretense, the more the farce, and the less the import. But how does a white American writer portray the pulse of Africa otherwise? He is not Chinua Achebe to approach it from the inside, and so farce (some might call it magic realism, as he made out with his other novel, Brazil) will have to suffice.To Updike’s credit, I have to appreciate his artistry in covering such subjects that were so out of his range of lived experience; to write this book, he had only visited Africa briefly as a Fullbright Lecturer. Updike took on tough topics, even if it was to view his country as the Ugly American in Africa in this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 16, 2024","Mar 16, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/948212.The_Coup

T“Money is a suicide note” – is an apt epigram for this book, and there is a lot of money with the attendant destruction it wreaks on people’s lives. This is also a wickedly funny book in which the detritus of humanity is softened with Amis’s humour and by the unforgettable protagonist John Self.Self is 35, a British joint owner of an ad company in 1981, that is rolling in money from TV commercials made for drinking, smoking, junk food, and nude magazines. No one can stop the juggernaut, no one has to work at it anymore, and no one pays taxes in these heady days before the fall. John is now launching his pioneer feature film, to be shot in New York, with a cast of derelict actors and financiers who can’t give him enough money. He has to fly first class, crisscrossing the Atlantic, stay in luxury hotels, and flash money everywhere to attract more of it. John Self is an alcoholic – the copious quantities of the hard stuff he guzzles at all times of the day will kill a horse in a week, but our hero thrives on it and alcohol makes him stay sharp (perhaps a freak genetic trait). He is a porn addict and loves self-service (hence the name Self, I guess). He is hopelessly devoted to Selina, his British girlfriend who is cheating on him, and he is madly in love with Martina, his New York squeeze who is married to Otis, who is banging Selina – get it? Self is also a very lonely man, losing his mother as a child and not knowing who his real father is. His namesake father Barry Self, demands that John pay him back for raising him, takes the money John readily gives him and puts it on a horse that wins big and allows Self Sr. to buy a pub and a livelihood.Self’s troubles mount when he starts receiving phone calls from a mysterious man who seems to know everything about him and is after his soul. He is also being followed by a mysterious tarty-looking woman who poses at a distance under streetlamps so he gets a view of her. He bumps into a writer called Martin Amis living in his London neighbourhood, a man not averse to talking literature but is not enamoured of the film industry. “The film industry is full of thriving duffers and speechless millionaires,” says Amis—speaking from his experience, I guess. And he is not altogether wrong, given the insecure, egotistic, competitive, and malicious cast vying for starring roles in this autobiographical movie on Self. They all want plum roles, great lines, and lots of on-screen time, and have preferences for who should co-star with them. Finally, Self fires the screenwriter and hires Martin to write a script that will work for everyone.The villain of the piece is Fielding Goodney, Self’s partner in the movie project, who likes to rack up expenses as if it’s good for the film’s prospects. But to talk more of Fielding would be to give away the plot. Suffice it to say, that Self attracts misfortune by sleeping with the wrong people (literally and figuratively), and drinking to the point of losing track of time and giving the reader jumps and gaps in this first-person narrative. When the fall comes, it is precipitated by a confrontation between Self and his mysterious caller in an alley. The money trail starts collapsing like dominoes, killing all of Self’s enterprises. Self is even unable to catch a flight home from New York for the airline carrying him goes bankrupt after take-off. Even suicide is a tough act to commit. A chastised Self has to lower his expectations and restart with only the love of a new girlfriend to sustain him.Amis’s novel is a parody of the excesses of the 1980s and the boomer generation that had it all and lost it all....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 06, 2024","Mar 06, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18825.Money

Instead, we are dragged through the detritus of upper-crust Philadelphia, to a world of country clubs and binge drinking “where Jews are excluded,” to 1930 when cars still held a novelty for its drivers and when women were long-suffering over their errant and impetuous husbands, where the reward for excess is the same outcome as for Maugham’s long-suffering servant in his short story - death.Julian English is the spoilt only son of a frugal but successful doctor. Grandfather English lived a profligate life and committed suicide when his debts got out of hand, and now Julian seems headed the same way with the debt bugaboo having skipped a generation; he owns a Cadillac dealership, is up to his ears in debt, and resentful of his father’s disdain. His childhood sweetheart turned wife of 4 years, Carolyn, tries valiantly to get him to change his drinking to no avail. The flip side of the cast of characters is the working-class types: Lute Fliegler who works for Julien as a car salesman, his wife Irma, Al Grecco the mob errand man, and Ed Charney the mobster and his loose girlfriend, Helene.The action of the novel takes place over 48 hours, from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day, during which Julian goes from one faux pas to the other while drinking himself to death at one party after another. Starting with splashing a drink in the face of Harry Reilly who has loaned Julian the money to keep the Caddy dealership afloat, to taking Helene “outside to the car” in the parking lot of a seedy dive, ostensibly to talk but inferring to the world they were up to hanky panky, to losing a valuable client due to his un-Catholic stance, to cancelling the Boxing Day at his home because he has upset Carolyn, to making an unsuccessful pass at the female journalist who comes to his home to report on the cancelled party, to discovering that despite Harry’s loan the dealership is still in the hole.The two long chapters on Carolyn’s and Julian’s youth shed light on their fragile conditions. She ran through all the eligible men in her social circle while still a virgin and finally settled on Julian as the only path to married respectability. He consorted with the lower classes to make some roughness rub off on him, but that did not happen, and he retreated to his family’s cozy and entitled cocoon to sulk. Julian resents his father’s success as a doctor, he resents not having signed up for the war like his colleagues did despite the horrible injuries they suffered, and he hates the society he was born into, a world of petty jealousies, inconsequential hurts, gossip, and secret transgressions. The working classes, on the other hand, are satisfied with their lot and flout convention without guilt: Lute and Irma are having sex on Christmas Eve when the book opens; Al Grecco has had affairs with Irma and with Julian’s friend Franny, Helene will sleep with any man, and Harry Reilly openly lusts over Carolyn. But all Carolyn and Julian can do is bicker and quarrel.I was reminded of Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Beautiful and the Damned which came out in 1922, and wondered whether this novel was O’Hara’s response to it, or his attempt to keep up with his peer group of literary writers of which he was regarded as the poor cousin. What was missing here was the finesse of Fitzgerald’s prose. O’Hara’s style is more direct, the anger is palpable, the dialogue unnatural, and the POV jumps all over the place, typical of that age before the writing schools took over and lectured us on craft.There is a final appointment for Julian in the book, but it certainly isn’t in the allegorical Samarra....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 26, 2024","Feb 26, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126583.Appointment_in_Samarra

However, in this book, they seem to work because we are completely unaware of the “dreams within a dream” device.The unnamed narrator, X, is on a prison transfer somewhere in California for a retrial, after spending 12 years on Death Row, because new DNA evidence has revealed that she may be innocent of the murder of her infant child, Angel. En route, the prison vehicle meets with a highway accident and this story takes off.X unexplainedly escapes unhurt while the driver and guard perish, and hops a flight to Vancouver to be met by long-suffering husband Vernal who takes her to his cabin within an indigenous community on a Gulf Island of B.C. Vernal is an on-again, off-again alcoholic, a lawyer who represents drug traffickers and addicts, and he has many clients in his island domicile. X, herself a reformed addict (every drug but heroin) is suffering the eternal guilt and loss of her child who, from the fragmented description, appears to have died in Desaguadero (I located it on the border of Peru and Bolivia) under the treatment of a curandero (medicine man). Details about why she was convicted for her son’s death are fuzzy.On the gulf island, we enter the world of addicts, and Musgrave describes them with compassion. Pregnant Gracie and her useless boyfriend Al who is forever drunk. Gracie’s brother Hooker (who has gone clean), and his caretaker friend I-5 who is never short of stashes of drugs and whom Vernal has cleared of a murder charge, are some of the inhabitants.When the ghosts of X’s two executed Death Row cell mates, African-American Frenchy and Mexican Rainy, and their murdered children appear (visible only to X) and take up residence with her on the island, the story gets into higher gear and gives us a clue of what this narrative is all about. When a fragmented news flash says that six commercial aircraft have crashed into Hollywood, Las Vegas, Disneyland, the Vatican, the Eiffel Tower, and the Giza Pyramids, that suspicion is clarified. After a while, the incessant prattling and antics of the ghosts get a bit annoying and distract from the main storyline, and yet they serve to voice universal truths to the living that we, the living, tend to ignore. And there are universal truths galore in this novel. A few I picked up were:1.	For Erotic Sex you use a feather. For Kinky Sex you use the whole chicken.2.	Whiskey does not make you drunk. It just gives you a higher level of lucidity.3.	Normal people burn with a blue flame. Heroin addicts burn with a green flame.4.	We are born alone and die alone, and in between there is only isolation.The plot accelerates with Vernal falling off the wagon and falling into an open grave. Gracie OD’s and has to be hospitalized and the baby ends up in X’s custody through a confluence of bizarre events that includes a murder, an escape, and a cover-up. Even Hooker reveals his true colours to X who had been nursing a secret desire for him now that Vernal was yesterday’s news. For the coup de grace and to cover up all traces of X’s footprints, we have an extremist suicide bombing thrown into the mix, a first for peaceful Vancouver.X now has a second chance to right all the things she did wrong before going to prison: releasing her husband from their hopeless marriage, sorting out her mother’s house and disposing of the old lady’s ashes, and caring for another infant whom she has been “given” by providence – hence the title of the novel. But all this comes at a personal cost, for the remarkably composed and compassionate X who does not display any hard edges from incarceration (my one peeve about this book), succumbs to her old addiction and goes on a cocaine bender, while slinging the newborn close to her breast. “For many years I had stopped wanting cocaine. From that point, it had wanted me.”Of course, all’s well that ends well when the “dreams within a dream” device is revealed and the inconsistencies start to make sense. I shook my head and said, “Shucks, I should have seen that coming.”Musgrave’s writing is visceral, funny, and in-your-face, and she displays great compassion for the fallen....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2024","Feb 19, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16187834-given

But Hanks as a writer? IWe all know Tom Hanks the actor, playing regular heroes in unnatural situations, rendering them superhuman and unforgettable. But Hanks as a writer? I was pleased by this folksy but eclectic collection of stories. Perhaps, Hanks has another career ahead of him when his star power wanes, if it ever does.Collectively, the stories are light, humorous, ironic, and poignant, capturing the heartbeat of America and the spirit of Americana. For a guy who lives with the trappings of wealth and is removed from the man on the street, Hanks does know a lot about middle-class life, perhaps drawing from his experiences before he became a movie icon. The stories hover around Philadelphia, New York and California. A couple are even science fiction. Of this category, I liked the piece “The Past is Important to Us,” in which a billionaire on his fourth wife travels back from the present to the World’s Fair in New York in 1939 repeatedly to meet with an elusive woman even though his life may be at risk.Other pieces that grabbed me were:a.	 “Three Exhausting Weeks,” the first of three stories with the same cast of characters, where the narrator tries living with an übermensch girlfriend who exhausts him – American Overachievement is on display.b.	“Christmas Eve 1953” and “Welcome to Mars” are dramatic.c.	“A Junket in the City of Light” and “Who’s Who” are drawn from Hanks’s world of movies and theatre. In the first story, an unknown actor is on a press tour to promote the third movie in a series where the real star is the female lead who is married to the producer. The schedule is brutal until a twist of fate releases him from his ordeal, revealing how fickle and subject to chance this whole industry is. In the second story, a reasonably accomplished theatre actress from Arizona struggles to make it in New York until she discovers that what is holding her back is her resume and her name.Among the pieces that didn’t quite hit it for me was the very long story, “A Special Weekend” – this was a slice of life with no twists. So was “A Month on Green Street” where a divorcee and her kids move next door to an eligible professor who sees stars – but not many stars ignited between them. “These are Meditations of My Heart” was another flat piece that amounted to a treatise on typewriters. Typewriters are Hanks’s passion and he owns 160 of them. A typewriter motif adorns each story and features somewhere in each of them, like a Hitchcock walk-on-walk-off part. The line-up of stories is punctuated periodically by op-eds from a journalist named Hank Fiset (Hanks) mourning the loss of the world we knew, typewriters being among the lost treasures. Sometimes the predictable ending we see coming doesn’t happen, like in the final story “Steve Wong is Perfect.” I was waiting for this 10-pin bowling star who could never not hit a perfect 10 each time he bowled flame out under the glare of publicity, but Stevie foxed me to the very end. “Go See Costas” also brought out a rather unusual and rude helper of refugees to America by telling them to “get lost!”Hanks tries for the complex literary sentence but often gets lost. He is best with his punchy dialogue which is best demonstrated by billionaire FXR and his assistant Ms. Mercury as they try to rescue a motel sidelined by a new highway in “Stay With Us” – this dexterity with dialogue I put down to Hanks’s experience in reading and writing screenplays, the format for this particular story.An easily readable collection that touches on nostalgia, reminding us of what is good in America despite the angst running through it these days....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 11, 2024","Feb 11, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34389773-uncommon-type

Fidelma is forty, with a husband over sixty, desperately wanting a child; she is willing to do a deal with the devil for his demon seed. When Dragan is arrested and the truth comes out, Fidelma’s adultery is revealed in this very Catholic backwater, where religious fervour and prejudice overrule rationality.The fallout of her illicit union with a mass murderer is a life of banishment and abuse for Fidelma. From a horrible rape inflicted upon her by Dragan’s hunters, to the double rejection by her husband and the tiny town of Cloonoila, she flees to London to find refuge among former refugees. She takes on a string of dead-end jobs before coming to grips with her seething hate for Dragan and realizing that it can only be quenched by confrontation.That fatal meeting comes when Dragan is on trial for his war crimes in the Netherlands. And yet, Fidelma could take a lesson from past megalomaniacs – they are never wrong, it is always the other person’s fault. Reconciliation and reparation are never going to be possible with Dragan who stands up in court and shreds all accusations levelled against him. The story ends on this pregnant note, with some hope that the judicial decision, whenever it eventually comes, will lead to justice for all. In the meantime, Fidelma has to be satisfied with small victories, like husband Jack making good for his harsh treatment of her.O’Brien’s prose is elegant and poetic. Her style will befuddle the writing schools that came afterwards and straight-jacketed writers with arbitrary rules of craft. Past and present tenses weave in and out of her sentences. Points of view jump all over the place, characters narrate in first and third person, and pronouns are attributed to different people in the same sentence or in subsequent sentences – but who cares? The authorial voice comes through strongly in this unorthodox style. “If it works, use it,” seems to be her motto. Her strong point is imagery: Jack killing the mating bats upon discovering his wife cheating on him, and the mashed sheep in the hollow projecting the punishment awaiting Fidelma for her transgression born of the need to produce a child, are vivid.That said, I had some difficulty understanding how Dragan could exhibit extreme brutality in his past life in Bosnia and extreme asceticism in his place of exile in Ireland without “falling off his horse and being struck blind” – perhaps he is indeed the Devil. The middle section of the book, when Fidelma is in London, also dragged for me, and the last part when she is in Holland for the trial just fell off the edge because nothing conclusive came of it. Perhaps that was O’Brien’s message – don’t make deals with the Devil.  ...more",Notes are private!,4,4,1,not set,"Feb 03, 2024","Feb 03, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25064563-the-little-red-chairs

Charmian, a retired novelist, suffering from dementia, but seeing a resurgence in the popularity of her novels; Godfrey, her philandering husband, needs her money and her company; Dame Lettie, Charmian’s sister, with the money, and the first to receive the mysterious calls that send her into a series of irrational and tragic behaviours; Lisa Brook, another rich heiress and patron of the arts, whose money everyone is out to get; Guy Sleet, womanizing art critic, who has “seen” everyone’s secrets; Peter Mannering, mad poet, smarting for being ignored by the literati; Alec Warner who is chronicling old people’s habits, including their body temperature when receiving good or bad news, and storing them in a vast repository in his tinderbox flat; Miss Taylor, Charmian’s companion, now confined to a nursing home with crippling arthritis; Mrs. Pettigrew, Lisa’s maid and companion, ruthlessly conniving to procure the wealth of everyone she works for. There is also a secondary cast of characters, too numerous to mention. The problem with all these characters is that they are representatives of the British class structure and are therefore cardboard cutouts in the hands of the bold, critical and judgmental omniscient narrator. The mysterious caller kicks off the elderly cast into committing irrational acts, making drastic decisions, being contrarian, breaking past loyalties, and blaming the police for not being able to apprehend the perpetrator. Sometimes the voice of the caller is that of a mature man, sometimes that of a younger man, and sometimes a woman. We soon come to realize that this is not a whodunit, the caller is merely a device, and this is a meditation on death and the impermanence of everything in life.The class barrier is also breached: Mrs. Pettigrew and Miss Taylor have secret relationships with their employers or their friends. Similarly, the working class alternates in trying to destroy the upper class or in supporting them. For instance, Mrs. Pettigrew blackmails Godfrey for his peccadillos which she manages to ferret out by going through his personal effects; Miss Taylor, on the other hand, decides to betray her former boss, Charmian, and her indiscretions, just so that Godfrey can level the playing field. Being seventy is the cut-off between young and old, it appears in this novel, the figurative Biblical “three- score and ten.” Miss Taylor intones,” Being over 70 is like being engaged in a war. All our friends are dead or dying and we are all suffering from war nerves.” Despite that, the Octogenarians are randy as ever, some marry twenty-somethings, and others prefer to catch a glimpse of their female prey “between the top of their stocking and tip of their suspender.”In the end, despite all their shenanigans, struggles, and engagement with life, death is the enemy, not the mysterious phone caller. We are treated to a listing of how all these characters meet their end: some through illness, some suddenly, some tragically. There is no escaping that voice “Memento Mori: Remember, you must die.”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 23, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/120158.Memento_Mori

She befriends older cousin Nathaniel and the Japanese gardener’s son, Ichimei Fukuda, the former to become her later husband, the latter to become her lover. When the book opens, 81-year-old Alma has suddenly left Sea Cliff where she had always lived, to take up residence in a nursing home for the underprivileged, Lark House, where she continues to receive flowers and letters from her secret admirer. She takes on Irina, herself a care worker with a murky past and of Moldovan extraction, as her assistant. Alma’s grandson, Seth, the inheritor of the Belasco’s legal business, and the family’s claim to fame and wealth, is madly in love with Irina. Alma is known to disappear from Lark House occasionally, and from what Irina discovers, these are for secret assignations with her Japanese lover in various hotels around the area. At least that is the surface story.What emerges in liberal data dumps of information, the latest piece often cancelling out the previous impression we’ve formed of the players, is a story of secret loves driven into dark corners by society’s treatment of mixed-race unions, homosexuality, and sexual abuse in the second half of the 20th century. As Irina digs deeper into Alma’s papers and enjoys long conversations with her employer, a complex picture of the older woman emerges: the loss of her parents to the Nazis, a brother shot down over France, an on-again-off-again relationship with Ichimei, an art career that took her around the world and attracted lovers with none of the calibre of the poetic and philosophical Japanese gardener, the brotherly protection of Nathaniel that extended to marriage, and the hotel bills where this octogenarian was still having her secret assignations. For her part, Alma regrets not marrying Ichimei, attributing it to weakness and selfishness, and being unable to leave the trappings of Sea Cliff for the ghetto of the Japanese gardener family. “The disadvantages of poverty drove out love.” As for Nathaniel, Alma respects his secrets; he in turn respects and permits her to meet her secret lover for their rendezvous – why, we will only discover in the last pages of the book. Irina is forced to face her demons too: her mother escaping Moldova to end up a prostitute in Italy, her coming to the US as a child and falling under the spell of an evil stepfather, having Seth desperately in love with her but being unable to reciprocate his affections due to the emotional baggage that prevents her from touching or being touched. And we begin to second guess the unreliable narrator: is Seth from the Belasco line or the Fukuda’s?The incarceration of the first generation of Japanese residents in the US during WWII, the issei, and the consequent rebelling by their progeny, the nissei, are well drawn. So is the process of aging and the loss of independence of those in Lark House: of hearing-aid batteries being recharged, violent impulses, avarice and persecution that comes with loneliness, of carrying winter on your back; to hesitate over every step, to confuse words, to have poor sight, arthritic pain, and constant fatigue. “Age doesn’t make you better or wiser, it only accentuates what you’ve always been.” When death visits the principal characters, especially a patriarch or matriarch, they are moments of reflection and regrouping, new beginnings for the survivors, and an opportunity for Allende to drop new information that changes the mental map we had of the story thus far. And yet these withheld secrets on the part of the author, mirror the secrets the characters keep from each other and make for an interesting rendition of a family story with its usual ups and downs. There is nothing unusual in this story except in its telling. And the very heavy “telling” is also its shortcoming, for in places it resembles a family history more than a novel. I read another family saga novel of Allende’s recently (that  is also on Goodreads) A Long Petal Of The Sea, and that novel too has a similar treatment. Every detail seems necessary for inclusion, like the grandparents washing and putting the grandchild to bed, family vacations, and quotidian domestic activities. I’m not sure all this is warranted even if it is in the interest of painting fully rounded characters. Somehow, I prefer Allende’s books on magic realism, like House of Secrets. But if you ask me who was the mysterious stranger who came to Alma’s deathbed, a phenomenon that could not be explained later, I’d like to think that there was a pinch of magic sprinkled in there amidst the heavy family narrative....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2024","Jan 21, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25152052-the-japanese-lover

He gains entry to a black state college after winning a competition which he describes in a dream where candidates box on an electrified mat, fighting for a reward of coins. IM believes in black-white co-operation, while his grandfather, a liberated slave, warns of white betrayal. He takes a white benefactor of the college, Mr. Norton, on a tour of the neighborhood, and ends up exposing him to a black sharecropper who has impregnated both his wife and daughter; they then wind up at the Golden Day, a bar full of shell-shocked black vets who give Norton a telling off for his race’s blindness and duplicity, rendering the white man ill from overexposure to stark black reality and anger. For overstepping his bounds and bringing shame upon the black community, IM is punished by his headmaster, Dr. Bledsoe, another servile black man to his white patrons, but a dictator within the school. IM does various jobs in New York and learns that the black man is “the machine within the machines” that keeps the white man’s world working, yet blacks are not united and fight among themselves. One such fight lands him in hospital and exposes him to rounds of electroshock therapy that makes him a new man; he even forgets his name. Now he is able to speak his truth, powered by fear and anger. He is drawn to the Brotherhood of Man, a mixed-race organization “working for a better world for all people.” His gift of oratory - low on substance, high on emotion - makes him their spokesperson, and lands him a job as a fellow Brother in charge of the Harlem district. Yet, he senses that there is dissension in the Brotherhood, jealousy over his popularity on the street, and he is excluded from the grander strategy of the organization, although, for the first time, he finds purpose in his life and is no longer invisible. He senses attempts of entrapment when white women lure him into their bedrooms, but the call of his loins renders him unable to avoid such temptations.When he is accused of overreach and transferred, pending an investigation into his conduct, all hell breaks loose in his district and a giant race riot erupts, forcing IM into the grim reality that he is still invisible, still a pawn in a much larger game. Despite IM’s desire that everyone be equal, his grandfather’s philosophy is still alive – you can’t trust the white man. IM retreats into a cellar, and into true invisibility. Key scenes are too long: the boxing match; the sharecropper’s tale about his sexual peccadillos with his wife and daughter; Norton at the Golden Day; Barbee’s eulogy to the founder of the black college, IM’s tryst with Sybil, the race riot, and many more. Yet metaphors and symbols compensate: the inscription on the briefcase IM wins for gaining entry into college, “Keep the Nigger Boy Running”; Brother Tarp’s leg-link that IM uses as an ornament and a weapon; Brother Clifton selling Sambo dolls; the evicted couple on the sidewalk that kickstarts IM’s career with the Brotherhood; the red-headed woman giving IM hell for trying to use her garbage pail; the syphilitic man begging; Ras the Exhorter turned Destroyer astride his horse and armed with a spear; white Brother Jack’s revealed glass eye suggesting his lack of insight into the problems of Harlem blacks; Rinehart, the only successful black because of his ability to shapeshift between being a pastor, a numbers man, a ladies’ man, and a thug.A lot of is left hanging: what happened with the investigation into IM’s overreach - was he found guilty or innocent? Did the white women he had sex with betray him? And what was the Brotherhood’s grand strategy that led them to sacrifice Harlem? And despite IM’s pledge to rise from the cellar and strike back at the white man in Rinehart-like style, we are left waiting for that to happen. We take away that just as IM sits in his cellar, illuminated by 1369 lights—another symbol for healing and self-care—the black problem will remain unresolved, and the black man will remain invisible in the white man’s world, just like wiser people such as Grandpa, the mad vets, and Ras had predicted....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 12, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16981.Invisible_Man

Her younger siblings—teenagers Otto and Lou—are hard workers but are not planners, and youngest brother, Emil, her surrogate child, is only five.Many of those who came out east to farm were not farmers by trade and did not have the skill or will to tough it out in the unforgiving Nebraska sun. Alexandra, like author Cather, is a product of the land and is inseparable from it. Hence, all she can do is stay and make a go of it. “We come and go, but the land is always there,” she says. Through shrewd moves of buying when droughts happen and farmers sellout, Alexandra amasses a sizeable family fortune over the next 16 years, divides it with her brothers, and sends Emil to college. She remains single, for the only love of her life, Carl, five years younger, was one of those farmers who sold out and went back east to seek paid employment. The neighbours are a mix of Europeans: Germans, French, Swedes, Norwegians, and Slavs (called Bohemians in this novel) from what is modern Czechia today. Villages go by the name of Hannover and Sainte-Agnes. Customs, carnivals, and religious traditions are European set amidst the sprawling American landscape.When Carl returns to the Divide, dissatisfied with his life as an engraver, and is headed west to the goldfields of the Klondike, their dormant but unexpressed romance blooms in Alexandra’s breast. Compounding this unrequited love is the parallel unexpressed love developing between young Emil, home for the holidays from college, who ignites his passion with childhood sweetheart Marie, now living on Carl’s old farm. Marie, a free spirit, is married to a disheartened European nobleman, Frank, who is finding farming in Nebraska to be a boring drudgery and has taken to drink and to making his wife’s life a misery.Carl’s presence ignites a family feud, as Otto and Lou figure that Alexandra will cut Carl in for a piece of land and cut them out. Prejudices like “The property of the family belong to the men in the family” start to spew. A confluence of events brings the situation to a boil resulting in a Shakesperean tragedy, and bodies fall all about. Like the tenuous land, Alexandra loses one dream but latches onto another in the hope that “mature lovers will not have the dreams of younger ones.”Alexandra, the protagonist, has been described by Elaine Showalter in the book’s introduction as asexual. I found Alexandra to be restrained and stoic, a product of her time, caring more for the farm and her family than for herself and for expressing her feelings. Cather’s descriptions of heterosexual relations in the novel are also restrained, and I wonder whether this was because of her own homosexuality.As the title suggests, this is a pioneer novel of America, written from an unusual angle, and is not the stereotypical one of cowboys and Indians. Written in short chapters, and taken firmly in hand by an omniscient narrator, it is essential reading for those interested in How the West Was Also Won....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/140963.O_Pioneers_

Oyster brings the message of untold riches to be found in the black opal, the most valuable in that precious stone family, lying under the ranches of elders Andrew Godwin (100,000 acres) and Dukke Van Kerk, aka the Prophet, (250,000 acres).Opal hunters and runaways flock into Outer Maroo, and from there travel to Oyster’s Reef, a commune built by its eponymous leader on the site of the new opal mine. Like all outback towns, the locals are wary of outsiders, except for Oyster who has everyone in his spell. However, this utopia soon becomes dystopian, for travel outside is prohibited (petrol is rationed), mail is withheld, women start getting pregnant (Oyster is sowing his seed liberally) while others are dying under the intense heat, the Australian government and its agencies are labelled Satan and his disciples, the rancher’s begin arming, while Old Fuckatoo (the wind that howls in that part of the continent) gathers force to hit the town and the Reef like it did once before in the previous century.Those who challenge the new order are silenced: like Susanna Rover, the schoolteacher, whose fate we discover only in a throw-away piece of narration, and Rev. Given who is deposed from the local church in favour of Oyster, so that the latter can preach his fire and brimstone message of the coming Armageddon. Oyster’s behaviour becomes increasingly paranoid, leading to the opal mine burning down three years after he arrives, and Outer Maroo burning down a year later. The causes are unknown, although human intervention is implied, helped by Old Fuckatoo who keeps the town constantly polluted with the smell of Sulphur, dead animals, and other unpleasant odours. Of course this rather simplistic story line is not delivered in chronological order, and that was my problem. We start a week before the end and then go forward and back in time, jumping POVs of the main characters: Mercy Given, 16-year-old daughter of the Reverend, who works in the post office-general store, and who is traumatized by her visit to Oyster’s Reef in search of her brother; Jess, barmaid, survivor, and sexually hungry railway brat; Major Miner, Jess’s older lover, WWII vet, and explosives expert who is still fighting nightmares of the Fall of Singapore; Dorothy Godwin, kleptomaniac wife of the sexually promiscuous rancher Andrew; Nick and Sarah, parents of rebellious children who were lured to the Reef only to disappear.Stories that jump around like this and offer snippets of information along the way, from which the reader has to piece together the whole, are somewhat gimmicky; they beg the question of whether there is sufficient meat on the bone that it has to be rationed out sparingly and confusingly? Most of the action takes place in people’s recollections, imaginings, and dreams, and through oblique references – i.e., off-stage. A line of dialogue will suddenly plug a hole in our storyboard, and that too, an often incomplete line: “Did everyone….?” (meaning, did everyone die?). We occasionally get philosophical insights: “Extremism is everywhere,” “Revenge never solves anything.” However, because their internal musings carry most of the story, the characters do not come alive on the page in real-time action until the final chapters of the novel.To the author’s credit, this book was published in 1996 and the Doomsday Clock was set by Oyster for the year 2000. That was a time when long-form, digressive, and indirect literature was acceptable, even fashionable within the right circles. In today’s attention span-deprived time, where getting to the heart of the matter by Page 5 is paramount, I wonder whether this book would get the appreciation it deserves? Read it for a look back at a vanished form of writing, rich in complexity, as vanished as that small Outback town and its huge mineral wealth....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2023","Dec 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/617558.Oyster

Lee, eminent poet of Canada, chose to write a non-fictional account of the traitor and less-than-desirable personality, Joseph Willcocks. I found the reason at the end of this rather short book, where in an essay on Peacock Point and its eponymous villains who were intrinsically linked to the War of 1812, and where Lee has a cottage, the author mentions that his desire to find out the history of the land he lived on had led to uncovering the facts behind the myths and to the writing of this book.Joseph Willcocks is an old Tory from Ireland, driven to Canada by family debts. Handsome, athletic, and a ladies’ man, he soon makes the right moves, thanks to cousins who are already established in Upper Canada. And yet, full access is denied without connections, in this colony run under the new shopkeepers’ aristocracy comprised of a largely Scottish cabal. Letters he requests from home to prove his loyalty to the Crown, never arrive, and Willcocks is forced to live on his wits. He also appears to have a loose tongue, is impressionable in his political convictions, and is given to fighting with peers. He soon loses his job with Peter Russell, Chief Administrator, over an impropriety with Russel’s half-sister. On the rebound, he solicits the Chief Justice to obtain a sheriff’s job. He opens a newspaper, but comes under the influence of the Whigs and their pro-democracy bent, an ideology frowned upon by the new Governor Gore who is intent on cleaning out these insurrectionary elements.What drives Willcocks over to the American side comes through a series of events as Canada and the United States lurch towards war. At first, he bravely acquits himself for the British by enlisting the indigenous tribes of Grand River, and by supporting General Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights. But being repeatedly ignored by the elites who run Upper Canada, the shutting down of his newspaper, being fired from his sheriff’s job and thrown in jail despite getting elected to the legislature, and witnessing the suspension of civil rights in a colony trying to maintain control of a populace torn between place of birth and ideology of conviction, finally breaks his loyalty. In April 1813, Willcocks is trading on the reputation of a zealous British patriot, yet in May of that year he is fearing arrest; what happened in-between is not clear. Given the character that the author paints however—based on records assembled from a myriad of historical sources, including Wilcocks’s diary and papers—I think our man, seeing the war go badly for his side by 1813, and, given his proclivity to seek personal advantage without the benefit of connections among the Upper Canada aristocracy, jumped ship. Willcocks becomes a thorn in the British side, thereafter. His crew of Canadian Volunteers fighting for the Americans, torches the town of Newark (Niagara), and takes command of Fort Erie. His end comes fast and ingloriously, and could have warranted more detail. What is more detailed is the account of the drawing, hanging, and quartering of the eight British defectors at Burlington Heights (Hamilton), an event reported from many angles in this book, and at which trial Willcocks is also convicted in absentia. Lee paints a picture of Willcocks with an assemblage of historical material, supplemented with his own poetry and essays. And yet, dry history falls short, for it tells you what happened, but not how it felt. And the convoluted politics of the time, which is different from what exists today, is a gap for the non-academic reader. Who was Willcocks really, what drove him? These details, alas, are still lost to us, despite Lee’s valiant effort to resurrect this part of Canadian history in digestible form....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 24, 2023","Dec 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/204312628-king-joe

And this memoir, written in In the hands of a writer, and an accomplished one at that, even the most mundane life can come alive in dramatic quality. And this memoir, written in the winter of Paul Auster’s 64th year, brings into focus not only the author’s life but also Boomer life over that time period.I recently read Lessons by Ian McEwan, a fictionalized account of that author’s 70 plus years on the planet, and Auster’s journal has a resemblance, in that both authors seem determined to gain immortality by leaving a record of their life activities, whether fictionalized or real, in the public domain.Winter Journal is narrated in second person, a challenging yet convenient device, because the names of other people need not be mentioned; they only need to be described as “your wife,” “your father”, “your neighbour” etc,. There is no chronology of time here, but one of memory, each scene being recorded as and when they recur to him. Yet, we are able to piece together Auster’s life journey as a career writer: the eldest child in a lonely childhood spent with distant or domineering parents and a schizophrenic sister; escape from school and family into a peripatetic existence on board ships, in Paris for a few years, and back to New York living in hovels in order to write; early struggles writing poetry and dabbling in journalism for minimal pay; a starter marriage that also had many false starts; a breakout book that leads to a different kind of life and an established career with a second writer-wife; the death of parents; facing one’s demons and looming mortality. This is also the typical boomer life path, irrespective of the industry we work in.Auster is constantly dodging crippling anxiety attacks, yet, like Dickens, walks to shake off his demons and for literary inspiration. He is sexually unrestrained in his youth (weren’t we all in the hippie ’60/70s”?) making out with strangers in planes and contracting STDs in strange places. To his support, the uncertainty of life may have been a driver: his grandfather was murdered by his grandmother, his mother dropped dead of a heart attack at 77 and his father of the same ailment at 66, his friend was struck dead by a lightning bolt at 14. These events may have led to his favourite theme of “Chance” that plays so heavily in his fiction. He is therefore unafraid to explore the darker side of humanity and dives into illness and dying without pulling punches. A few sequences in this disjointed narrative are explored in greater depth than others: the descriptions of the many houses he has lived in provides another incisive picture of his life trajectory; the lamentation on the death of his mother explores the inherent sadness that accompanies him; the meditation on his hands takes us through the many milestones in his life. The itemization of the number of times he could have been killed by a random accident – swallowing a fish bone, knocking his head in a fall et al – is possibly another reason for Auster’s pre-occupation with Chance.A few philosophical gems are dropped along the way, and I find these important when coming from writers of Auster’s eminence:“The question of race can only bring dishonour to the person asking it.”“Panic is the expression of mental flight.”“One must die lovable.”There is no dialogue in this journal, and Auster must be glad, for he is not a very dialogue- intensive writer, even in his fiction. Given that we can never reproduce dialogue as it really happened in a memoir, the “telling” works well for this book and renders it more authentic.This book is an affirmation to boomers that, warts and all, they lived during a great moment in history, one that has vanished now as social media and other technological developments have driven us into a surveillance society where freedoms have been lost instead of enhanced....more",Notes are private!,2,9,1,not set,"Dec 17, 2023","Dec 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13516651-winter-journal

The protagonist, Roland Baines, is approximately the author’s age, a gifted pianist who falls early prey to the ills of the boomer age. Let’s see, all the perils are there: sexual abuse as a pre-teen and being sexualized by an older woman in his teens, dropping out of school, drifting through many relationships in search of Paradise Lost, inability to commit, insomnia, drifting through careers, an impulsive and disastrous first marriage, single parenthood, a second marriage with a blended family, parents aging and dying of dementia and cancer and other ills, those same ills descending upon himself, preparing for death and trying to achieve immortality by writing a memoir that captures it all – yes, it’s all here, and if you are a boomer, as I am, you will hang onto this rather long-winded and episodic story, for you will see yourself in some or all the episodes. I counted myself in all.Historic events in those 75 years also play close to Roland’s life: the Suez Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Chernobyl, the fall of the Berlin Wall, to name a few. The Suez crisis when he was six saw him evacuated to a British military camp in Egypt; the Cuban affair leads him to rush to sex with his older music teacher in his anxiety that he would be dead the next day and would never enjoy an orgasm; the Berlin Wall’s fall relieves him of the guilt for smuggling western literature and music across the border to his East German friends that may have led to their internment and banishment by the Stasi; Chernobyl makes him seal his apartment and eat and drink only from tins and bottles for fear of contamination.The story drifts lifelessly in sections, just like Roland’s listless life, but is punctuated periodically with dramatic confrontations and reconciliations: Roland and his music teacher, Roland and his ex-wife, Roland’s son and his mother, Roland and his father. McEwan even parachutes in a forgotten brother (directly drawn from his own life) who was given up for adoption during WWII to avoid a scandal and who shows up later in life to make Roland realize that the “brother” had enjoyed a more stable life than him.The women in the story are the most dramatic: Rosalind, Roland’s mother, working class and uneducated, who gave up two children for adoption after her first husband was killed in battle, but had an affair with Roland’s father and later married him, only to be abused and bullied by him for the rest of her life; Jane, Roland’s mother-in-law, the frustrated journalist who went over to the continent at the end of the war to write the scoop of the year but fell in love instead and settled for married mediocrity in Germany; Miriam, the music teacher, 11 years older than Roland, who controls and sexualizes him, destroying his music career and distorting his conception of love and fidelity; Alissa, Roland’s wife, who abandons husband and infant, to do better than her mother and become Germany’s greatest novelist; Daphne, his best friend, who later becomes his second wife when it is too late, and the woman who gives him a home and cares for his son and her children in a happy domestic environment.McEwan gets to voice his own observations about this period through his characters:“Christianity has been the cold dead hand on European Imagination” – Roland“You can’t make love night and day, even though we desire it. It’s the price we pay for order on the streets,” - Joe Coppinger, Roland’s friend.“Daily life in the city, from tea to eggs and bacon, to ambulances, was sustained by hidden systems, knowledge, tradition, networks, effort, and profit” – Roland as a student.There is no novelistic arc in this book, but only a life arc. And just as with life, there are large swarths of dull periods when nothing dramatic is building or happening. But as Roland experiences his ups and downs in life (mostly downs) I kept constantly asking myself, “Would I have reacted this way?” or more appropriately, “Did I react this way?” From that perspective, this is a good guidebook and check sheet for boomers who are taking stock of their lives at this point in time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 08, 2023","Dec 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60092581-lessons

The action takes place in 2021, but there is no Covid pandemic running around the world, instead there is nuclear fallout from the last World War, which has rendered the planet uninhabitable and caused a migration to Mars. The only ones left on earth are the old, the specials (those mentally handicapped from inhaling too much nuclear dust), and those deemed essential to keep Planet Earth functioning for the departed migrants. Mars is a dull place and migrants are given an android servant to alleviate their circumstances. The androids, smarter than humans but devoid of empathy, are fed-up with their servile and sterile existence on the red planet and are secretly returning to earth to take up human identities. Rick Deckard, android bounty hunter, is tasked with testing suspected androids and “retiring” them (i.e., destroying them).Philip K. Dick got a few more things wrong about 2021: he has secretaries and telephone books still around, the Soviet Union is also in existence, and everyone still works in offices. But he did get one thing right: the empathy box, aka the smartphone; everyone has one to keep in touch with one another and to surf the virtual world of Mercerism. Mercer, the supposed founder of this philosophy of empathy, proposes that we need only “kill the killers.” He also proposes that “a basic condition of life is that at some point you will be required to violate your identity,” which the androids seem to be doing successfully by assuming human identities.Another strange facet of this world is the human pre-occupation and craving for live animals, most of whom have died in the nuclear fallout. Electric animals are cheap supplements, but they are no better than the non-empathetic androids. Deckard’s stated ambition is to buy a live goat to replace his electric sheep with the bounty money he receives ($1000 per retired android – I guess, Dick had got inflation wrong too!).Through a convoluted plot, Deckard hunts down his quarry: eight escaped androids who could be anyone, as the one test he is provided with to prove their lack of empathy has some serious flaws in it. In the course of his hunt, he wonders whether he too is displaying signs of androidism, as he retires his targets without empathy. And he begins to have feelings for some androids, as they for him. The androids even eat and drink and have sex with him – go figure, Mercer’s prophecy is coming true. The climax, which I will not give away, leaves Deckard with questions about his identity, about Mercerism, and about where do we place value. Would adopting a toad do the trick? Dick, being the doomsday prophet, is seeming to imply that life on earth is screwed and that we are heading for extinction. At least, between 1968 and now that prophecy seems to be holding, and he seems to have got that one right....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Nov 30, 2023","Nov 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36402034-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep

Hall.The methodologies range from the textual to the reader-response driven, from the material to the psychoanalytical, from the structural to the post-structural, from gender to sexual, from race to post-colonial, and also includes a pluralistic methodology that combines multiple individual methodologies previously discussed. In the last methodology, there is recognition that traditional cultural forms of poetry, drama, novels, and essays are being supplemented with newer forms such as journalism and news reportage, letters, diaries, popular songs, fashion, film, advertising and television. Before embarking on a , it is therefore advisable to choose the methodology that most appropriately matches the core points you want to unearth.That said, some great writers and their work are ed here: Wordsworth’s “Intimations,” Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Shakespeare’s King Lear, Melville’s Billy Budd, a comparison of Marlow to Shakespeare with emphasis on Romeo & Juliet, Richard Wright’s Native Son, and Dickens’s Great Expectations. A  of advertising under the methodology of Structuralism and Semiotics also indicates how much the symbols of advertising have influenced our cultural evolution.The s themselves are quite long, in excess of twenty pages in some instances, and I wondered whether they served only the academic’s expansive desire for words with no concern for brevity in these attention-starved times. There is a great deal of repetition as the er circles their point from many angles, despite having made it a long time ago: Mercutio and Romeo’s phallic dalliance is looked at from several vantage points wherever they occur in the play before concluding that these two young men did not act upon what was suggested in the text; the irony of Billy Budd’s innocence which leads him to violence vs. Cleggart’s treachery that attracts violence is referred to many times; the insistence that marriage is the key to survival of the failing aristocracy comes up at every plot twist in Pride and Prejudice. These central points echo with annoying consistency throughout each . I’m not sure whether any of those s would make it into shorter-form  sites such as Goodreads or Amazon without radical surgery. And yet this book gives us a view into the depth at which s of literature could (and should?) be undertaken. Far better to go deep than shallow, they seem to imply, and mine the depth of human experience and perception that have led to the present pass, rather than reduce book s to thinly veiled sales promo pieces that litter most  sites today.

Traumatized, she is visited by the Goddess Pampa and given immortal life for 250 years, among other magical gifts. Pampa Kampana brings to life an entire city with her thoughts, creates new people and infuses histories into them, and creates a liberated world where women are equal (in fact, all the soldiers are women); sati is outlawed, the arts flourish, and governance is tempered with love. However, patriarchy demands that only a king can rule, and so the brothers Hakka and Bukka, goatherds, become King #1 and #2 respectively, and Pampa is obliged to marry both in turn. She is however attracted to Portuguese men and has her first crop of smart children (three daughters) from Domingo Nunes, a horse-trader (the guy who mispronounced the city’s name into posterity), and her second crop of stupid children (three boys) from husband #2, Bukka, after Hakka dies.Thereafter, start the palace intrigues that are too numerous to mention here but which are all interesting, interspersed with some dull periods where I could imagine Rushdie saying, “Now what spice can I add here from the known intrigues of royal families?” So, we get wars, and jealousies, scheming gurus, and poisoning, and childhood deaths of heirs, invasions by enemies, and invasions by the King of Bisnagar to expand the kingdom. There is a period of exile when Pampa and her daughters fall out of favour with the successors to Bukka and leave Bisnagar to enter the Enchanted Forest. The invasion of the pink monkeys who practice “divide and conquer” on the black and brown monkeys, follows, and one wonders whether this is a metaphor for earlier lighter-skinned foreigners like Marco Polo or Ibn Batuta who passed through India, or a foreshadowing of the European colonizers to come. Pampa helps drive the pink monkeys away but then falls into her deep sleep and we advance 140 years. All the while she is still a youthful woman and is witnessing the dying of her progeny.In the post-sleep period, more intrigues are afoot as Pampa is re-invited to the palace of the new ruler, an arrogant, impulsive man not from her lineage, Krishnadevaraya, the God King. Pampa, along with her sixth-generation daughter Zerelda-Li helps the king vanquish the surrounding five sultanates in the north and exert control over the land. King Krishna however marries the poisonous Tiramala Devi, daughter of the king of another warring kingdom in the south, for political reasons, and relegates Zarelda-Li to second wife status, and he uses Pampa as regent to run the kingdom while he is on his various military campaigns. The scene is set for the decline of the empire just as the Portuguese are setting up camp on the shores of Goa.There are many metaphors, symbols, and historical points that Rushdie makes in addition to the pink monkey invasion: Pampa’s attraction to western men is akin to India’s dependence and attraction to the West before it became a power in its own right in the 21st century; the priests and gurus like Vidyasagar are the Khomeini-types who influence and fracture societies; “divide and conquer” was practiced in India long before the British arrived; blinding the wise ones or destroying their manuscripts are the ploys that ignorant and insecure leaders use when feeling threatened by knowledge.Given the two and half centuries being covered in this book, many characters are cardboard cutouts and play only during the time period they function in, while Pampa Campana is the central figure who weaves through them all and is the only fully fleshed-out one. By using the “narrative within a narrative device” i.e., the author of this narrative (Rushdie) is explaining that he has found a diary written by Pampa called the Jayaparajaya and that it has various inconsistencies. These include time leaps, characters being introduced without warning, and other novelistic inconsistencies. Rusdhie also gets away with the mammoth amount of “telling” that goes on in this book because he is covering such a long time sweep. This excuse is a good cop-out for male author Rushdie, but not so flattering for the female author Pampa Kampana writing in her diary over 600 years ago. I could also see that Rusdie was having fun with this book which did not have some of the pent up anger of similar novels such as Shalimar the Clown that also covered violent periods of Indian history....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2023","Nov 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61111246-victory-city

I gather he was Republican although he denied a political affiliation. He espoused hard work, decried consumerism, abhorred war, promoted the idea of “Being American” as a necessary solution for other countries, shot his mouth off in politically sensitive areas, got suspended, got re-instated when ratings declined in his absence, and represented the voice of Everyman trying to make sense of a changing post-WWII world.The prose is utilitarian, and Andy does not use apostrophes, as he claims he is writing for a script that he will later read from, and he understands that “Ive” is the same as “I’ve.” Some topics get revisited, like the consumer price index, because it appears that Andy visits every grocery shop, clothing store, travel agency, and gas station to keep tabs on prices. He also appears to get a copy of every newspaper and magazine in the land to keep abreast of the news and pick topics for exploration under his caustic and witty pen.While he could be off on some lost tangent by making inane statements such as “50% of students are dumb,” or others against feminists and gays – statements that earned him hate mail or suspensions – he was bang-on about a few things that he was unafraid to call out: 1.	Countries get polarized when presidents are impeached (he lived through the Clinton experience).2.	Ballpoint pens were the worst invention. Rubber bands were the best.3.	Elections should have (a) a campaign running no longer than three months, (b) there should be limits on large corporate sponsorships, (c) winning candidates should post their promises in public, and (d) no polls should be published until after the election. 4.	Spies are a waste of time and money. Surprisingly, John Le Carre, the writer who profited most from the spy genre, arrived at that same conclusion at the end of his career.5.	Why is the government spending so much on military tanks when they are the most unmaneuverable in warfare?Some of the topics are pedestrian: telephone directories, cook-books, eating out, gloves, maps, vans, mail, and toothbrushes (renamed teethbrushes). It is almost as if Andy wants to take apart these most mundane of things we encounter in our daily lives, and hold them up for us to view from his off-centre perspective. However, I liked his fictitious rendering of President Bush and Hosni Mubarak attending a baseball game – the clash of cultures was well drawn, humorously.His ideas for improving the world are equally off the wall:1.	Dump US junk mail in Iraq (during the rule of Saddam Hussein). The avalanche may destabilize the dictatorship.2.	Put advertising on US dollar notes to help reduce the national debt.3.	Make the Japanese spend more on weapons so that they won’t have a surplus to invest in manufacturing and beat the US in consumer products.4.	Women should wear clothes with more pockets if they want to be equal to men – you see why this guy got into hot water! After awhile there is a sameness to these essays. And I can imagine someone having to do this for 33 years, well into his nineties, finally getting stale on the idea side while desperately stoking his critical fire. He laments the world passing him by in some articles, and the loss of his hold on the conscience of the nation as he becomes more of an anachronism. I read elsewhere that Andy Rooney died within a month of retiring from his last show on 60 Minutes. As much as he was an anchor on that show, the show must have anchored him to life....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 13, 2023","Nov 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/176241.Years_of_Minutes

This novel, reflects her life somewhat, although it has a male protagonist, a standard of those times if a book was to go anywhere.Jonathan Jaimieson, of Silver City, Ohio, arrives in New York determined to find his real father. He only has dead mother Connie’s diaries and letters from her short sojourn in New York in the ’30s where she edited and performed secretarial duties (and a bit more on the side) for notable artists, writers, and academics who inhabited and still hover around the Village. Connie, who may be a proxy for Powell, returned to Ohio, pregnant, and married Jaimison Sr. who treated the illegitimate son horribly. Jonathan gets a job in the Village, writing copy for a historical magazine and shares a studio/flat with two good-time girls, Lize and Darcy, who seem to make a living out of partying and stealing each other’s boyfriends. Soon, Jonathan is dipping his wick into both his flat mates when they run out of men. The Golden Spur bar is his base for meeting the denizens of the Village, a place where artists congregate, and the place purported to be where his mother met his mysterious father.Several suspected “fathers” emerge, all regulars of the Golden Spur, and this is the most interesting part of the novel, for Powell paints each in excruciating detail. There is Hugow, the painter who has women falling over him willy nilly, including young Lize and Darcy, and who is now shacked up in Cape Cod with his art dealer, Cassie Bender. There is Dr. Kellsey, the academic, who remembers Connie as the student who introduced him to the Spur. There is George Terrance, the lawyer, who hides a secret of homosexuality and has a daughter who acts dumb and demure at home but moonlights as a vampish actress named Iris Angel in the Village; Iris strings along lovers such as Hugow and, most recently, Jonathan who could very well be her biological brother. Finally, there is Alvin Harshawe, bestselling-author who has run out of ideas and needs a reboot. Each of these potential fathers, upon discovering Jonathan’s motive for coming to New York, and for selfish reasons of their own, want to be his biological father, and they compete by making elaborate arrangements for including him in their circles, much to the consternations of wives and other partners.Other characters also fill the canvas: Earl Jones, world traveler, starving writer, and foil to Alvin, who provides Jonathan with gossip and fodder for his articles. Claire and Bea Van Orphen, fraternal twins; Claire is a writer in need of re-tooling and Bea is a musician, and they need space from each other to develop their creativity despite the homing call of twins to live together. And finally, there is Percy, Lize’s current boyfriend and protegee of Hugow, who wants to be a great painter like his mentor.Powell visits for long periods with each of the main characters. The plot spins out and becomes convoluted as we get deeper into the novel. POVs, coincidences, and contrivances jump all over the place, and we are grateful that the writing schools hadn’t held sway during Powell’s time and that she was free to tell her story in her own way. And yet, I felt the ending was rushed; Powell seemed like she was running to tie up the loose ends within the word count given to her by her publisher—some characters made half-baked, uncharacteristic exits.When the mystery “father” arrives out of left field—another contrivance—all suspects are absolved, and Jonathan winds up a rich man, free to consort with Iris—phew! A Dickensian ending? No, for like Hugow, he too realizes that he must “want to want” and that the sterile world of art galleries is not for him. He needs to be at the Golden Spur, where the drunk and derelict accrete, and where real art is to be discovered.I have seen recent articles on Dawn Powell surface in the media, perhaps a resurgence is afoot. Her writing provides a great view into a world of artists that has now vanished....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 07, 2023","Nov 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/94988.The_Golden_Spur

Since when has the individual literary work of a writer been penalized for the political misbehaviour of her countrymen? Isn’t that why writer’s write? To expose warts in society? The novel comes in two parts: (a) the brutal rape and murder of a Palestinian girl in Aug 1949 in the Israeli sector of the Negev desert, and (b) the search for her story by a female Palestinian reporter from the West Bank who was born exactly 25 years to the day after the murder. In both parts, the narration is detailed, every action described, even to the step-by-step personal hygiene rituals of the main characters. While this slows the pace, it ramps up the tension, for we know that bad things must lie at the end of this plodding. None of the characters have names.In Part 1, the antagonist is an Israeli army officer sent to guard a border section in the Negev Desert after the declaration of armistice with Egypt. He is a recluse and does not consort with his men, preferring to wander off into the desert at night and keep his own counsel. He is bitten by a spider, and it appears that the infection within is warping his mind, just like the intense desert temperatures are affecting his men. The Israeli's mission, as voiced by the officer is: “It is our duty to prevent them from being here and to expel them for good. After all, Bedouins only uproot, they do not plant things. We, however, will do everything in our power to give these vast stretches the chance to bloom and become habitable, instead of leaving them as they are now, desolate and empty of people.”When his patrol stumbles on Arab nomads, the soldiers kill without mercy, taking a girl prisoner. The officer exerts his authority over his men when it comes to the spoils; and they help themselves to the dregs when he goes wandering about. Finally, they bury the traces of their savagery in the desert.  In Part 2 – we get into the insular world of the Palestinian, restricted to their area of residence as listed in their ID card. For example, Palestinians living in Area A cannot visit Area B, both of which are in the same country. Our protagonist, a Palestinian journalist, has trouble with boundaries because Israeli soldiers are constantly crossing into hers, subjecting her to searches and questioning her at every encounter. Consequently, she only travels from home to work and back, and spends her time writing in her apartment when not working. The story of the murdered girl from 1949 obsesses her and she makes plans to visit the Negev to find out more details. It means crossing boundaries (checkpoints) with forged ID and renting a car with the assistance of a friend who has a credit card. To be discovered after this level of subterfuge would be disastrous. Yet, she persists, and we get a tour of Israel, where the old Palestine is steadily making way for the new Israel, where Palestinian villages and settlements have been erased in favour of highways and security walls, and where Israeli settlements are proliferating. She makes it all the way to the place where the murder took place but cannot find out anything more than what she has extracted from Google. On her return, she spots a Palestinian woman, about 70, probably the age of the dead girl that day, and feels that talking to a local would be more useful than all the museums and heritage centres she could visit. But so doing means crossing another boundary, and there are dire consequences for the vanquished who cross borders.The Israeli soldiers in this book are portrayed as angry, brutal, and disgruntled.  Interesting motifs are used: spiders, chewing gum, the heat, sweat, gasoline, the barren land, check points. – this is not the Promised Land. It's Hell.The moral of the story: Let sleeping dogs lie; when retracing history, history repeats. It also talks to the utter hopelessness and subjugation of the Palestinian people.

I have to disagree, although I will give “John Metcalf has written some of the very best stories ever published in this country,” quotes Alice Munro. I have to disagree, although I will give Metcalf kudos for having the balls to write about topics that we consider too indelicate to discuss in Canada, and certainly not in literature during these self-censoring times of political correctness.Like Philip Roth, the protagonist in these stories appears to be a fictionalized version of the author at various points in his life. Like Roth, this fictionalized protagonist suffers from penile anxiety and envy over others’ more generous endowments, he lusts over women, is frustrated by a puritanical upbringing, and admits to being racist and misogynist. He is an immigrant to Canada who longs for home back in the UK, works in the arts or in education, and is often short of money. Marriages fall by the way and children are a disappointment. He is sexually frustrated and looking for gratification, even if it’s on the side. He writes about loneliness and self-discovery, and many of his stories have inconclusive or less-than-fulfilling endings. In other words, an archetypal post-war boomer who had it all, wanted more, and did not make much of this golden time. In “Single Gents Only,” our young protagonist is pulled away from home and sent to lodgings in preparation to enter university. His eccentric roommate, who spews racist thoughts, collects kiddie porn, and has to be read from The Wind in the Willows in order to go to sleep; roomie warns our hero of the unfamiliar world he has arrived in and must now navigate. “Private Parts,” subtitled as a memoir, is the most distasteful piece – the protagonist is obsessed with his small penis: he gives us a treatise on penile types and masturbation, not unlike Portnoy (perhaps Metcalf was imitating Roth here); he remembers the songs but not the girls from his youth; he hates his mother and is glad when she dies. Two of the most complete stories, craft-wise, are “Gentle as Flowers Make the Stones” and “Girl in Gingham.” In the former, a struggling young poet with a single book to his name, accepts a reading gig with group of older women and ends up in the sack with one of them; the encounter helps him complete the nagging poem in his head. In the second story, our protagonist, now a divorced 35-year-old art evaluator, is working his way down a list of potential female partners gathered for him by a pre-internet dating agency. He strikes gold with the last candidate, only to make a frightful and disappointing discovery. “Girl in Gingham” warns us to beware of undisclosed secrets, of stepping into the unknown. I felt a tinge of empathy for our art dealer in this story, which I didn’t feel in the others. “Polly Ongle” repeats from where “Girl in Gingham” leaves off – another lengthy dinner date scene dominates the story. But this time, our protagonist is a 46-year-old married art dealer who is sexually frustrated because his busy, working wife is always “tired” or “the children are around.” He is trying to make it with his 20-something, rather dull, female employee. The story veers off into a long monologue, presented as a dialogue with himself, in which our protagonist tries to come to terms with the holes in his life – a mean feat for a short story to accomplish. Thank God, he doesn’t have any epiphanies but is left hanging, like we are!Two other stories read like travelogues. The first, “Years in Exile,” is a journey back in memory to childhood and teen years in England, where the passion for art is born out of stealing artefacts from war- abandoned country mansions. The second story, “The Nipples of Venus,” is a trip to Italy in senior years, and which describes the usual touristy things done in Florence and Rome. But I lost the point of “The Nipples…” unless there was a link between the horny lizard and the horny protagonist, which wasn’t that apparent. I had a similar dissonance in imagery when trying to figure out whether the juvenile arsonist in “The Eastmill Reception Centre” was a proxy for the insurgent Metcalf acting out against his predictable, safe, and boring middle-class life? Given that the author was an editor of an established Canadian literary press and an English teacher, I wondered whether he set out to deliberately skewer the writing schools and their “dos and don’ts” of craft that have emerged in recent years, or whether those same schools hastily erected the rules to prevent another John Metcalf from emerging on the Canadian literary landscape. Let’s see: he is comma-averse, engages in passive voice and run-on sentences, flips tenses between sentences, introduces too many characters all at once, adds too many irrelevant sidebars into the short story form synonymous with brevity, and some stories are totally out of balance, especially when he goes off on penis rants or dinner dates.All that said, the likes of John Metcalf are on the road to extinction in Canadian literature, if not there already. His muscular, incisive, take no-prisoners prose is giving way to tepid, politically-correct writing that has not seen a single Canadian writer win any major international fiction prize (Canadian prizes don’t count because someone local has to win anyway), since Munro won the Nobel. We wish him a happy retirement back in England, if that is where he winds up, because from the tone of his stories, he didn’t seem to enjoy life in this colony. ...more",Notes are private!,2,4,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2023","Oct 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2713454-standing-stones

The Japanese administration is well organized, its hierarchies aligned, and they allow their conquered subjects some degree of freedom. The Germans are technologically superior to the Japanese and have sent rockets to distant planets (how they accomplished this by the early 60’s when we could only get to the moon in 1969 is the science fiction part); they have continued their Final Solution even into Africa; their hierarchies and allegiances are confusing, and the top leadership is in conflict between Goebbels (the new Furher) and Heydrich. Goebbels supports a nuclear attack on Japan to claim global domination while Heydrich opposes it.Into this maelstrom we have a set of characters playing out their destinies. Among them are: Frink, the Jewish jewellery maker who captures the American wu in his work; his judo-instructor wife, Juliana, who prefers to drift and live apart from her husband; Joe, her current lover who is not quite Italian as he makes himself out to be; Childen, the artefacts seller who is faced with the classic American dilemma of going mass-market with Frink’s creation, or not; the Katsouras, a young Japanese couple settled in San Francisco who are totally enamoured with all things American, symbolic of the Americanization of Japanese culture. There are the secret agents Tadeki and Baynes alias Wegener, intent on foiling Goebbels’ diabolical plan; and there is the tragic Mr. Tadomi, head of the Japanese Trade Mission that is the de-facto ruler of the Pacific States of America, who much make life-altering choices and decide whether there is wu in American culture. Many of these characters rely on the I Chin, an ancient book on divination, to steer their daily actions.Complicating the plot is the Man in the High Castle, an unknown writer named Hawthorne Abendsen, living in the unregulated central part of America, who has written a book, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, which claims that the Axis powers actually lost WWII to the Allies. It is a secret bestseller that both the Japanese and Germans frown upon. Some are willing to kill Abendsen for it.The convoluted, multi-pronged plot moves in fits and starts with frequent stops for philosophical musing. The Japanese characters think, narrate, and speak in stilted form and I wondered whether PKD was trying to cast them as inscrutable when viewed from a Western sensibility, thus serving only to promote the stereotype. The drug-addled scene between Juliana and Joe, when she finally breaks free to pursue her quest, is equally garbled, and I wondered whether PKD was writing this to show us her mental state at the time or whether his own was jumbled at the time of its writing.When we finally get to meet the Man in the High Castle, he is underwhelming. He is a drunken womanizer, is careless about his cover despite being pursued by assassins, and is evasive in his answers about what led him to write this book. The quintessential writer of the 1960s and a proxy for PKD? Was Grasshopper written by the I Chin, the oracle, and not by a human? Was it a message to humanity about what really happened? Was this an example of parallel universes - PKDs pet theme - of events happening across multiple worlds, all in the present? Was PKD writing this novel under the influence of, and to indicate his fascination with, ancient Chinese divination techniques? The suspenseful plot peters off into these philosophical questions, both by the characters who are left standing on the stage and by the reader turning the last page. Putting the down the book, I noted that PKD was high on mysticism and metaphor but low on character development and dialogue, at least in this book. Perhaps there were too many culturally diverse characters and too many story strands to parse out. I also concluded that this work was the jumping off point for a journeyman sci-fi writer plunging into more serious faire, but one in which he had not quite wrested his subject matter....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Oct 14, 2023","Oct 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle

Novels, the author posits, are about normal people in extraordinary circumstances (leave epics for heroes, and lyrics for saints), and rose in tandem with the rise of the middle classes.The novel faced extinction in three critical years: 1966, 1969 and 1970, when it was pronounced “dead.” Yet, John Fowles came to the rescue in 1966 with his The Magus and again in 1969 with The French Lieutenant’s Woman, infusing metafiction into the novel and breaking the fourth wall. The cavalry was led by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his band of South American Boom writers in the 1970 “death”; his One Hundred Years of Solitude injected new blood in the way of magic realism into the dying form, leading to another revival and further evolution. There are many unusual takes and oblique views on traditional novel craft in this book which I will not dwell on, but the ones that hit new chords for me were:1.	The 18 things you need in the opening lines. I didn’t know there would be so many!2.	Stop believing the narrator when you start seeing the word “I.” They are biased and flawed. E.g.: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Huckelberry Finn, Great Expectations, The Good Soldier et al. 3.	Character Mnemonics and Objective Corelative: the former consists of internal characteristics or physical features that make a character distinctive, i.e., Capt. Ahab’s peg leg; the latter is made up of external objects that distinguish them, i.e., Sherlock Holmes’ periodic cocaine fix.4.	Positioning of words for different emphasis: e.g., Joyce’s positioning of the word “relish” vs. Fitzgerald’s.5.	Faulkner wrote in adjectives while Hemingway wrote in nouns and verbs.6.	Dialogism: the conversation about texts over time allows the reader to interpret and attribute more meaning than the author ever intended.7.	The Law of Fictional Ideation: the philosophy behind the novel is insufficient if the story sucks. It reinforces my belief that a great novel needs the 4 Es: engage, entertain, educate, and enlighten. Most genre fiction gets stuck after the first two, and literary fiction gets hung up on the last two. 8.	Nobel prize-winning authors’ work is shot through with history. Other best-selling but non-Nobel winners stick to narrower frames,9.	English is a complex language. Good readers must invest in the novel they are reading and interrogate its text.10.	Endings: Victorian novel endings were neat and tidy, 20th century novels were incomplete and inconclusive, reflecting our more complex and fragmented world. I’m sure those modernists and post-modernists had something to do with this also.The author concludes by positing that there really is only one story that embraces all of literature – the story of being human. The text is greater than the writer because the latter has had many influences (life experiences, books read, formal and informal education etc.) that have helped shape their text. And books lead to other books....more",Notes are private!,2,9,1,not set,"Oct 06, 2023","Oct 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8068626-understanding-novels

Reprinted here with permission)An unvarnished account of Canada’s shame(This  was originally published in Devour Art & Lit Summer 2023 edition. Reprinted here with permission)An unvarnished account of Canada’s shameful colonial past and its treatment of the Indigenous that, had it been known at the time, would not have qualified “our home on Native Land” for the frequent title of “the best country in the world to live in” by poll after poll, and lured millions of new immigrants, me included, to her shores in the last half a century.Who are the Five Little Indians? Damaged children, plucked from their parents at the age of six and held in a residential school called The Mission in rural British Columbia in the 1960s, and who either escape or are kicked out on their 16th birthday to make their way in the unfamiliar world outside. They are:Kenny: He is always running, either trying to escape the school—at which he succeeds after many recaptures and beatings—or running away from family and loved ones when he is on the outside, for as much as he loves them, he is unable to love himself.Lucy: The girl who loves Kenny, no matter what or how frequent his peregrinations. She is kicked out of the Mission at 16 with a bus pass and twenty-five dollars, and the name of another student in Vancouver as her only toehold into the outside world. Despite this rude re-entry, she graduates from nursing school to build a normal life for herself and daughter Kendra, Kenny’s offspring, hatched during one of his fleeting visits.Howie: Originally from Saskatchewan but kidnapped by police while celebrating his sixth birthday at an aunt’s home in B.C. Howie gives as much as he gets, and once older, beats the abusive “Brother” for his pedophiliac acts, landing in jail as a reward. A life of crime is his legacy, until Clara, the caseworker comes into his life.Clara: The steady but militant one who skirts danger by joining the armed struggles of the Traditionals (those who agitate for Indigenous rights) against the Sellouts (those Indigenous who sellout to the Settler). She helps fellow students released from the Mission, operating on the principal of “Keep Indians out of Jail.”Maisie: So sexually abused by “Father” at the Mission that she has to have a look-alike older man perform similar degrading acts on her when she is on the outside. Her dual life of hotel cleaner by day and sex slave by night consumes her in guilt, leading to the only relief available – drugs, lots of it.There is no grand plot here, just the recounting of how these damaged souls recover their lives over the next 25 years on the outside, plagued by recurring nightmares of life on the inside. Some make it and others don’t. The recounting is naturalistic, amounting to many quotidian events like working, child-raring, housekeeping, even partying. They have developed weaknesses that threaten to derail them: Kenny’s restlessness, Lucy’s naivety, Howie’s hair-trigger, Clara’s avoidance, Maisie’s self-loathing. While the five Indians’ stories are rich in poignancy, the writing is far from rich. I fault the editors who could have done a better job of elevating the text. Echoing pronouns, casual sentences, and scenes out of place in time, pepper the narrative, impeding flow. If this book won so many awards, I assume it was more for the explosive and politically significant nature of its content rather than for the elegance of its presentation.By accepting traditional Indigenous healing offered by the mystic woman, Mariah, as the way out, Clara is able to come through the cycle of hurt. We hope many others caught up in this horrible legacy will follow her example, and that we can put this shameful chapter of Canadian history behind us....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Sep 29, 2023","Sep 29, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52214103-five-little-indians

It also raises the quesA searing portrait of slavery in the American South and the indomitable drive of the human spirit for freedom from oppression. It also raises the question of “could America exist if there is justice, when its foundations are built on theft, murder and cruelty?”Cora is a young slave in a Georgia plantation who is coerced by her fellow captive, Caesar, to escape via the Underground Railroad. Caesar was formerly the slave of a benign owner in Virginia who died, resulting in him being sold further south where conditions are harsher – he knows what freedom smells like, while Cora, a third-generation slave, has never tasted freedom, except to know, and detest, that her mother Mabel escaped leaving her behind, and was never recaptured, a source of irritation to owners, the Randalls, and the feared slave hunter, Ridgeway. When the brutal Randall son, Terrance, takes over the plantation and has his eyes set on Cora, she takes the reluctant step towards freedom.The Underground Railroad is portrayed as an actual railroad, although in reality it is a metaphorical one, relying on networks of sympathizers and anti-abolitionists to ferry “cargo” between “stations,” rather than crumbling railcars in tunnels that go off into the dark as portrayed in this book. But the physical aspect given to the Railroad works to heighten the dramatic effect and helps with the plot.Cora traverses through the states of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Indiana in her odyssey, a proxy Gulliver. Each state has its own rules and conditions for slaves. Georgia treats them to the lash at every whim of the owner, whether while caught reading a book, talking back, dancing, or slacking while picking. And woe be unto the slave who escapes and is caught – they will be tortured in the most heinous manner and executed (slowly) in front of their peers. South Carolina, though less harsh, has a program of sterilization for slaves, fearful of them proliferating and overrunning the master race. North Carolina is a growth market for slave hunting, where fugitive slaves and their white helpers are executed in public and strung up along the Freedom Road. We don’t see much of Tennessee for it is blanketed in the smoke of a large fire that has burned down towns and homesteads as Cora passes through. Indiana has abolished slavery when Cora arrives; she finds work in a blacks-run farm, but the whites are not friendly to these upstart free-blacks who appear to be smarter than them – trouble is brewing under the surface. Ridgeway is Cora’s nemesis, dogging her footsteps, forming a love-hate-respect relationship with her for being one of the few, along with mother Mabel, who exposed the flaw in the American scheme that he profits from, by escaping. As she sits hobbled in chains, he tells her stories, even treats her to meals, and pontificates on the American imperative: “If you can keep it, it’s yours.” Cora is openly scornful of him, and forces him to face the evils of his “scheme,” and seeks any opportunity to escape. Back home, Terrance lapses into decrepitude, awaiting his runaway to return home so he can mete out her just desserts and re-assert dominance over his domain. Given the number of scene-shifts, involving new casts of characters each time, there are constant name dumps that make pegging who-is-who-doing-what difficult. Particularly, in the Georgia and Indiana chapters, there is also a lot of world building going on, therefore expository passages read like a summary on the state of slavery in each locale.The liberated slaves too are in a quandary, getting used to their new-found freedom and wondering whether to go it on their own or to partner with the white man in an integrated, post-slavery society. However, in the 19th century South, these are but pipe dreams, for the almighty vigilante posse will strike and destroy all good intentions, the author seems to say. As for Cora, she is left with two choices – go west or go north, and leave the south to simmer in its fetid juices. ...more",Notes are private!,2,9,1,not set,"Sep 25, 2023","Sep 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

Mac of New York is a drifter with a literary bent, while Charley of Fargo N.D. (he appears only in the final chapter like an afterthought, but is supposed to play a pivotal role in the subsequent books of the trilogy) is a car mechanic and drifter. They travel all over the country, usually down on their luck, grabbing jobs and losing them, drinking, whoring, getting married and divorced, having lovers and losing them (or ditching them), and finally ending up where they have no option but to be: Mac in Mexico trying to join the revolution there but owning a bookshop instead, and Charley in a boat bound for Europe to join the WWI Ambulance corps. Both like to read and pursue an education but are prevented by circumstances beyond their control.The two female characters, Eleanor of Chicago and Janey of Washington D.C., are a bit more circumscribed in their movements given the times and their gender. Eleanor is an arts student who opens an interior decorating business with mixed results. Janey is a stenographer and a romantic. They have typical middle-class lives with middle class preoccupations: where to live, whom to marry, how to stretch a dollar, how to grieve parents who die young and short-circuit their lives. Unlike the male characters, the women seem to complete their trade education, but lead sexless lives, although both are in love (but can’t express it) with J. Ward Moorehouse.The unifying character is J. Ward Moorehouse of Wilmington, Delaware. His college education too is interrupted, and he becomes a real estate salesman, although his training and aptitude is for journalism and song writing. He is also ambitious and will not let a dead-end first marriage or a cheating wife derail him. A series of propitious events leads him to open a public relations firm with the help of his second wife’s family wealth. This marriage too is a failure, but Wade prevails to become an arbiter between business and labour, having powerful clients like bankers Morgan and Rockefeller, and interceding between the Mexican government and American capitalists doing business south of the Rio Grande during the Mexican Revolution. By a circuitous route, Janey becomes his secretary, while Eleanor becomes his decorator and platonic friend.All roads lead to Mexico or to WWI, and the book has a strong leftist flavour, a hallmark of Dos Passos. The Mexican Revolution attracts leftists, and the WWI is considered a conflict aimed at protecting big banker loans. Getting the proletariat involved in a military conflict to prevent them from protesting at home is the underlying message. This is also a book where the bulk of the novel lies in the back stories of the principal characters, and not so much when they intersect to move forward. Dos Passos peppers the narrative with his own illustrations of scenes or characters, providing us a visual of this time, i.e., the first two decades of the 20th century. The five characters open a window on middle-class America of the time, but as a novel, The 42nd Parallel is fragmented and episodic, for we jump back and forth for long stretches into each character, and conflict is sacrificed for quaintness. And the construct with the Newsreels and Camera Eye did not work for me, unless they were devices to show the evolution of the American backdrop on which the central characters play, and were Dos Passos’s contribution of innovative tools to the modernist movement of literature that was trying to stretch the novel in new directions at the time.A good primer for Americanophiles and leftists. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2023","Sep 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7101.The_42nd_Parallel

It’s as if the author of this book, Noah Lukeman, is either a poor writer himself (which I doubt), or because he wants to exaggerate the bad examples until they scream at us. In truth, no one who writes like what is written in those examples need call themselves a writer or even attempt this art form. Reading the examples alone can be a bit of a hoot. What is scary is that with unfiltered self-publishing, these types of bad writing may already be around in published form. That said, as with all books on craft, one picks up a few gems and dusts off a few forgotten elements. The ones that stuck out for me were:1.	Pay attention to the “sound” of words.2.	Two years – the average life span for someone in publishing.3.	Aim for complexity of thought, not complexity of expression.4.	A book bereft of comparisons (analogy, simile, or metaphor) may connect intellectually but not emotionally.5.	A story can spin out of the types of characters you create.6.	A hook that does not follow up with the same intensity through the rest of the book is a let down. Dialogue as an opening hook does not work.7.	Tone is intentionality.8.	For pacing, you need to keep several hundreds of pages in your mind so that you don’t miss the inconsistencies.Lukeman falls into the trap of the jaded editor. He keeps repeatedly stating that overwhelmed editors “read to discard” at the slightest error. Why don’t editors “read to discover” instead? As a publisher of a small press myself, I spend a lot of time mining the slush pile for the hidden gem.Perhaps, Lukeman redeems himself in the closing lines of the book when he says “Write not for publication, but be devoted to the craft of writing for its own sake.” In this age of shrinking Big 5 publishing windows, but ever widening self-publishing choices, there can be no other option....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Sep 08, 2023","Sep 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/263254.The_First_Five_Pages

His heroes were George Orwell, Susan Sontag, Leon Trotsky, and Karl Marx. Pivotal events like the Gulf War, the invasion of Iraq, 9/11, the Balkan wars, and the kafuffle over The Satanic Verses gave him grist for his writing and public speaking mills that lasted for many essays, chapters, debates, and episodes.His attraction to the United States of America which began as a child, blossomed as a student when he visited but could not get permanent residence, and was consummated when he got his green card in 1981. With all other political systems collapsing around him, including the fading glory of the British Empire, he claims that America is the last bastion of freedom for the individual, warts and all – he loves the country and its people but challenges its political bureaucracy and systemic imperfections.What irritated this reader were the digressions upon digression in his writing. That his is a fertile and hyperactive mind and a storehouse of information is very clear, despite his frequent imbibing of copious extracts of the “grape and the grain” as he calls it. As an essayist, I would like to have seen coherent arguments put forth with just enough support material, not streams of thought that rushed off in multiple directions, pausing occasionally to make a point before taking off again. However, the avalanche of trivia that peppers the narrative also sustained me during the rambling. Here are a few I picked up:1.	Martin Amis was a fussy and affected grammarian who tore Hitch’s prose apart (I have to agree, I would have liked to do the same).2.	Juan Peron had Jorge Luis Borges fired from the National Library in Argentina.3.	The Brits have irony, the Americans have not. American women ask for what they want, British women do not.4.	Thomas Jefferson fought to protect the small pox vaccine from anti-vaxxers in his time.5.	Nabokov hated music, a rare dislike among writers.That his job and gab kept him well connected is not in question. He knew everyone, from presidents to dictators, from saints to sinners, from movie stars to Nobel prize-winning authors, and they all welcomed him to display his intellect at their soirees in exchange for food and drink, and sometimes financial compensation.The final chapter dubbed “Decline, Mutation or Metamorphosis?” was the hardest to digest because, just as the title suggests, I did not know where it was going. A brilliant display of intellectual heft, a man after an all-night bender, or chemo addling the mind? It had the rambling of the previous chapters taken to its zenith. All I could extract from it was the essence of what this book was trying to say all along: that the duty of the intellectual is to argue for complexity and not to sloganize or formularize the world of ideas.A complex man indeed, as contrarian in his life as in his writing....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 03, 2023","Sep 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7332753-hitch-22

Rushdie gets away with the caveat by admitting that he was writing this book for his younger son, just like he had written Haroun and the Sea of Stories for his older boy.Luka, younger brother of Haroun by 18 years, sees his father Rashid the storyteller slump into a sleep that is threatening to kill him. The boy is visited by a transparent ghost of his father, called Mr. Nobodaddy, and told that he must retrieve the Fire of Life from the World of Magic (his father’s creation from where he draws his stories) in order to restore Rashid’s health. If not, Nobodaddy will suck out his father’s life, gain full opacity, and disintegrate into nothing.So begins Luka’s adventure that resembles the levels of a video game - eight to reach his goal and one to return to the real world. He gains a boat called the Argo, and allies Bear the Dog and Dog the Bear, the Elephant Duck and Drake, Insultana Soraya and her magic carpet, shape-changing dragons, and a host of others. He needs to wade through the River of Time, the Lake of Wisdom, the Mists of Memory, the Mountain of Knowledge, the Great Stagnation, the Inescapable Whirlpool, and other terrain in the World of Magic, facing a myriad of life-threatening obstacles before reaching his goal. Arraigned against him are a host of enemies: the Badly Behaving Gods (drawn from every mythology on the planet); Captain Aag, the evil circus master; the Rats; various demons; and the dreaded Aalim, custodians of time and of the Fire of Life. Just like in game theory, Luka is given a finite number of lives which he can lose in order to get to the next level, and he has to save each level before moving up.I will not deal with the various adventures, for they are too numerous to explain and would amount to spoilers. Suffice to say that when things are grim, Rushdie introduces a rather simplistic solution or a new character who helps Luka prevail – contrivances in adult literature, but sources of cheer for mid-grade kids who see their hero survive another near-mishap.It’s a thrill-a-minute ride until the final twist in the tale. Luka comes across as a mature 12-year- old, and this struck an off-chord with me. After the final battle, where everything is thrown at Luka and his band, and which gets cleared away through clever thinking on their feet, the story ends as predicted and everyone lives happily ever after, as is to be expected from a novel of this nature. No irony, no sarcasm, but plenty of clever wordplay.Apart from writing this story for his children, I wondered why Rushdie decided to publish it for the wider world. Was it because he couldn’t gather new material from the adult world during his fatwa-induced incarceration? Was he trying to escape the horrible real world and hide within the World of Magic, which was safer and predictable? Was he experimenting with children’s literature because adult literature was a dangerous place for him? Was he displaying his virtuosity in another genre? Was he just having fun? All of the above, I think.

What better memeI purchased this copy at the Shakespeare and Company bookshop that I finally visited in Paris after many failed attempts in the past. What better memento of this visit than a copy of the personal and business letters of its founder, I thought.The letters are one-way – i.e., from Beach to the many people she corresponded with – and include, in addition to family and friends, such notables as James Joyce (whom she always addressed as Mr. Joyce), Ernest Hemingway (whom she always called “Hemingway”), Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Richard Wright, and Scott Fitzgerald. An intimate portrait emerges of a woman dedicated to the avant garde in literature—especially the modernist movement of the time—one who waged a relentless war against plagiarism, and who paid the price of staying on to run her bookshop in Paris when France fell to the Nazis.The earlier letters deal with her youth and rather privileged life as an American in Europe before the wars, where the cost of living was considerably cheaper than back home. Imagine having President Woodrow Wilson as a family friend! Life was an eternal round of holidays, horse riding, and soirees between Italy and France. When WWI breaks out, Beach volunteers in the ambulance field service and picks grapes in the countryside, then serves in Serbia with the Red Cross.After the war, and after discarding New York and London as possible locations, she decides to open an American-British book shop cum library, on the advice of her friend, mentor, and lover, Adrienne Monnier, herself the custodian of the first French lending library in France. Shakespeare and Company soon becomes the watering hole for all exiled literary personalities of the age who were still to gain immortality. The library side of the house does better than the bookshop. Beach pegs her hat on James Joyce and publishes Ulysses, a book banned in the English-speaking world for obscenity. This is her maiden foray into publishing that she knows nothing about. She soon becomes not only Joyce’s agent and publicist, but his medical co-ordinator and real-estate agent, shepherding the nearly blind and bankrupt author from one crisis to another, while going on to reprint 11 editions of his masterpiece over the same number of years. Joyce leaves her rather coldly when bigger fish like Knopf come calling, but she retains a trove of Joyce publishing memorabilia and copyrights that she tries to trade on in later years to exhibitions and universities. In all, Beach published just three books, all by or about Joyce, before the “fall”: i.e., the war intervened, the Americans returned home, her library collection was ferreted away to safety, Beach herself was interned, and the bookshop was shuttered. She never re-opened for business, although the present owner of the store, now located at Rue de la Bucherie and not at Rue de l’Odéan, opened his own bookshop in 1951 and was gifted the celebrated name, Shakespeare and Company, by Beach.In her later years, she continued to live above her old bookshop, was a rainmaker for the literati in Europe, dabbled in translations, and wrote her memoir which was finally published in 1956. The letters, especially in the later years are so widely spaced apart in time, that they are sketchy about a few key events: the deaths of Joyce and Hemingway, her internment by the Germans, the split between Beach and sister Cyprian, and the events leading to the closure of her shop. She does lament when Paris was devoid of sugar, milk, meat, and coal during the occupation. And she was convinced that apart from Collette and Monnier, French women writers were useless. The letters paint the picture of a hyperactive woman, full of optimism (war and dying only happened to other people), determined to have her way, whether that be by flattery, threat, or persistence. She was not afraid to ask for financial assistance from friends, family, or patrons, and the help always came. Running a shop and a publishing house during the Depression and between the wars, when technology was archaic, was a challenge, and she was subject to crippling migraines from overwork that laid her low for long periods.Although she didn’t know it at the time, but perhaps had an inkling of it during her sunset years, she was in the epicentre of a literary movement and subculture that still reverberates a century later. Her life as an independent bookseller and publisher stands as a beacon for those of us who toil in her footsteps with a plethora of automated tools that Sylvia would have salivated to get her hands on....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Aug 11, 2023","Aug 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7203231-the-letters-of-sylvia-beach

How did two little-known German philosophers hatch a political ideology that took root, not in their home country but abroad, and led to the rise and fall of the Soviet Union?Marx & Engels trace the fall of the aristocracy and feudalism to the rise of the bourgeoisie in the late 18th century; the discovery of the Americas and the development of international trade were catalysts in this transfer of power, they posit. The authors advocate that the bourgeoisie and their lesser cousin, the petty bourgeoisie (small merchants and farm owners who stand perilously between bourgeoisie and proletariat and who could be cast into one or the other camp by the changing of fortunes) are an evil class which exploits the proletariat (working class). In a world consisting of the exploiting and the exploited, each class battles for supremacy over the other. The authors make the case for the proletariat – that it is now their turn to rise and subdue the bourgeoisie, and this being a manifesto, there is no counterargument entertained.Bourgeoisie is defined as the class that owns property and the means of production, and the proletariat is the working-class majority who have none of the above and who trade skills and labour in exchange for a subsistence existence. In a rule by the proletariat (Communism), private property will be taken over by the State. But who is the State and how it will be organized is not clarified in this manifesto. If you look at the unravelling of the USSR that mainly happened due to state control of production and property and the stifling of individual enterprise, one wonders whether our two philosophers were smoking dope. The moribund bureaucracy spawned in the USSR, the lack of accountability to none but one’s political master, and the gross inefficiency of the system led to a complete collapse and ushered in the oligarchy, where nationalized resources went back to an even smaller number of powerful and privileged individuals than would have existed under a bourgeoisie class system.The authors go onto differentiate between the many offshoots of Socialism and Communism. There is Petty Bourgeoise Socialism, True Socialism (Germany), Bourgeoise Socialism, and other derivatives. In order to advance their cause, Communists are known to make “deals” with these alternate idealogues although their principles remain unchanged. This is therefore a good primer for North Americans who have difficulty articulating the difference between Socialism and Communism. In a nutshell, according to Marx/Engel, Socialism, in whatever form, still believes in tinkering with the bourgeoisie system while Communists believe in totally eliminating it.The system of Bourgeoisie Capitalism still flourishes in the West, even though we like to label it with less harsh labels like Democratic Socialism, Liberal Democracy, Parliamentary Democracy, Market Economy and so on. The bottom line is that the means of production and private property are not in the control of all citizens but of only a smaller subset, and both Bourgeoisie and Proletariat require each other in a symbiotic relationship – the former to provide the jobs, the latter to work them, each playing to their strengths. When the proletariat stepped into the role of the bourgeoisie, as witnessed in the USSR, things fell apart. Of course, one could point out that China has probably cracked the code on making Communism work when you look at their phenomenal growth in the last 25 years. But if you look at the structural impacts that draconian edicts like “zero-Covid” and “One Family – One Child” have had on that country’s economy, policies that would be impossible to implement in non-Communist countries, one wonders whether the bourgeoisie must be having the last laugh.This book is a good introduction to how we arrived at this pass in the 21st century, Communists and non-Communists alike. And for those who don’t read history, of how we could possibly repeat the foibles of the last century if we don’t learn from its lessons....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 06, 2023","Aug 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30474.The_Communist_Manifesto

The only steadfast man, Selden, the lawyer, is a great shoulder to lean on, but she cannot marry him because he is poor and not up to her social standard. Her only true girlfriend is Gerty, also poor, and a promoter of charitable causes. Lily is secretly frightened of these “principled” friends, because they hold the mirror to her, shaming her.Her society friends are women like Mrs. Trenor who lives for parties when the “season” begins in September and runs through to the following summer, and who judges people on how well their parties turned out; or Bertha Dorset who invites Lily on a Mediterranean cruise so that she can keep husband George busy while Bertha cavorts with a young poet. Lily’s reward for the support of these women: Mrs. Trenor’s husband Gus tries to seduce her causing a scandal, and Bertha cuts her dead in Monte Carlo after accusing her of adultery with George, another scandal that loses Lily most of her rich friends. And yet, Lily cannot shake off this dream of wealth and status among her set, and allies herself with other social groupings like the Gormers, and Norma Hatch who has newly arrived in town and is looking for connections to sprinkle her wealth upon. These moves only bring diminishing returns, and by the time she is 31, Lily is living in a bedsit, in debt, unemployed, and realizing that she was brought up to be ornamental, not a bread-winner.Amidst the parade of parties, the potential suitors, and the inevitable disappointments, Lily stumbles upon a caché of love letters that could compromise not only her enemies but her friends as well. She is faced with the dilemma of using the material to her advantage, no matter what the fallout, and re-establishing her position in society, and possibly grabbing a rich husband who wants her free of scandal, or taking the high road and passing on the opportunity, and “living the rest of her life in shallows.” This seesaw of conscience dogs her slowing steps, like Selden does, and leads to the tragic climax of the novel. For a book of over 450 pages, I found the story line rather thin. Most of the writing is taken up with elaborate descriptions and with the omniscient narrator visiting with each character and doing mental gymnastics in their heads. Every move on a character’s part has to be calculated for its impact on the social set they belong to, or aspire to. Despite their wealth, these are fragile people with elevated senses: “the light pierced the crannies of her soul.” Metaphors and similes abound in the dense prose: a disrobed Lily in the poky room she is ultimately consigned to is described as “slumped with finery laid out as unappetizing as the remains of a feast.”The age-old moral of that old Beatles’ song applies: money can’t buy you love. Except that Wharton, in her time, embellished the message with a whole lotta more words. I was left wondering, “Where was the Mirth? There was only Misery.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 29, 2023","Jul 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17728.The_House_of_Mirth

Told through the woven threads of a report by a psychiatrist in an asylum, Dr.Gren, and a memoir by his 100-year-old patient, Roseanne, a tale of gross injustice and redemption emerges.Roseanne is a Presbyterian living in County Sligo, Ireland and is caught up in the Irish independence movement of the early 20th century, and the two world wars, before being committed to an asylum where she spends the rest of 60-plus years, a majority of that in the care of Dr. Gren, himself recently widowed and nearing retirement. She suffers from faulty memory in the recounting of her early life lived outside the asylum, and has selective memory in other places, so she is the classic unreliable narrator. Dr. Gren too suffers from selective and unreliable memory – did he actually make love with abandon to his wife, Bet, on the eve of her death? He, however, has more resources at hand, and is relying on sketchy official records to write up an assessment of Roseanne, because the asylum is to be demolished shortly and its residents re-located, and the question to be solved by the authorities is what do you do with a 100-year old woman?Both doctor and patient suffer from guilt, for acts committed or neglected. Dr. Gren believes his marriage failed and that Bet retreated into herself, a loveless cave in which she ultimately perished. Roseanne believes she loved too much and gave herself freely to the men who took from her and later abandoned her to the machinations of the evil Fr. Gaunt, the Catholic priest who saw sex as the dirtiest sin. Talking and accompanying a man up a mountain while married to another was considered nymphomania in Fr. Gaunt’s book, an act liable to having one’s marriage annulled and being banished from society.Despite the staunch Catholic moorings of her in-laws, forgiveness is alien to them, and Roseanne is turned away in her hour of need, a rejection jarring enough to make her commit irrational acts with damning consequences. A child is born and disappears in Roseanne’s life, and she combs memory through writing her memoir to find out what happened. Dr. Gren approaches it by going on the hunt through old records in asylums and orphanages to find the truth. The discovery he makes is startling, and I thought a trifle melodramatic, for a story so rooted in such dense humanity. As Roseanne says, “Humanity in general is cruel and cold. We measure the importance of our days by the angels we spy among us.” I guess, the lost child is one of those angels, as is the simpleton Joe Kane who keeps an eye out for Roseanne while she deteriorates in the asylum.A sidebar we get from the novel is a view of the shifting and unsettling politics of the time. We learn about Treaty People and Free-Staters and Irregulars (later known as the IRA). We hear about the deviousness of Eamon de Valera, long standing President and architect of Irish Independence, all told through the faulty memory of Roseanne who suffers directly from the shifting political allegiances of the time. I guess the format used – that of weaving an official report by a doctor with a rambling memoir by a centenarian – make for lot of unnecessary prose. I felt the novel could have been edited to tighten the narrative and amplify its dramatic impact. Or else, we have to put this overwritten novel down to an example of Irish prose, where the beauty and musicality of the language must co-exist amidst the human misery being plumbed, a combination that has led to some great literature coming out of that country....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2023","Jul 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3419808-the-secret-scripture

Despite his youth, Hiero’s reputation is hot. When the Nazis outlaw jazz and substitute it with a sanitized version of the art form (played to sheet music!), the Swingers go underground. When they get into a brawl outside a bath house in 1939 and beat up a couple of Nazi bullies, the hunt intensifies, and they escape to Paris where the war has yet to arrive. Unfortunately, only half their number get out, helped by an American-Canadian black woman named Delilah, the amanuensis of another expatriate black jazz musician holed up in France, Louis Armstrong.The survivors—ironically, only the blacks among the Swingers—team up with Armstrong and are about to cut a disc with him when the Germans invade Paris. Armstrong evacuates. The band stay on to complete various cuts of the disc they had planned, driven by Hiero and his perfectionism. They hide their work-in-progress recordings. When Hiero and bassist Sid (one of the other two black musicians and the narrator of this tale) go out for milk, our prodigy is arrested by the Gestapo and is never seen again. Sid and the third surviving black member, drummer Chip, return to the USA and separate with the guilt of Hiero’s arrest hanging over them: Chip believing that Sid betrayed the young man out of jealousy, and Sid hiding the real reason why Hiero ended up getting arrested.The story fast forwards 52 years, the hidden recordings have been found through a series of propitious accidents and are deemed masterpieces of music by scholars. Hiero is a folk hero in Europe and there is a festival being mounted for him in Berlin along with a documentary film of his life. Sid and Chip are invited to attend. The visit brings out buried questions, secrets, accusations, and emotions in the two men: was Delilah in love with Hiero while sleeping with Sid, was Hiero betrayed to the Nazis, why was Sid cut from the recording by Armstrong, and most importantly, what happened to Hiero? Then word comes that Hiero is indeed alive and in Poland. His two surviving colleagues set out for a fateful meeting and reconciliation with him.The atmosphere is claustrophobic, for most of the action takes place while the group is in hiding. Cabin fever runs through the members as they engage in purposeless banter, drink a lot, fight among themselves, and are suppressed from practicing their art.

The house itself is a left-over from the VanHoebeek family whose members have all died in the two world wars, and through illness, leaving no heirs. Elna hates the opulence and complexity of the house and escapes to India to help the destitute when Maeve is 10 and Danny 3, leaving them in the care of the dedicated household staff and the remote father. This sets off the chain of dependency between Danny and Maeve, and their locked memories in the house. Maeve pines for her mother and gets permanently ill over the abandonment, while Danny hates the woman who ditched them.Things get worse when Cyril marries Andrea, an acquisitive and conniving widow with two young children of her own, and they move into the Dutch House. Then Cyril inconveniently dies while on the job and lets the stepmother duke it out with the stepchildren over the inheritance, which we know who will acquire.Without going into each bend and bump in the story line, suffice to say that the lives of the family and the domestic staff are traced over 40 years, narrated in Danny’s first-person voice, sometimes moving swiftly through time, sometimes pausing around pivotal events. The central characters are Danny, his sister, and the Dutch House. Despite setbacks in health and the loss of their inheritance and parents, the siblings cobble together a life for themselves. Danny even follows in his father’s footsteps by becoming a prominent property developer and giving up a career as a promising doctor. The siblings are constantly drawn back to the Dutch House over the years, where they park outside the building and reminisce on each visit, never going inside to visit the evil stepmother who is slowly paying for her cruelty.When Elna makes a late reappearance in the story, lives are thrown into turmoil again, and Danny is reminded of his father’s words “Elna will be the cause of Maeve’s illness and death.” To her credit, Elna is viewed as a saint by the aging housekeeper, Sandy, who had the most interaction with her when the children were young. But Elna plays true to form, or true to her calling, and dumps those who love her once more to attend to the care of those who do not – with tragic consequences. Sandy’s response: “Saints are universally despised by their families.”There is no dramatic ending here, just a bunch of peaks and valleys and a soft landing. We are essentially following a dysfunctional middle-class American family through their ups and downs. The author implies, subtly, that childhood loss is a traumatic crucible that leaves permanent scars. I think we know that. The Dutch House seems to be the only permanent structure that is kept in a state of good repair by Cyril Conroy and his descendants, as they wax and wane around it through their personal triumphs and tragedies....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44318414-the-dutch-house

In the process, we discover an eveMuriel Spark wrote this memoir to set the record straight and squash the gossip circulating about her private life. In the process, we discover an even more enigmatic figure who kept the really private parts out.Written from her childhood to about the time of the publication of her first novel, The Comforters, and with later-in-life reflections on that formative period, the rather boring title of Curriculum Vitae would have been better renamed Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman.The sketches of childhood come in flashes of memory, and social habits of 1920s Scotland are quaint: lunch was dinner; High Tea was after 6:30 p.m. and resembled a full English breakfast; Regular Tea was at 5 p.m.; furriers priced in guineas because it had an extra shilling than a pound and was considered posh; her mother was superstitious and wouldn’t wear green. Growing up in another far-flung colony of the British Empire myself, I remember these customs were still prevalent in the 1950s. The generation of spinsters or widows growing up between the two world wars is finely drawn, culminating in the manifestation of her most memorable character, Miss Jean Brodie, modeled on school teacher Christina Kay who lost the love of her life in WWI.Spark’s early marriage to an older man she knew little about, and heading off to Southern Rhodesia to live with him at the age of nineteen (and still a minor) was considered ballsy. So was her decision to leave him—after he succumbed to a concealed mental illness and was consigned to an asylum—and leave their five-year-old son in a convent to brave the long journey back to England through torpedo-riddled waters during WWII. A copy of an Ivy Compton Burnett book in her hands while job interviewing landed her employment with MI6 and the company of stars in the department such as Ian Fleming. Her war-time exploits are well drawn. Who says that fake news was invented by social media? Goebbels of the Nazis and Spark’s own MI6 team were well into the misinformation industry to turn the war in each’s favour.That most of her work was autobiographical is clear – this was one of two questions she was trying to address in this book. The Comforters was based on her stay at a Carmelite convent while recovering from an accidental drug overdose, A Far Cry from Kensington is based on her work for many years as a publisher’s editor in post-war London, and Loitering with Intent was based on her fractious two years spent in 1947-49 as Secretary and Publisher of the Poetry Society, an organization she describes as “faction-ridden and fissiparous.” And of course, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is based on her teen years in school in Edinburgh with this Svengali-like mentor.Her work in the publishing world following the war, mostly in independent small presses, kept her connected with the literati and with men anxious to hit on this now-divorced, attractive, and talented woman. Spark admits that she liked men, and that was a problem to everyone else. She takes a few strips off some of her “admirers” and even of long-time literary collaborator, Derek Stanford, who wrote a biography on her with many inaccuracies, who was jealous of her success, and consequently suffered a nervous breakdown. Her early writing life was spent mostly on poetry, for she saw the trajectory of the writer as: lyric poetry --narrative verse -- short story -- novel. It was her winning the Observer newspaper’s short story contest from among 6700 entries that saw her career take off. Soon, there were offers for commissioned work, including offers from the New Yorker and MacMillan. Yet this success does not hide the early post-war years when she struggled in shabby boarding houses and starved as an underpaid publishing employee and unknown writer – also chronicled in the novel The Ballad of Pekham Rye.The other question that Muriel Spark was trying to explain in this book was why she became a Catholic, and I’m not sure she gave us a detailed answer to this very personal question, except to say that she believed this branch of Christianity corresponded to everything she had known and believed, and that the incremental steps that lead to such a conversion do not happen “between the soup and the fish at a dinner party.” An autobiography written with a lot of back-up material to cover her ass, as they say, but holding off on the really personal bits, making us want to hunt through her novels, autobiographical as they are, to find clues to the life and leanings of this enigmatic writer....more",Notes are private!,2,13,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2023","Jun 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/514626.Curriculum_Vitae

This is a trend, as humans have been “lifted.” – i.e., taken out of mass schooling and home schooled by tutors who appear on their “oblongs” – i.e., smartphones. To offset this isolation, the children have regular interaction meetings—group parties—that they are totally unsuited for and in which their nasty instincts surface.Klara is our narrator, an unreliable one, for her worldview is limited to her factory settings and the shop window from where she waits for her first customer, looking upon the world through box-like frames that change in shape depending on how energized she is. Her energy source, and her God, is the Sun.Klara’s purchaser is a 14-year-old girl, Josie, a rather sickly person, displaying varying moods from petulance to compassion. Josie lives with her single-mom, a lawyer (in fact, all the mothers appear to be single, having divorced or lost their husbands in mid-life). Her older sister Sal died of an illness, and now Mother (as Klara calls her) is scared of losing the fragile Josie and is hatching a plot to keep her daughter immortal and ease her own loneliness. Everyone in this book is lonely, despite the advances in technology, and many of them are bitter and edgy with how their lives have panned out. The only one who appears to be balanced and compassionate (like Klara) is the “unlifted” Rick, Josie’s boyfriend who seems to be destined for the sidelines due to his stubbornness to be lifted and his consequent lack of connections, despite his remarkable aptitude in drone technology. Rick looks after his sick mother Helen, who also has secret plans for her son’s success despite his marginalization.For herself, Klara believes the Sun could help Josie recover her health, but believes, like in ancient times, that an offering must be made to procure this assistance, the equivalent of a blood sacrifice. Of course, without giving away the plot, the “offering” is what moves the plot from Nobel-worthy to juvenile for me. And just as Klara gives, Helen and Mother too must give, face their past transgressions, and atone for them in order to gain concessions to move forward. Klara witnesses these humans wrestling with their conflicted lives; she cannot absorb this complexity of emotions and provides only bland goodness to everyone around.Of course, the ending is predictable for this rather slow-paced novel: the human’s recover from their dilemmas and move on. But for Klara, when her usefulness is over, only the scrapheap awaits. She also becomes more of an unreliable witness as her energy is sapped, and Ishiguro captures this decline very well. However, as with all unreliable narrators, a lot of the action takes place off-stage, and the reader has to infer what has really gone on. As the outsider looking into this human dramedy, Klara is the perfect witness, but her naivety also throws a sanitized YA sheen over the novel.What disappoints is the dialogue – it is so stilted and artificial. Even the humans speak like robots in perfectly modulated paragraphs, as if they are trying to give the reader information—something amateur writers do—but in someone of Ishiguro’s caliber, this comes across as an experiment gone wrong.From her experience with Josie, Klara emerges with one nugget that the AI scientists should pay heed to, and that is, while everything human could ultimately be replicable in machines, the reactions of humans (love, sympathy, even anger) towards the cyborg, as compared to those between humans, may be different, and those reactions are not replicable. The human heart is indeed complex, and that is what makes each of us unique....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jun 16, 2023","Jun 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54120408-klara-and-the-sun

Is her ultimate demise, betrayed by one of her prize students, a metaphor to the fact that Fascism never caught on in England of the 1930’s and was vanquished in the Second World War that followed?Miss Brodie is an unforgettable character, 43 years old in 1931 when the story begins. She is the class teacher for a group of female students for two consecutive years when the girls are 10 and 11 years-old; from among them she picks her “set” of six girls with unique traits who will become her loyal acolytes long after they graduate and move into adulthood. The set comprises: Monica known for mathematics, Rose for sex, Eunice for gymnastics, Sandy for her small eyes, Jenny for her beauty, and Mary for being a silent lump and the dullest of the bunch. And they all wear their hats differently, signifying their individuality.Miss Brodie’s teaching style is unorthodox, preferring arts to science, real-life experiences to numbers and text books, individuality to team spirit. She is unreserved in calling Mary “stupid” when warranted. Her heroes are Mussolini, Franco, and Hitler whom she believes will make the world a better place. She even encourages a new student to join the Spanish Civil War, only to wind up dead in an accident in Spain. Miss Brodie entertains her “set” to tea parties at her home, to museum and theatre excursions, to long walks about the city of Edinburgh, and she tells them stories from life, including her personal tales of unrequited love that get embellished as the years go by. The head teacher, Mrs. Mackay and the rest of the staff are looking for ways to get rid of Miss Brodie or force her into retirement, while Miss Brodie resists, for she is determined to be “the leaven in the lump.”Things hot up when Miss Brodie begins parallel love affairs with her fellow teachers: Mr. Lloyd the married art teacher, and Mr. Lowther the unmarried music teacher. Lloyd is her unattainable love while Lowther is her substitute for sex. Everyone suspects this triangle but no one can prove it. Lloyd paints members of the set during individual and collective sittings but the face on each portrait is always that of Miss Brodie, which leads to great satisfaction on the part of our eponymous class teacher who thereby has Lloyd in a “sex by proxy” relationship. Some of the sitters end up becoming Mr. Lloyds lovers too, and we suspect that jealousy on the part of one of them for being relegated to a surrogate was the cause of Ms. Brodie’s ultimate downfall.Like Jesus being betrayed by Judas, Miss Brodie is ultimately double-crossed by one of her set, not for her sexual shenanigans but for her Fascism, and she is forced into retirement in 1938, while still in her prime. Miss Brodie ostensibly never found out who betrayed her. However, the rather bossy omniscient narrator is wont to drop spoilers, and by the midway point of this rather short novel we know whodunit, just as we know how each of the members of the set made out in later life.The narrative is loaded with innuendo. When Miss Mackay is trying to find out from the girls whether Miss Brodie is having an affair with the music teacher, she keeps insisting to them, “But she (Miss Brodie) likes music, doesn’t she?” When Lloyd wants to insinuate that Miss Brodie is spending more time with Lowther, he says, “Cramond has a lot of charm” (Cramond being Lowther’s hometown where Miss Brodie spends her weekends and some overnights). When Miss Brodie, in retirement, laments that she never knew her betrayer, she confronts that very person, and conjectures loudly of everyone in the set possibly being the guilty party, except for the traitor herself. In later years, when Sandy becomes a nun, she always meets her old friends behind a set of bars, signifying perhaps that she is in some kind of a prison for past sins.  When each member of the set is asked in their mid-life years what their most formative experience was, they unhesitatingly say, “Why, Miss Jean Brodie, of course, in her prime.”A uniquely written novel, funny at times, but with an undercurrent of menace....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jun 07, 2023","Jun 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/517188.The_Prime_of_Miss_Jean_Brodie

India, as she is named by the American side of her family, or Kashmira by her birth mother, is a headstrong young woman who watches porn in hotels, cannot love the men who are crazy for her, fights to let off steam, and is an expert marksperson with a crossbow.Mother Boonyi, is the dancer, the woman who enthralls the powerful American ambassador, until he installs her as his mistress in Delhi. Of course, mistresses meet sorry ends, especially when they get pregnant, and Boonyi is soon a housebound, discard eating her way into obesity. Her return to the family fold is only possible as a hermit living in the mountain refuge of former teacher Nazareboddoor, the farting magician.Father Maximillian Orphuls, war vet, brilliant economist, forger, flyer, lover, spy and disgraced ambassador for his sexual transgression with a local woman, is the one love of his daughter Kashmira (or India), until he is brutally murdered when he visits her apartment.Shalimar is the cuckolded husband of Boonyi, belonging to a family of entertainers and cooks, in the Kashmiri village of Pachigam, who has to bear the shame of his wife’s dalliance with the American ambassador, a shame he nurses for decades as he turns into a terrorist fighting to free Kashmir, a shame that turns to hatred and revenge until he is able to murder those who shamed him.There are many other secondary characters that dot this multi-layered novel, but the one that merits mentioning is the state of Kashmir itself. A beautiful valley up in the mountains straddling India and Pakistan, where people once lived in harmony without concern for religion or creed, is torn asunder following Partition in 1947, when both rump countries of the former British Raj fought for control of it. A local “Keep Kashmir for Kashmiris” campaign tries to boot these two interlopers out, which only helps split the revolutionaries into either pro-Muslim or pro-Hindu factions. Even the Indian army that controls most of the valley has to manipulate these two opponents to maintain control. The result is the destruction of a peaceful way of life. Pachigam and Shirmal, the villages where most of the action in the Kashmiri segment of the novel takes place, are decimated. Of course parsing through Rusdie’s verbose style, tongue-in-cheek humour that neutralizes the horror, penchant for movie culture references, tendency to ramble off into yet another side story, one gets nuggets of vivid imagery: “Gorbachev walking around without a country after the Soviet Union collapsed,” “Mandela walking to freedom,” “Los Angeles – the city is a cliff, and at the foot is the valley of broken dolls.” Sometimes the tendency to want to anchor the fictional story within the real history of the place leads to data dumps of information which detracts from story-telling.The novel is divided into five parts with each principal character carrying a part and India/Kashmira carrying two, one for each of her names. And yet the slide from present to past and back to the present is easily accomplished in this structure.This is one of my better reads of Rushdie. I could see shades of the exiled and silenced author in the character of Shalimar, a man bubbling with rage for what was done to silence him. The story is also prescient considering what recently happened to Rushdie in New York, for some of the methods of murder that Shalimar was plotting seems to have really transpired, in reverse. I wonder if Rushdie’s assailant had been reading this book before his shameful act? ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jun 2023,"Jun 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4830.Shalimar_the_Clown

Young Magnus is exposed to the “Court” where Rick Pym rules large; all his courtiers and fellow crooks swear by the boss and will take the fall for him, even with their lives. They look after young Magnus when his mother is taken away to a lunatic asylum (I bet she had more peace there than as queen of this den of thieves). Rick forms dozens of fake companies, writes bouncing cheques, embezzles widows and pensioners of their earnings, and records everything in a green file cabinet that travels everywhere with him. He even runs for parliament and parades Magnus in public as the doting and loyal son.Magnus therefore comes to spying easily and is recruited by the British Secret Service while in school, an association that no matter how much he tries to dodge, stalks and enmeshes him even deeper for the rest of his life. The secrets that he hid for his father, and which are stored in the green cabinet, logically and inevitably steer him into this life of subterfuge. He meets his soul-mate and a proxy for the elusive Rick: Axel. Axel is a European survivor of WWII, tortured by every side he aligns with – i.e., the Germans, French, and Swiss, until the Czech take him on as a spy. Axel becomes a surrogate father to Magnus, because Rick is usually on the run somewhere for his latest misdemeanor.Gradually, the two become each other’s greatest coup: Pym getting Eastern Bloc secrets from Axel, and Axel getting Allied secrets from Pym, to feed their respective spy masters and enhance their own careers. After moving all over Europe, they get to the prize destination for spies – the USA – where the pickings are even richer and the game is easier, because Americans like to talk.But a pivotal event conspires to upset this cozy relationship: Rick dies and Magnus unravels.When Magnus goes AWOL after attending his father’s funeral, the hunt is on by both sides to prevent this breach, to stop this perfect spy from going out into the cold and telling all. The rest of the novel meanders between the hunt for Magnus by his wife, Mary, and his boss, Jack Brotherhood – that Jack and Mary were once colleagues in espionage, and lovers, only heightens the tension – and Magnus’s recollections on his life and on how he came to this sorry pass.What irritates is the narration which tries to be a garbled stream-of-consciousness – therefore, we have Pym talking about himself in first person and third person, sometimes in the same sentence. Some other characters also take on this dual voice, which after awhile gets rather tiresome and confusing. All the spying happens offline and is dealt with in throw-away passages, while the impact that spying has on the principal characters gets the spotlight. There is too much back story, obscurantist wordplay, and time flips that slow the pace and dull the tension. That Le Carre is an “in-your-head” writer compared to Ian Fleming’s “action” writer is obvious. About 200 pages could have been excised from this novel to make it a tighter one.However, the strong message, prevalent in all Le Carre novels is: espionage is a game in the end, and is a bloody waste of time and life. And it all came to nought when the wall fell in Berlin in 1989. And the irony was that the most educated and best-bred English types were recruited for this secret work, while the working classes were sent as cannon fodder to the front lines in the two world wars that preceded the Cold War. Both sins, yet who pays for them?That Le Carre struggled with himself in writing this very personal novel is obvious from the obfuscatory writing. Maybe, like Pym, he was trying to withhold secrets while being forced to reveal them in this novel. And as much as Magnus was inside his head all the time, Le Carre seemed to be inside his too, probably forgetting, or not caring that there were readers like us trying to figure out what the heck was going on. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 25, 2023","May 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19001.A_Perfect_Spy

With my current handicap of 25, I have a better chance of winning the Masters after sufficient practice rather than getting a Big 5 publishing deal, according to Pat Walsh.”The title alone: 78 cons and 14 pros (165 pages telling why you may never be published compared to 20 pages telling why you may), shows how Sisyphean this mountain is. Published in 2005, the book may be a bit dated, for much has changed in the publishing industry. Walsh’s own independent publishing company went into financial difficulties 10 years after its founding in 1998 and declared bankruptcy in 2013 – so his advice may not have been all that sound even in his time, let alone today.Despite the tried and true “dos and don’ts” that you get in most “How to get published” books by publishers who really don’t give a damn except for the royalties from their book, some new ones stood out for me:1.	You need ego and insecurity to write.2.	The first sentence in your book should be the best one in your first chapter.3.	Reading your work aloud, especially in the early drafts, hides a multitude of sins.4.	Paying a big advance gets everyone in the publishing company riled and revved to earn that money back – it’s a great motivator. News about it in the trade creates instant buzz.5.	It is in the publishing industry’s best interests to reject, discourage, and ignore you.What grated on me was the glib (in his words ""flighty”) attitude that seeps off the pages. He doesn’t appear to like writers that much, even though they are his bread and butter. If Walsh was trying to be humorous, then his jokes were flat to me. If he was trying to be insulting, then he succeeded, admirably. Yes, he is open about the jokes they trade around submissions when the editing team goes “slush diving” to find something worth publishing; about how jaded they are with submissions that range from the stupid to the bizarre. What has to be borne in mind with sensitivity is that all these “citizens of the slush pile” are trying to gain attention for their bundle of pages that they have worked their ass off over several years and are staking their future on – they need respect, and that is lacking. He has a particular fatwa out on the self-published, while admitting that before publishing got industrialized in the early 20th century, this business was mainly author-funded. What he does not admit to is that with the advent of the internet and DIY tools, and the shrinking of the “industrialized” publishing industry, the worm may be turning towards both sides living together in an unholy truce. And his peeve about e-mail submissions being cheap and lazy? Hey, it’s the industry standard now!Walsh also places undue emphasis on the query letter – one apostrophe out of place, and – reject! What I have found as a small publisher is that writers of great stories are poor formal letter writers. I wonder whether Thomas Wolfe, who couldn’t quite end his novels and tossed them off to his editor to finish, had ever written a query letter in his life (one that he would have to finish in a single page), and had he done so, would he have been published by the “industrial press”? Again, the writers need to be treated with respect – they are claiming to be novelists and story tellers, not concise letter writers. BTW, at the time of writing, Walsh had given up getting his own novel published and jumped over to the easier side, editing, and then writing this how-to (or more appropriately, how-not-to) book from his experience.Overall, a light read – most of this stuff is already known. The cynicism, I didn’t need. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 09, 2023","May 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1371147.78_Reasons_Why_Your_Book_May_Never_Be_Published_and_14_Reasons_Why_It_Just_Might

Her lovers: the chaste and caring Tate who builds her up and the two-timing Chase who destroys her. When Chase is found murdered in the opening chapter in 1970, the scene is set to find out whether Kya is guilty of the murder.Two story lines converge: the story of Kya from age 6 in 1959 until 1970, and the post-murder 1970 storyline of the trial and Kya’s subsequent life, with chapters alternating between the two.Flashes of Nicholas Sparks came to mind – then I realized why: “New York Times Bestseller,” a book sanitized of it’s incendiary potential to appeal to the masses. However, despite contrivances to keep it clean and above board, the novel and its offshoot film were not devoid of controversy. Reading old newsclips show that the author had incidents in her own life that mirrored Kya’s misadventures, and I wondered whether this book was written for catharsis or for getting even with the criticism Owens had faced. The controversy has mainly been about the portrayal of racist stereotypes (Jumpin’ and Mabel), but that can also be attributed to current morality being applied to incidents (albeit fictitious) being portrayed from 65 years ago when we were not so hypersensitive to race.All that said, Crawdads is a tender love story, but it was too syrupy for me. For a marsh dweller with no education and highly tuned survival skills, Kya comes across as a bit too noble. So does Tate. I would have been more convinced if Kya had gutted and eaten a fish raw and thumped her chest like Tarzan. And when she became a best-selling author, I had to ask someone to hold my beer. The one who played closer to type was Chase, when he moved from wooing suitor to philandering rapist. The writing also broke many of the rules of novel craft (jumping POVs, author intrusion, shifting tenses et al). But one wonders about craft these days; if books that break craft can go onto become bestsellers, who gives a damn about craft? Was it something cooked up to keep a bunch of literature professors gainfully employed? The ending redeemed the novel and explained (no spoiler) some of Kya’s behaviour, like her ability to spew out poems on the run, or why the details of that night of the murder were so sketchy, or why the case for the prosecution was so full of holes.An easy read.

The novel goes back and forth in time, pre-pandemic and 20 years into post-pandemic life, centering around a celebrated actor, Artur Leander, who dies of a heart attack while playing King Lear in Toronto, a few days before the outbreak. The people in Arthur’s life—his ex-wives, his son, the paramedic who tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him—and the artefacts they traded between each other become key characters and components in this tale.This virus kills, cities empty out, highways are gridlocked with traffic as vehicles run out of fuel, and people die in transit; planes sit idle in airports, the news networks go off the air, and the electricity grid finally shuts down. We are back to a feral state, where might is right; fundamentalists preach the end of the world and proclaim themselves the chosen ones; survival is one of plundering existing infrastructure until there are diminishing returns.Through this desolation, moves the Travelling Symphony, an itinerant group of about 30 musicians and actors, performing symphonies and Shakespearean plays for scattered survivor communities that usually consist of a few people huddled around an old-world facility – a gas station, a supermarket, an airport terminal. The survivors are of two types: those who have seen both the old world and the new and know what they have lost, and those born after the pandemic into the new world and accept life for what it is. “Even Shakespeare lived in times of plague, but he never knew of a better time. We did,” the former group seems to be saying.When members of the Symphony start to go missing, presumably kidnapped or killed by an ultra-orthodox group led by the charismatic Preacher, the stage is set for a showdown between the just and the righteous. But this contrived event comes too fast and is not the main thrust of the novel. The focus, I think, is on showing human durability, suggesting how linked we are, even if only by ideas, objects, or art, yet revealing how fragile the whole edifice of human existence is.What is most interesting and well-drawn are the scenes immediately following the pandemic, when institutions and systems we have come to rely on start shutting down, one by one, and humankind is reduced to survival, like their cavemen ancestors of old. There is a lot of killing in the early days, until people run out of bullets and crossbows are produced. The old world is suddenly quaint, a paradise lost, its pre-occupations and dilemmas trivial at best. Arthur for all his fame, his quest for immortality, his duplicitousness and ambition, is inconsequential in the grand new scheme of things – what survives him is a graphic novel, Station Eleven, written by his first wife, along with a paperweight, his son who turns out to be the antithesis of the father, and a young child actor who used to read books in his green room – remnants of the celebrity actor’s life washed up on this new shore in surprisingly new forms and functions. Of course, with world-building, there are always loose ends and unanswered questions. For instance, I was curious as to how Arthur’s alcoholic second ex-wife, Elizabeth, happened to go cold sober while trapped in an airport terminal for two years without even a twitch of complaint; or how Dialo had access to paper to print his newspaper in a post-pandemic, non-industrial, non-agricultural world that had no electricity or fuel. But let’s leave that to the editors and continuity people to figure out.I found the book ended rather prematurely too. So, we get a view of Year 20 post-pandemic, where mankind is just starting to get used to its present state, with glimmers of light (electricity?) on the horizon, but what’s next? Is this the set-up for a sequel, perhaps a series? ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,not setnot set,"Apr 16, 2023Apr 16, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

While good and bad can battle each other in equal or unequal measure, the reader must come away with an understanding of what is good and what is evil and be able to place their bet on the side of good even though the latter may lose in the story. And Tolstoy does that with vigour. His omniscient narrator is pretty sure of himself, quoting biblical text to support his case, using devils and imps and other forms of magic realism, and fable, to get his message across. The characters are caricatures. Wise old men appear from nowhere to sprinkle trinkets of wisdom on the stories, suggesting perhaps that Tolstoy must have been a fan of the Brothers Grimm who wrote their fairy tales during his formative years. And Tolstoy does death very well.Two stories that stray from the parable mode are “A Prisoner in the Caucasus” and “The Death of Ivan Illych,” the latter being of novella length. The former reads like a journalistic event of a soldier captured by Tartars, who makes his escape across the steppe with an unfit colleague likely to take the easy way out – i.e., pay the demanded ransom and not try to outwit the enemy. I expected a twist at the end but it never came. In “Ivan Illych” we see the gradual death of the protagonist, an otherwise ambitious, successful, and prosperous judge with a nagging wife and predatory colleagues. As his cancer grinds him down, he looks back on his life and realizes that it has been a fraud. He knows he will not be missed; his colleagues will be fighting to step into his job and his wife will grab his pension. Some of the stories are forgettable – their moral lessons have been done to death in the last two centuries following Tolstoy. Some stories like “How Much Land Does a Man Need” and “Too Dear” are laced with irony. Other stories, like “The Three Hermits” and “Death, Work, and Sickness” have ambiguous lessons that I couldn’t quite understand. Some stories are adapted from de Maupassant and Russian folk tales and don’t appear to have any incremental value added by Tolstoy.Love is the overarching theme in this collection, the most important requirement for a fulfilled life. Tolstoy brings this home in his last story in this collection, named “Three Questions: 1.	What is the best time to do anything? Now.2.	Who is the best person you need to consult? The one you are with.3.	What is the most important task? To do that person good.Now, is that not love? Even the dying Ivan Illych realized it was the missing element in his life. And, I believe, that was true for Tolstoy too – otherwise, why would he have left his wife at the end of his life and died in a train station?...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2023","Mar 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43125362-tolstoy-selected-stories

He wants extradition to the USA for the narcos prohibited by law, and is willing to turn himself and the hostages over to the authorities if they would grant him a secure prison from which he could carry out his business.This journalistic account commissioned from Garcia Marquez by one of the hostages, Maruja Pachon, and her husband, Alberto Villamizar, flips between the plight of the hostages in their dingy cells and the wider political moves underway to secure their release. Not all are saved, for some must be killed to make a point.The hostages are moved constantly and have regular changes of guard which create all sorts of interpersonal conflicts – some guards treat them well, trade life stories, and play cards with them; others threaten and terrorize. Living conditions range from good to horrible: plenty of TV and newspapers are mixed with overflowing toilets, boring food, shared single beds, darkened rooms, and no exercise. Tranquilizers and cigarettes are the way to keep madness at bay. Relatives convey subliminal messages to the captives by appearing on the television shows that fill the hostages idle time in captivity.The plight of the guards is no better than that of the hostages. They are shrouded in face masks through stifling heat all day and forced to sleep in the same rooms as their captives at night. They face the prospect of being gunned down mercilessly by the police, who under the unrelenting President Gaviria, are murdering hundreds of poor young men in the slums of Medellin.Rescue attempts are hampered, because the President will not act unless the families of the hostages give permission for such attempts, because people die in cross fires, and, in this case, they do.Escobar emerges as a man shrouded in secrecy, who will not meet with anyone for fear of those outside contacts carrying concealed tracking devices that will expose him. The only way to reach him is via letter that takes the mule train route. Hence, progress is agonizingly slow.Gradually, the negotiation narrows towards a conclusion, with pressure placed on the President by the hostages’ influential relatives, and on Escobar by a saintly priest, Father Garcia Herreros. The hostages (the ones still left alive) are set free, one by one, on a moment’s notice, while Escobar gets his luxury prison at government expense.The terror in the hostages is amplified when events are out of sync, when they receive a letter written some time ago but mislaid in the long delivery chain that shows negotiation at an earlier impasse than what the news on the TV is saying. At other times, the news announces that they have been released, while they still remain captive. When they are suddenly told to get their things and be ready to leave, they wonder whether it is to be reunited with their loved ones or to receive a bullet in the head. This graphic account of recent Columbian history reveals how inverted a country can become when criminals get more powerful than the government: it propagates a culture that life is better as a criminal than as a law-abiding citizen. The degree of violence and the cheapness of life is sharply drawn when thousands of kilograms of explosives are used to blow up a car and results in hundreds of bystanders also being killed or maimed; the lethality of the arms is on display when a high-calibre bullet can explode inside a victim’s body, killing them in a dozen ways. One also wonders whether if these eight journalists hadn’t been highly connected among the ruling elite, would they have ever been released from their captors or ended instead in a mass grave, as one of them mistakenly did?Garcia Marquez affords us a final chapter on Escobar’s demise, much needed, to put this senseless killing season to rest. But is it really over? Or has the balloon been squeezed in Colombia, so that it has bulged out somewhere else – Mexico, perhaps? ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 23, 2023","Mar 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16251.News_of_a_Kidnapping

If this was his entry ticket to being able to write as a Socialist, then he paid his dues in spades, finally imperiling his health to pass away in his forties.When his money is stolen in Paris, Orwell goes job hunting with his anti-Semitic, ex-Russian soldier friend, Boris. Their job hunt is hilarious. They always seem to lose out on some technicality. Managing on 6 francs a day is perilous: a bug in the milk, an overcut of meat leading to a higher bill, a damaged coin, and their budget will be blown. They finally find work at the Hotel X and afterwards at a newly opened restaurant, the Auberge de Jehan Cottard (the latter is a bit of a fraud, for the stranded staff end up propping up the elusive proprietor). Orwell sums up Parisienne restaurant life as follows:-	Waiters and lower-level staff did not have mustaches. Cooks had mustaches to show their contempt for the rest of their colleagues.-	There was only a double door that separated the filthy scullery where the staff ate in haste and anger from the dining room where the guests ate in all their splendor.-	Cursing and swearing are the dominant forms of staff management.-	The more one pays for food, the more sweat and spittle is in it, for it has been handled by more hands.-	Life as a plongeur (dishwasher) is work (17 hours x 365 days a year), commute, eat, and sleep. There is no growth. There is only a wearing down and an early death.-	Eating in hotels and restaurants (especially those in Paris) is an unnecessary extravagance. People could eat healthier at home.He gets a friend in England to bail him out of France—by finding him a softer job looking after a rich invalid—and bring him back home (so, he had connections, and one wonders whether the sojourn in France was more for experience than circumstance). However, his job in England is delayed for a month and he is left to manage on 19 shillings and sixpence. Back he slides into poverty, living the life of a tramp this time, and as usual, he makes his observations of that lifestyle:-	The bed bugs are more plentiful in the north than in the south of London-	Tramps are abject and envious people, and often bite the hand that feeds them.-	A tramp is always on the move, for the law prohibits staying in the same shelter for more than 24 hours. So, tramps work the circuit of shelters ringing Greater London.-	While in Paris you died of overwork, in England you died of boredom and hunger.-	The overwhelming majority of tramps are men, too broken to be mean, devoid of women, and thrown into homosexuality and the occasional trinket from prostitutes.-	Tramps are beggars, and beggars are despised because they do not perform profitable work.He also provides us a street slang dictionary and a hierarchy of the best places to get a free or extremely low-cost rest for the night, including places where you sleep leaning against a rope (the rope is pulled in the morning providing an instant wake-up call).Of course, being Orwell, and destined for a higher calling than that of a plongeur or tramp, this period too ends, and he moves on to write his memoirs of being down and out in Paris and London and to document the evils of classism, colonialism, Fascism, Communism and a myriad of other “isms” that he dedicated his life to fighting after tasting their bitter fruit. One of his observations of the rich and poor stuck with me: “Poverty frees people from ordinary standards of behavior, just as money frees people from work.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2023","Mar 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/393199.Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London

Lurking behind the safe façade of middle-class respectability, and the religious and social rituals of small-town life, is a desire for more, a desire to cheat on the side, a desire to be authentic, and these desires lead to all sorts of complicated, tragic, and hilarious situations. Humour, pithy observations, and eloquent writing drip off every page, making this an easy and pleasurable read, despite us wondering where the author is going to wander off next.Two other characters of interest are church organist Ashley who nurses a secret life, and jogger Chuck, although I wondered how the latter could reconcile his physical fitness regimen with his fondness for alcohol—something had to give, sooner or later—instead, he attracts a lover! And of course, the mysterious Lucas Darnell helps tie up many of the loose story strands floating around Thorneside. As I also live in the area from which the author draws his inspiration, I got a kick out of trying to match the names of the fictional places— i.e., Thorneside, Lockport, Port Percy, Workforth and Hoostens, not forgetting Lindisfarne County—with their real-life equivalents. I agree, given the salacious matter lying beneath the “respectable” lives of these church-going WASPs, it was wise of Cameron to fictionalize the setting. There are at least half a dozen novels here – each of the principal characters could easily deliver one—and I believe Cameron is teasing us with an “executive summary” of small-town life through this collection. I hope he sits down (soon) to take each one of these characters apart and render those follow-up novels in greater depth. For a big city guy who retired to a small town not-so long ago, he has a remarkable eye for the “types” that rural communities generate.In his acknowledgements section, the author quotes Galbraith and admits that he (Cameron) “talks too much.” I have to agree. “Brevity is the soul of wit,” would apply here, and if some excessive descriptions, some unnecessary chapters, and a whole raft of peripheral characters had been eliminated, this would have amounted to a taut novel or linked story collection while retaining the author’s signature humour....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 11, 2023","Mar 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62997046-thorneside-stories

Considering where the country is today—bankrupt, facing food insecurity, and with another revolution bubbling amidst the hungry masses—nothing much seems to have changed, or will change, as the author implies in the story of Maali Almeida.Maali is a 35-year-old homosexual photographer, specializing in taking exposé pictures in war zones and some risqué ones of his sex life. He works for everyone: the army, NGOs, the foreign press, and the LTTE. He has secreted away some incriminating photographs that might make governments fall. He is also a compulsive gambler and blows all his earnings between assignments in shady casinos. When the story opens, we meet his ghost, for he has been murdered and his body decapitated. We know where he was killed, and even some of his murderers, but we do not know why, or who ordered the hit.Maali is now in the In-Between world where he is given seven moons to get his act together and go onto the Light (re-incarnation, where everything earlier is forgotten and you start again – kind of counter-productive, one would think, given the loss of all the valuable experience gained from previous lives). In this demonic world, he sees the spirits of those killed in the long-raging civil wars – some real-world names are also mentioned for verisimilitude – interacting with the folks Down There (mortal plane), except that the mortals cannot see or hear the spirits, and only certain channels like the Crow Man and the devil goddess Mahakali allow for communication between the two. Our hero is caught in the conflict between going to the Light (urged by his spirit advisor Dr. Rani Sritharan, herself killed by the LTTE for being a moderate) and taking revenge on his murderers Down There (urged by the spirit of Sena Pathirana, a former JVP organizer who is doomed to spend his life in the In Between). We also meet the stereotypical gang of murderers: the corrupt politician, the army commander, the stooges who do the dirty work, the policemen who turn a blind eye and cover up the sins. Maali throws in his lot with Sena, partly for revenge, and partly out of love for his roommates: DD, his lover, and lesbian Jaki, who wanted to be his lover.The story weaves and bobs at a slowly ramping-up pace as Maali tries to uncover the mystery of his death and expose the culprits before his seven moons run out. The key is in finding those photographs and their negatives. Like peeling an onion, revelations come out, allegiances are exposed and the whydunit is revealed. Everyone is busy in this tragic country it appears: international arms dealers have carved out political factions they will supply to; contract killers and garbage cleaners are disposing of hundreds of youths captured, tortured, interrogated and killed industrial-style by the military; the army and the rebels are colluding to dispose of dissidents within their ranks; and politicians are raking it in despite the poor man’s misery. The city’s population has doubled from dead Maali’s vantage point because he sees the living and the ghosts running around, and this constant, bizarre backdrop provides originality to the tale.Some acute observations on the Sri Lankan reality are tossed out in passing:-	“Creatures with power acting in their own interest, that’s what we must fear.”-	“Your generation fucked up the country” – DD, speaking to his politician father.-	“It’s not Good vs. Evil in this country; it’s varying degrees of bad squabbling with conglomerates of the wicked.”-	“Why not the Pangolin on the flag? They have big tongues, thick hides and small brains.” -	Burma, Israel, North Korea, Apartheid South Africa, and Sri Lanka were all born in 1948 – not an auspicious year.-	“Being an English-speaking Colombian (resident of Colombo) exempts us from the rest of the country’s suffering” - MaaliI found the style of writing daunting. Narrated in Second Person, with tenses alternating, sparse attributions, and with two worlds to navigate simultaneously, the stagecraft gets confusing at times. Non-Sri Lankan readers may find local expressions and direct translations of Sinhala into English (such as “Sperm Dog” and “Your Amma Screw”) to be confusing, although I laughed my head off being fluent in both languages. I wondered whether a glossary would have helped, given that this book has now emerged an international bestseller after winning the Booker. I had a touch of nostalgia because much of the action centred around locations that I was familiar with: The Lionel Wendt theatre and art gallery, the Art Centre Club, Hotel Leo (I presume it was once known as the Rio), Slave Island, the Beira Lake – all regular stomping grounds and watering holes during my youth, when this country had been gentler and kinder.Maali’s ongoing conversations with the Dead Leopard provides philosophical heft: the leopard is keen to ascend the food chain and be next incarnated as a human, despite the foibles he has seen in the human world. The human ability to create is what fascinates the animal. Whereas Maali wants to get the heck out this place after settling his scores, for all he has seen of humanity is its incredible power to corrupt and destroy. The damning conclusion the author posits is that even when the truth is revealed, Sri Lankan’s don’t give a fig – Maali’s “big reveal” photo exhibition at the art gallery is an apt metaphor.

And yet, the characters and the situatiA fusion of memoir and fiction which the author confesses to up-front, making this book a hard work to . And yet, the characters and the situations make for compelling reading.The author listened to his maternal grandfather’s confessions on the latter’s deathbed back in 1989 and then proceeded to write this book twenty years later, after a crucial piece of the puzzle was revealed in the records of his grandmother’s dead psychiatrist.Given that these are the ramblings of a dying man hopped on painkillers, the narrative weaves and bobs after some preliminary standalone pieces — like the sexual encounter with the hermaphrodite in a railway yard and the attempted bombing of the Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Potomac by Grandfather who is best described as an angry nihilist—before lapsing into defined narrative streams covering different timelines in Grandfather’s life. In fact, all key characters demonstrate Grandfather’s bubbling rage, a supposed legacy of the Holocaust, that gets them into sticky situations, especially when Grandfather tries to strangle his boss with a telephone cord that merits 20 months in jail.The downer for me is that names of people are missing: it is Grandfather, Grandmother, Mother and Father for the author’s close circle all the way through in this book, and when the paternal grandfather appears briefly in the picture things get a bit muddied.Although it is Grandfather’s recounting, it is Grandmother who is the mercurial and mysterious character. Of French-Jewish origin, widowed with a three-year old (Mother), and losing her entire family to Auschwitz, she arrives in America and hooks up with Grandfather (a demobbed war vet) when she was supposedly to be hooked up with younger brother, Rabbi Ray. Theirs is a tender love story, wracked by schizophrenia, loss, anger, separation, and lies. They were happy “in the cracks” says Mother,The most dramatic story strand is Grandfather’s fatwa on Werner Von Braun, poster-child of the Nazis who pioneered the US space program and landed a man on the moon. Grandfather, a rocket engineer himself, believed that his rocket was better than Von Braun’s – yes, the penis-envy is palpable. Although he initially sensed a kindred spirit in Werner, Grandfather came to despise the man when Herr Sturmbannführer (major) was associated with the Nazi atrocity machine, and when it was discovered that the V2 rocket program was built on the deaths of hundreds of prisoners of war. Grandfather hunts Von Braun down in the closing days of the war and unearths his cache of rocket documentation only to see his wily foe surrender to the Americans crawling up one side of the mountain while the Russians are crawling up the other, both sides set to steal over 1600 German scientists who would fuel the Superpowers’ mad space race in the following two decades. The two foes face-off at a space conference in the USA many years later, when Grandfather is still making models that have yet to be officially endorsed by NASA and Von Braun is the celebrated “Man of the Century,” pissing in a potted plant in a public auditorium to relieve himself of the pain from the cancer that will eventually kill him. The later story strands cover the retirement years of Grandfather at the Fontana Village, his recovery from Grandmother’s death, and the new love of his life, Sally, a fellow-retiree whose cat, Ramon, takes on a python, a metaphor perhaps for Grandfather and Von Braun.  I find this form of creative non-fiction, or faction, to be compelling, for it forces us to look at history as it was, yet re-arranges (and invents) events to make them cohere. According to Grandfather, he won the battle against Von Braun if you consider that America lost interest in the moon after the space shuttle program took over, and old Grandpa won contracts with the space agency and proceeded to have a 14-year career at NASA long after Von Braun had shuffled off this mortal coil. But we only have the author’s word for it – is it fact or fiction?

We are however given distinct chapters that deal with the mythology, symbolism, botany, and industry of roses; and others that deal with Orwell’s life - particularly the period he spent in Wallington and Jura, when he planted roses – and with his writing, particularly his masterpiece Nineteen Eighty-Four, which capped all his prior literary efforts at zeroing in on the great evil of Totalitarianism. Suffice to say that we see the contrast between his life—which was embroiled in the misery of illness, poverty, and war—and the beauty of the rose that provided him respite from his travails. There are so many books written on Orwell and there is no point getting into minutia of his life here. Solnit however focusses on a few points that get overlooked in this great man’s self-inflicted martyrdom:1.	He sought poverty and squalor as an expiation of his ancestral ties to slave owners and those who were well connected with the colonial system of his time. His name change from Eric Blair to George Orwell was related to this erasure.2.	He was anti-British Empire, but he was pro-British.3.	He was not good at portraying women and ignored their right to assertion.4.	Even though he was a political writer, or “pamphleteer” as he called himself, he also sought beauty in writing which came in the forms of precision, clarity, accuracy, honesty and truth.5.	Orwell lamented the loss of eccentric English names for flowers (forget-me-not, red-hot-poker, love-lies-bleeding et al) in favour of their botanical equivalents.6.	Despite his woe, he was hopeful. He married for the second time on his deathbed, adopted a son, and had his rod packed to go fishing the moment he got out of his final trip to hospital (from which he didn’t return0).On the gardening side, there were a few revelations for me:1.	Roses are associated with the Virgin Mary, the Suffragette Movement, Wars (of Roses) and other revolutionary activity. They signify subjectivity, liberty, and self-determination.2.	Colombia exports 80% of roses sold in the USA. The mass production of roses and its exploitation of resources, both human and natural, is the ugly underbelly of this otherwise beautiful flower.3.	Stalin loved lemons, and grew them forcefully against the dictates of nature. Few survived.4.	Flowers are the sexual organs of plants.5.	Gardening is tangible. You reap what you sow, barring the interference of bad weather, unlike the returns from writing which are, at best, nebulous.6.	Farming outlasts regimes, dictators, and lies, although lies mutate faster than seeds. There are other digressive but interesting chapters on the Carboniferous Age, Coal Mining in Britain, George Bernard Shaw and Jamaica Kincaid (the former for his pro-Stalin stance, and the latter for her writing about plants and gardens), Darwinism, the ideological battles of Soviet agriculturists Lysenko and Vavilov that could only be won by he who was Stalin’s favourite, and the treacherous Enclosure Acts in Britain of the 18th and 19th centuries that disenfranchised the common man from the land and herded them into cities as fodder for the Industrial Revolution.Despite his posthumous greatness (imagine having an adjective – Orwellian- named after you!), Orwell was the perennial outsider: “Eton left me too snobbish to be accepted by the poor, and still poor not to be accepted by the snobs.” And in Spain, he was shot, injured and hunted by the people he went to help.A short, agonizing life that produced masterpieces in novel and essay forms that are still read and appreciated today in a world that has become increasingly Orwellian.

She mines the underbelly of human experience without placing the polite veneer of political correctness that has permeated much of Canadian literature today.Vanessa McLeod, a girl who veers back and forth from about the age of six to fifteen in the stories, for the pieces shift in time, is a writer in the making, and a proxy for Laurence. ’Nessa is able to flit in and out of places, or find nooks and crannies from where she can spy and eavesdrop on adult conversations. She is the proverbial “bird in the house” of the title, although that title takes on more ominous portents later in the book. Vanessa is growing up during the Great Depression when even doctors, like her father, are paid in chickens and pork, and experienced secretaries like her Aunt Edna are unable to find work and must content themselves looking after aging parents to remain relevant.And speaking of relevance, the real villain of the piece is maternal Grandpa Conner, blue-eyed and Irish, the first immigrant who travelled 100 miles north of Winnipeg to Manawaka, blacksmithing along the way, until he was able to raise enough money to buy a hardware store and build the Brick House that later became the multi generational family home. Conner has recently sold his hardware store and retired, and is battling the irrelevance of old age. He is a temperance fanatic, thrifty, irascible, and terrorizes his wife and daughters. He drives all of Edna’s would-be suitors away, until one is able to stand up to the old geezer. Connor leaves a losing argument by sulking off to his man-cave in the basement, yet he is frightened by tenderness, something his wife, Agnes, is full of. The other side of the family is Scottish, epitomized by Grandma Eleanor, a big spender, whose husband and son are doctors, and who looks down on the Connors for their humbler origins. Laurence deftly paints Eleanor’s reluctance to show emotion and her preference to cover this squeamishness with possessions and activity. When the bird enters the house, bad luck is foretold, and people start dying, deaths that have a profound impact on Vanessa. Lives are changed not just by the Depression, but by cruel circumstance—grist for the mill for the budding writer, moving her from writing fairy tales to capturing real life tragedies.I found two of the pieces, “Horses in the Night” and “The Half Husky,” to be the best of these linked and looped stories. In the first, we meet cousin Chris, doomed to an unfulfilled life, yet always full of hope, trying every trick under the sun to get out of his impoverished “house built of trees,” but who is constantly dragged back to base by crushing circumstances beyond his control. In the second, we face the inevitability of disaster for children who take the wrong path, wittingly or unwittingly, and how animals are consigned their fate based on human expediency.Education is the way out of Manawaka, and the family pools its finances to getting the only eligible one away to university – Vanessa. Years later, a middle-aged Vanessa revisits Manawaka to discover what we all know – you can never really “go back.” The home that once was is no longer home, others have occupied it and altered its character. All that’s left of the old home are locked up in memories.Laurence’s style is brutally honest and unadorned.

I thought Inherent Vice which was supposed to have a bit of a plot and was half the size, depicting a time I could identify with, would hold me, and I nearly ditched this one too. But with a sense to being loyal to a literary great, I plodded on.Doc Sportello is a hippie detective engaged in routine investigations like checking on errant husbands, insurance defaulters, and other white-collar miscreants. He is constantly lighting up and experimenting with “new” drugs fresh off the boat. He appears to have some alternate means of sustaining himself for he doesn’t seem to get paid much for his sporadic work. His ex-girlfriend, Shasta, asks him to check out her land developer boyfriend Mickey Woolfmann whose wife is also having an affair with her guru. From there on, the plot wears off in various directions like a bad LSD trip. Pynchon traits—multiple characters, digressions, and new plot points emerging whenever the narrative dead ends—are all there. The Woolfmann story soon becomes a side play in something more important, involving FBI hit squads, addicts trying to go straight, a heroin and money smuggling gang called the Golden Fang, a trail of dead bodies that fall at regular intervals, and a cop called Bigfoot who is keen on getting Doc caught up in a myriad of dangerous situations to see who the bad guys are. Everyone in LA is smoking something. The wanton damage people are doing to their bodies and their families is frightening in the land of the free and the home of the brave. It seems that people are trying to flee American life where the spectres of Vietnam and Charles Manson hang over them. Behind the delirium of drugs lurks fear. Sex is clinical and an animal act, and everyone is screwing everyone else, literally and figuratively. Yes, everyone, including Doc, is inherently caught up in vice of some sorts, as the tile suggests.Pynchon evokes the memorabilia and mood of the time, from songs and musicians, to merchandise, to the movies that epitomized the age. The internet is nascent, and Doc uses its antecedent, ARPANet, to get valuable information to help in his investigation. Phone booths and answering machines are also popular at the time and invaluable aids to PIs. However, the jargon, hippie jargon, I believe, is a bit hard to handle: “Anything from a double-quint pommer down to a sopranino shawn” - go figure!Not every loose end is tied up in this novel, but a few of the plot digressions have a satisfactory conclusion, and Doc is free to “smoke-off” into the sunset.I think I have performed my ode to Pynchon now. As a post modernist writer, he certainly exhibits versatility to move from a novel like Gravity’s Rainbow to this one, each so different in setting, subject matter, and time. But does one read him for pleasure? Certainly not.

My interest was raised bI received a copy of this book from the author because he had discovered my proclivity to read and/or  edgy literature. My interest was raised because I am always curious to find out what new literary forms are in the pipeline. I was blown away by this one.Although dubbed a novel, this is a collection of 22 short stories. We also get a copious but unindexed set of Notes at the end in which we get more story-like passages and an explanation from the author as to why he has written this nearly-500-page tome and his remedy for all that ails his characters.In the stories, written in stream-of-consciousness style, the author does not lack for verbosity, lingual dexterity, and anger. Yes, all these 20-something characters are in various states of drug or alcohol induced despair and anger. They hate the establishment (yet live off its largesse), they want to commit suicide yet don’t, because there is a life force holding them to this “fucked-up world.” Yes, and the four-letter expletive is used so extensively, I wondered whether all of them would develop a permanent stutter if that word were taken out of their vocabulary. And their sexual habits include urolagnia and coprophilia, and for a moment I wondered whether the author was copying Thomas Pynchon. These are not characters I could identify or empathize with, in fact, I wanted to say, “If you want to ‘off’ yourself so badly, get on with it. There are more starving but grateful people out there.” But if they represent the “opioid generation,” then it is a sorry indictment on where society has evolved.Some stories amount to essays on subjects that I could not comprehend, for they too flowed stream-of-consciousness and the arguments were not logically laid out. Where I was able to extract arguments being made—such as monetary theory, perception vs. reality, or the proposed social media reality show—their concepts came across as either half-baked or old hat. I mean, why have a scripted and controlled social media TV show similar to Survivor, when social media in its present form is one big reality TV show anyway?There is a charlatan called Hakim, who appears in the Notes, and he intrigued me as the classic snake-oil salesman who tries to sell us nirvana in exchange for our money. Not sure if our Hakim is a metaphor for the televangelists and motivational coaches who are already in on the act. Is Hakim the epitome of the establishment that these characters detest? Another question: the author claims that artists should not commit suicide because that would arrest the development of our culture; yet his hero is Lil Peep, a 21-year-old rapper who died of a drug overdose. I couldn’t read all the stories, but I read a majority of them, as well as the Notes. Why? Because there was a sameness in all of them, and a nihilism that grated after awhile. I have taken my son and his girlfriend on the golf course often, and we usually have a great time; I felt really sorry for Tim’s dad, in the story “Sanctuary Golf Course,” getting an expletive-filled diatribe that ran over a whole page from Tim. I would have whacked this drunken asshole of a son with my golf club until he showed some respect. The author posits Love as the answer to our woes, and yet none of his characters embody that, nor is it evoked in us as readers. I only felt revulsion and pity. It would have been good to have one character at least show us a way out, a better way. Isn’t fiction about showing as well as telling?The generation gap exists at any given time, with any age. But as an ex-hippie myself, we preached love and practiced it, not the anger and hopelessness of these characters. We also grew up eventually, took a shave and a shower, and joined the establishment and made it bigger (not necessarily better) than it was, because the alternatives were far worse. I hope these guys in this book will also wise up at some point, clean up their shit, detoxify from their drugs, and join the human race, given that they have strong lifelines.I gave this book three stars for two reasons: the word dexterity of the author and the total focus on his artistic presentation at the expense of losing his audience – the work comes first, the audience? Pfft! Is this an art form that I would appreciate or emulate? No. Tim could have dismissed his reformed alcoholic father with a single sentence, he didn’t need to blow my ears away with his invective that had made its point long ago. And this is true of many other stories in this collection where we are plunged into labyrinths of soul-searching and voluminous physical and mental sensations that could be covered off in a few lines. Do we as the audience have to be inside these hopeless people’s minds and veins, or could we observe them from the outside? That’s a question you will have to answer as you read this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63890262-spiritless-but-actually-not

Therefore, being presented the keys to the kingdom, he proceeded to expand the empire. Jack’s world was a world of hardcovers (McClelland & Stewart went into mass paperbacks only in 1977), huge print runs on old technology, manuscripts that had to be trucked by postal mail, pre-internet and pre-social media. And yet his pressures were similar to the ones we as publishers face today: US publishers had cornered the majority of the Canadian market, local printers were more expensive than foreign alternatives, and the spirit of customer service and efficiency in the publishing industry was unheard of. Jack agonized over the look and feel of book covers, he argued over title names, and he would be slighted if a writer queried their royalty statement.Publishers and authors did not appear to do much business by phone in those days, for Jack wrote voluminous letters, sometimes on the most trivial matters – he had the aid of a secretary and a Dictaphone. I suppose, as he alludes to Mordecai Richler in 1968 and then re-affirms to Margaret Laurence in 1982, he was expecting his letters to be published post-retirement and read thereafter as essential Canadian publishing history – which they seem to have been done by the publication of this book in 1998. Other than for his letters, Jack never wrote a book himself.As a publisher, he was the “big picture guy” – a super salesman, staging grand promo events, arranging conferences to select the 100 greatest Canadian books (to which event, strangely, only M&S authors had access while others had to fight to get in), and championing cash-cows like the New Canadian Library. He was not shy to lobby parliament for preferential treatment for Canadian writers and publishers, and wield his “influence” with the Canada Council for the Arts. And he took bets on obscure books if they struck a chord in him, like Beautiful Losers by Leonard Cohen and Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence. And, given his cavalier approach, M&S struggled financially from the late ‘60s until Jack sold the firm in 1985. Not into the more technical aspects of publishing, i.e., editing, production etc.,—he had a staff of nearly a 100 for that—Jack focussed on relationship management, public and government relations, and marketing. His kept his favourite authors close, and his correspondence with them is the best parts of this collection: frank, honest, witty, sometimes brutal, and sometimes vulnerable and apologetic. I counted Pierre Berton, Al Purdy, Farley Mowat, Margaret Atwood, in addition to Cohen and Laurence among his “inner circle.” Being a small publisher in Canada myself (certainly not in Jack’s league), I found this book refreshingly comforting – the big guys didn’t have it easy, is what I came away with. And yet, Jack’s zeal and commitment to this strange industry is reassuring to us who plod in the dark wondering what the heck we’ve got into that we can’t seem to extricate ourselves from. And yet I salivate when Jack says 250,000 copies was a good print run, when we count a Canadian best-seller today as 5000 copies sold....more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,not setnot set,"Jan 15, 2023not set","Jan 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1816442.Imagining_Canadian_Literature

Despite having earned his reputation as a stylist with his famous novel, Madame Bovary,An autobiographical novel of Flaubert’s younger days in Paris. Despite having earned his reputation as a stylist with his famous novel, Madame Bovary, this book failed to live up to that reputation, for me.Frederick, the protagonist, and a proxy for Flaubert, is a law student who leads an aimless life, hopelessly in love with a married woman, Madame Marie Arnoux, and open to dalliances with mistresses (Rosanette) and other richer, older, married women (Madame Dambreuse). He does not work. His uncle has left him an inheritance, and his mother presents him a title into the aristocracy. It is the middle of the nineteenth century when the Houses of Bourbon and Orleans are duking it out for control of the nation, and socialists and communists are advocating revolution. A time that brings in the short-lived Second Republic. The political events are a backdrop and there is no firm chronology in the narrative; a lot of political names and local events are bandied about which probably have relevance to a historian of the period, but only signified turbulence, shifting allegiances, and jockeying for privilege to me.Frederick’s circle of friends is split between loyalists and revolutionaries, and despite being from the former, he is sympathetic to the latter: “He (Frederick) was exasperated by the rottenness of these old men; and, carried away by the recklessness which sometimes takes possession of even the most timid, he attacked the financiers, the deputies, the government, the king, took up the defence of the Arabs, and gave vent to a great deal of abusive language.”The storyline is episodic, like Frederick’s wayward life, and does not have a novelistic arc. This was disappointing. There were other issues that could be related to the style of the time, but which jarred me:1.	Pronouns are used lavishly and indiscriminately, and after awhile one wonders who the “he” or “she” is. Characters are also referred to by their profession or lifestyle – so one hears of “the clerk, the picture maker, the citizen, the Bohemian, the Vicomte, the Marechal” etc.2.	Tight editing makes continuity a problem – scenes jump from one to the next in a sentence.3.	Despite all the affairs, the sex is muted or absent. Perhaps the threat of venereal disease made sex difficult or less enjoyable than the dalliance. Or perhaps the censors in Flaubert’s day were more intrusive.4.	Some descriptions are excessive, as if Flaubert is reliving them from memory. Check out Frederick’s tour of Fontainebleau with Rosanette, and M. Dambreuse’s funeral ceremony. And yet scenes of 19th century Paris described by one who actually lived there are well done: “Establishments for chemical products and timber-merchants’ yards made their appearance alternately. High gates, like those seen in farm-houses, afforded glimpses, through their opening leaves, of wretched yards within, full of filth, with puddles of dirty water in the middle of them. Long wine-shops, of the colour of ox’s blood, displayed in the first floor, between the windows, two billiard-cues crossing one another, with a wreath of painted flowers. Here and there might be noticed a half-built plaster hut, which had been allowed to remain unfinished. Then the double row of houses was no longer interrupted; and over their bare fronts enormous tin cigars showed themselves at some distance from each other, indicating tobacconists’ shops. Midwives’ signboards represented in each case a matron in a cap rocking a doll under a counterpane trimmed with lace. The corners of the walls were covered with placards, which, three-quarters torn, were quivering in the wind like rags. Workmen in blouses, brewers’ drays, laundresses’ and butchers’ carts passed along.”5.	I learned a lot of archaic words: Paletot, antimony, piastres, fichu, Bacchante, ague, faïence, equipages, maledictions, paletot, postilion, quincunx, cavil, magniloquence, burthen.Some of the male characters are interesting: Arnoux the philanderer, who actually approves of Frederick consorting with his wife and needs the young man’s assistance to get out of his complicated finances; Seneçal the revolutionary, who believes that brutal control by the state is the answer, and who is prepared to kill his colleagues who disagree; Deslauriers, Frederick’s childhood friend, who secretly aspires to acquire everything and everyone Frederick has and who throws his energies into the revolution; Cisy, the lawyer, who is a bit of a sissy and passes out when facing a duel. The female characters are separated between free-wheeling, free-loving mistresses like Rosanette who have no class restrictions to worry about because they are shamed women anyway, and married, respectable ones like Madame Dambreuse and Madame Arnoux who have to cloak their affairs in subterfuge and secrecy. There are also the panting virgins like Louise who wait forever for their men to make up their mind and dare not sully their reputations while in-waiting. Yet all of them, men and women alike, are ruled by superficial passions and are sometimes hypocritical in their behaviour.In the end, it is a story of unrequited love, perhaps even a moral lesson about those who pursue mortal desires - like Frederick pursuing love and Deslauriers chasing power – end up short, just like M. Arnoux did on the financial front.A good snapshot of France during the Second Republic by one who lived through it, but not much of a novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,not setnot set,"Jan 10, 2023not set","Jan 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2183.Sentimental_Education

I found the six stories were wound together like the layers of an onion – you enter like a needle piercing through from one side and exit from the other, getting closure to each story only after you pass the core.The six stories:-	Circa 1850 - a diary: A lawyer is travelling through Polynesia and encounters the evils of colonialism where both colonizer and colonized are deeply unhappy, where “the weak are meat, that the strong do eat,” and where trust is betrayed for slim pickings. He returns to America to become an Abolitionist.-	1931 - an epistolary: an impoverished composer apprentices to a former maestro who is dying of syphilis. Soon, both are cheating on each other: the apprentice is sleeping with the older man’s wife and pawning his art treasures, while the aging genius is stealing his amanuensis’ compositions for his magnum opus.-	1975 – 3rd person omniscient: A journalist is on the tail of a report exposing possible public anger over a nuclear powerplant. The scientist who prepared the report is coincidentally the recipient of the letters of our impoverished composer back in the 1931 story. The intrepid journalist must endure several near-deaths before she can zero in on her prize scoop. -	2000s – 1st person: an aging, financially precarious, British small press publisher hits the jackpot with a book by a dead author, but is pursued by the author’s thieving relatives for a share of the royalties. The only hideout is to go incognito in a nursing home on the Scottish border. But the refuge is worse than the outside, and he attempts to flee the coocoos nest. This is by far the most rib-tickling tale of the lot.-	Sometime in the distant future – an interview: the world has once again embraced slavery. Neo Sea Corpros (modern-day Korea) is ruled by the Corpocracy and is peopled by humans called purebloods who live a life of consumerism, and genetically manufactured sub-humans called fabricants who are created with lower intellectual capacity and who do all the grunt work for their masters. However, a revolution of the fabricants is underway, for some are starting to develop sentience. A fabricant, who shows remarkable promise, is taken to a pureblood university for study. A crucial decision needs to be made – should she be destroyed or allowed to ascend to pureblood status? Or will she survive to write the Declaration that will expose the evils of the Corpocracy? -	Way Out in the Future, after the Fall of Man – 1st person, Pidgeon English – Life is back to the age of the barbarian in the Hawaiian Islands after the fall of man. The survivors are the peaceful Valleypeople, their rivals the blood-thirsty Kona, and the Prescients who arrive by boat, and who appear to know what went before. When a fifty-year old Prescient, Meronym, comes to study the ways of the Valleypeople, 16 year-old narrator Zachry views her with suspicion, until she reveals what led to the fall. Zachry quickly realizers that their existing world is facing annihilation again, from impending conquest and plague, and he must escape if the human species is to continue to exist. This is also the hardest story to read, for the language is a bastardized English with its own syntax and lexicon.In the film version, the pieces are more tightly linked by having the principal characters be reborn in each story with new identities. However, in the novel, apart from a few clues and a mysterious birthmark that appears on one character in each of the stories, the links are subtle, or weak. What is most impressive is the six different narrative styles (I have called them out above against each story) and the distinctive voices. For a moment, I wondered whether Mitchell had written six novellas, and, finding them difficult to sell individually, had threaded them into a novel by providing superfluous links. The onion structure, while innovative, led to me forgetting the outer layer stories by the time I revisited them on the way out (or back) of this huge book – so much had happened in between. However, the action is strong in each of them.The lesson is clear: “The Old ‘Uns tripped themselves, leading to the Fall, due to their hunger for more,” says Meronym. Greed, in all the stories, leads to their unravelling.A robust bout of imagination and virtuoso story telling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13642707-cloud-atlas

The presentation is like a play of monologues: the characters speak to the reader and comment on the idiosyncrasies of the others, and sometimes drop clues to their own psyches. A novel approach, but a difficult one from which to parse important facts about the characters, for they get buried in throwaway lines, and in speculation and rumination.The situation is also quite banal: artist wife leaves businessman husband for another artist; they meet several years later and the second guessing begins. The voices of the three are distinct and this is the only interesting feature: Stuart talks in the limited and stock vocabulary of a person of commerce; Oliver, the artist wife-stealer, is expansive and erudite, floating all over the place without a focus; and Gillian, the most grounded one, is yet the one who makes impulsive choices when it comes to matters of the heart.I’m sure the novel would have made its way to a fitting conclusion despite its scatter-gun presentation, but at page 100 it still hadn’t done so and was firing all over the place, so I dropped off at that point. Experimental novels run the risk that often those experiments do not work. This experiment did not work for me.Not necessarily the way to end my book reading for 2023 on a downer, but I did go shopping for good books at Christmas and have a few winners in the bag for posting next year.

A northern family of comfortable means is taking a vacation in the south of Italy. The narrator, the head of this family, is a pompous, racist (extreme hot weather is described as “African”), full of opaque prose, and unable to acculturate in his new surroundings. The family gets thrown out of the Grand Hotel for suspicion of residual whooping cough among the children, is not given the outdoor dining reserved for hotel guests (“aren’t we hotel guests?” argues the narrator), and is fined for having one of their children run naked on the beach.But the villain of the piece is Cipolla the Magician, a travelling entertainer who sets up in the town and practices a range of illusions, from hypnosis to sleight of hand, from arithmetical tricks to card tricks to parlour games, all performed with finesse. Cipolla is a hunchback, an unpleasant person both in look and character. He drinks and smokes copiously while performing (to gain energy, he insists), and is disdainful of his audience, often berating those he pulls up on stage to be the subjects of his magic. During hypnosis, he humiliates his subjects, drawing upon their secrets and placing them on public display.The voyeurism of the audience is also evident, for even though it is way past the children’s bedtime, the northern family continues to stay up and watch Cipolla’s performance as it grows in menace and intrusion. And yet, as much as he dominates, Cipolla displays the ability to serve the audience when it is their turn to hide and his to seek – “he who knows how to obey, knows how to command” is his credo. However, he should have known that this is the credo only of the enlightened few.Mario is the local chocolatier, a twenty-something lad with a love affair in the doldrums. He has little to do in this drama until Cipolla pulls him up on stage saying, “I have been eyeing you all through the evening.” He is to rue his words.Mann leaves us with the implied warning that the conquest of the mind is a dangerous battle, that we are better off mastering our own minds than those of others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2022","Dec 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/539128.Mario_and_the_Magician

He then checks into a clinic in Switzerland to have himself analysed, for he feels his problems are more deep-rooted than stress and alcohol. As he submerges into analysis, a portrait of the man emerges: he doesn’t feel loved by his wealthy father who disinherited him, he has had sex only once in his life; his only love affair, a platonic one, was 20-something years ago to a Jewish woman that was doomed to failure; he drinks alcohol because it is his symptom not his disease, and took up the law due to an act of depraved vandalism he participated in as a teenager. More than anything, he is a thinker, not a feeler, in Jungian terms, his analyst, the attractive Johanna von Haller tells him. He promptly falls in love with her, but just like his previous romance, she remains inaccessible to him due to their professional relationship.The novel is also a social commentary on the wealthy class in Canada, the one-percent who only have first world problems to deal with. Problems such as researching pedigree and finding out to one’s horror that a founding ancestor in Canada was a barmaid who had a child out of wedlock and fled to the colonies rather than sink into a life of prostitution and poverty back home. David also wonders whether this illegitimate strain continues into his generation and whether he is the love-child of his father’s best friend, Dunstan Ramsay (the central character in the first novel in this trilogy, The Fifth Business). And why did his father duplicitously introduce him to sex with a wealthy divorcee (remember that solo sex adventure?) to get him off onto becoming a man? Given that this book was written in the 1960s, I was struck by the number of words that have now gone out of circulation for their politically inappropriate use: “Indians” (indigenous), “Hit the Nigger in the Eye” (a carnival game), “Orientals” (East Asians) among others.With about eighty percent of this book being spent on the analyst’s couch, Davies gets to philosophize along the way:“Is greater freedom another form of servitude?”“Fanaticism is the overcompensation for doubt.”“To be rich is to be a special kind of person. You have to discover your own truths and make your own rules. Those of the middle class will trip you up.”While we spend a lot of time with David and Dr. von Haller, other characters are rather sketchily drawn, and this is one of the shortcomings of the book, for the focus on the Jungian analysis neglects other novelistic treatments. Magnus Eisengrim and Liesl appear only at the very end of the novel, and although the latter plays a pivotal part in David’s cure, the former is just a name. However, I’m told that Davies was saving Magnus for a starring role in Book Three of the trilogy.And talking about the cure, Jungian style, David has to first navigate through identifying the archetypes in his life and interpreting his dreams with the help of Dr. von Haller. Therefore, we get to meet his Anima, Shadow, Friend, Magus, Troll, and Persona. Recognition and acceptance are the first steps towards healing and by the time he gets to this point, David has lost many of his rough edges. Finally, in a metaphoric journey through a cave in a mountain with Liesl for company, and which resembles a new birth, David emerges a new man, even coated in shit for having experienced Feeling for the first time in his life—aka fear—and lost control of his sphincter muscle!Not all the answers in David’s life are revealed, but he has made a start.

In the privileged corner we have Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, and the fictional Patriarch known only as Father and who is the owner of a flags and fireworks company; for the underprivileged we have Harry Houdini (famous but smarting that he was considered blue-collar fare), Tateh the Jewish silhouette artist and his daughter, and the black man, Coalhouse Walker II, around whom most of the fictional story swivels. For socialists we have Emma Goldman, for revolutionaries we have Emiliano Zapata and the fictional brother-in-law of Father, known only as Mother’s Younger Brother who graduates from fireworks to firebombs and who is accredited with designing most of today’s modern weaponry.Life is ticking along until Mother finds a baby buried in her garden, still alive. The find leads to the discovery of the mother of the child, both of whom are adopted by the patrician white family. The father of the child, Coalhouse, finally deigns to reveal himself and visit; upwardly mobile, well dressed and driving a Model T Ford, he starts the wooing process of the mother of his child in style, impressing even the host white family. Then a bunch of undisciplined white firemen decide to rough up Coalhouse and his car, and the sparks fly. Coalhouse is a man of principle; he demands that his car be repaired and the Fire Chief be fired. American Justice in the first decade of the 20th century did not put much store in black people’s rights, and Coalhouse descends into a spiral of disaster, until he decides to take the law into his hands and strike at the symbol of white capitalism: J.P. Morgan.This really is a story about America. Of the Underdog fighting the Overlords. Of the American Dream of rising from rags to riches, just as Tateh does when he hits rock bottom – he just re-invents himself, cloaks himself with a pedigree and uses raw talent to climb the economic and social ladder. It is the story of the wealthy building monuments to themselves, and of the poor wanting to scale them or pull them down. It is the story of social hierarchies: even Father is unable to get to the North Pole because chief expeditioner Peary has to get there first; no matter how daring his tricks, Houdini realizes how small he is in the presence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; and no matter how much he is in the right, Coalhouse cannot get anyone to take his case, because he is a black man. It is also about human need transcending artificial barriers of class: during his solitary sojourn in the North Pole, Father has sex with an Eskimo woman although he is revolted that these women “push back” during intercourse; Younger Brother ditches the trappings of his privilege to join the revolutionaries. The most intriguing person for me was the narrator – who is this guy who seems to be in the head of every character? Is he the only son of Father and Mother, the little boy who is described often but who never utters a word? But how does the child know about his parent’s afternoon coital habits or what goes on in everyone’s heads? Doctorow has created an omniscient narrator who is also an intimate player in the drama, yet we don’t quite know who he is.Also, a note on style: short, descriptive, and dramatic sentences make this book come alive. Horses explode in the heat. And Younger Brother’s explosive orgasm when he spies Emma Goldman massaging his love interest Evelyn Nesbit is to die for.A thoroughly engaging book told in a novel way....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 05, 2022","Dec 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175675.Ragtime

Fugui lives a licentious and irresponsible life as a young man living with his parents. He rides on the backs of prostitutes in front of his father-in-law’s house (riding on someone’s back is the only form of transportation in this place if there were no oxen). His once-prosperous family is likened to an ox reduced to a sheep and then to a chicken by Fugui’s and his father’s gambling. He is a cruel man, kicking his pregnant wife, Jiazhen, and getting her to walk miles home when she comes to rescue him from a gambling den. He loses the entire farm that night.The penitent Fugui’s life of struggle begins at that moment of loss and traverses through being kidnapped to serve in the Nationalist army under horrible conditions, being liberated by the Communists and given safe passage home (I thought there was a bit of propaganda here), to the deaths of his family under the ravages of time and the tough circumstances of farming and changing political forces. Fugui’s chronicle spans the end of the Sino-Japanese war, the Communist Revolution, the Long March, Land Reform, the Cultural Revolution, and the dawning of State Capitalism.-        His take on Communism: “The village is setting up a communal dining hall. Smash your pots and nobody will have to worry about cooking at home anymore. If you’re hungry, just pick yourself up and head on over to the dining hall. We’ve got fish and meat—so much you’ll choke to death!”-        On the Cultural Revolution: a time of violence and inversion of the social order -        On Chairman Mao: “We were just your average everyday folk. It wasn’t that we didn’t care about national issues, it was simply that we didn’t understand that kind of stuff. All it took was one word from the higher-ups and we’d all think and do whatever they wanted.”He faces irony at every turn: losing the farm saves his life later when landowners are executed; his son donates blood to save a life and loses his; the daughter Fugui tries to give away for adoption turns out to be the saviour of the family; the deformed son-in-law turns out to be a godsend. But just as much as God sends, God takes away.The women in the family are the true heroes: ailing wife Jiazhen and mute daughter Fengshia embody the novel’s title To Live. They struggle to keep on going, whatever the circumstances, and Fugui picks up their baton after his life’s losses teach him valuable lessons: “In my younger days I wandered amuck, At middle age, I wanted to stash everything in a trunk. And now that I’m old I’ve become a monk. It’s better to live an ordinary life. If you go on striving for this and that, you’ll end up paying with your life.”The author claims he was inspired to write this novel after listening to the American song, “Old Black Joe.” Even though Joe and Fugui are culturally, racially, and geographically poles apart, their essential humanity unites them, and that powerful message, that “we are all one” is what endears this book to us....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2022","Nov 27, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8280609-to-live

This collection may not be America’s best, but it seems to be the best in a year when we were pre-occupied with a pandemic.As with any collection, there are strong and weak stories. I won’t waste my time on the weak ones but will call out my top 5 in the order in which they appear in the collection:“The Apartment” - the conceit of a reverse annuity mortgage, or viager, seems to be popular (check out the Maggie Smith film My Old Lady, on which this story could be based for all I know). But what happens when the sure-bet does not work and the viager becomes an albatross?“Sibling Rivalry” – a sci-fi scenario when robots (called Supers) have become too dangerous and are incarcerated, and when Synths (lab-manufactured children) are better in a one-child mandated society. Yet, the Synths have the free-will to decide whether they will throw in their lot with the Supers or with their human manufacturers. I liked the Cookies – eavesdropping devices used by extreme helicopter parents to monitor their children – not unlike the cookies that infect our computers today.“This is Pleasure” – in the era of #MeToo, a publisher who did not respect social and sexual boundaries with colleagues in his industry, faces ruin. Written from the male and female perspective, including that of the accused, one feels empathy for the publisher who reminisces, “We belonged to a generation that valued freedom and honesty, above politeness.” “Octopus VII” – the conflict between earning a living and creating art – we all face this. Alas when one is young, like the protagonist sculptor in this story, and a long future needs to be provided for, money trumps art. It happened to me, what about you?“Enlightenment” – An aging, celebrated, closet-homosexual university professor has a brief flowering with a young student who wants to follow in his footsteps. The professor wants to scream out, “Don’t – I hated Harvard. Look how lonely I am!” but do the young ever listen?The stories roam from the US mainland to Alaska, to Venezuela, to Europe, to China, and into the future. Some are based on real-life historical characters, and some on myth. The styles and literary forms are varied. However, beginning the collection with a rather difficult to comprehend magic realism story almost led me to casting the book aside. The stories should have been grouped in reverse order, for the later stories had a more concrete form than the earlier ones. Other peeves that bothered me were:1.	Many of the stories took a long time to get into focus, for the writers came at their stories from odd angles.2.	The twenty-page average story length made for some overwriting, especially glaring in short story writing where every word needs to count.3.	Many of the stories were so open-ended that I wondered why they were even written. In our Age of the Shortened Attention Span, the short story has got a bad rap because of its inconclusiveness. We don’t need all loose ends tied up, but at least show us some light at the end of the tunnel. Especially helpful are the notes at the end of the book by the individual authors on how they came to write these stories and what they were trying to accomplish – this was the most valuable part of the book for me, for it put some method behind the madness that is creative writing. Whether the authors succeeded in their goals, or not, is another story – you decide!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,not setnot set,"Nov 23, 2022not set","Nov 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48932355-the-best-american-short-stories-2020

Her life story is episodic, some incidents are pulled from memory and are therefore sketchy (the Dubai of the 1980s she describes is not the same place I lived in, but then I wasn’t a refugee), and at other times is full of gaps, chronologically. But her focus is on the refugee-experience: when she was a refugee, when she is interacting with refugees after having crossed over to the other side, when she is describing the stories of select refugees, or when she is reflecting on the plight of refugees in general.The biggest loss to the refugee is that of time. No school, no ability to work, and being restricted to a camp while in Refugee Limbo. Time is lost at border crossings that have to be attempted several times before a boatload gets through. Time is lost waiting for a case to be heard – sometimes refugees go mad, make mistakes that compromise their case, or commit suicide. Time is lost to build a new career in the host country when the old qualifications from the home country do not count anymore; despite her Iranian PhD, Dina’s mother has to re-invent herself many times over due to her poor English and due to the baggage of devout Christianity she embraced to shut herself off from Islamic Fundamentalists who had taken over her country. At one end of the spectrum are refugees like Kaweh who gets through the eye of the needle in England after a circuitous overland route and goes on to become a prominent refugee lawyer; at the other end is Kambiz, of the same age and who left Iran at the same time, who gets mired in the refugee pipeline in Holland for 14 years and finally sets fire to himself in Dam Square.The fear of being sent back is a constant nightmare even for naturalized refugees in their new homeland. Like Dina, they become super-achievers to keep the beast at bay. The author becomes a Tae Kwon Do champion, starves herself to achieve the desired weight category in her sport, and trains until she is black and blue. She graduates from Princeton and gets an MBA from Harvard. She lives in Holland and then in England, always on the move. When she travels to a refugee camp in Greece as a volunteer in 2016, she realizes that the modern refugee has different priorities than her batch had – WiFi is the most sought-after commodity now – but that the journey, and the acceptance, is harder as the world is more awash in refugees than in her time. She spends a lot of time re-iterating that getting one’s story right is key. A lie uttered at the beginning of the process, whether by omission or commission, is hard to erase later, because the authorities are looking for any excuse to decline, not accept. And you must believe your story, whether it is exaggerated or not. Embellishing is okay, just stick to it. “Facts are the least believable. It is fiction’s job to fix them in the service of truth” – a lesson she learns when she flees her first marriage to become a writer and join the Iowa Writer’s alumni – is also applicable to refugees. I found her level of human knowledge, honed in the crucible of the refugee experience, to be remarkable for a 38-year-old. Here are a few insights:1.	The refugee will take years to fully convert to the new country, there are no instant epiphanies.2.	The host countries absorb the refugees’ talents and claim them for their own.3.	Those with chameleon-like natures (i.e., adaptable, like Dina) are the most likely to succeed in the refugee journey.4.	Refugees invent stories to fit eligible categories for acceptance (i.e., gay, Christian etc.) and later get caught out under interrogation.5.	The Americans and British want undamaged goods, not flawed individuals, while some refugees are prone to damage themselves to release stored energy and frustration.The one point I found lacking in this book, is that Dina too falls into the trap of beating up the host countries for their unwillingness and inability to improve their refugee intake systems and processes to absorb the burgeoning hordes of refugees emanating from countries in political, ecological, or economic turmoil. But she doesn’t aim enough barbs at those dysfunctional countries, Iran included, for their barbaric practices that jettison their best and brightest.

At 14, he is in love with Hans, son of the town’s industrialist, the blue-eyed, popular, athletic, all-star. At 16, he is in love with Inge, daughter of the town’s doctor, another blue-eyed, blonde beauty. But these infatuations fade as Tonio discovers his real self, the product of a traditional German father and a foreign artist mother (like Mann was): he is destined to be a poet, and the artistic life demands being set apart from humanity, not belonging, and damned to a solitary existence. “Literature is a curse, not a calling. One who lives does not work. One must be indifferent to life in order to be a creator.”At 30, having achieved some literary accomplishment, he seeks out a painter friend, Lisabeta, living close by in Munich, to act as his sounding board. He bemoans the ascetic artistic life and yearns to live. She holds the opposite view that poets are saints, that the literary art is the noblest manifestation of the human mind. Unconvinced and unreconciled, he travels north to Denmark on a short break from his gruelling work schedule, stopping in the town he lived in as a child. He makes the predictable discovery we all make – you can’t go back, and home is no longer home—his old home is now a public library—the authorities mistake him for a swindler working those parts of the country and want to arrest him. Leaving his town after embarrassingly proving his identity, he continues his travels north. At a border town, he runs into a group of tourists, and in their midst is Hans and Inge, presumably now a couple, and the embodiment of those who live life and do not waste time documenting it or converting it into art. The finale comes when Tonio is faced with either re-introducing himself to his old friends and joining in the merriment of the dance, or slinking away unrecognized to his customary world of the solitary artist.Although Tonio springs from the bourgeoise world of his father and the bohemian one of his mother, he is trapped between these worlds, living the life of the artist while desiring the pleasure of living, and thus sub-optimizing in both directions.

Stalin attends the composer’s version of Lady Macbeth in Mitsensk in 1936 and walks out of the theatre because the music is deemed formalist, pro-capitalist, and not “of the people.” An apology is called for, which is provided, yet Shoshtakovich stands outside his apartment by the elevator each night, to spare his young family the horror of his arrest, expecting to be “disappeared” like many other intellectuals and artists under the Cult of the Personality. His work to that point, which included four symphonies and other minor operettas, are made to disappear too. It is only when his interrogator vanishes (himself the victim of a purge) that the pressure eases somewhat. The threat of a rising Nazi Germany also helps his career; his Fifth Symphony becomes a hit for being more conservative and his subsequent work takes on an anti-Fascist tone.The story flash-forwards to 1948 and to a Soviet cultural delegation visiting the USA, among whom is a reluctant Shoshtakovich, urged to attend by the Power (Stalin) himself. The composer’s pro-Stalin speeches are written for him and read out by an interpreter, and have no relationship to his convictions. Shoshtakovich realizes why he was spared the first time – he was earmarked as a poster-boy for Communism and “was not to be touched.” However, the take-over of his soul, by the takeover of his voice, is almost complete. Add to this, the old persecution returns when the dreaded Zhdanov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, accuses certain composers— Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovitch among them—of formalism. Shashtakovitch is forced to appease his accusers by writing music that is popular and positive.The last flash-forward is to the 1960s, Stalin is dead, Shoshtakovich has been rehabilitated again only to have Khrushchev (the Corncob) pressuring him to join the Communist Party in exchange for being made the Chairman of the Union of Composers. At this point, in failing health and weakened by compromising on his principles all these years for the sake of survival, he acquiesces and enjoys the perks of office – a dacha, an apartment, a Russian model car, a chauffer, and a second wife. However, his role-induced accusations of prominent dissidents like Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov damages his spirit further.Written in short vignettes, Barnes gets under the skin of the great composer and portrays him as the sheltered prodigy with two older sisters and an overbearing mother, as a nervous man later in life who wears garlands of garlic to ward of infection from typhus during his travels, who likes the symmetry of sound, including the simultaneous chiming of the different clocks in his house, a musician who composes against the grain but who is forced back time and time again into conformance by the politics of his country. Some great quotes pepper the book:“Sarcasm is irony that has lost its soul.”“Art for art’s sake” (Democracy) vs. “art belongs to the people” (Communism)“Writers were condemned on Page 1 of Pravda, Composers on Page 3”“Words cannot stain music”“Music is not like Chinese eggs and must be performed when created. It does not store well.”We are also left with great imagery throughout. The one that stuck with me was the synchronized clinking of three vodka glasses on a remote railway platform, a musical note to transcend the noise of time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2022","Oct 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25912206-the-noise-of-time

He is a respected doctor and inveterate womanizer. She is “a baby in the bullrushes” who came into his life and stayed, even though she got the flu the first night they went to bed. Tereza is traumatized by an erratic mother who discusses her sex life, walks about naked, drops her false teeth, and farts – all in public. All Tereza can manage is a waitressing job and then one as a photographer – yet the latter gets her into trouble with the Communists when she starts taking pictures that are rather kept hidden. When Czechoslovakia is invaded in 1968 in the aftermath of the Prague Spring, life becomes restrictive, secretive, and depressing with spies everywhere, people vanishing, and others willingly asking to be shot rather than face a life without freedom. The couple flee to Zurich, but return because Tereza is unable to live in the lightness of freedom, and Tomas is unable to live without her.The second couple is Sabina, an occasional mistress of Tomas, a painter who has also moved to Zurich in light of the Soviet invasion, and Franz, a promising Swiss academic, who is in a loveless marriage with a socialite wife. Franz arranges to take Sabina to conferences overseas because he couldn’t bear to make love to her close to his family. He envies the conflicts of Czechoslovakia and looks down on his sterile life in academia, while she cannot bear to be saddled with becoming his wife should he abandon his marriage.The book alternates between these two couples and constantly switches POV from man to woman in its seven parts. Despite occasional diabolical glimpses of life behind the Iron Curtain, the action is totally focussed on the internal lives of the four, in particular on their sexual, emotional, and psychological lives. Tomas has trouble keeping tabs of who he has had sexual relations with, for his liaisons are so numerous, and when he loses his job as a doctor and has to take up window cleaning, his profligacy goes into overdrive. The unnamed narrator, who treats the four characters as his clinical subjects, gets to postulate in depth on arcane subjects such as shit, kitsch, the myth of the eternal return, and the Grand March of humanity towards brotherhood, equality, and justice, and of course, on the unbearable lightness of being. He postulates that the more intense the burdens we have the more intense our experience of life. Hence, Sabina desires no involvement and lives an unattached life; Franz desires involvement, thus embraces heaviness, and volunteers to go to Cambodia to help the injured held in captivity by the Viet Cong, with disastrous results. Both Tomas and Tereza with their intense involvement in their work, his womanizing that affects them both, and their darkening country’s intrusive meddling in private lives, have the heaviest burden of all four. She constantly smells women’s crotches on his hair and drives herself mad with guilt for having brought him back behind the Curtain and to a life of career doom.The style is easy to digest, given the philosophical load of the book: short chapters, some even only a page in length. I wondered about balance: a dog gets a whole chapter dedicated to his end but the four humans exit the stage in toss-away sentences, making it sound as if Kundera is not interested in death so much as in what leads us to it and our last moments before it.Since I mentioned the philosophical gems and observations of human behaviour.

I’m the same age at the time of this reading, and I have had many 40-plus year re-unions that have only affirmed to me that “nothing is the way they used to be” anymore.The three buddies: Lincoln, realtor and businessman, married and harried with a lawyer wife and six children; Teddy, bi-polar, small press publisher, never-married, wanting to write his own book and live in a monastery; Mickey, big, talented musician, ex-draft dodger, with a hair-trigger temper and many secrets. The meeting place is Martha’s Vineyard, at Lincoln’s mother’s cottage that he is contemplating selling after the re-union. The three men are haunted by the woman they all loved in their own way, Jacy, mercurial, beautiful, engaged to another man she didn’t love, who spent a similar weekend with them at this cottage in 1971, before she vanished from the face of the earth.The men are there to find or provide answers to what happened to their lives, and to Jacy. Was she murdered? By whom? When the POV narrative switches only between Lincoln and Teddy in alternating chapters, when red-herring Mason Troyer, Lincoln’s neighbour, is introduced as a bad guy with a history of abusing women, when retired police chief Coffin picks up the cold case again, and when Mickey is only given his own POV chapter two-thirds of the way down the book, you kinda know where this “mystery” is heading, although the outcome is not as anyone would imagine.Russo gets to dole out a lot of kitchen-table wisdom:1.	Sixty-six-year-old men suffer creeping pains – Lincoln’s stiff lower back that only loosens as the day progresses – heck, I have those!2.	Re-union weekends cannot be recreated. Each one is a different experience with different people, even though they have the same names and have merely got older.3.	Couples coming from different social classes have a tough go of making a relationship work.4.	Americans now describe themselves as either Republican or Democrat.5.	Obama was dreaming if he thought the world was a rational place where everyone acted out of goodwill.6.	Sons live in the shadows of their fathers’ spoken or unspoken admonishment of “You are not good enough.”7.	How wrong we are in our assumptions. We default to the negative over the positive. Even the police do that.8.	Old age is defeat, disappointment, and exhaustion masquerading as wisdom.Characters are well painted - excessively, I thought, down to their daily rituals and pet peeves. Driblets of new information are doled out in consequent chapters, some simply tossed out in throwaway lines amidst heavy head-talk. I almost missed some of these important story markers because I was skipping. Why was I skipping? – because this story is told mainly in the heads of the narrators – swaths of conjecture, introspection, and memory clog the narrative, told in complex and sometimes confusing sentences that do not flow. And the dialogue, when it occurs, is oblique, and sometimes superfluous. Those were my beefs with this novel. What happened to good old “show and tell”? Thankfully, after Mickey gets his chapter, the book comes alive and is unputdownable from then on. Going back to the past to unearth skeletons can change our life trajectories – that is the outcome of this book. However, Russo ties up all the loose ends and places everyone in a better place – another beef, for real-life is hardly that rosy....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2022","Oct 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44037144-chances-are

The only way to resurrect his career is to write a no-holds barred novel about his secret passion for Poppy, 66 and still stunning, if he can get his hands on her, that is.What follows is a fragmented romp of a tale, which only conspires to send Guy further down the rabbit hole. The world of the writer that he paints is the most depressing (and real, although many of us do not want to admit it):•	The writer is facing “death by creeping invisibility.”•	The comedians have taken over. Their scripts fair better than satiric novels.•	Novels are born out of misery. The impulse to write is to alter the conditions of one’s childhood, not to falsify them.•	Writers do not sleep with competitors’ wives because it gives the competitors material for their next novel.•	Writing is a profession with no justification or employment.•	Writers suffer constipation – too much sitting and too much stress.•	If Henry Miller showed up tomorrow, he would be shown the door by a publisher.•	The future will be one with no readers and all writers.•	Writers need a person to obsess over, vilify, and write about even though that person is not always obvious in the writing. Guy’s is Vanessa, and Vanessa’s is Poppy.Enough said. Despite his woes, Guy continues to plod at his novel, until Poppy is out of reach; then he switches over to writing about his younger brother Jeffrey, heir to the family clothing shop, who has apparently slept with both Vanessa and Poppy and is now dying of a brain tumor – do you believe it? Guy uses skillful wordplay to question this: “Jeffrey lies, and then lies with Poppy and Vanessa.” In fact, word play is everywhere: “he stroke she,” “less, luss, loss,” “twit and blag” (this last from his publisher referring to tweeting and blogging that is taking the world by storm and relegating long-form literature to second class status).The story is stitched together through anecdotes: from a trip to the Adelaide Festival and a detour to Monkey Mia to see non-existent monkeys, from various meetings with publishers and agents, from Guy’s meetings with readers, and from his visits to the extended family in Cheshire. And from the many skirmishes between him and Vanessa as he struggles to start his next novel and she struggles to begin her first one. However, when she does produce that debut effort—only made possible when they take a short separation from each other and after she is able to let go of writing only about herself—it sends her to the top of the pile, including a movie deal, and sends him into a nervous breakdown – perhaps another bullet I should add to the above list: do not have spouses in the same profession.From the depths of his despair, Guy learns something about his wife and mother-in-law – they weren’t such good friends as he saw them, but they had his back, and through them he finds the true subject matter for his next book, allowing him to turf out all prior attempts.I’d like to think that Jacobson is the British equivalent of Philip Roth, not so frenetic and obsessive, but funnier and milder in a stiff upper-lippish way. And now that Roth is gone, I hope this septuagenarian sticks around a little longer and churns out a few more books, like Ableman suddenly did when he got his second wind, thanks to the good women in his life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2022","Sep 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13394634-zoo-time

These wartime articles are the best ones in this collection. The fear of losing everything: the Empire, his library, his way of life, his ability to think and express freely that would be muzzled under a Nazi regime is palpable and, especially for a writer, takes on nightmarish proportions, which Forster tries to face with equanimity. He laments, not so much for the established writer whose work is already out in the world, but for the writer of tomorrow still gathering grist for their mill, who would be subject to censorship of the Fascists should they cross the Channel. His solution to building a great civilization is not Love, but Tolerance, the ability to accommodate the Other.Several articles tackle other subjects of art apart from prose literature: music, painting, and poetry. As a person who played piano, his dissertations on music are quite deep (for me), but he is a novice at painting and it shows. Forster’s poetry s, mostly of poets from the 18th and 19th centuries, are incisive, and he quotes from the ed works quite extensively. He dips into Milton in the 17th century and likens the censorship of that time to that of the Nazi variety in his present. There are also many essays written on lesser-known personalities, some known to him, and about places where he had lived (London, Cambridge, Abinger) or travelled to during his life (India, South Africa, the USA et al). I found the travelogues not as revelatory and only skimming the surface.Forster was a thinker, and some of his philosophical observations bear repeating:1.	“Lord, I disbelieve. Help thou, my unbelief,” – the prayer of the intellectual.2.	“Spend your money, don’t save it, spend it on art” – his exhortation to citizens of wartime England.3.	If Science could “discover” instead of “apply,” we would be better off.4.	Life has no order, art has.5.	“Think before you speak” – criticism’s motto. “Speak before you think” – creation’s motto.6.	Knowledge must not only be protected from the gangster; it must also be protected from the crowd.7.	“Opinion is but knowledge in the making” – this one borrowed from Milton. Forster’s criticisms and observations on literary personalities interested me. Virginia Woolf is described as a poet trying to be a writer and hence weak on plot and character. Voltaire is compared to Emperor Frederik of Prussia – a man of truth vs. a man of power. So is Andre Gide the humanist compared to Stefan George the authoritarian. A book is likened to a church – you enter it alone and are awakened to its resonance with our lives. There you are – a miscellany of writing from an eminent writer, for many of these pieces were extracted from speeches given at prominent lectures at home and abroad. As for the unusual title, democracy gets two cheers for its accommodation of variety (diversity) and its openness to criticism. Given that democracy is the least imperfect of political systems we have still to invent, the third cheer is withheld.However, although he was liberal in his criticism of others, Forster admits that criticism of his own writing did not work for him, and he often did not take the advice offered. “They said I killed off too many of my characters abruptly. How could I change that? It was a hallmark of my work.”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2022","Sep 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1082394.Two_Cheers_for_Democracy

Interspersed with the fragmentary and circulatory details from Amis’s life is his advice on the life and craft of writing, particularly fiction, which I found the most useful. Some nuggets of wisdom:1.	There are A novels (story, character, phycological insights etc.) and B novels (language only). B novels are now dead. (Examples of B novels are Ulysses, Finnegan’s Wake and Clockwork Orange) 2.	Life writing is the new genre – social realism is the leader of the pack.3.	Use the “mind’s ear” to get grammar correct.4.	The hidden work of uneventful days” – aka the life of a writer.5.	Go for rhythm in the sentence, don’t repeat a syllable in a sentence.6.	“Elegant Variation” is the need to vary phrases and words to avoid repetition.7.	Ninety percent of short stories are slices of life.8.	 The pre-occupation of the writer must be words.9.	Fiction gave way to non-fiction after 9/11. Poetry too is a casualty to the speeding of time.10.	The unreliable narrator is dead. Despite the rambling and colliding story lines, Amis provides copious footnotes that are sometimes more interesting than the main narrative. They provide ample proof of how well connected he was in the journalistic and literary firmaments, having access to the luminaries of his time, some becoming personal friends and rending him heartbroken when they passed on, often with him at their deathbeds.Two of his closest friends were Saul Bellow and Christopher Hitchens, and Amis covers his encounters and discussions with them in great detail, full of intellectual banter. Both are characters in their own right: Bellow the debonair octogenarian on his fifth wife, still fertile but losing his mind to Alzheimer’s; Hitchens is the hard-drinking, hard-working contrarian journalist and public speaker who defies and denies God even when he is dying of cancer. Theirs are long-drawn out deaths, and Amis is there throughout, facing up to his own impending mortality in the process.The Philip Larkin/ Phoebe Phelps episodes are juicy, and Amis uses clever wordplay to dance around the questions he raises: Did father Kingsley sleep with Phoebe while Martin was her boyfriend? Did Larkin have an affair with Martin’s mother, and is the dear misogynistic and racist Philip literally Martin’s “father figure”? Despite all their literary bravado, Larkin and Hitch, just like Martin’s other sex-charged writer hero D.H. Lawrence, are relatively subdued and reticent on the sex meter, while the Amises, father and son, more than compensate for their colleagues and are not afraid to brag about their amatory exploits in this book. All these illustrious writers are also mortally scared of death. Inside Story seems to be Martin’s attempt at coming to terms with this ultimate inevitability.I thought the book was too long – much of it being indulgence by an eloquent writer appearing to exorcise his demons by exercising in wordplay. And yet, Amis is endearing to writers like me when he says, “So politely ignore all warnings of ‘cultural appropriation’ and the like. Go where your pen takes you. Fiction is freedom, and freedom is indivisible.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Sep 13, 2022","Sep 13, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51199459-inside-story

He sets out to secure food (mussels, seaweed, and anemones) and fresh water from a cave that collects rain, and he names discreet outcrops by place or street names to mark out his dwelling place and make it comfortable until help is surely to arrive.The isolation sends him into flashbacks of his life, to people he had loved, lost, and hurt, and to life aboard his ship. Survival soon becomes a struggle despite his determination. He suffers food poisoning due to constipation and improvises an enema with his lifejacket to relieve himself. He uses the tinfoil from a candy wrapper to create a reflection from the sun at the highest part of the island and signal passing ships, and he lays out rows of seaweed in a giant SOS to attract aircraft.Then the isolation starts getting to him. We see him struggling between sanity and insanity and this is the pivotal point of the book – is he more productive when he is insane or vice versa? Lines like “there is no centre of sanity in madness” and “there is always madness, a crevice in the centre of the rock” give you food for thought. When a giant storm blows in and hits the rock full force, it is a time of reckoning for Pincher. And that infamous last line in the book makes you go back and examine what has transpired thus far and put everything into a different perspective.While the writing is elegant and allegorical, you have to wade through the first 70 pages of being in Pincher’s head while he battles the ocean to get to land, and once there, you have to wait until he is able to summon the strength to stand up. This is the most difficult and boring part of the book— understandable in retrospect, in light of that final punch line—and it proves to me that books about solitary characters don’t work that well. That is probably why Defoe had his Friday, Rice-Burroughs his Jane, and God His Eve. At least, Pincher had flashbacks to when he interacted with others, and that relieved the tedium for him, and for me.The end left me breathless and cheated, as if the author had lured us into an alternate reality and then let us know this fact only via that damnable last line. It certainly left me pondering about the afterlife and wondering whether that is a place I would really like to end up in, or even believe in. Was Pincher alive or dead all the time? Was the rock a proxy for Purgatory, or Hell, or, God forbid, Heaven? Should we fear sleep? As Pincher says, “Sleep is consenting to die, to go into that great unconsciousness.” Certainly, a thought-provoking book.Spoiler Alert: Don’t read that last line out of sequence!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 05, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14429.Pincher_Martin

From his original destination of Pola, which ends up being sterile and boring, he crosses over to Venice, a city that had once not been a good experience for him. He takes a beach-side room on the Lido, across the lagoon from the city. There, he sees and falls in love with a 14-year-old Polish boy, Tadzio, who is vacationing with his nun-like sisters, stern mother, and governess. The women in the entourage look nothing like the boy who is a picture of perfection and beauty, and one wonders whether Aschenbach is in love with the concept of beauty rather then its embodiment in Tadzio. Is Tadzio a reflection of Aschenbach’s younger self before he embarked on a life of sensual denial? Has Tadzio therefore unlocked the door to life long shut by the older man in pursuit of his art? Mann imbues Aschenbach with some of his own family traits: a father who was German, disciplined to the point of being inartistic, and a mother from a southern country who was bohemian. This duality plays in Aschenbach, who like Mann asserts that the artist must give up on life in order to create art. However, life wins over, and very soon, the fictional author is obsessed with Tadzio, following him everywhere in the resort, following but not conversing or engaging, other than through surreptitious looks that seem to say a lot.When malaria hits the city, the guests empty out, and Aschenbach is faced with the decision whether to leave or not. He starts and stops, and is relieved with his decision to stay, for it prolongs contact with the boy. Then Tadzio and his family make arrangements to leave too as the epidemic intensifies, and Aschenbach is faced with another dilemma. “We poets cannot take the road to beauty without having Eros join us,” and his conclusion for letting Eros in has damning consequences.Although the style is narrative-heavy, Mann brilliantly conveys the philosophy, drive, and fragility of the writer. Lines like “The mature writer pursues dignity over skepticism and irony,” “Art is a heightened form of existence – it gives deeper pleasures, it consumes more fiercely, it marks its servants faces with imaginary adventures and fatigue,” and “Everything that comes into being, comes despite something else,” stuck with me.Many have argued that nothing much happens in this novella. I would disagree. If you consider the emancipation of Aschenbach from his cloister to his embracing of the sensory life and thereby paying the price for it, a lot does take place in this short novella, although much of that transition is cloaked in beautiful prose that could be enjoyed for its own value....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 31, 2022","Aug 31, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53061.Death_in_Venice

Three story lines intersect constantly: one is set in a bleak distant future on an overpopulated planet (35 billion inhabitants) made of the huddled grimy masses who keep the wheels of industry grinding for the “one percent” who live in luxury inside climate controlled domes; another is set either in the past or the future, a place called Anterwold, where life is medieval and based on rules, tradition, and superstitions bound up with the Story, a sort of Bible on the origins and projected end of that world; the third is firmly set between 1938 and 1960 and has the shadings of a cold-war spy thriller. Access between these worlds to select individuals is enabled by a time machine, and its later derivative, an alternative reality machine. Sometimes these machines don’t work as designed, adding complexity to an already complicated plot.In a nutshell, an alternate reality building project in the future world, spearheaded by a manic pill-popping psycho-mathematician, Angela Meerson, goes awry and becomes a time machine instead. Angela hides the data of her work and transports herself back to Europe in 1938-60 to perfect her machine, while Oldmanter, the predatory business mogul in this future world who is intent on colonizing new alternate realities for profit, sees the time machine as an enabler of his plans. What results is the tug of war for control of this invention between the good and bad guys, with some surprising revelations along the way.The author uses literary allusions galore. There are shades of The Time Machine, Alice in Wonderland, Hansel & Gretel, Narnia, Robin Hood, and the Book of Revelations. Some characters parallel Elizabeth I, Ulysses, and God. In fact, Iain Pears takes a stand for good and evil by equating Henry Lytton the author of Anterwold to the God who will come in judgment on the Last Day through a mysterious light (i.e. the alternative reality machine), while Oldmanter is cast as the Devil. The central premise—the future is determined by the past, and the past by the future, and the present is nothing—gives us an anchor to cling to as these complex but intriguing plotlines weave their way through the novel. Given the amount of world-building required to conjure up, not one but, three worlds, there is a lot of telling, and clumps of backstory are dumped on the reader from time to time. The constant switching between worlds and their evolving stories also interrupts flow, and I had to skip back to catch up on the dropped threads. And yes, there are lots of plot inconsistencies, but given my fevered attempts to catch up with the three fast-switching story strands, I wondered whether it was my own aging brain that was the cause. I also had difficulty keeping track of the multitude of characters, many of whom were one-dimensional; and when they kept appearing in the different worlds with different names, this complicated the equation even further.The ending was a surprise and left me thinking long after closing the book. Did good triumph over evil or the other way around? Which world started which? What was the past, present, and future? If the past was the future, had we regressed? Or was progress only to be found in going back to the past, to a simpler time when we were ruled by tradition and the Story? That certainly was a better time than the sterile one inhabited by Oldmanter and his crew.

Dostoevsky also compounds this jumble of names by setting many crowd scenes where the polyphony of voices adds to the confusion.In a nutshell, this story is set in the 1860s, soon after the serfs were liberated in Russia and when nihilist cells were proliferating with intent to destroy the aristocracy and the established society. The book swings between aristocratic and nihilist life, and the intersection of the two when key characters are present in both camps.Stephan Trofimovich, a sometime writer, gambler, and former university professor (and a proxy for the author himself who was also addicted to gambling), is living in the aristocratic home of widow Varvara Petrovna where he has tutored her only son Nikolai. Stephan and Varvara have a love-hate relationship; he is an atheist and a liberal, while she is a traditionalist. They are also a reflection of the polarization taking place within the Russian aristocracy at the time between those who were embracing liberal ideas from Western Europe and those who were traditional Slavists (i.e. those who supported the Tsar, the Orthodox Church, and serfdom) The couple start a literary journal that founders and hold literary salons to keep up appearances with the gentry.Their respective sons Pyotr (Stephan’s) and Nikolai (Vavara’s) are pure evil. Pyotr is the head of a cell of nihilist plotters distributing insurrectionist tracts across the land, and Nikolai is a serial adulterer, leaving every female character we encounter in the book either heart-broken or pregnant. Their respective cell-mates are a bunch of amateurs who cave when the going gets tough. Two from their midst, Kirilov and Shatov, who worked together in America, are marked for punishment, for they are supposedly about to betray the others. In fact, Pyotr believes that the “Cell of Five” should murder one of their own, so that they would be bound even more closely together by that deadly secret. The plot meanders through early sections featuring life in the aristocracy, and into later dramatic scenes involving the nihilists. There are just too many characters that Dostoevsky tries to embrace and some get only a passing reference. Much of the dialogue is oblique, crises are implied but never described, and references are made to events in obscure fashion, as if much has happened offstage. In fact, the animosity between members of the Cell of Five seems to have taken place in America and Switzerland – scenes we do not get to see. One whole chapter, “At Tikhon’s,” where Nikolai confesses his profligate life to a retired bishop, was added back to the end of the tome in the translation I read, for it had been deleted from previous versions, and it clarified a lot for me.In typical Dostoevskyan fashion, the dialogue is muscular and frenetic. The author seems to have been writing this for serialization in a magazine and picks up the narrative wherever he last left off with no concern for continuity or balance; therefore I did not know why Stephan’s “fixed” marriage to Darya Pavlovna (Dasha) fizzled out and was never mentioned again, or when or if Nikolai called off his affair with Dasha; Matryosha, another of Nikolai’s victims, is 14-years-old in one place and 10-years-old a few days later; and although the narrator is one Anton Lavrentivitch, who is present in many of the scenes, there are other scenes described in greater detail where he is absent.The Fête organized by the Governor’s wife, replete with literary readings by Stephan and the famed writer of the upper classes, Karmazinov (a stand-in for Turgenev), is bound to end in disaster, sabotaged by the nihilists, foreshadowing what was ultimately to happen in Russia in the early 20th century when the communists took over. And then, when Pyotr puts his plans into play for cleaning up his cell, the body count starts to ramp up on both sides, but to mention who gets “offed” would amount to a spoiler. The revolutionaries, given their state of readiness though, were not ready to overthrow the aristocracy in Dostoevsky’s day.Dostoevsky also brings into focus the need and search for God in people’s lives. Some prophetic lines and descriptions illustrate this:“An atheist stands closer to a believer than an indifferent one.” – Bishop Tikhon.“I’m afraid of suicide because I’m afraid of showing magnanimity.” – Nikolai.“A nation is a nation when it has a common God,” - Shatov At the same time, pot shots are taken at organized religion: the scene with holy man Semyon Yakolovitch is ridiculously funny – it reminded me of Dostoevsky parodying Fr. Zossima in The Brothers… In fact, Demons is a humorous novel despite its dark subject matter.And for those who are wondering whether they should bother with this book, and not go direct to The Brothers Karamazov, the penultimate chapter “Conclusion” ties up quite a few loose ends for us who got stranded in Dostoevsky’s murky world of Demons. I wish I had read this book before The Brothers…, because I found I was retracing my steps over a well-worn road, but this time, the final coat of asphalt was missing....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Aug 14, 2022","Aug 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5695.Demons

The author explains his own family story in a lengthy Afterword, and the parallels with the fictional story are very strong, even down to locales and character names beginning with the same letters as their real-life equivalents. In a nutshell, Hans Van Hout, Dutch émigré to Cape Town, South Africa and later to St. John’s, Newfoundland is abusing his four daughters and a host of other vulnerable women, while his wife, Myra, supports and protects him. Hans Van Hout is the classic predator, an inveterate liar, a brag, a victim, and a professional failure. Under his ministrations, his daughters become, in age order: a nymphomaniac, a drug addict, an anorexic, and the youngest, Rachel, turns into a hypergraphic, hyperlexic, bibliomaniac – ironically, the last three are the conditions that Johnston admits to suffering from as a young man.The story is told alternatingly, from Rachel’s viewpoint and her boyfriend Wade’s (the latter being a proxy for author Wayne). Wade is preparing to become a writer by reading copious classics. Rachel is already a writer, scribbling voluminously whenever she slumps in and out of psychotic states, but she has no audience, for she does not share her work written in a reverse language called Aurellian. Interspersed with these two point-of-view (POV) narratives are sequences of poetry from Rachel’s diary called the Aurelliad and Hans’s rambling bedtime story to his daughters called the Ballad. I thought the poetry was superfluous, amateurish, and repetitive, but the author insists in his very explanatory Afterword that the Aurelliad is an attempt at self-examination on the part of Rachel and the Ballad is a form of indoctrination and self-justification on the part of Hans. There is even a chapter narrated in Hans’s POV – I guess the author ran out of the means of how to convey a crucial event in the book and needed the villain’s help.Another prominent character in absentia is Anne Frank, Rachel’s obsession, for despite her bibliomania, the only book she reads is Anne’s famous Diary, in many languages, over and over again. Anne’s Secret Annex is Rachel’s Aurellia – they are both inventing alternative realities to escape from the terrible worlds they live in. To compound things, Hans writes in his Ballad that he betrayed the Franks to the Nazis, and that he also tried to save them by revealing their hideout to the Dutch Resistance.The scenes shift between St. John’s and Cape Town, with a short transit in Amsterdam. Since the action takes place in the 1970s and ’80s, we are exposed to chilling scenes of Apartheid, viewed through the naïve eyes of Wade who has never travelled outside Newfoundland. Cape Town is beautifully painted, prejudicial warts and all, and so is St. John’s with its bitter winters that drive some people to murder.After the dramatic whodunit revelation, the story continues to meander between Rachel and Wade, and I found this part lopsided, for one of them knows the whole truth and the other only half the truth. Perhaps, this is the situation that the author lives with today with his wife, for, as the Afterword reveals, nothing of the real-life abuse has been revealed to him, although its occurrence is known, and he lives in a world of half-truth.Johnston admits the book reaches no answers on child abuse, just like Anne Frank’s Diary didn’t on the Holocaust. However, unlike the real-life sisters who chose to remain cloaked in silence, the fictional sisters in this novel are able to redress the problem with their father, even though there will be much debate among readers as to whether their actions are forgivable or not....more",Notes are private!,2,9,2,not setnot set,"Aug 04, 2022not set","Aug 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57341967-the-mystery-of-right-and-wrong

I picked up Beyond This Place, ouOf late, I have been picking up books read years ago to see if they still hold the same magic they once held for me. I picked up Beyond This Place, out of a portable community library box during my peregrinations around town, fifty years after I first read it as a teenager, and which, at the time, led me to devour all of A.J. Cronin’s major novels afterwards. Alas, the magic had evaporated this time around, although I could understand the social significance the novel may have once had. Set in the 1930’s, and published in 1950 after being serialized in Colliers, the novel artfully portrays the archaic and entrenched British customs and social hierarchies of the early twentieth century, uses outdated words and phrases (such as “queer” and “gaily”) out of present-day context, and is chock-full of page-turner chapter endings reminiscent of dime novels and magazine serializations. And yet, its message of the damning effect of the miscarriage of law and the human cost of punishment vs. rehabilitation in the British penal system is as current today as it was then.Paul Burgess, 21, stumbles on his murky past when he tries to obtain a copy of his birth certificate to apply for a summer job (birth certificates for jobs? – that archaic British custom thing!). He discovers he had a different surname at birth, and that his father, Reese Mathry, who was supposed to have died on a trip to South America, is actually serving a life-sentence in Britain for murder. Determined to find the truth, Paul delves deeper, only to discover that his father may have been framed by an ambitious prosecutor intent on making a sensational trial debut that would lead him up the legal career ladder.Paul’s search becomes an obsession and pushes him into penury, destitution, and illness on the streets of London. It is only with the help of the long-suffering Lena, the fallen woman who puritanical Paul spurns due to her “having a child out of wedlock” (more archaic British customs!), and a couple of regional press reporters who believe this scoop will take them national, that the Mathry case is re-opened to startling revelations and a new conclusion.And yet the outcome for Paul of being re-united with his father is bitter-sweet. “Let sleeping dogs lie,” has some merit here, for a lifetime of harsh punishment inflicted on a man who had a low moral compass to begin with does not reveal a Nelson Mandela-type savant – quite the opposite, in fact. There is no possible reconciliation, only a new altered reality that has to be accepted, both by the Mathry family and by the British judiciary and its 700-year old trial-by-jury system that was deemed “best in class” until its wheels fell off in this case.Despite the serious moral message, the style of writing put me off. Dickensian plot contrivances abound, information dumps are provided in photographic detail by witnesses about events that took place fifteen years earlier, help arrives at the eleventh hour (always), dying old men speak like sprightly young ones, and the omniscient narrator jumps in and out of everyone’s head rending them into caricature. I realized why Cronin’s books were made into films, for many of his scenes are cinematic. His portrayal of London, especially the murky corners of the city, are well drawn.“Let sleeping dogs lie” – I should have heeded that advice and let this book repose in its little community bookcase without picking it up, a book that, fifty ears ago, had inspired me to pursue reading more serious fiction. Like Paul discovered with his father Reese – you can’t go back to better times, you can only return to different experiences. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2022","Jul 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1458918.Beyond_This_Place

Nemirowsky gets out of her customary omniscient narrator role this time to inhabit the head of narrator Silvio, an aging landowner who has never worked his lands, but continues to sell off his inheritance parcel by parcel. He once roamed the world in search of adventure before landing back in a shack on his diminishing property. Is he running away from something or running towards it?Silvio’s extended family: cousin Helene and Francois and their children live the idyllic loving life, owning their own farm and working it efficiently. But, something lurks in the shadows – passion that cannot be expressed in this community of paysan where “Everyone lives in his own house, on his own land, distrusts his neighbours, harvests his wheat, counts his money, and doesn’t give a thought to the rest of the world.” Helene’s oldest daughter, Colette, aspires to the same happy life as her parents by marrying Jean, a staid, obliging man like her father. And yet the fire of love, that “fire in the blood,” rages in her, unquenchable by her dull husband. When Jean accidentally falls off a bridge one night and drowns, secrets emerge to wreck the idyll. Silvio is not surprised, for he has gone through this entire cycle during his youth.In fact, this is a story about the loss of youth, as much as a story of secrets. Silvio reminisces on the “love of his life,” and the “fruit of that love” – embodied in people walking about his village, people he cannot name, talk about, or betray. He tries to assuage Francois that to err is human, and to forgive is divine,” but in a land where justice and honour are still hard coded, this is a tough sell. Helene is confronted with the pain of abandonment by someone from her past. And the next generation of Helene and her vixen friend Brigitte realize that marriage is an economic arrangement, separate from affairs of the heart; that the consummation of the latter leads to a diminishment, decline, and an ending. Just like Silvio discovered a generation earlier. Silvio wisely counsels Colette on the differences between age and youth: “I won’t think of about anything. I’ll go to bed. I won’t sleep much. I’ll dream with my eyes open. As for you, well, you’ll go home, you’ll feel miserable, you’ll cry, you’ll get out Jean’s photograph and ask his forgiveness, you’ll regret the past, fear the future. I can’t say which of us will have a better night.” Nemirovsky was entering her forties when she wrote this book; youth had passed her by. I suspect a tone of regret in her authorial voice, and yet she captures this region of Burgundy and its people, a place she spent her last years, with deep insight. How much more would she have regretted had she known that but a few years later she would pay the ultimate price at the hands of the Nazis?

Young Bernard, 15, aspires to join the First World War that is showing signs of beginning in 1912; Martial, a medical student has only thoughts of saving lives while his friend Raymond dreams of making profit from the war; Renee will sleep her way to acquiring wealth and power, while Therese will let men walk over her for love.WWI changes the known world, the first war that introduced machines into the battlefront like never before. Old men profit by sending young men to their deaths, a nouveau riche emerges from those who deal in armaments and the war economy, and women are plentiful in a continent left with millions of men dead or maimed. Nemirovsky’s style is spare and insightful, and I wondered whether this novel was an early draft upon which she was going to develop character and story further, but was prevented by her unfortunate arrest and death in Auschwitz. Some scenes are detailed for pages and yet ten years could fly by in another sentence. Her strength is in the use of the omniscient narrator who inhabits the thoughts and actions of the characters intimately for long stretches. In that sense, this is a very interior novel.Although business plays a big part in the book, many of the business developments happen offstage, and Nemirovsky deals only with their emotional fallout. I sensed business naivety on the part of the author, for some of her astute business people take “all or nothing” gambles to lose everything, which I found to be rather implausible, unless by so doing, Nemirovsky was showing us a generation conditioned by war who sought thrills in everything they did.This book also focusses on the older generation who had to face two major wars in their lifetimes and lose loved ones in both, something oft forgotten in our contemporary literature. “It’s too much,” wails old Madame Jacquelain who has to see her men off to both wars.

Mevlut comes to Istanbul when he is fifteen, leaving his mother and sisters behind in the village, and helps his father, Mustafa, sell yoghurt and buy a piece of land in the Kultepe area of the city with documents that would not stand up in court (everyone is doing it). At night, Mevlut sells boza, a light alcoholic drink from Ottoman times, by walking the dark streets and being invited into homes, or by depositing his wares on trays lowered by ropes from upper floors of houses. Mustafa’s brother Hasan brings his whole family over, opens a shop on the opposite hill, Duttepe, and prospers. Hasan’s two sons are capitalists who hang onto the coat-tails of a land developer and go on to prosperity, while honest Mevlut is destined to always struggle by earning an income working gigs as varied as waiter, rice seller, electricity meter reader, recreation club manager, and, of course, boza seller. He lives in fear of stray dogs and is drawn to cemeteries.At the core of the family story which swings off in many episodic directions, tightly woven with the many social and political events that beset Istanbul during the last half of the 20th century (coups, elections, mafias, the rise of Islamism, and earthquakes), is the love letters that Mevlut wrote that led to him eloping with the wrong sister, Rayiha, someone he eventually grows to love and have daughters with. The author takes a novel approach to portraying unrequited love – implying that the satisfaction of it does not necessarily lead to “happily ever after.” I will not go into this rambling story that reads like a soap opera with its twists and turns while sounding naturalistic at the same time. This is a very mercurial family, switching allegiances, cheating, nursing petty jealousies, holding grudges and keeping secrets. However, they do reveal much of Turkish culture. Here are some nuggets I pulled out:1.	Courting between couples is severely limited by social mores. This is especially harder for widowed people.2.	In Turkey, couples either get married quickly by family arrangement, or they elope.3.	The headscarf is a dividing line between people, and between families.4.	Right wing, left wing, or Islamist allegiances drives rifts in families.5.	Stealing electricity is a big business, and the electricity meter reader is a powerful gatekeeper.6.	There is a lot of land that cannot be capitalized in Istanbul, for clear title cannot be proven. Selling out to mafias is sometimes the only alternative.7.	Building standards and codes do not exist. They can be subverted with bribes. Buildings come crashing down occasionally due to earthquakes.8.	Boza sellers make their sales by how they announce their product, with a wailing cry along the street. The passion in their voices either makes or breaks a sale.The author choses to tell this story through multiple first-person voices. And as this translation is in standard English, all the characters sound the same. There is a lot of description that could have been cut out, as well as some character pieces. And yet this voluminous book, given its multi-angle view, provides a real feel for the evolution of Istanbul, from a time when people could come in from the countryside, mark off turf, bribe a government official, and erect a single-story dwelling, to the time when developers moved in to grab land from shaky owners and build massive apartment buildings. We see the dying out of the street vendor, as yoghurt and boza is packeted or bottled and sold in grocery stores.The two sides of the family end up in the same apartment building, in different units, stacked one over the other based on level of income, after having negotiated various concessions from the developers. The older generation has the hardest time adjusting, without a garden, trees, and the bustle of street life. Looking out from an upper floor apartment across the Bosporus, (his cousin’s apartment, for Mevlut’s first floor unit has no view) Mevlut realizes how far he has come. He reaches some conclusions about his peripatetic life, about the dreams that dog him, about what really matters, and mattered to him during his peregrinations around this city. Then he goes out searching for new customers, to sell them his custom-made boza – the quintessential survivor in a fast-changing world. There are no conclusions here, just evolving stages of life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2022","Jun 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24997390-a-strangeness-in-my-mind

Ambitious, penniless, and ruthless, he realizes quickly that the seduction of women, which he discovers a talent for, is his quickest route to the top.Bel Ami joins a newspaper, has one of his admirers write his first piece for him, and begins the career ascendance, aligning himself and the newspaper with rising stars in French politics, something done more overtly back then and which seems to be making a comeback in present times. Insider trading comes in the form of fake news planted in the media that leads to surreptitious investments, that in turn award financial windfalls to those pulling the strings. Although much of the wheeling and dealing with politicians is given cursory treatment, and Duroy’s ability to amass so much knowledge in such a short time about the socio-political establishment he is parachuted into is questionable, it is Bel Ami’s adventures with his lovers that take centre stage. And these women, reflective of late 19th century French society, bear some description:•	Rachel, the dance hall girl, who initiates the broke and jobless Duroy into the profligate life, and then who insults him in public when he moves up a few notches on the social ladder and dares to be seen in public with another woman. •	Clotilde, married but adventurous and vagabond, who rents an apartment for their regular bi-weekly trysts, and who is physically abused by Duroy, only to return time and time again for more punishment. •	Madeleine, widow of the friend who got him into journalism, whom Duroy marries; his muse, who prefers the independent life and who has secrets of her own. •	Madame Walter, his boss’s religion-obsessed and hobbled wife who falls “ass over tea-kettle” for Duroy and would gladly be his doormat.•	Suzanne, virginal and heiress to a fortune, who is in thrall to this Svengali. And what of Bel Ami? He is jealous, scheming, petty – in a word – despicable. His attitude to women sums it up: “All women are whores. One must use them and not give them anything of one’s self. Selfishness for power and wealth is much better than selfishness for love and women.” Enough said. But he is astute and knows where to place his bets. People, even his cuckolded boss, grudgingly back him, for this boy is going places. Maupassant paints interesting scenes of pistol duels and charity fencing matches that go off the rails. Poet Norbert’s long monologue on aging and dying is a masterpiece to that state where we will all end up, and which Bel Ami is morbidly fearful of: “We’ve created a discrepancy between our overdeveloped thought and the unchanging conditions of life.” The pettiness of social life drips from every page: Madeleine wants her new husband’s name changed to Du Roy from Duroy, for the latter is too common. The strict social implications of divorce, inheritance, adultery, and elopement are made very clear and are in direct contrast to a social climate in which everyone, man or woman, is expected to have a spouse for propriety and a lover for passion. By today’s writing school rules on craft, there are many inconsistencies: the overuse of possessives and pronouns in the same sentence, the sudden shifting points of view, and the occasional references to characters as “young” when they range in age from teens to their forties, are some I picked out. In a way, I’m glad Maupassant was not constrained by these arbitrary rules, for he is able to get to the centre of the emotion. His descriptions of places and people are visual and original: “A ball nailed onto another ball, on short legs that almost looked like balls” – his description of a fat notary. I was a bit surprised at the ending, for I thought Maupassant—then at the stage when he was facing a death sentence from syphilis after having lived a Bel Ami-type life—would condemn his anti-hero and the Third Republic for its excesses. But no, the condemnation did not come, instead he seemed to endorse the lifestyle. Perhaps Maupassant foresaw that even in that century, as in any, the road to the illusive top of the pyramid was based on trampling the Other, no matter what the other side of the mountain presented. Perhaps that is why Bel Ami was scared of Norbert’s lament on death, the final victor: “Life is a slope, dear boy. As long as you are going up, you feel happy; but when you reach the top, suddenly you can see the road going downhill and death at the end of it all.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,not setnot set,"Jun 13, 2022not set","Jun 13, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/780581.Bel_Ami

Given the dense prose, the constant diversionsA tragic love triangle taking place in New York in 1947 with its roots spreading back to the Holocaust. Given the dense prose, the constant diversions into back story, and the detailed descriptions of the Nazi concentration camp system, I wondered whether there were two books here.Narrator and budding author Stingo, 22, is madly in love with the beautiful Sophie, 30, who in turn is ass-over-tea-kettle over, and enslaved by, the mercurial biologist Nathan. Each is hiding secrets and must lie to survive. Stingo is tormented by his deprived sexuality that borders on homo-eroticism; Sophie by her past in the Warsaw Ghetto and Auschwitz; and Nathan by his violent bi-polarity. And yet the trio are bound by mutual attraction and love for each member. They are from different backgrounds: Stingo is from the American South working on his debut novel, Sophie is Polish and fluent in several languages, while Jewish Nathan is an expert on any subject, abuses drugs, and abuses Sophie when in his “down” state. The author brings into focus the parallel between the persecution of Jews by Nazis and Slavery in America, both which robbed their victims of rights and eliminated the sanctity of life. Sophie seems a proxy for a victim of both systems. Gradually, Stingo unearths Sophie’s and Nathan’s stories. We learn that she had a son midway during the book. Then, we learn, further along, that she also had a daughter. She is wracked with survivor guilt and finds solace in alcohol and sex. Nathan does not appear to be the scientist he claims to be, one who makes breakthrough discoveries in cures that lead him to incredible highs and disastrous lows. Even Stingo hides the source of his grubstake in New York that enables him to scrape by writing his book without having to work.With frequent diversions into Sophie’s journey from being the privileged only-child of anti-Semitic, academic parents and the wife of another academic, living the good life in Cracow, to her descent into hell in Auschwitz, and from her slavish attachment to the destructive Nathan upon arriving in America as a refugee, we come to learn the source of her lack of self-esteem and of her desire for numbness through annihilation. In ironic fashion, each of the characters achieve what they desire. Even Stingo is liberated from his “block” by a night of mind-blowing sex worth dying for.Although the subject matter is gripping, there are huge information drops in places and unwarrantedly complex sentences that role on ad nauseum. Sometimes the new information is back story to get the next section of the narrative moving, and I found this to be clumsily rendered. The author alludes often to Thomas Wolfe and to his voluminous and ponderous style, and I could see that Styron was a Wolfe adherent. The most dramatic scene in the movie version, where Sophie has to make her damning “choice,” is dropped in only about 35 pages from the end of the book when Dr. Von Niemand is introduced. There is even a detour into peanut farming and an elucidation of the differences between the American North and South further towards the end, making one wonder whether the author is throwing in his copious research notes into the novel as well.That said, the scenes in Auschwitz and Birkenau are well drawn, and the philosophy and psychology behind Germany’s concentration camp system are explained in depth, more than what is required for a novel, I think. Hence why I concluded that there are two books crammed into one here, making the reader switch hats constantly between the fictional love triangle and the factual Holocaust rendition, diluting the impact of both. A line that stuck with me: “At Auschwitz, where was God? And where was man?” Can one ever understand or explain Auschwitz? That is the unanswered question remaining, after our tragic trio exit the stage....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jun 05, 2022","Jun 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/228560.Sophie_s_Choice

He works his children and Haley to the bone and will not tolerate any misbehavior from them or from his hired hand, the crazy Banghart. The central conflict in Haley is his desire to win Hope and conquer his fear, and that opportunity presents itself when a series of unforeseen accidents lead him and Banghart to go AWOL and face-off, with the General standing between them.This story is idealistic – Haley longs to study in a music academy in Chicago, hoping to improve his present situation of being a prospectless orphan – and melodramatic, for Haley does an about-face from his cowardice while the General goes in the opposite direction during the denouement. But all ends well, like most debut novels (or novellas) do.The second piece, written circa 2007, If God Were Alive Today, is darker, and shows us the jaded Vonnegut after coming through WWII, and writing for over half a century. Protagonist Gil Berman is a stand-up comic on the state of the world. Coming from a wealthy background, he shuns a prospective career to joke and comment on all that is wrong in America. His comments mirror his cynicism:“The only proof of the Existence of God I need is a Third World War.”“The illegal drugs industry is the largest industry in America.”“The Swastika is another Christian Cross.”“The War on Drugs is better than no drugs at all.”Berman dismisses Nobel prize winning authors as a bunch of alcoholics (was Vonnegut suffering some jealousy here?) and notes that Sigmund Freud had been on cocaine. He disses the Bush/Gore election and labels TV as an “eraser,” for it has wiped out real human experience and transplanted an artificial one in its place. He takes up the cause of climate change and fires pot shots at political correctness around race and gender issues. A 60-year-old groupie thinks he is the re-incarnation of Jesus.Yet Berman suffers from his angst. He has two nervous breakdowns. His father commits suicide at 42, the same age as when we meet Berman giving his final comedy performance that ends with no one laughing. His wife and daughter desert him – a cause for his comedic antics, one psycho therapist surmises.While the first story is structured with a linear and text-book plotline, the second story is a scattershot, stream-of-consciousness rendition, resembling a stand-up comedy routine, Vonnegut’s final act of absurdity and resignation....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"May 28, 2022","May 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15716409-we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be

Each school that comes into prominence prescribes (or describes) their rules – this is how dictionaries and style guides are written, but no one is in charge of the asylum. And each generation has decried the decline of the language since the eighteenth century. Write for clarity and impact, the author advises, not to abide by a rule concocted by a person or persons who may be long dead.Pinker takes each rule and shows us the exceptions. Hence, split infinitives, dangling modifiers, stranded prepositions, nouns repurposed as verbs or vice versa, and passive voice are okay if the circumstances dictate. The serial comma is exposed with its pros and cons. Myths surrounding who/whom, there/their, lie/lay, the singular “they”, and that/which (also known as the which hunt) are laid bare. He lays (not lies) side-by-side comparisons of properly written sentences compared with seemingly properly written alternative versions and points out the errors in the latter. In the section on diction, he takes commonly used words and shows us their proper and improper usage. The sixth chapter was the most useful to me, for it was the primer on grammar, a twenty-first century version of Strunk & White. The section on punctuation would be any writer’s and editor’s sandbox, for he covers the difference between punctuating for prosody vs. syntax in our age where the latter is winning over the former. Although admitting that he is a card-carrying member of the Prescribists school, he bows to common sense where modern usage has made certain rules irrelevant – his argument over the stupid North American rule that the comma be placed inside the closing quote mark is quite persuasive, especially when reading examples that he cites. In fact, I have used his preferred option somewhere in this  – see if you can find it.In keeping with his Prescribist’s nature, Pinker leaves us with five prescriptions that are loaded with common sense: look things up; be sure your arguments are sound; don’t confuse an anecdote with the general state of the world; beware of false dichotomies (please check his right use of the word dichotomy); and arguments should be based on reason, not people.So, if you are wondering whether to place your next period inside or outside the closing quote – this book is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"May 20, 2022","May 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20821371-the-sense-of-style

After all, he is in America in 1949, during the golden age of the post-war boom, and he too gets caught up in the tsunami of upward mobility where factory workers are breaking backs to put their children through college “for a better life.” His trajectory, however, is modest compared to brothers Malachy and Michael, whom he brings over to America, but who being more entrepreneurial, make more money in the hospitality and television businesses, while Frank prefers to remain a lowly high school teacher who never went to high school himself, but who talked his way into being accepted into university.  Starting from a joe-job cleaning floors and ashtrays in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel in Manhattan, and being exposed to the extreme racism and class consciousness that is never advertised in America, Frank enters the army for four years. Upon discharge, he works his way over to a higher-paying warehouse laborer’s job, but escapes the high pay-low career prospects trap of manual work by enrolling in NYU and sticking to it, despite having to take night jobs and other part time work to pay his way through, while struggling not to cave into chucking it all up and “going out for beers with the boys” when he is unable to even pay his rent. Frank has the devil of the Irish, the ability to get blindly drunk, a cause for his problems in the romance department. In many ways, he is not different to his father, Malachy Sr. who is a confirmed alcoholic living in Belfast, never to be reformed.The book is detailed about scenes of street life in New York, school and university life, new immigrant life, the teaching life, and the impressions the returning émigré receives when he revisits home. “I can be in New York and read books or go to pubs – why do I need to do it here?” he asks upon visiting Ireland briefly after his discharge from the army and finding himself received like a war hero; yet, the grinding poverty of the home country is stifling: “The family of broken shoes and blackened teeth – that will be our family coat of arms.”He falls in love and marries a girl whom he calls Mike Small (perhaps he is trying to disguise real names) – an Episcopalian, all-American girl who has never witnessed the horrors of poverty. “Irish girls reserve their bodies for the wedding night, Protestant girls don’t,” is his observation on women. However, the marriage is destined to end when their only child, a daughter, is eight years old, about Frank’s age when his father left the family home back in Limerick. Frank resignedly accepts his fate: the union of a slum-bred Catholic and a well-raised Episcopalian was never intended to last.The narrative has no sharp highs or lows like Angela’s Ashes, and is episodic, for Frank is trying to capture events in chronological order; so, we get careers, marriages, children, divorces, and deaths – not the stuff of killer memoirs. What holds interest, however, and raises this memoir above the mundane, is McCourt’s narrative style – irreverent, humorous, and grammatically mind bending. He repeats the same sentence or situation umpteen times to make it stick. There are many peripheral characters, but they come and go and are inconsequential, for they only serve to embellish the character of Frank McCourt. The immigrant story is always appealing, for it deals with the protagonist scaling impossible heights to succeed. ’Tis is not the rag-to-riches story of American staple heroes such as Carnegie, Rockefeller, or Vanderbilt, but it is a more accessible immigrant story of how hard work, some vulnerabilities (like drinking), a sense of mission, and loyalty to family can still wrest a better life out of hopeless beginnings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"May 08, 2022","May 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4912._Tis

Thirty-nine of them are with his playwright’s cap on and sixty-two are from the director’s chair. Each of the two segments begin at the concept stage of the play and ends where each role ends, or is handed off to the other.I found some interesting one-liners that revealed a lot:1.	Mix comedy with drama for contrast.2.	Theatre can call an emotional response, rarely objective to global issues.3.	A comedy is a play in which someone wants something and eventually gets it; a tragedy is a play where they don’t.4.	Always get your audience to look at the same thing.5.	Unity of time and setting, a strong narrative, and a few characters are essential ingredients to begin writing a good play. He then gets into a lengthy section on dialogue that draws scenes from his own collection of plays, which is a delight to read, for the short scenes reveal much about character, relationships, and plot movement – great case studies on writing dialogue and on saying much with an economy of words.In the director section, we get to realize the power dynamics between the director, the producer, the actors (especially the star of the show), and the diverse crew members who bring a play to life. The power rests with those who have the higher reputation, money, and audience-attraction – hence, directors are often at the mercy of star actors and producers, and are dispensable. There is always a battle for creative control between the director and the actors.The director is alternatingly project manager, coach, mentor, traffic cop, and shrink. The director helps others create and has great difficulty building their own CV, for how does one isolate the directing from more obvious parts like the plot, the acting, the costumes, the set, and the lighting? It is also better to have no director than to have a bad director. His advice on directing that stuck with me:1.	New plays don’t built reputations. Remakes are better.2.	Most new playwrights have no clue about the theatre.3.	Don’t hire a star. Or your friends and relatives.4.	Casting is the most important job. Be sure to be present at every audition, especially when recruiting understudies.5.

However, juxtaposed within the mundane activity of cops are chapters from the criminals’ POV in gangland Glasgow which provide a more sinister tone.The plot is threadbare: the crooked playboy lawyer of one of the four main gang bosses in Glasgow is found murdered in the precinct of another boss. Suspicions of a turf war abound as properties, lucrative to the criminals, are burned down in either side’s camp. Who is responsible? Is this an overt attempt by one boss to overthrow the other, or is it the work of one of the other two bosses to stoke a war and pick up the pieces later? Or is it a crime related to the profligate life of the victim?Enter DC Laidlaw, irreverent, chain-smoker, father of three, out of love with his long-suffering wife, and preferring to sleep in a hotel while on a case where an attractive receptionist makes cryptic remarks to him suggesting another whodunit in the wings. Laidlaw is literary and believes that it’s not cops who are needed but sociologists and philosophers who could go back to the origins before crimes are committed to find answers and prevent them from happening. He believes that clues lie in the little things: “Details are like the giant’s fingers,” paraphrasing John Updike. He is destined not to rise above the rank of constable for his “in your face” actions that his boss frowns upon; yet criminals shy away, allowing him to bulldoze into finding answers quickly.This is a novel of deceptions. The mobsters are deceiving each other; their minions are deceiving their bosses and colleagues; the reader is deceived into going down many blind alleys and reading a lot of inconsequential chapters; and the cops are deceived into pursuing the wrong motive. When illumination finally strikes Laidlaw, the solution doesn’t appear to have had any prior foreshadowing, so it looks highly contrived. I’m not sure I even met the killer, although the name was mentioned often.I found the writing pedestrian. There were so many viewpoints, no one (except for Laidlaw) stuck out as particularly memorable. It was as if the author needed someone to carry each chapter, so he picked one person at random – and they all ended up sounding like the same person to me. Cam Colvin’s four hoods moved around like a body with four heads; they did not look different from one another except that one guy carried a spanner and the other a knife, the third guy liked to eat, and the last? I can’t even remember the fourth guy. The most character-revealing chapter for me was the one in which the Laidlaws and the Lilleys (Laidlaw’s partner and the lead sergeant) have dinner and discuss each other afterwards once back in their respective homes. The snappy and sarcastic dialogue redeemed the flat narrative. The final chapters also saved the book, and I wondered whether they had been written by Rankin. We are left with a new insight into Laidlaw and into the way gangs resolve their differences. There are no happy endings here, although some loose ends get tied up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Apr 20, 2022","Apr 20, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56442695-the-dark-remains

He covers the difference between countries with an evolved common law system (the US, Britain and its former dominions) and those with civil law such as France and Germany. And the role that International Law plays vis-a-vis national laws, and the reason why the former is increasingly needed in our interconnected world.There are interesting explanations and examples of “trial by ambush, “the right to freedom of expression,” “the right to life,” “the law’s delay,” “statute law vs. common law,” “Public Interest Immunity,” and “full disclosure of evidence.” We seem to have reached the pinnacle of respect for the rule of law when the Wall fell in Berlin and totalitarian states began to clamor for democracy. But the last twenty years have seen us drift back towards a less-than desirable state in the liberal west with laws such as the Patriot Act, the Rendition program, and others designed to deal with terrorism, cyberattacks, and the rise of totalitarianism. Torture has returned – check out Gitmo and Bagram; surveillance is higher than during the cold war due to the presence of CCTV; and partisanship has returned to the judiciary – check out the Bush vs. Gore election battle where the application of the rule of law boiled down to “Hooray for our side.”Bingham however, is fully onside that the non-elected judiciary should only interpret law and not usurp the lawmaking powers of elected officials such as parliamentarians, however irrational and unfair those laws might be. He also makes an open apology up front for his politically incorrect use of the “he” and “she” pronouns instead of the currently enforced, gender-neutral form of “they” in his text, a subtle point perhaps that language, like law, is evolutionary and should reflect humankind’s development, his language being behind current trends.

While everyone is sitting on land and other assets, much of these assets do not have clear titles of ownership and are therefore considered dead capital; they cannot be held as security for loans and mortgages and other instruments that extend their value far beyond their principal function. The West, numbering 25 out of 200 countries, has evolved over the centuries to create integrated systems of property management that allow for clear title and therefore can leverage this wealth to create more wealth.He cites some alarming statistics: 1.	There is $9.3 trillion of dead capital made up of favelas, shanty towns, and illegal homes set up in the developing world, all hives of activity but useless beyond that activity because it sits outside the legal system.2.	92% of urban Egypt is extralegal, only 2.8% of farmers in Russia in 1995 owned their land. 3.	It takes 289 days to register a business in Peru, and 728 bureaucratic steps taking 22 years to gain title to municipal property in Lima.4.	It took the USA over a hundred years to achieve an integrated system of property management in the late nineteenth century, and Japan achieved one only in the 1950s. The section on how the USA went from a bunch of squatters to an integrated property system is an interesting study on how such a system may be assembled. The US also has lessons for reformers today, where top-down prescriptive legal remedies do not work, for the law has to be “discovered” not merely enacted. A viable legal property system needs to include the extralegal practices and principles lying at the base of its myriad components. In the USA, it was the squatters who asserted their rights and had laws such as the Kentucky Act, the Pre-emption Act, and the Homesteader Act passed that progressively harmonized the extralegal with the legal. There are quirky beginnings mentioned, like Tomahawk, Cabin, or Corn rights that dictated land boundaries between neighbors; or one walked until a different dog barked to signal the end of one property and the beginning of another.De Soto bemoans cursory solutions offered by western nations to democratize Communist countries after the fall of the Berlin Wall: stable currencies, open markets, private businesses – these were all downstream systems of a more vital system that had been developed by the west and forgotten. That vital system, Capital, was not focused on by the solution providers. Capital could only be raised with an effective property system and its accompanying laws and enforcement. Bill Gates became rich because he was able to leverage and lock-in that other form of property: intellectual property.There is a lot of overwriting in this book, for de Soto doesn’t veer from his central premise, and I started skipping in places when he got into a repeating groove, hammering home his message about the imperative for a property system. I wondered whether this premise could have been presented as a white paper on the need for a property management system for developing countries, and not as a full-blown book?Given that this book was published in 2000, I also wondered whether subsequent economic developments in the world wouldn’t have taken the shine out of some of de Soto’s recommendations. He talks of property generating capital in the form of paper forms like mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and other forms of virtual wealth that expands the core property they link back to. What would he have said about the dot.com bubble bust that was based on vapourware or the 2008 financial crisis that was precipitated by mortgage-backed securities running amok? What would he say of the present crypto-currency bubble that is overheating and threatening to spill into the property market? Are their limits to creating capital out of property? Dated though it is, this is a thought-provoking book which made me take another look at our heated-up real-estate markets around the world and wonder whether everyone has taken a leaf from de Soto and is gobbling up scarce legal property so that they can extend their capital assets into the stratosphere. But everything that goes up must come down, no? Isn’t that true even of property, even if it’s sometime in the distant future?  ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2022","Mar 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/86154.The_Mystery_of_Capital

The author stays true to the script we have all been given on what those past wrongs were and on how they should be righted, so I found little that stretched my imagination, despite this being a work of fiction that has more latitude to roam than a government commission report.Hazel Ellis is a conflicted young woman. A recent graduate with a “very white, very male-centric degree” (not sure why she enrolled if she felt that strongly!), she has returned to the Rez to live with her mother and grieve the passing of her father a year and a half ago. She is angry at the white man, and the barbs fly occasionally: “white men always win when they tell our stories,” – fair enough, it’s payback time. She also has a spiritual connection with Nanabush, a trickster who reveals himself as a crow and carries messages to her from the Spirit World, where the Seven Grandfathers reside. These seven wise spirits are not always clear in their instructions— reminding me of the Greek gods on Mount Olympus—causing Nanabush much grief.A grievous situation has arisen: the quarry on Hazel’s property, now owned by her and her absentee brother, Gus, is about to be taken over by a white man’s mining company, because it is recorded as surrendered land. From her work in filing old records at the Rez administration office and from trips back into the past with the assistance of Nanabush, Hazel discovers the heinous machinations of the former Indian Agent, whose great-great grandson is now the mining company executive in charge of the proposed quarry mine. Hazel, with her supernatural powers, is the new Wonder Woman who can right the wrongs of the past. Nanabush, for his part, craves to be released from this flitting about between two worlds where he is respected in neither – he would either like to regain his human form or die and head off into immortality. The Seven Grandfathers too have a vested interest in the mine deal not going through.We get the tourist’s version of a very long and accurate sweat lodge scene, which might be boring to those who have experienced one, and educational to those who haven’t. Life on the Rez is described in detail – great for those of us who don’t live in one, but quite resembling small-town living in Settler Canada, for the accoutrements of daily life—clothes, groceries, food, cars, and entertainment—are the same. There are also more than the required “dead” moments when we are either embroiled in domestic scenes between mother and daughter, or in dream sequences, or in Hazel’s peregrinations around the Rez– great for those seeking saccharine, boring for those wanting the novel to get off its ass and get going. The author correctly includes stereotypical Rez characters like Heath Whittaker, the big, bad, greedy Indigenous construction guy who will sell out anyone for a profit, and Brian Howard, the ineffectual Band Chief, who will sign anything. Unfortunately, Whitaker and Howard are mentioned in passing and figure only as window dressing—they do not feature in the main story at all.In her exalted superwoman status, Hazel, and her Man Friday, Nanabush, will prevail, and the author, politically correctly, presents the modern generation of settler as honest and ethical, conceding when confronted with evidence and the rule of law, making amends for their crooked ancestors who robbed the Indigenous of their land. The Commission’s remediation script is followed to the letter.I found the writing pedestrian, and attempts to create accents (“ting” for “thing,” “den” for “then” etc.) did not quite work in the places they were applied. I wished the author had not relied on overused tropes such as “men are predictable – they haven’t changed in thousands of years.” We know that already—tell us something original. Given the prevalence of mysticism in the Indigenous way of life, mainstream literary novels like this have the advantage of covering the human and supernatural planes, without being cast into a genre such as magic realism, or fantasy, as often happens in settler literature.However, this being fiction, I was looking for something original that would go beyond the existing Settler-Indigenous state of affairs and stretch our imagination into new possibilities. For example, what if the under-characterized Whittaker had been the villain of the piece instead of the stereotypical Indian Agent of yore?

Yet Grandma laughs about the vicissitudes of life, and her advice to Swiv is “fight – against patriarchy, pain, and against all forms of injustice,” advice that gets Swiv suspended from school and forced to care for Grandma and her pregnant mother, Mooshie. Mom is another character , embodying “fight” to the hilt. Mom is a struggling stage actor, fighting for meaningful roles, fighting with directors, fighting discrimination by exploitative producers, fighting guilt for having affairs with men just to fill the hole in her own life, and always in a snit; “scorched earth” is her approach to anyone who opposes or frustrates her. This trio of women soldier on in the same household, fighting and loving each other, for the only men in their lives are either dead (Grandpa), run away (Dad), or, in the case of Swiv, still to make an appearance, although our teenage heroine thinks that the smell of “T”’s chest in California is pretty cool, and she has his phone number.The book is divided into two halves - not quite the way Grandma saws her books into sections to digest them more easily – the first half dedicated to the three women’s quotidian lives in Toronto, and the second half to chronicle a trip that Grandma and Swiv take to Fresno, California to visit relatives for the last time. This is where I got the sense of a strong parallel between this novel and Toews’ The Flying Troutmans: another multi-generational story dominated by women, another road trip down south, another round of fantastical happenings and erratic behaviour that is hard to keep up with, without losing credibility. In fact, I wondered whether an American connection was required just to maintain book sales and international acceptance. I will not go into recounting all the antics that Swiv and her grandmother get into, for that would amount to spoilers, suffice to say, that at some point we know this game is going to end. Grandma is going to wear herself out, despite her philosophy that “Pain - it is not those who can inflict it the most, but those who can suffer it the most who will conquer.” Yet, before the final whistle, Grandma gets to fly in an airplane, go boating and drinking, drive her own convertible, and literally kick up a storm in a nursing home in Fresno, all this while travelling to the USA with insufficient medical insurance coverage. The final scene in the hospital back in Toronto is sad and funny at the same time, where three members of the family go inside and three come out, but not without tragedy and joy in their wake.I found the writing style to be even more unorthodox than The Flying Troutmans. In that previous book, although there were no quote marks to separate dialogue from narrative, each distinct line of dialogue spoken by a character had its own paragraph. In this book, dialogue (even by two or more characters) and narrative are dumped together into dense paragraphs, identified by a lot of unnecessary “I said”s and “she said”s. Perhaps Toews was trying to present the writing of an unformed teenager, Swiv, but I got the impression she was copying that other master of denseness, Jose Saramago.Despite these quirks, this is a heart-rending story. Now I have to read the Giller prize winning novel to find out why Toews, who has put in her time over the years and perfected the multi-generational girl-power novel to a fine art, was denied the prize this year....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 06, 2022","Mar 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57491164-fight-night

What is the author trying to say?” And many have left those questions hanging discreetly rather than probing the wisdom of a Giller Prize wining author, whose book, this one, won that award in 2017. As much as the doppelganger has been a much-used conceit in fiction, if I have to hazard a guess regarding motive, I think Redhill was simply trying to kill off his pseudonym, Inger Ash Wolfe, who was becoming more commercially bankable than him.Though written in easy prose, the jerkiness and gaps in the narrative, the unreliable narrator, and the amount of detail that is withheld makes for a confusing read. On the surface, Jean, a forty-something bookseller, with a loving and protective family, hears third-party accounts of her doppelganger, Ingrid, frequenting Belleview Square located in the Kensington Market area of Toronto. Jean becomes obsessed with finding Ingrid and haunts Belleview at all hours. Then people start dying. And the reader begins to suspect that the problem is with Jean, not her double.The subject matter is topical because it focusses on mental illness in the big city. There are many of us who walk by each other on the street, suffering yet hiding our illnesses of the mind due to the stain they bear. As Jean says, “If it’s just another illness that can be cured by medicine, why should there be a stigma?” In the process of her peregrinations, she meets some quirky characters haunting Bellevue Square; drug addicts, dope peddlers, photographers, pavement hawkers, immigrants, food-sellers, temporary rabbis—eccentric or mad, as judged by us sane people, but all very interesting within the pages of fiction. Having frequented that area of Toronto myself during many literary outings, the setting had particular appeal to me.After a shocking revelation midway, the tables are turned, and Jean becomes the victim, struggling to prove her sanity and reclaim her “one-ness” that can only come if the double is outed and destroyed. The double, who seems to have the same life and relationships as Jean, is trying to do the same thing. Or is this one big experiment by the doctors who are using Jean and Ingrid as lab rats?That’s when things get a bit weird and the chase leads to a literary conference in the wilderness (obviously a familiar setting for the author) for the final, nail-biting showdown. The ending sounded like a bit of a soap opera after we had been immersed in highly complex medical conditions like asymmetrical autoscopy, micro-angioma, schwannomas, and mind games, and it made me wonder who the good guys and bad guys were. I was left also wondering whether this novel was Giller material at all, or whether Redhill’s time to bag the award had come up due to his copious contributions to CanLit over the years, and that his next book, any book, this one, was to be his ticket to the prize? I was unable to answer that question as much as I was unable to piece together all the open ends in this narrative. Perhaps the recipe to winning the Giller is to write a book so open to diverse interpretations that readers will puzzle for days over it before finally shaking their heads, shrugging their shoulders, and saying, “This is beyond me – therefore, it must be a masterpiece!” Past masters of obfuscation like Joyce, Lowry and Pynchon must be smiling....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 27, 2022","Feb 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33595663-bellevue-square

A proof-reader alters one word in a book and changes the history of Portugal. This dramatic premise gives us mirrored love stories from the 12th and 20th centuries, an alternative history of a country, and a meditation on love and war, all told in the author's inimical dense, stream-of-consciousness style. It is also a cautionary tale, emphasizing history's vulnerability to be written and re-written to suit its custodians.Raymundo is a 50-year-old, single, proof reader who lives in the Moorish section at the base of the old castle in Lisbon. He has no interests other than in his work as a corrector of facts; he is subservient to authors and publishers, and has no authorial ambitions himself. When not working, he walks about the city to visualize its historical past, visits museums and bookshops for intellectual stimulation, and consorts with prostitutes to relieve sexual tension. He is working on proof-reading a book on the history of the Siege of Lisbon in the late 12th century by the Portuguese to rid themselves of the Moors who had occupied the country for over three centuries. Appalled by the factual errors he encounters, and seized by an inexplicable fit of insurrection, Raymundo adds a single word that changes the popular understanding about who helped the Portuguese vanquish their enemy.In hot water for his transgression, Raymundo is placed under a new manager of proof readers, Dr. Maria Sara - fortyish, divorced, and recently split from her last relationship. A gesture involving a rose in the new boss’s office throws Raymundo and Maria into a love affair, more dramatic for passion withheld than expressed. As the lovers draw closer to each other through a series of phone calls, surreptitious meetings, and discussions over art and literature, Maria inspires Raymundo to “climb the mountain” and write that alternative history of Lisbon his phantom word has given birth to. He capitulates, if that would only bring her closer to him. In their relationship, she is the aggressor, and he the passive one who would rather strategize on how the battles in Lisbon were fought eight hundred years ago than pick up the phone to call Maria.Events taking place in Lisbon with these two 20th century lovers influence Raymundo’s re-creation of what happened in the 12th century. An alter-ego soldier, Morgueime, emerges, a hero of previous battles and drawn to the concubine Ouruana who is the property of a knight crusader. Timelines merge, as what Maria reads aloud to Raymundo of St. Anthony’s miraculous travels get also transformed by him into the alternative history of Lisbon. “Each of us besieges the other,” Maria says. The battle scenes are more analytical than descriptive, reflective of Raymundo, who is described as a closet philosopher by one of his author clients. Therefore, we get insights into logistical elements (food availability, the disposal of dead bodies, women who follow soldiers to provide sex relief, the construction and destruction of assault towers etc.,) and disagreements over the distribution of plunder, rather than scenes of men swinging swords at each other.Saramago uses not only his usual dense prose style that mixes narration with dialogue, he also blends present and past tense in this novel, a device that a clarifying afterword by him seeks to explain as the way to convey the blending of time between Raymond/Maria and Morgueime/Ouruana. But it did not work for me and made the reading even more difficult in places. Jose Saramago is always a tough read, for he demands that we follow his stream-of-consciousness style and trust that, from out of those dense passages of text, we will emerge with an understanding of his characters, his story, his allegories and allusions, and his philosophy. Perhaps he was accepted during his day because readers were more accepting of post-modernist writing. And he is probably accepted today because he won the Nobel, and therefore “must be good.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Feb 20, 2022","Feb 20, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/6251302-the-history-of-the-seige-of-lisbon

On the shadows of the Fiesta hovers McIntyre (Mac), the benevolent cop who once gave Sailor a chance, and who wants to nab the murderer of the senator’s wife.Sailor circles the inner city amidst revelers, rituals, and reminiscences, looking for non-existent accommodation and the slippery Sen, while always putting off the moment when he will take his gun out of his pocket and extract five grand from his ex-boss before hightailing it to a better life in Mexico where his old gang buddies are hanging out and waiting for him. We get flashbacks into his childhood with a drunken and abusive father, and a mother who died of cancer, into multiple reform schools, until the Sen bailed him out, educated him, and made him his private secretary. Yet now, Sailor wants to expose the Sen to the cops to secure his own salvation.During his peregrinations, he bumps into Mac and evades him with obscure answers about his involvement in the murder; he befriends Don Jose (Pancho) the carousel owner who offers him a bed under the stars wrapped in a smelly serape; and he meets representatives of the Indian and Mexican underclass in the form of the three teenagers Pila, Rosita, and Irena who are also visiting for Fiesta but live with relatives; he participates in religious ceremonies and misses getting stabbed by those who do not agree with his plans for the Sen.Despite the tough talk, the repeating sentences, the circling action, and the noir feel, there are strong messages that emerge. The first is about race: (a) Colonization is under siege – the Indian will remain unbending and diminish the Gringo into non-existence. Sailor gets cold feet whenever he is in the company of an Indian, even if it is Pila, and even if all he wants to do is buy her a ride on a pink horse on Pancho’s carousel (b) The Spaniard, even though he colonized the land before the Gringo, does not have high expectations or ambitions, because the Gringo is going to get him anyway.The next message is about salvation. Sailor believes that salvation for him lies in Mexico, just over the mountains. He believes that salvation for Pila is never to leave her pueblo and come to the sinful Yankee city to earn her living. He believes that salvation only arrives when bad people like the Sen are handed over to the police (after collecting his payoff money, that is).The plot spirals like the carousel, spinning Sailor towards his destiny, as his peregrinations spiral down into smaller and smaller loops. Details of the murder are unraveled in scraps of dropped conversations, but if you asked me to explain who done it and how, I wouldn’t know, nor is it important, for it is Sailor and his dream of salvation that is in the balance. Mac gives Sailor a way out from his utopian dream, “Repent, take your medicine and turn over a new life.” But that is not good enough for Sailor, he has to do it his way. The ending, despite the inevitable trajectory of the book, quite surprised me.There was a lot of down time in this book and the excessive and repeated “tough-guy” writing was to create mood, I guess, the noirish feel. However, given its one-stranded plot, I think this story could have been written as a tight novella and elicited a sharper reaction from the reader. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2022","Feb 12, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/579819.Ride_the_Pink_Horse

Some read like short stories, others are satire, and others are quotidian events that we all encounter at some time or other, but all are recounted for their humoristic value.This is my first David Sedaris book, and I found it refreshingly light in contrast to the heavier literary fare I have been reading recently. He is unabashedly revealing of his personal life and his interpersonal relationships. Especially, the one with his father who comes across as the villain of the piece, who always denigrates David’s accomplishments – “But I am #1 on the New York Times list, Dad”, “But I read the Washington Post, Son.”Some pieces focus on a funnier way to recount a commonplace incident, like the goings-on aboard air planes: flight attendants who fart in the aisles and call it “crop-dusting,” their sounds drowned out in the roar of the engines, the smell making you look around in your seat for whodunnit. Some stories get lost in the middle only to re-emerge with a punch line that brings it together.I liked his travel pieces: losing his passport in Hawaii; trying to get a residence sticker from a hopelessly backlogged British Immigration department; the nuances of German, Japanese, and Chinese expressions pulled out of travel dictionaries and the embarrassment they cause; the Kookaburra beating its meat; spitting, snot blowing, and shitting in public in China, and then sitting down to a meal wondering where your server and cook stuck their hands. His book tours are also interesting, especially when he gets to engage with his audiences and ask them questions.Being a gay boomer, he suffered his share of ignominy - of coming out, and of secret liaisons between members of the same gender - reflective of the last century. His story of meeting the proverbial stranger on a train (twice), each encounter which leaves different lasting impressions on him, encapsulates his life and times as a young man.Three satirical pieces took me by surprise, for they were narrated by people diametrically opposite to Sedaris: a Christian Fundamentalist revealing how stupid she was, a letter to a paraplegic by an evil sister, and a white, male misogynist who murdered his family after the gay marriage bill was passed in New York. Dark, funny, and revealing.Despite the diversity of content, a picture emerges of a man ridiculed and marginalized by even his family when young, who makes it in the world of celebrity journalism by sheer determination to tell his story in all its humorous permutations, and to laugh at them, thus making us laugh too, lightening everyone’s load in the process. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2022","Jan 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790837-let-s-explore-diabetes-with-owls

From that perspective, this book is a treasure, as a novel it is weighted by that very literary burden it bears.Aaliya, is the translator of translations, a retired bookseller, 72, living alone in a high-rise apartment, divorced at 22 and never remarried, and forever holding a grudge against her impotent former husband. She cries a lot because she has no occupation, no desire, no hope, no ambition, and no self-love. The only enterprise that keeps her from suicide is her translations. She translates a new book every year, and upon concluding the project, files it in a pile of boxes in the maid’s room of her apartment, never to be published. By withdrawing into her cave and her work, she has withstood the Lebanese 15-year civil war, the threats of her own family to vacate, and the entreaties to join the Three Witches Club comprised of her landlady, Fadia, and two other tenants, Marie-Therese and Joumana, who live on floors above and below her. Translating a translation is also Aaliya’s way of avoiding critique that she may have mutilated or misrepresented the original.The book is largely plotless, and we follow Aaliya in her daily peregrinations: to the museum where she takes regular refuge, on her walks about the city which is building back after much devastation, and in her reminiscences of times past, especially during the war when her space was invaded by Israeli soldiers and she defended it with her Kalashnikov. There are not a lot of nice people here, but they hide their ugliness with makeup, hairstyling, and pedicures. And there is a lot of overwriting: one particular scene, a visit to her mother to atone, took twenty pages, and the symbolic “washing of the feet” took eight pages.Two people influenced Aaliya’s life: Ahmed the Palestinian freedom fighter, 15 years her junior and the only man who made love to her; and Hannah, 15 years her senior, who inveigled herself into Aaliya’s in-laws’ family through a comedy of matrimonial errors and stayed connected until her suicide. Aaliya sees herself intractably following Hanna’s tragic trajectory with sleep deprivation, loss of love, loss of family, and isolation being the contributors – hence the maniacal reliance on literature to provide answers to the difficult moments of her life.And there is a lot of literature in this book – it’s most endearing feature to me. I lost count of the number of authors and their work that were discussed here. Some stuck out for me, for they were mentioned more than in passing: Fernando Pessoa, Danilo Kiš, and W.G. Sebald. There are even writers for suicide: Hemingway, Plath, Wolf et al. I also liked the descriptions of situations or people:Israelis: “Jews who have misplaced their humor.”Civil War Soldiers: “Young men in clean uniforms who were able to shoot people while gnawing at a kebab and drinking a Pepsi.”On Translation: “It helps time flow more regularly.”A pivotal event at the end (no spoiler, so I will not describe the event) forces Aaliyah to re-evaluate her choices and translation process, for the better, we hope. It also proves to her that the Three Witches are actually good people and may be able to help her re-engage with humanity. For me, the added lesson was: “Back-up all your work and don’t leave it to chance.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2022","Jan 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18114449-an-unnecessary-woman

Yet, in our flIf the life of our planet could be distilled down to a 24-hour day, then plants arrived at noon and humans at four seconds to midnight. Yet, in our flawed wisdom, man is endowed with consciousness while trees are not. This novel is an attempt to redress the balance.This is a book about trees, and literary writing, sometimes excessive, always lyrical and beautiful. You will hear of many species, common and uncommon, about their origins, characteristics, and quirks. Many grow through an interconnected root system underground for centuries before daring to pop their heads into view only for us to cut them down for profit or aesthetics. The author and the characters are unequivocal in their plea, “What you make from a tree must be as miraculous as what you cut down.”At first, one wonders whether this is a collection of short stories about nine unconnected characters with diverse backgrounds such as lawyer, artist, actuary, academic, war vet, computer programmer, engineer, and dendrologist. The first part of the book covers their life stories, and these were the most interesting to me. All of them have a sense of mission, derived from different stimuli and life experiences. The next three parts, aptly given tree references: Roots, Crown, and Seeds, show how the characters were brought together in a unified cause to save the three-percent of old-growth trees left on the planet. Some become activists, other’s anarchists, other’s become defenders, and other’s custodians; one even decides to use cyberspace to invade our minds with tree-consciousness.Much of the anarchist scenes seem to be based on real-life events that happened in locales like Fall Creek, Oregon, and which are still taking place in flashpoints like Fairy Creek, Vancouver Island. These confrontations between logger and protestor provide the dramatic elements of this book. Despite temporary delays and legal injunctions arising from protestor antics such as tree sits, chaining humans to trees, or laying them across roads tied to concrete blocks, there is a sense that the activists will be slowly ground into submission in the name of progress, in our desire to “cover the globe with row crops for the care and feeding of our species before the doomsday clock strikes midnight.” When one such protest goes wrong, and an anarchist dies, that starts the question in the activists’ minds: “Were we right? Did we accomplish anything, really?” It also leads to betrayals and to the destruction of something beautiful that was built-up between them. Which brings me to the writing. Watch it when the writer drifts off into describing trees in the middle of the story – he seems to love it and loves to get lost in them woods! He comes back to base however, with a zinger sentence that sums up his walkabout and makes its connection to the story. But those lyrical, staccato deviations say a lot about trees, if you care to listen. Maybe he is trying to test whether we are listening, for to date, no one is.I picked up some profound wisdom from these ancient growth trees and the activists:- You and the tree come from a common ancestor.- Restoration must come on the trees’ timeline not the humans.’- Exponential growth in a finite system leads to collapse.- Beliefs must be considered delusional if they are in keeping with societal norms.- Trees talk to each other and work in teams for self-preservation.Just like Professor Patricia Westerford’s great speech and final act of theatre on behalf of the trees, that would be forgotten in days, this book stands as an attempt to change our conception of trees and their importance to our ecosystem. Books alone will not do that, despite them winning prestigious awards like the Pulitzer. Frankly, I prefer the crippled computer genius Neelay’s approach to warping our minds with tree-consciousness to make the shift happen. Perhaps, someone should be talking to Mark Zuckerberg as he develops the Metaverse and get him to inject some Tachigali versicolor into his formula.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jan 14, 2022","Jan 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40180098-the-overstory

The setting is New York City; the plot is pretty much presented on the first page: a detective is hired to keep tabs on a writer, or vice versa. The job is tedious, for the writer does nothing except sit in his room and write, and take occasional walks around the neighbourhood. The watcher gets careless. After awhile, the watcher realizes that he is the one being watched. Characters who appear in Story 1 reappear in Story 3. In Story 2, they are only known by colours: Blue, Black, White etc. Auster even injects himself into the stories, first as a detective in Story 1, and as, I suspect, the unnamed writer-turned-detective in Story 3.Despite these background similarities, each story is different and can be read and appreciated on its own merits. The demerit, I found, was the heavy “telling” style of Auster, with very little dialogue except at the end of Story 3, which was supposed to reveal the purpose behind all the stories, but which left more questions in my mind as I closed the book.The stories allude to the emptiness and paranoia of the writer’s solitary life, a life spent within the lives of fictional characters, a life spent conjecturing “what if, what then?” Often, the watcher (the detective or writer, depending on the story) is reduced to vagabond or alcoholic status in the pursuit of his mission. Those who try to profit from the writer’s work end up in trouble. The characters mirror other literary luminaries like Hawthorne and Whitman, and we get little-known anecdotes from the lives of these famous writers.At every turn, Auster twists the plot in different directions, giving us reversal and counter reversal, until the watched (and the watcher) disappear into nothing, making us question whether this is all an illusion being conjured by a master puppeteer at the expense of his reader.I wondered about purpose. Despite all the plot and counter-plot maneuvering, what message did this trilogy have for us? Was this assembly of stories merely the early experiments of Auster on his recurring theme of Chance? Was he playing the trickster and seeing how far he could go with his clever tricks? Was he suggesting that we are all pawns in the workings of Chance, a random inevitability we cannot escape from, and that all we can hope for is to emerge from its clutches not-too-worse for wear? Was it a cry for help?Well, you’ll have to find out, by plunging into this fictional labyrinth....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jan 08, 2022","Jan 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/431.The_New_York_Trilogy

Le Carré’s final novel, somewhat incomplete in my mind, deals with the aging spy who turns against his masters after witnessing the horrors of war, and lives to tell the tale (we think) instead of getting shot at the dividing line between East and West.Two story lines converge: (a) that of Proctor, a Service veteran investigating a leak alerted by one of his star operatives, Deborah, and (b) that of the foster parent-child relationship that springs up between the enigmatic ex-spy Edward (Deborah’s husband) and Julian, a hotshot investment banker who has given it all up to run a bookshop in a coastal town and further the cause of literature.Both Edward and Julian are driven by causes, both had bad parents, both are outsiders in their respective worlds. Julian had unfulfilling experiences in London that made him retreat to a small town and invest in a fragile enterprise with indeterminate rewards; Edward, once anti-catholic, anti-Fascist, and anti-imperialist, becomes a Communist but reverts back when the Cold War exposes the underbelly of the East, and then in later years is completely disillusioned with his western masters when he is exposed to the horrors of Bosnia. From their first casual meeting in the bookshop, a symbiotic relationship develops between the two men, and Julian goes along with Edward’s plans for the expansion of his new venture, knowing that all is not as it is cracked out to be, but unable to get off the path he has embarked on with the older man.Deborah, on the other hand, is an old empire loyalist, respected by her handlers and given special privileges like secure access to top secret networks. She is overtly racist, calling her mixed-race grandson a Sambo. She is also dying of cancer, which makes Proctor’s job that more urgent to uncover the leak that has emanated from her estate, Silverview. For this novel, Le Carré has decided to bring the Cold War from across the Berlin Wall and into the living room at Silverview.In the course of Proctor’s investigations, we are exposed to the evolution of the Cold War spy and their oft repeated question “We didn’t do much to alter the course of human history, did we?” Disillusionment leads to betrayal and illness in the case of Edward and Deborah.This book could have done with about fifty more pages of character buildup, particularly with Deborah, her daughter Lucy, and the two women who influenced Edward and “turned” him: Ania and Salma. Le Carré is known for his weak female characters and that is evident here. I also found the lack of quotes for dialogue in some lines and the presence of them in others, the arbitrary flipping between present and past tense (for effect? it had the opposite effect on me!) and the ruminations of some of the characters that would suddenly pop up on the page, to be all examples of sloppy writing—perhaps Le Carré had given up on being crowned a literary writer, was keen to get this one finished and out of the way, and used the shortest routes wherever possible.I also found the afterword by Nick Cornwell unnecessary—sure this book was about some dark secrets in the service being outed, about dissention in the ranks, but weren’t all the Smiley books also about interdepartmental rivalry and skirmishing, and even sabotage? Perhaps the goings-on at a country estate like Silverview had really taken place, and this retelling was cutting closer to the bone?I think this final Le Carré novel will carry through to best-sellerdom (I think it may have already arrived there even before the book was released) purely on the nostalgia of his fans wanting one last drag of this murky world of Cold War spies, a world that has now morphed into something more sinister and bloody....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Dec 30, 2021","Dec 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58133677-silverview

The wide assortment of writers also makes for a diversity of styles, forcing the reader to regroup with fresh eyes and a new set of allowances before beginning each piece.A good read for those who want great experiences in life, but realize that they only have a limited time to pack it all in.

He claims he has never slept with Catherine. In fact, as the story unravels, he seems choosy about the women he allows into his heart, a conditioning perhaps of his shadowy life in the Service. He is suddenly summoned to London; an investigation is underway to determine “improprieties” in the deaths of Alec Leamas and Elizabeth Gold. The children of these victims are suing the state and the individuals responsible for damages. As Smiley is nowhere to be found, Guillam is the obvious sitting duck to take the fall, if indeed skulduggery had been afoot around the Berlin Wall in 1962.The story is revealed through a combination of interrogations, reminiscences, reports, letters, and tape recordings – a handy method, for large swaths of time can be jumped without causing any jerkiness to the story.In the course of the exploration of this cold case, we are exposed to the events and outcomes of Operation Windfall, a case involving the usual double-cross, triple-cross, and quadruple-cross that is associated with the Circus. And to department politics between Smiley’s Covert Operations and Bill Haydon’s Joint Steering group. Haydon is not only hated as a bureaucratic rival, he has also slept with Smiley’s wife. In Windfall, Alec Leamas, the tragic character of Spy...is running a network of agents in Berlin, one that had literally fallen into his hands, when the prime candidate, a much abused woman in the Stasi HQ has to be exfiltrated. Guillam is recruited to help and for once lets a woman into his heart, a definite no-no in the Service, one that even gets Smiley upset with his protegé. The operation does not go well (which one ever does in the spy business, when there is so much room for double crossing across porous intelligence boundaries?). This setback in Operation Windfall is what sends Leamas back to his fate (detailed in Spy…). Guillam lives with the guilt of knowing much of what went on but of having to keep his mouth shut at the time.Of course, all the answers usually lie with George Smiley, and I wondered what the fuss was all about, for when the old man is finally tracked down, he is able to calm the waters and put everything in its right place. Much ado about nothing, I thought - a rather sedate ending to a book where the middle part teemed with the intrigue of Operation Windfall.The take-away for me from this book was not-so much the convoluted and sputtering-out plot, but the masterful depiction of the loneliness endured by cold-war spies, and the utter futility of all that they were engaged in. When the Wall finally came down, they wondered whether their sacrifice had all been worth it – what the heck had they achieved other than turn their lives into wastelands? They were able to conceal, but unable to love. And the statute of limitations did not seem to apply to them, for Guillam was hauled out after 50 years to face the music. Smiley has the last words of wisdom to claw back some meaning into their occupation: “We were never pitiless. We had the larger pity.” He was all-knowing about the frailty of others, while stoically refusing to acknowledge his own.

Therefore, I was ready for the anachronisms, the misogyny, the archaic technology and spying techniques, the introspection, the deception. But there was more.Set in Bonn, a temporary capital, “a house draped in Catholic black and guarded by policemen,” and the eponymous small town in Germany of the book’s title, the plot hovers around a British embassy official who has gone missing with valuable documents on the eve of a Neo Nazi demonstration to be held in the city, and on the eve of Britain’s bid to enter the European Union with the support of Germany against the opposition of France.The omniscient narrator seems to lose himself between the dialogue and the action, for sometimes I found it hard to figure out who was saying what, or what was happening, but it all jelled in the end because there was a lot of overwriting that amounted to the author philosophizing or trying to raise his prose above genre into literary – much of it dispensable.Suffice to say that the action centres around the British Embassy in Bonn and its staff, its cloistered life, its protocols, its hierarchy (A level staff do not fraternize with B level staff, and so on), and its secrets.The missing official, Harting, is a German émigré to Britain who threw his lot in with his adopted country against the Nazis. His hunter is Turner, a brutal and relentless security official who tries to get into the mind of the hunted and gain understanding of his quarry. Much of the investigation hovers around Turner’s obsession with minutia: what did Harting eat, who did he have sex with, what did he dress, what were his movements before he went missing – obsessive to the point of me wanting to drop this book midway. However, the plot gradually emerges—mostly through dropped threads in innocuous dialogue—into something larger than anticipated, and the last few chapters are unputdownable. What bothered me was Turner’s relentless hounding of the British Chief of Chancery, Bradfield, and the other embassy staff and their wives, goading them on, ostensibly to provide the reader information we are unable to derive from the narrative – a sort of double agent of a kind. An oft-used device, but one to be used sparingly these days, even by genre authors. Turner is abusive and not above beating-up women in the course of his investigation, especially when Harting grows in his mind into a sympathetic character worth saving instead of sacrificing. Britain and its representatives are portrayed as the bad guys, hedging their bets with all players, German Feds and Neo Nazis alike, and willing to sell their people down the river if it benefited them. They have conveniently ended the persecution of war criminals and handed that task over to the Germans who grin and nod at the many with shady pasts who are in positions of power without sanction. As Bradfield says, “Hypocrisy is a virtue of the British. We are a corrupt nation.” He even has a reason for why they are pursuing their quarry: “Harting has broken the law of forgetting, of moderation.”Despite its jerky narrative style—and I put this down to the book being one of the earlier works of the author—this shorter Le Carré novel has a particular charm in capturing the small town in Germany, Bonn, and its political events before it vanished into the background by becoming just another German city after the re-unification of the country and the restoration of the original capital, Berlin....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Dec 08, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/399737.A_Small_Town_In_Germany

Roser is the little shepherd girl with a talent for music who was encouraged by consecutive music masters, one to adopt her, and the other to mentor and gift her a grand piano. Being brought together under these forced circumstances, Victor and Roser don’t love each for the first twenty years of their association, preferring to focus on raising love-child Marcus instead, maintain a home, and pursue their separate careers. They take lovers and face the pressures of being strangers in a foreign land that is also heading the way of Spain. Real characters like Pablo Neruda and Salvador Allende enter the story, and so do a lot of peripheral and unnecessary events that give the impression that the author is trying to write an autobiographical novel, drawing more from memory than from imagination and craft.Victor and Roser, being leftists on the proletarian side of the tracks, get involved with a right wing bourgeoisie family, the del Solars, soon after arriving in Chile, and this interplay of political extremes at the micro-level mirrors the larger conflict going on at the national level. Through a forbidden romance that blossoms between Victor and Ofelia del Solar, the two families are indelibly linked. And yet when the light bulb finally does go on for Victor, he discovers that Roser is the only woman who loved him deeply, as he did her.When Salvador Allende (and Neruda?) is murdered and the Fascist Pinochet takes over, Victor faces deja-vu: being stripped of his privileges as a doctor and sent into prison and exile, just like it had happened to him in Spain. Yet, over the course of his life, he builds and re-builds, even spending 10 years in Venezuela in a hospital for the poor while his status in Chile is being re-evaluated; he is the perennial immigrant outsider. “My life has been a series of journeys,” he concludes on his 80th birthday when he receives another surprise that sets him up for yet another journey. The characters and the middle part of the book sagged for me, for this is a very “told” story, and Isabel Allende seems anxious to cram in every chronological detail associated with the real-life characters who possibly gave birth to the fictional ones, even if some details are unnecessary. What is skillfully depicted however, are the extremes of political life in a young Chile struggling between the landed gentry and the impoverished masses, the dangers of escaping an imploding Spain as the Nationalists swoop to conquer, the barbaric practices of Franco and Pinochet, the duplicity of the Catholic Church who is a loyal supporter of both Fascist regimes, and the uncertainty of life for refugees fleeing dictatorships. The possibility of going missing, either abducted or lost in battle, is ever present in these conflicts; Victor and Roser witness a lot of people disappearing in their lives.Despite Victor’s conditioned despondence from all he has endured in life, there are rewards for him at the end of the road when the mystery of what unites the right and left wings of his extended family are revealed, rooting him firmly in Chile.A good book to be read for the history of this period of Spain and Chile, but not so much for its novelistic elements....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Dec 2021,"Dec 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45897568-a-long-petal-of-the-sea

His father, Donald, has been dead a year, and the residual Ryan family, mother Linda, sister Mary, and Draper are now boarded with the matriarchal head, the widowed and childless Aunt Phil. Everyone in this family is childless except for Draper’s father: uncles Fr. Francis, Fr. Seymour, and Reginald, and aunt Sr. Louise – all barren of seed whether by choice or circumstance. The family owns a newspaper, a funeral home, an orphanage, and a convent. One begins to wonder whether Draper’s father, who used to pull all-nighters at the newspaper and disappear for periods on end, was really happy with his marital and progenitor status.The body of the book is concerned with Draper’s ineffectual attempts to succeed in this world of secrets, convention, shame and guilt. He is sub-par at everything: at hockey (his passion), singing, tap dancing, and boxing – all mandatory requirements at “Fr. Seymour’s Number” an elite band of students into whose claws Draper is thrust by virtue of him being the only male member of the next generation of Divine Ryans. Draper’s feeble attempts at these endeavours lead to some embarrassing and hilarious situations, which led me to believe that this was the classic Newfoundland bildungsroman, replete with panting priests, frustrated widows, suppressed sexual desires, hapless heroes, and rip-roaring humour (family patriarchs go by nicknames such as Stern, Cross, Grim, and Disapproving, for example). And, there is a lot of hockey.Yet, humour apart, strange behaviours continue to occur among various members of the family to suggest that this innocuous comedy will end in something deeper, something tragic: Draper’s worsening sexual dreams, especially those featuring a beast called Momery (half Mom-half sister Mary) that end in the shame of bedwetting; Linda’s own rebellion against the family cloister run by Aunt Phil; Uncle Reginald’s thumbing of his nose at the Catholic rules of the house despite living under Aunt Phil’s aegis and acting as the chief undertaker replete with top-hat, spats, and waistcoat; and of course, the haunting presence of Daddy Donald.Things come to a head when the family sit down to watch the 1967 Stanley Cup final, everyone supporting the Habs, only to see the Maple Leafs win for their last time (until when again, we may never know). The flashbacks that this momentous Stanley Cup match unleash (perhaps that’s why Donald always had a puck in his hand) lead us to the discovery of what went wrong a year ago, and to the circumstances of Donald’s death. It is left with Draper, a loser in everything he has set his hand to so far, to use this knowledge and gain his nuclear family’s freedom from the claustrophobic control of the Ryans.A delightful novel for those interested in Canadiana, and in our pet literary conflict: family dysfunction, given that we have been free of others like wars, droughts, and pestilence for a very long time (this book was published thirty years before Covid-19)....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Nov 24, 2021","Nov 24, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/296743.The_Divine_Ryans

Joseph embodies parental guilt that is bestowed upon children. He agonizes whether, when warned of King Herod’s dastardly plot regarding the Massacre of Innocents, he should have warned the parents of those children who were killed. He goes to save his neighbour during the revolt of the Jews, led by Judas the Galilean, and ends up foreshadowing his son’s crucifixion.The traditional Angel Gabriel is a dubious character, visiting Mary several times, not just at the Annunciation, to remind her about what has been foretold. He even hangs around with Jesus for four years in the desert, teaching him the arts of animal husbandry. Except that when Gabe coaches his protégé to take a sheep for his sexual needs, we begin to wonder about this guy’s bona fides.But it is God who is the most revelatory. Eager to expand his believers beyond the paltry tribes of Jews to encompass the entire world, He sees Jesus as the most likely instrument of that conquest. Yet, the trail of carnage and martyrdom to follow will be long before this goal is reached, if it ever will. In fact, the list of martyrs runs for three whole pages in the book. When asked by Jesus why He can’t do this job Himself, God responds that he is on collegial terms with the other gods, and gods don’t steal believers from each other.Jesus comes across as a sincere, forthright and humane person, subject to the desires of the flesh, and plagued by the sins of both his earthly father and his heavenly one. He lives openly with Mary Magdalene, and drives Mary’s sister Martha to jealousy when she can’t have him. Yet, he is endowed with this other cross, the ability to perform miracles, that is making him a celebrity along the banks of the Sea of Galilee. Wherever he goes, the fish gather, and where the fish gather, believers gather. However, he refrains from raising the dead, for in the Magdalene's words, “No one has committed so much sin that they need to die twice.” The other miracles, however, happen, more or less, according to the biblical record. Although, if you are looking for those forty days spent in the desert with the Devil, how about forty days spent on a boat with God AND the Devil instead? Jesus tries to outwit God from his megalomaniacal plan, but has to succumb to the Father who is a master trickster. Even Jesus's best friend, Judas, who is actually a good guy in this narrative, has to succumb to the lines that were written for him by the Almighty. However, there are good Pharisees in this version.On the text, as with Saramago’s other books, I stumbled through dense paragraphs which included dialogue, separated only by commas when two or more people were speaking, all packed into thick blocks of pages that go on forever. This is a Saramago trait, something that separates him from the pack, but it is also the most annoying. Given that this is a gospel story, that is, a very “told” one, the style is less abrasive and congruent with the period and setting, but one needs patience to read this book, or any Saramago book. That said, he is the master storyteller, refining the art of “what if, what then” to a high standard.I found this version of the Gospel more accessible – the divine component was lowered, the human component raised. Even the Immaculate Conception was more palatable in this version, in the way it was executed. And the twist behind the ultimate death of Jesus was a hook that sat better with me than the traditional one of him butting heads with Imperial Rome on behalf of his Father’s Kingdom.If you have no religious hang-ups, or feel that your fundamental beliefs would not be shaken, read this book for its allegorical value....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2021","Nov 17, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28859.The_Gospel_According_to_Jesus_Christ

Father Ronnie, and David’s nemesis, was a confidence trickster on the grand scale (football pools, airlines, real estate, international trading, even trading on his son’s reputation – Daddy had done it all, and gone to jail many times for his transgressions); his mother deserted the family when David was a child. David learned early in life to mistrust love, which made him a good spy. He was a recluse and bloomed late – and when he did, he went full bore.He was recruited by MI5 and MI6 as an agent while still in school, and later worked for both agencies despite their different missions and work cultures (MI5 was for old war vets and MI6 was for idealistic university grads from posh families). He was a budding poet and cartoonist, but took to writing because he was bored. Given his family connections, he had no problem getting into the publishing world and bypassing the starving writer route. His third novel, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, launched him to worldwide fame and allowed him to retire from the Foreign Office (much to the FO’s relief, although he always portrayed Britain on the winning side, warts and all).He was lucky to come of age as a writer when the Cold War was at its height and spying was fashionable. Yet he craved the recognition of a literary writer—like Somerset Maugham, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Stephen King also did—despite making millions in his pigeon-holed genre. That recognition never came, and he reacted badly to critical s. In fact, once, he departed from the beaten path to write the novel The Naïve and Sentimental Lover, modeled on a love triangle between him and his closest friends, the Kennaways, only to be so badly beaten up in the press that he ran back to his cold but comfortable world of spies. The book gives considerable air-play to each of his novels, to their genesis, reception in the marketplace, s, and spin-offs such as films and television series, and to Le Carré’s rigorous drafting regimen and on-site research that often took him into dangerous terrain. Despite his introverted nature, he was ruthless with agents and publishers, negotiating tough deals and ditching his promoters, even long-standing ones, at the slightest hint of non-performance. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Le Carré had to regroup and cast abroad for other conflict zones to serve as backdrops for his fiction. Gradually his writing took on a polemical tone of fighting for the marginalized: prisoners in Guantanamo, Africans bilked by multi-nationals, and refugees, among others. He was anti-political correctness, and he could afford to be, given his giant media profile, yet he got into a feud with Salman Rushdie over the publication of The Satanic Verses (Le Carré was one of the few writers who opposed the book’s publication) They remained lifelong antagonists – perhaps it was good for book sales, for both of them!.Le Carré was happiest while writing and would remove himself from his family to travel the world or hide away in a nook where he could write undisturbed. Writing was his therapy from the shocks of love denied in childhood. His writing tips are interesting:1)	Begin the story as late as you can2)	Write out key sentences and put them on the wall3)	Rewrite4)	Don’t be afraid to throw away 18 months of work.This is a good book for writers, if you are not going to lapse into despondency under the shadow of this man, who couldn’t seem to write a bad book and who became a one-man book industry, a man of privilege who took the side of the underdog in his writing and profited hugely from it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Nov 10, 2021","Nov 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22535415-john-le-carr

And he couldn’t have picked better with the flamboyant and flawed Paul Gaugin and his equally left-of centre grandmother, Flora Tristan, in the last phases of their lives.This is a classic rendition by Llosa, told in alternating chapters for each character, in third and second person voices that weave and blend into the narrative – a dislocated style perfected throughout his oeuvre. The second person voice acts as the conscience of Paul and Flora, reminding them, even accusing them, of past deeds and misdeeds, taking them back in time to pivotal events that shaped their characters.Paul and Flora are opposites: she is chaste and dislikes sex after having fled from her brutal husband Chazal, who pledged his life thereafter to kidnapping their children from her. Paul, on the other hand, finds sex regenerative, and is pedophilic, with a curiosity for cannibalism. Flora dedicates her life to work for the rights of women and workers who are exploited in mid-19th century Europe, while Paul wants to flee the bourgeoisie life for the far corners of civilization – Tahiti, and when that place gets polluted, the Marquesas Islands. However, his grandmother’s spirit takes over in the end and Paul launches his own crusade against the French colonial authorities for their cruel treatment of the local Maori islanders.The canvas of Europe in 1841, when Flora sets off on tour of France, is full of organizations intent on reversing capitalism. There are Fourierists, Saint-Simonians, Evadamists, Icarists – all intent on creating utopian societies to flee the prevailing oppressive one for the underprivileged, a place where men and women would be equal, workers well compensated, and sex would be unbridled (or bridled, depending on the group). Flora is touting her latest book and manifesto, The Worker’s Union, but finds that her audiences of the downtrodden are so dumb and scared that few find wisdom in her words or are able to act on them. The Church and the French authorities are scared of her message of insurrection and are intent on shutting her down.Paul’s life too is one of struggle: the vivid colours and sexually charged imagery of Tahiti that infiltrate his post-Impressionist painting takes long to find acceptance in Europe where aficionados are more intent on grabbing the work of the now dead Vincent Van Gogh while blaming Gauguin for the demise of the “mad Dutchman” after their tragic life together in Arles. If there is one redeeming feature in the sex addicted and syphilitic Gauguin, it is his conviction to give up the life of a wealthy stock-broker and follow his calling of the starving artist, to capture Polynesian life on canvas, even if that means abandoning his formal Danish wife and five children. But he wasn’t deprived of sex in his remote new home, for I lost track of the number of 13-14 year old Maori women he bedded and abandoned, some with child.Llosa is Peruvian, and we discover that Flora had a Peruvian father from an aristocratic family, and that both she and Paul spent time in Peru, although neither of them got a share of the immense family fortune in that country. Instead, Flora lands in the middle of a civil war while in Arequipa, which amounts to a comedy of errors, and has to flee for her life – another lesson that affirms her determination to be a social justice activist.Given the spectre of death lurking around Flora and Paul, this is a tragic book. However, it rings up the flag for those who go against the grain and follow their star, no matter how unpopular it is, and no matter what personal hardship must follow that decision. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2021","Nov 02, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1148628.The_Way_to_Paradise

The story is narrated by Isabel in her 70th year, looking back on her life from ages 30-40 when she stood toe to toe with Valdivia, suffered starvation, repulsed continuous attacks by the indigenous Mapuche, and prevailed to set up the capital city of Santiago, thus setting the stage for subsequent waves of Spanish to settle the land and push back the incumbents, with gold, land, and slaves as their reward.For those wanting to know how brutal the Spanish conquistadors were, this book pulls no punches: executions, torture, rape, pillage, and betrayal were de rigueur. Even Ines, when pushed to the limit, does not stop at lopping off a few heads. And just like Pizarro conquering Peru with 150 men, Valdivia sets off to claim Chile with 13 Spaniards and 1500 disposable Yanacona slaves. Battles are won on a ratio of 1:1000 between Spanish and Mapuche, due to the former’s superior strength compounded by horses, armour, guns, and swords. And when hospitality is shown by the locals towards “the bearded pale faces who come in floating houses from across the sea” the Spanish return the courtesy by robbing and raping their hosts. The Spanish camp is riddled with disunity and conspirators lurking to topple the established order at the slightest opening. How such fragile groups could go onto found nations is baffling. Valdivia is the most complex character. Married to a frigid woman aged 13, he flees to the new world as much to escape her, as to seek fame and glory, and leave his mark on the world, being sterile himself. He strives to rise above the lust that plagues man (sometimes, he fails) and set up a just society based on hard work, away from the greed and corruption of Peru. He meets Inez in Cusco while she is on the hunt for her husband, Juan, who had introduced her to the art and deviations of sex and abandoned her for the new world. Ines and Valdivia are soul mates and strike it off in their first encounter. Ines abandons her quest for Juan and sets off with Valdivia to Chile instead, inducting him into the sensuous arts she has learned.Conquest does not prove easy, for the Mapuche plant their own Manchurian Candidate within the ranks of the Spanish to learn the latter’s war strategy and tactics. When the “sleeper” is activated, Valdivia faces his real challenge, and the novel moves through to a thrilling but inevitable climax.Ines prevails as the Matriarch of Santiago, immersed in healing the sick, organizing meagre resources, growing food, and inspiring her citizens to prevail against all odds—and she comes through. Valdivia, is not so fortunate, for he is beset by the pressures of Royal authority to make unethical decisions and preserve his own status, which extends to abandoning his loved ones and viciously punishing those who don’t toe the party line. “We reap what we sow” applies to this couple.Allende is brilliant in being able to take us back to this period and immerse us in its tragic brutality....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Oct 20, 2021","Oct 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3300.In_s_of_My_Soul

Hannah disappeared in a rogue wave that swept their tourist boat off the coast of New Brunswick and was presumed dead at the time; however a You Tube video later revealed her attending a wedding in Oaxaca, Mexico in the company of some bad looking hombres.Matthew’s search takes him from New Brunswick to Mexico and then to Salisbury, England where he seems to be shadowed by bad guys and yet helped out in trouble spots by good angels who keep appearing and reappearing along his journey. I wondered whether the author was pulling from a tour he had taken to these places, for Matthew plays the quintessential tourist, doing touristy things as he searches for clues. Scenes in in all three locations are well described – good, if you plan to take a similar tour.The recovery of Hanna seems to end up rather passively until Matthew returns to Toronto where the real showdown begins. The reason for Hannah’s kidnapping is a bit flimsy – a lot of trouble to go to to add another prostitute to a human trafficking ring, when a visit to a poorer European country, or the luring of illegal immigrants to the UK would have sufficed—unless the Canadian Hannah was the bait draw in Matthew. This made me wonder whether the detective story really needed to happen in order for us to get to the real battle between the powers of good vs. evil. The ending was your typical Marvel comics superhero battle which went over the head of this reader looking for a good detective story.The other limitation I found was that this short novel, with very short chapters, had a heck of a lot of characters in it, limiting the author’s ability to flush each one out properly; apart from Matthew, everyone else was just a name carrying out a specific action to advance the plot. But if you want a page turning, fast-paced plot, this is a book for you.I recall the black magic books of Dennis Wheatley from half a century ago, where the occult was layered over the war-time spy genre, and that seemed to work, for Wheatley spent more time developing his characters and the theory behind the magic, and placing it at a time when the world was in turmoil during WWII – evil was expected to be walking the land. Wheatley’s books were also quite long. Given our shrinking attention spans today, we have no time for Wheatley, but then I wonder with books like The Rogue Wave, which are paired to the bone, whether we can do justice to this mixing of genres without slumping into cartoon faire?  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 11, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56390668-the-rogue-wave

Home is no longer home, and they must journey to el norte to reclaim themselves. The entire book is based on their harrowing journey, one undertaken by thousands of displaced people in Mexico and Central and South America today, who head singly, in groups, or in convoys to the United States in search of a better life. This is a story that must be told, given that political leaders have risen and fallen, walls have been erected and dismantled, illegals have been deported and granted amnesty, and no one wants to tackle root causes that will keep people in their home countries without ever being pushed to seek shelter elsewhere. Without going into the many twists and turns that drive this plot-driven story forward, all I can say it is that it is a riveting read. Lydia and Luca not only have to contend with the poetry-loving, psychopathic cartel leader, Javier, who is on their tail, they have to deal with border patrols on both sides, bandits, vigilantes, fast-moving freight trains, the unforgiving Sonoran desert, and flash floods. Everyone’s loyalty is suspect because the Cartel is the defacto government in these countries south of the border, and almost everyone works for the Cartel in order to save their lives – a sad indictment, especially of Mexico, a full-fledged trading partner with the USA and Canada in NAFTA.Despite the thrilling plot, I found some discordant notes in character, voice, and pacing. On character: I found Luca spoke like a professor most of the time, even when he was in danger; it was hard to reconcile the poetic and romantic Javier with his homicidal tendencies – murderers don’t apologize for their actions; and the two rural girls, Soledad and Rebeca, acted like townies. On voice: although the bulk of the narrative switched between Lydia’s and Luca’s third person voices, the author found it convenient to slide into other minor characters’ heads from time to time to cover pertinent details, which rang out the false notes for me – but this is only a personal peeve, other’s may not mind or notice. I would have preferred this being Lydia’s story, narrated only from her point of view, for her anguish in trying to protect her son at every twist and turn was present throughout. As for pacing: the fast pace of the first three chapters was slowed down by excessive (but well painted) detail of the land and people being encountered, and the book slumped into a slower middle component before picking up pace again at the end – a hybrid literary-thriller novel.I know this book came in for a lot of criticism about cultural appropriation by the author of Latino stereotypes. However, her Author’s Note at the end is a brave testament to her motives and to the level of research she performed in order to capture this other Overland Railroad to freedom. In the words of a Latin scholar she interviewed: “We need as many voices as we can get, telling this story,” and they motivated her to press on, and I’m glad she did. For if writers, especially fiction writers, cannot “lie to tell a higher truth” then why do we exist?I also hope that governments sincerely work to root out problems like narcos to give their citizens the ability to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in their own countries without having to seek these inalienable rights elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Oct 03, 2021","Oct 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046527-american-dirt

While her sleuth, Temperence (Tempe) Brennan hasn’t aged much over that time span, Reichs has managed to keep herself current, even delving into the world of vaccines and mRNA for this, her 20th, novel in the Tempe series.The plot is simple, two bodies of women are found washed up in a container in Charleston, South Carolina, a copy-cat killing of two other females fifteen years ago in Montreal, Quebec which is still unsolved. Approaching the crimes as a forensic anthropologist, Tempe recreates possible scenarios until we get down to an anti-vaxxer’s dream conspiracy. Given Reichs’ dual locations in South Carolina and Quebec, Tempe herself flits between the new case and the cold one, and has two able-bodied assistants—boyfriend Ryan in Quebec and tough cop Voslowsky in South Carolina—to help her out when she is in the other location. That Reichs writes her books two years before they are published, and that this book is set in Oct 2021 and was published earlier this year, she obviously missed the entire Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 in the first draft, for this plot hovers around another epidemic: captocytophaga or capno, transmitted by cats and dogs to humans. The subsequent Covid pandemic had to be obviously filled into the manuscripts in subsequent drafts for veracity, and the pandemic, I’m sure, gives a boost to the mRNA connection in the plot, although how the Covid scenario actually played out in 2021 is not that accurately depicted. The book also must have found an instant audience with anti-vaxxers who saw the possibilities for Big Pharma to manipulate us lab rats by saying, “See, even Kathy Reichs is writing about it.” And yet the book poses interesting questions and shows how a twisted and selfish person with access to knowledge and opportunity can wreak havoc on society. In that sense this book is timely, and is a compulsive read.However, fast-paced plot notwithstanding, I was put off by the casual and hurried writing, as if Reichs was contractually on a timer to finish this book while mRNA was fresh on everyone’s mind. The fragmented sentences or predicate-only sentences, the contrivances, the information conveniently provided when needed, the constant conjecturing and summing up, the blatant punchlines at the end of every chapter to get us into the next one—all got to me after awhile and I wondered whether best-selling authors were at least obligated to write good English, given that so many were reading their books.

However, its maxims have permeated society and still enter the conversation be it in literature, politics, gender, race, history, architecture, music or art.Postmodernism seems to have emerged as an antidote to mainstream Anglo-American liberal philosophical thought that was deemed to be accessible to all in an “ordinary language” with maximum clarity. The postmodernist attitude was therefore one of suspicion which bordered on paranoia and, despite its Marxist affiliations and political aspirations, was never intended to fit into anything like this kind of consensual and cooperative framework. It is therefore anti-grand narrative, anti-history, anti-colonial, and anti-empirical science. A typical postmodernist conclusion: universal truth is impossible, and relativism is our fate.I was particularly interested to note that some of the most difficult books of literature I have read, or attempted to read, were by postmodernist writers, notably Beckett (see my  of his Molloy Trilogy that took me years to finish), Pynchon (whom I abandoned halfway),Nabokov, Fowles and Auster, the latter three authors whose books I did finish reading, but concluded that they preferred to dwell in states of altered reality or madness. In fact, Butler posits that “The postmodernist novel doesn’t try to create a sustained realist illusion: it displays itself as open to all those illusory tricks of stereotype and narrative manipulation, and to multiple interpretation in all its contradiction and inconsistency, which are central to postmodernist thought.”This short book, termed “a very short introduction” – thank God, for it got into various arguments and viewpoints that seemed to circle back to the key points that I am trying to extract in this  — covers other areas of human endeavour where postmodernism has left its footprint: painting, music, architecture and language. However, the dominant characteristic is postmodernism’s anarchic stance and desire to turn the established order on its head and leave us open to many interpretations of the truth. Postmodernism, being mainly on the side of the subordinated and marginalized, has been a boon for feminists, race and gender activists, prisoners, and the criminally insane. Many of the pro-marginalized movements born in the last 50 years could be seen as manifestations and extensions of postmodernist thought.The author displays his bias when he says:  “Postmodernists are by and large pessimists, many of them haunted by lost Marxist revolutionary hopes and the belief that the art they inspire is often negative rather than constructive.”However, Butler leaves the door open to freedom of choice when he concludes, “But it is important to remember that in the arts, too, alternative traditions persist – and for two main reasons – firstly, because modernist traditions continue, and there are many artists who have learned something from postmodernism without being devoted followers of it.” I myself conclude that I never succumbed to postmodernism although I came of age during this period; my work is more in the realist mode.This is a good primer for those interested in the various artistic and philosophical movements that rise and fall over the ages. Over the last two centuries, they seem to be coming in 50-year intervals, more or less. If that is the case, then postmodernism must have run its course by now, leaving only stains of its ideology embedded in various segments of our society. What comes next?

Despite the deaths, guests are not in short supply at the hotel, with daily arrivals replacing the dead or departed.We come to realize soon enough that the young woman, Anna, is a patient of Dr. Sigmund Freud and has developed neuroses based on an incident she witnessed between the Polish Catholic side of her family and the Russian Jewish one: her mother’s twin sister, her uncle, and Anna’s mother engaged in a tryst on the family yacht when Anna was three years old, while her emotionally distant father was busy at work. Freud’s conclusion: “Anna possessed a craving to satisfy the demand of her libido; at the same time, an imperious demand on the part of some force I did not comprehend, poisoned the well of her pleasure at its source.” The story moves forward ten years to Vienna in 1929, and we meet Lisa Erdmann, aging opera singer. We discover that she is the real Anna, and that Freud was fictionalizing names to publish her case for his medical archives. Lisa corrects some aspects of the case history, confessing that there were still things she hadn’t told Freud. She meets opera diva, Vera, and partner Victor, both Jewish. Circumstances lead to Lisa ultimately marrying Victor and adopting his son Kolya, and moving to Kiev to live with them.Then we fast forward to 1941; the Holocaust is underway. Lisa and Kolya are involved in the tragic Babi Yar massacre (where 30,000 Jews were beaten, shot and dumped into a mass grave, after being lured out of their houses on the ruse that they were being sent into exile in the Promised Land). What is shocking is the imagery that once dogged Lisa/Anna in her youth plays out in diabolic fashion at Babi Yar. I was trying to figure out whether this woman had been prescient all the time, and whether Freud’s passing statement that she was telepathic had more depth than even the learned psychoanalyst had given it. I was left to puzzle out whether it was the past incident on the family yacht or the future one to come in Babi Yar that had bottled up Lisa into a neurotic state, manifesting itself in pains in her left breast and pelvis for most of her life. Anna/Lisa arrives at her Promised Land, and the unresolved issue in her life has a chance of resolution in this place where the milk of human kindness flows freely, like it once did at the white hotel in her youthful dream. And where the refugees arrive daily, suitcases in hand, just as the guests did at the hotel. Yet, her journey to this state has been one of terrible anxiety and suffering.   This was a hard book to get through, although it was thoroughly engaging. The lack of dialogue, until the last chapter, made it a very told story, but I couldn’t have had it any different, for I needed to be caught by the scruff of my neck by the author and pushed toward the startling conclusion....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Sep 04, 2021","Sep 04, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24342904-the-white-hotel

Chris and Kitty lost their only child, two-year-old Oliver, to a fever five years ago which has created a void in their lives.Word arrives from an unusual source, a middle-aged, dowdy, working class, married woman named Margaret, who informs them that Chris has been wounded at the front and is suffering from amnesia. On further grilling by the two noblewomen as to why Margaret has been informed and not them, it transpires that Chris has lost the most recent 15 years of his memory, and only recalls up to the last day he spent with Margaret, with whom he had a romantic liaison at that time. He does not remember Kitty and has only a vague memory of Jenny as a young woman.The action then focuses on bringing Chris back home and rehabilitating him. But he wants nothing to do with his cousin or his wife, in fact, he seems to dislike them and cleaves to Margaret with whom he goes on boat rides and other indulgences that they partook of 15 years ago.The contempt of the upper classes for the those below is obvious in Jenny’s observation: “She (Margaret) was not so much a person as an implication of dreary poverty, like an open door in a mean house that lets out the smell of cooking cabbage and the screams of children. Doubtlessly he (Chis) sat somewhere close to her, lumpishly content. I thought distractedly how necessary it was that Gilbert Anderson (the doctor) should cure him, and tried to shout to her, but found my throat full of sobs.”While Kitty withdraws and is hurt beyond measure, Jenny prevails on Chris: : “Margaret’s old, Chris. She isn’t beautiful any longer. She’s drearily married. She’s seamed and scored and ravaged by squalid circumstances. You can’t love her when you see her.”Physical beauty is the measure of, and impetus to, love among the upper classes, the author seems to imply. For Jenny has an observation on Kitty too: “Beautiful women of her type, they are obscurely aware that it is their civilizing mission to flash the jewel of their beauty before all men, so that they shall desire it and work to get the wealth to buy it, and thus be seduced by a present appetite to a tilling of the earth that serves the future.”The nobility are bound and insulated by their wealth, class, and gracious life. Jenny and Kitty appear to be imprisoned in their country estate, able to describe every, nook, cranny, fruit, and flower in exquisite detail. “The splendid house which was not so much a house as a vast piece of space partitioned off from the universe and decorated partly for beauty and partly to make our privacy more insolent, out of the garden where the flowers took thought as to how they should grow and the wood made as formal as a pillared aisle by forestry.”Margaret emerges as the strong woman in this tale, herself a mother who lost a child of the same age and under the same circumstances as Oliver. It is up to her to make the sacrifice, forsake her own opportunity for love, and introduce the “shock factor” that the Dr. Anderson says is necessary for Chris to return to his present unhappy life – an indictment in itself on the cloying and empty charms of Jenny and Kitty.I found a lot of the action in this book took place in Jenny’s head, and therefore the reader is in the hands of a rather biased, unreliable, yet perceptive narrator.

Both sides of his family (the Jurianszes and Ondatjes) were Jews (or had Jewish connections) who converted to Christianity due to persecution, and then from Catholicism continued to transform into the many Protestant offshoots: Dutch Reformed, Baptist, Anglican, and finally Seventh Day Adventist. Religion is a strong anchor and driver in this family. Loyalty to the British Empire and to its linguistic and cultural legacy is another anchor of the Ceylon Burghers, such that for want of retaining that lifestyle in a fast nationalizing Ceylon, the diaspora to English-speaking countries like Australia and Canada began in 1948, forever removing the Juriansz-Ondatje family from the tropical island they loved.The Burghers are a mixed-race community in Ceylon, formed through the mingling of Portuguese, Dutch and English colonizers and their assorted European workers who administered the country between 1505 and 1948. During the course of their residence in Ceylon, they adapted to each colonial power, learning the new language and religion, and holding administrative positions in the colony. They mixed with the native Sinhala and Tamil communities out of the urgings of their hearts or loins, but preferred to keep those relationships secret unless their partners were from well-to-do families. They were non-political and didn’t engage in the seismic shifts of Independence that gave birth to Nationalism. They resisted learning the local language of Sinhala and, soon after Independence was granted to the colony, were caught flat footed when government jobs began moving to the vernacular. In chronicling the Juriansz-Ondatje family odyssey, much of European and Ceylonese history of the period is revealed, which makes for interesting reading. Burgher history—especially the juicy parts of family scandals, misogyny, battles with the bottle and the race track, religious interference, political and social change, and the steady migration away from the homeland—is also on display. The racial mixing is set very early in the Juriansz-Ondatje family tree. Michael Jurie Jurgen Ondaatje, 53, the first from the maternal side who arrived in Ceylon in the 17th century, took a Sinhala woman, 24, as his mistress when his wife died of tuberculosis; the mistress bore him a son who seeded the rest of the Ceylonese Ondatjes. (apparently the additional “a” fell out of the name due to a quarrel between two brothers.) The Sinhala mystery woman remains unnamed in the family genealogy. Other juicy stories also pepper the narrative: mental illness, alcoholism, gambling, and patricide are some, and I won’t recount them lest they become spoilers.The author’s parents, Benjamin and Edith, and their family of 10 children get the most airplay. By now, having abandoned Dutch for English, and Dutch Reform for Baptist, the family drifts by accident, and design, into the arms of the Seventh Day Adventists. Benjamin is the only holdout, for he drinks and gambles, but the rest become devout SDA advocates and some even work for that organization as ministers and employees. The SDA is also their conduit out of Ceylon, for the organization provides education and employment opportunities abroad for its members. Benjamin is the tragic hero of the piece, with his determined battle to find employment and provide for his children’s education, with his lifelong attachment and promise to the child that died at age two, and with his dream of seeing his sons become doctors being constantly threatened by their call to serve in the SDA organization instead.The author is straightforward about the racism in different sectors of the colonial hierarchy and within the SDA. On the SDA: “The SDA organization in the mission field was firmly bound to the policy that white skins were superior to coloured skins and qualified to live superiorly despite education and other qualities.” On colonial Ceylon: “In the 19th century in Trincomalee and Colombo there were separate bus transport systems for the white British. The native nannies were allowed on these buses only in the care of white children.” On The White Australia Policy his brother faced when being interviewed by the Australian ambassador: “You go and see your uncle the Chief Government Archivist and get me your pedigree for five generations on both your mother’s and father’s sides. I want it under Government Seal.” When an ideological schism took place within the SDA in the 1970’s the family too split along this fault line, so deep were their convictions.The author however falls into the trap of most memoirists when covering such a large family where many members are still alive – he has to be nice to everyone, and that shows up in the flattering and sometimes fawning descriptions of his ancestors: “This lovely mortal”, “This glorious woman”, “There he was, standing like a prince.” That he is a doctor (Benjamin would be proud that at least one in the brood made it through medical school) and not a literary writer comes up in the various medical and biological words used throughout the narrative, like occipital brain, tachycardia, canthus, flatus, faeculent, scapulae, and placenta praevia. And how about this, for a stab at romantic prose: “Edith and Benjamin awakened from a night of velvet richness, emerging from a cocoon full of the inclusions of the nectar of love and sensibility. It was the celestial abode of the merging of flesh and passion.”In concluding his family history, I am glad that Juriansz zeroed in on a core issue with the Burghers. They are a vanishing breed, created by racial admixture and now dissolving via the same process through migration and intermarriage: like Stonehenge, they represent symbols of a historic period, rather than continuing to grow as a cultural or political influence in the world. I’d like to think however, that just like yeast, they have leavened many loaves in other cultures around the world, despite some Jewish roots....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 21, 2021","Aug 21, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44773075-colonial-mixed-blood

The soul-searching by both carries the book.Some Biblical myths are revised: there were two wise men instead of three, and Jesus’s body was supposedly disposed of in a mass grave along with other crucified corpses. Despite these revisions, the author sticks to the Nativity story and to its message of hope. Fundamental in that message is that the ”Kingdom of God lies within and is not external,” testament to the Jews trapped in endless waiting because they expect the Kingdom to come from the outside.The two wise men are portrayed as Middle-Easterners who went to India to study and decided to return home when they were beckoned by a pesky star that wouldn’t let up and disappear. A quote from their Indian guru stuck with me: “Wisdom is like soap. You use it to wash the grime. Then you wash off the soap.”The two most interesting characters are the animals: the Ox and the Donkey, for they are the most intelligent. They narrate their chapters in first person, while the rest are relegated to third person status. The Ox prefers to “chew the cud,” ruminating on the world, convinced that the wild can never be domesticated. The Donkey sees into the future and into the demise of this beautiful baby in the manger; like Balaam’s ass, it also has the last word “You can command a horse, but you have to negotiate with a donkey.”The most interesting factoid was how I came to read this book that is not yet published.

Set in the palace of a maharajah in 1909, in a divided Bengal, itself a proxy for the subsequent partitioning of British India forty years later, the domestic conflicts within mirror those at large in the country.Nikhil is the idealistic Maharajah who believes in a self-reliant India, in freedom and education for the population, including women, and in trade with the outside world. His wife is Bimala, a representation of Mother India, childless despite being married for nine years; in fact, there are no children even in the widowed sister-in law’s family, and I wondered whether Tagore was sending us a message about the barrenness of royalty in India, a social hierarchy heading towards extinction post-Independence. The villain of the peace is Sandip, the greedy and opportunistic Nationalist, who is openly seducing Bimala while enjoying the largesse of her husband. Amul is the loyal acolyte of Sandip, who also bears allegiance to Bimala, and is caught up in the nationalism conflict like the average Indian on the street.The respective philosophies of the principal characters are interesting.

If I am obliged, I would snatch them and filch them. I have anger. I would be angry for my country’s sake.”Sandip: “Man’s chief business is the accumulation of outside material. Those who are masters in the art, advertise the biggest lies in their business, enter false accounts in their political ledgers with their broadest-pointed pens, launch their newspapers daily laden with untruths, and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like flies carrying pestilential germs. I am a humble follower of these great ones.” – shades of the fake news phenomenon that modern politicians engage in, perhaps?Amul: “Do you know, we always insist on Sandip Babu travelling First Class? The greatest weapon of those who rule the world, Sandip Babu has told us, is the hypnotism of their display. To take the vow of poverty would be for them not merely a penance — it would mean suicide.”One wonders why Nikhil continues to prop up Sandip. Is he practicing the philosophy of assuming good intent in everyone, or is he trying to keep his enemies close? Nikhil’s passiveness drives Bimala into the more passionate Sandip who uses flattery to extract favours from her, including influencing her to steal her husband’s money to fuel his cause. When the pangs of conscience interfere, Bimala tries to right the wrong she has committed, and this leads to a series of contrived events that made me wondered whether Tagore, the master of mellifluous prose, got lost in his plotting. Finally, I decided to abandon the threadbare and silly plot and focus on the moral of the story instead.And Tagore’s moral is strong: idealism dies, misguided passion loses, and the tenacious ones live to fight another day. I found the painting of life in a Maharajah’s palace very interesting: men and women eat separately, including husbands and wives; widows are cared for by the in-laws and given status within the family; there are many rooms for the few inhabitants; royalty lead isolated and self-absorbed lives. A good read to gain an understanding of the last days of colonial power in India, as experienced from the local perspective, for there are no British characters in this story at all....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2021","Jul 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/174216.The_Home_and_the_World

The narrator relaying the Time Traveller’s story is also nameless. The Time Traveller arrives in the year 8002701 AD where mankind is divided into two species, the Eloi and the Morlocks. The former are pretty little people who spend their time playing gently, bathing in the river, making love in a half-playful fashion, eating only fruit, and sleeping in groups. “The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay.” And yet that most vital stamp that creates our humanness, “the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young”—doesn’t exist here.The Morlocks, on the other hand, are the meat-eating workers who live underground, the ones who create industry and commerce, and are given to the basest impulses of humanity. They were once subservient to the Eloi, but as the latter atrophied by living their perfect life, the Morlocks have gained ascendence, even eating Eloi for sustenance and terrorising the little people. In a museum dedicated to artifacts from our time, the Time Traveller sees evidence of the futility of ambition and immortality.Our Time Traveller, the quintessential fearless explorer, is able to make quick inferences of what has led to this pass; he escape from the clutches of both the Eloi and the Morlocks, retrieves and refires up his time machine, and returns to the present to tell his story to his unbelieving audience.But those who experience a mind-altering event fall prey to the drug of this new stimulus. Despite the evidence of futility he witnessed in that museum in 8002701 AD, the Time Traveller wants to push the boundaries of his invention and travel even beyond in time to where this world will face extinction. His discovery is disturbing but inevitable. This addiction to time travel is also his undoing. And the vanishing Time Traveller is conclusive evidence to his unbelieving dinner guests, that perhaps they should take him seriously. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 11, 2021","Jul 11, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine

Siobhan has her own mystery to solve: a young Saudi found murdered in his fancy car in Edinburgh. Are the murders related? Given this is fiction, they have to be, even in some remote way, to make the plot work.What follows is alternating chapters between the organized and fully resourced investigation in Edinburgh and the rather country-bumpkin style one in the Highlands. The contrasting styles of city vs. country cop are on display, with Rebus straddling both.Police procedurals are full of mundane office politics, idle chit-chat which sometimes give away clues, dull plodding, CCTV footage, after-work drinking, lots of take-out food eaten on the job, and pots and pots of tea. The life of a cop is pretty empty, is what these books always convey. The private lives of cops are non-existent, relationships are cursory, whatever progeny they have is damaged, vacations are boring, and work is their defining activity. And even cops, and the children of cops, cheat on their spouses. Unlike in P.I murder mysteries where the loop of suspicion is circumscribed to a remembered list of suspects, these cop stories have many more characters, with names, even for just throwaway scenes. Therefore, there are more possible villains and outcomes to choose from, making it nigh impossible for the reader to guess whodunit.Throw in a blackmailing nightclub owner, a wellness centre with offbeat types, an old WWII POW camp with secrets, and a philandering husband of a senior cop, just to add flavour to the story. And the constant emotional neediness of Rebus’s cranky daughter Samantha, to add a millstone to our hero’s neck while he pursues his investigation in a car that refuses to start.Also, trust Rebus and Siobhan to get their killer, trust Rebus to put his life at risk by stubbornly sticking his nose into dangerous territory—fragile health notwithstanding—and trust that there will be linkages between these two random killings at distant ends of Scotland.

It also opened me to the world of the Cthulhu Mythos, a Lovecraft invention that has spawned into fan-fiction and game culture, and which has now evolved beyond the boundaries of its creator’s imagination.The expedition’s geologist is the narrator who receives fragmented radio communications from his advance party about the discovery of a giant mountain range many thousands of feet taller than the Himalayas. They report the recovery of specimens from the foothills of this range which include 14 star-shaped beings that could have been vegetable, animal, or amphibian, and that, once dissected, give off a terrible stench. The advance guard are impatient to continue their exploration without a break. Then radio communications end abruptly following a deadly storm. The narrator and his assistant are left to head out, in the sole airworthy plane, to find out what has happened on the other side of this frozen continent. What follows is a gradual descent into horror, reminiscent of Marlow’s journey into the Heart of Darkness.The rescue party finds all its colleagues dead and the camp destroyed (no spoiler alert as this happens rather early in the narrative) and stumble upon a large lost city created fifty million years ago and abandoned 500,000 years ago when the ice age threatened. The ice also preserved the city under its frozen blanket. Murals on the walls of empty buildings tell the history of this civilization, leading to various revelations: a species from outer space that colonized the earth, a battle between the Old Ones and their creations, the evil Shoggoths, the arrival of the ice, and the retreat of the Old Ones into the ocean to head north. But did they all get away?What is difficult for the reader is that there isn’t a single line of dialogue, and elaborate descriptions are richly embroidered with technical or mythical references, making the scenes of mounting menace hard to visualize and absorb. I can see why this book would have made a better movie or video game, for it has all the elements of a venture into the unknown where one doesn’t know what lurks around the next corner. And in typical horror genre format, the final reveal is too scary for either the narrator or his assistant to bear, and they must hightail it determined never to return, and to discourage others from exploring this place of ultimate horror.What is interesting to note is the age-old battle of good vs. evil that played out even within this advanced civilization 50 million years ago. Humans seem to frame this duality, embedded in our own history, into any real or imagined civilization, be that heaven vs. hell, government vs. opposition, east vs. west, democracy vs. communism, cowboys vs. crooks…and in that tradition, Lovecraft gives us the Old Ones vs. the Shoggoths. And woe be unto those who resurrect old feuds, even in the innocent pursuit of scientific exploration. What this novella has awakened in me is a desire to read books by the authors who inspired Lovecraft to write At the Mountains of Madness and other short stories about this mythic civilization at the southern end of the world, notably Edgar Alan Poe’s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and M.P. Shiel’s The Purple Cloud. And to read more fan fiction to see where the Cthulhu Mythos has evolved since Lovecraft gave it definition.This is not your regular Stephen King kind of horror story by any stretch of the imagination. And just like fanfic has extended Lovecraft’s creation, I wonder whether later iterations of the horror genre have desensitized us to the scare factor in Lovecraft’s novella, rendering it now into more a philosophical book rather than a page-turning shocker?...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2021","Jun 21, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32767.At_the_Mountains_of_Madness

And yet, if literature is supposed to expose humanity in all its imperfections, then I applaud the author for having shown us the harsh north of the Klondike through the eyes of an animal.Buck, the mixed breed of St. Bernard and Scotch Sheppard, has all the inherent instincts and capability of the hunter-survivor, and yet is domesticated and coddled in a respected judge’s farm in Southern California. However, in another part of the world, dogs are the “other gold,” especially in the Klondike, for they can transport supplies across the ice. Buck is kidnapped and sold by an unscrupulous employee on the farm to settle a gambling debt.So begins Buck’s travels north, handed from master to master, his fortunes, and tribulations dependent on who owns him, just like the slaves in Uncle Tom’s Cabin. He enters the world run by the Law of Club and Fang. The man in the red sweater, a trader in abducted dogs, is his first shock; the man tries to break Buck with a vicious beating, something he had never faced from a human before. Buck learns that he must feign obedience in order to live to fight another day. He not only has to survive his various masters, but he has to survive the pack of huskies he is thrown in with – some who become allies and others who view him as a threat. Attacks come from humans as well his fellow dogs, when least expected. The battles are fierce, and it is indeed a survival of the fittest situation. Buck learns and sheds his domesticity quickly.Eventually the predator in him rises to the surface, as well as his will to lead the pack in this hostile environment. However, no sooner has his leadership position on the sled team been attained, when he is sold to a trio of amateur prospectors who overload the sleds and starve the dogs, driving them over ridiculous distances. Near to death, Buck is finally rescued by another damaged and injured man called John Thornton. Now begins a symbiotic relationship between man and dog, one saving the other from peril, both fiercely loyal to each other.As Thornton’s prospects improve, thanks to Buck, the dog is freer to roam the frozen north, becoming more of the predator his ancestors were, even seeing visions of man as an ape from previous incarnations. The dog merging with his ancestor, the wolf, is complete when Buck kills larger prey, including man. Buck transcends life into legend by coming to be known in the North as the Ghost Wolf, and the breed of timber wolves in that area are reputed to have his unique marking. There are many lessons here: animals need to roam free and should never be domesticated; slavery is a vile industry, and animal slavery is no less odious than human slavery; greed kills; hierarchy is prevalent not only in the human kingdom but also in the animal kingdom; survival of the fittest applies to humans and animals alike.Having read the comic-book version of this novel years ago and seen sanitized and romanticized movie renditions, this original book is far more compelling and raw.

When the Reds finally gain control in 1922, he is banished from his palatial suite in the Metropol to an attic room in the same hotel to spend the next 32 years under house arrest. Although he misses the bees and apples in his hometown of Novny Novgorod, and flower shops close in times of revolution, Rostov makes a life for himself and finds comfort in the little things: a fine brandy at the hotel’s Shalyapin bar, a bouillabaisse made from stolen ingredients, old movies, the essays of Montaigne on Solitude, and the staff and guests who pass through the hotel, bringing the world and Russia to him. There is a wide cast of characters, some with just walk on parts. But the most impactful on his life are: Nina, the nine-year old who gives him a skeleton key to the inner sanctums of the hotel, her daughter Sofia, in later years, who has the key to his heart and his emotions; Anna the actress who keeps his libido alive; seamstress Marina who becomes a surrogate mother to Sofia; and the wily chef and captain of the hotel’s famed Boyarsky restaurant, Emile and Andrey, who run this fine-dining venue where the world comes to meet Russia and where the new power elite flexes its muscles. I must not forget to mention the tragic poet Mindich who, ironically, got the Count into his predicament, and who accurately observes that Russians are good at destroying what they create.Rostov is of use to the new regime, for he holds knowledge to the outside world that the proletarian leaders lack, he has skills in menus, wines, art, and a host of other western accoutrements the Soviets are clueless about. The Count is soon the head waiter at the Boyarsky, listening-in on conversations and educating his new rulers on etiquette. The upturned old order is personified in the sly waiter, nicknamed The Bishop, who ascends the career ladder, with the help from his party affiliations, to become general manager of the hotel, and then who focusses on cost savings at the expense of quality.Compared to Nina, who was a math whiz as a child, Sofia is a musical prodigy. And it is only when the Sofia enters his life at the age of six, and Rostov is constantly faced with being separated from her because of her musical talent, that the aging count decides it’s time to defect and effects an elaborate plan for them to leave Russia. This is where the plot sags a bit, for there are too many variables and implausible components that need to fall into place to make that happen. Perhaps the book’s sub title, “the rules of civility,” come into play here, suggesting that everything works well if one plays by those rules. Shades of the movie Casablanca echo in the Count’s final moves, and one wonders whether he used the movie to plan his getaway.Russia is a the loser for the disappearance of men like Rostov who announced their presence by their bearing, remarks and manners, and not by their coats; while “carefully crafted things of the aristocracy,” like foxhunts, were no great loss to the country, and duels—another aristocratic indulgence—also mercifully vanished. Custom-made buildings designed by architects made way for squat, mass-produced five-storey buildings, in which each unit looked alike. I am not sure why Rostov stayed on in 1918 to face almost certain exile, even death, and why he didn’t see back then that his ilk had no place in the emerging Communist Russia, unless you bought privilege by selling your soul to the Party. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jun 05, 2021","Jun 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow

For horror only desensitizes and makes one crave bigger shocks. However, to my surprise, this is no horror novel, but a deeply philosophical one, written in lyrical language, a lament, a lesson, and a love story, or a story of love denied.This is also a story about the pursuit of knowledge at all costs – the Adam and Eve story, or the opening of Pandora’s box. This is a story of vengeance being pursued until it consumes the enraged one. This is a story of thwarted love that turns to hate.Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant young science student is fascinated with life and death, and the restoration of life into dead and decaying matter. Given that this novel was written by a 19-year old, educated, upper class British woman who had no reason to meddle with cadavers, we are spared the gory details of the making of Frankenstein’s monster. Sometimes I wondered whether the monster was a figment of Frankenstein’s imagination, persecuting him at every turn for eating from the forbidden tree of knowledge like his first ancestor had done. However, as the story progressed, I realized that the monster was more than a metaphor. Frankenstein’s experiment leads to a life of misery for both creator and creation, and a long duel that spans all over Europe, destroying them both.The monster is a sympathetic character. He yearns for love but is shunned by all, including his creator; he is beaten for his hideous looks, despite him performing good deeds for mankind. Enraged and thwarted, he lays his woes at the feet of his creator and vows to kill all of Frankenstein’s loved ones if he were not given a female companion to share his life with. Frankenstein rebukes him, and people start dying, and the master is forced to acquiesce to the monster. Frankenstein, therefore, removes himself to the dark corners of the Orkney Isles to work on the female version of his earlier creation, but falters, for he cannot reconcile breeding a race of monsters, like Adam and Eve had begat. He winds down his experiment prematurely, setting up for the final showdown with his problem child.Plot contrivances abound, but I put this down to the author’s age and experience at the time. People conveniently die when required, the monster scales cliffs and can live under extreme climatic conditions with very little food; he is also able to live undiscovered in a hovel adjoining the house of a farming family for a whole year and picks up a foreign language by merely overhearing people talk. But for a book like this, what is plot? It is merely a device to bring out the issues that need to be discussed and reflected upon. Plausibility became a contemplation when writing schools evolved in the late 20th century—Mary Shelley was mercifully spared this consideration.I particularly like the descriptions around Lake Geneva where Mary Shelly spent time writing this novel in the esteemed company of her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron. Frankenstein’s journey along the Rhine, with his friend Henry Clavell, all the way to the British Isles, a journey no doubt undertaken by the author herself, is well described, as is the desolation of the northern regions where Frankenstein meets his date with fate. The style is lyrical and poetic, again difusing any suggestion that this is a book of horror, although the fallout of Frankenstein’s actions lead to horrific consequences. And it is a nested novel where three stories accrete within each other: the explorer Walton’s voyage to the North Pole, Frankenstein’s story, and the monster’s.Alas, this is a sad book, for there are no victors, unless you consider it Walton, who realizes the limitations of his ambition to conquer the North Pole. Perhaps the only good that Frankenstein served was to show this explorer that “too much of anything is good for nothing.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"May 24, 2021","May 24, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35031085-frankenstein

I saw the movie many years ago in another country and could not relate to the issues as well as I did when I finally bit the bullet and read the real deal during times of pandemic, MAGA, and Black Lives Matter.Despite its archaic style that hinges on the sentimental and melodramatic, and the annoying tendency of the author to intrude frequently, directing the reader to the next scene or explaining that she is now going to leave one set of characters and move to the next, Harriet Beecher Stowe is overtly uncompromising in three key messages: slavery is evil, Christianity is redemption, and women would do a better job of running the show given their maternal leanings.What is so stark is that the slave had no rights whatsoever; he or she could be bought, sold, separated from children and family at the master’s will, could be subject to torture, rape, and murder, and had no legal standing in court as a victim or a witness to a white’s inhuman behaviour. Slaves were whipped to be kept in line (some were even sent to special whipping houses); high performing ones were demoted back to the lowest menial labour if the master through they were getting too smart; they were on call 24/7, and if they wore down, well…they were just sent off to the slave auction and replaced. And heaven help the comfortable slave who suddenly experienced his benevolent master’s death, the world would suddenly be upended for all the master’s chattels, slaves included. The further south one travelled in the United States in the first half of the 19th century the harsher the conditions for slaves became, and the further north one went, they improved. Canada was considered nirvana for liberated slaves.The book therefore cleaves north and south from the benign centre of Kentucky, the opening setting of the book, where slaves are treated well in the Shelby household. However, as finances get tight, Uncle Tom, the Christ-like figure who has been a loyal servant of his owner, is sold down the river to Louisiana, while Eliza and her family escape and head north to Canada. The story weaves back and forth between these two journeys. Some great characters emerge, sharply delineated: Uncle Tom: honest and loyal to a fault, uncompromising in his love of God and his ability to forgive those who trespass against him.Evangeline (Eva): the young girl in the St. Claire household that Tom is sold to, who loves black and white alike but suffers the pain of the inhuman South’s treatment of its slaves.Marie St. Claire: Eva’s hypochondriacal and self-obsessed mother who believes that the Bible allows for segregation of the races, and that blacks are a “degraded species.”Topsy: the black slave girl who lies, steals and begs to be beaten, for she knows nothing else, and doesn’t even know how she was born—“I s’pect I grow’d.”Sam Legree: the final master that Tom ends up with in the swamps of Louisiana – the epitome of evil. A man who treats his slaves like animals so that they behave like animals.Cassy: the quadroon and discarded sex-slave of Legree, one who has given up hope that God exists, and would rather kill her offspring to prevent them coming into this world.Ophelia: the northern pro-abolitionist, who is a paragon of order, propriety, and hard work, but whose sympathies are only intellectual, for she lacks the ability to touch the slaves.Augustine St. Clare: Eva’s father and Ophelia’s cousin, who is a poet. He understands the problems of the South but is unwilling to take a stand. His lack of faith and resolve is his undoing, just as Tom, possessing both these qualities in abundance, is undone by them too.This was a controversial book in its time, and just like the America of today that is deeply divided, a host of anti-Tom books emerged in the wake of Beecher-Stowe’s novel being published in 1852, contesting that slavery was needed and that slaves were treated better by their masters than if they had been left to their own devices. The stupidity of those counter claims ring true today when we see blacks exceed in all areas of endeavour if given the opportunity.The author rings off the book by tying all the loose ends: those who head north live happily ever after, those left behind in the south are in a horrible situation. She also steps onto her political platform and overtly claims that this book was based on real people she knew and that the situations she depicted in the book have occurred, more or less. She then implores the North not to be complicit in slavery by reaping its economic rewards but staying non-involved. She must have touched a nerve, for this novel was the highest selling book next to the Bible during that period.

The characters still haunt him. “All these Murphys, Molloys and Malones do not fool me. They have made me waste my time, suffer for nothing, speak of them when, in order to stop speaking, I should have spoken of me and of me alone. They never suffered my pains, their pains are nothing, compared to mine, a mere tittle of mine, the tittle I thought I could put from me, in order to witness it.”He refers to one Mahood who has told him many stories, who may be his muse or his master. Or it’s his own name. He refers to a person called Worm. “For if I am Mahood, I am Worm too, plop. Or if I am not yet Worm, I shall be when I cease to be Mahood, plop. I’m Worm, no, if I were Worm I wouldn’t know it, I wouldn’t say it, I wouldn’t say anything, I’d be Worm. But I don’t say anything, I don’t know anything, these voices are not mine, nor these thoughts, but the voices and thoughts of the devils who beset me.” Perhaps mortality represents Mahood, and Worm is the transformation of flesh after death.The toing and froing—advancing and retreating—is a constant. He is advancing towards death and yet he is holding back, and then retreating. But the trend line seems to be towards extinction. The book is remembered for a famous line of his: ""I can't go on, I'll go on,"" – characteristic of the to-ing and fro-ing of the narrator. Sometimes he skirmishes with his characters, hurling abuses: “I’ll let down my trousers and shit stories on them, stories, photographs, records, sites, lights, gods and fellow-creatures, the daily round and common task, observing the while, Be born, dear friends, be born, enter my arse, you’ll just love my colic pains, it won’t take long, I’ve the bloody flux.”Call this a soliloquy, a rant, a lament for a life incompletely lived, an examination of existence, a voyage through the addled mind of a nervous wreck, an exhausted writer at the end of a book who can't let go his characters, a man at the end of life who doesn’t yet want to die, but don't call this a novel. For why does the narrator (Beckett?) need so many pages for this soliloquy? Does his ego need that many pages before it is assuaged?We have to be considerate that Beckett had suffered a nervous breakdown while he was writing this trilogy, and its writing may have been his way of healing, blaming his fall for the burden of literary greatness heaped upon him, and for these rather decrepit characters who lived in his head. Or was Becket experimenting with another form of extension for the novel, like Joyce, Hemingway and Nabokov did? Who are we to question geniuses?

It has plot contrivance at its height, with only a hint of redemption at the end, nothing in comparison to Greene’s major works like A Burnt Out Case or The Power and the Glory. A story-to-go, which, given his connections, turned into a lucrative movie as well. Bertram, a fortyish divorcee, a sub-accountant by trade with a penchant for gambling, is about to be married to Cary, twenty years his junior. They are the most ill-matched couple, for while he prefers money and power, she prefers modesty and living poor. Their humble honeymoon is scheduled for Bournemouth. All this is upended when one of the senior shareholders of his company, Dreuther (a proxy for the Devil), impressed by Bertram’s handling of an accounting problem at the firm, changes plans and has the couple marrying in Monte Carlo, spending their first night in a hotel with an attached casino and then getting onto his boat for a Mediterranean cruise. All this is fine, until Dreuther doesn’t show up for several days, and Bertram is drawn towards the casino as the couple kick their heels in the Riviera.All the elements of temptation, greed, and ambition are in play. We expect to see Bertram losing it all, but Greene turns the tables on us and has our hero actually winning with a “system” that he perfects to beat the house. Then the contrivances start and without giving the game away, suffice to say that Greene, probably being reminded that he needs to bring in that redemption thing of his, forces Bertram to confront what is more important to him: money or his marriage.The plot twists keep you reading, but this story is probably better off as a screenplay, and I would put it down to one of Greene’s “entertainments” that he wrote in between his serious Catholic novels....more",Notes are private!,0,18,2,not setnot set,"Apr 21, 2021not set","Apr 21, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48859.Loser_Takes_All

And I have had this book on my shelf for over ten years, so it was time to crack it open.First off, I have a problem with academic books that give us every other academic’s point and counter point on a particular subject and strays off the point so much that one forgets what the point was in the beginning, wondering what point the author himself was trying to make; or was the author’s intention not to make a point at all, but rather to do a data dump of all the writing out there on this particular issue? This book unfortunately falls into that category for me, although others might disagree. The author also qualifies that he has not had the lived experience of being imprisoned and that his research centres around North America, Europe and Australia only; he avoids Latin America, Africa and Asia where the bulk of the political prisoners have originated from, and therefore skips much of the prison writing of ideological import.That said, the author draws from a myriad of sources, approximately 40 writers who had the lived experience of prison—including famous ones like Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Wilde, Genet, Koestler and Dante—and a slew of other academicians who hold diverse views on prison writing.Despite the rather convoluted arguments and counter-arguments floating around in this narrative, I picked on the following that defines prison writing:1.	Denial of expression is torture, So is the seizure and destruction of one’s writing while in prison. 2.	Prisoner’s leave prisons more damaged than when they arrive. Genet feared not only what would be done to him in prison but what he would turn into when he came out. 3.	Oral storytelling is a big part of prison literature.4.	Prison writing, particularly on Death Row, can implicate the prisoner rather than exonerate him.5.	Intellectuals got their first opportunity to meet the underprivileged classes when they went to prison – e.g. Oscar Wilde.6.	Violence is a frequent companion of prison literature.7.	Prison writing is about guilt. Prison autobiographies are often confessions.8.	There is less writing emerging from collective prisons than from individual prisoners. For example, it was left for those who lived outside Eastern Europe and Germany to write about the Jews and the Holocaust.9.	Primo Levi emerges as the premier Holocaust writer.10.	Slavery (another form of prison camp) was the offshoot and impetus to mercantilist capitalism.11.	Some prisoners become writers after they go to prison. Some writers became prisoners when they dared to speak the truth.12.	Prisoners use prison writing to create political platforms for themselves and reveal flaws in the system that incarcerates themThe author pulls things together in the final three chapters and these were by far the most coherent and interesting to me. The Appendix too has short bios of the imprisoned writers who feature in this book.At the end of this rather difficult book, I wondered why the author had not kept his readers in mind and approached this exploration of a very important subject in a more simplistic way. I would have preferred if he had focussed on the selected works and lives of those imprisoned writers and analysed them in serial fashion, thus revealing an evolving picture of “writers in prison” which is what the title claims. I’m sure I would have gleaned more than the twelve points I have bulleted above had he done that, and this book would have been less complex to get through. But then, are academics there to simplify or to complicate? The latter, this book seems to imply, thus making their work appear all that more important and harder for simpler minds to parse out....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Apr 15, 2021","Apr 15, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1088422.Writers_in_Prison

And Travel stories always ignite my interest, especially those set in remote parts of the world, journeys that require courage, stamina and patience. And a great deal of luck. This book fulfilled my vicarious need to travel to offbeat destinations, especially during these prohibitive times of pandemic, and established Pico Iyer as the next generation Graham Greene for me.Iyer covers India, Tibet, Cambodia, Aden, Bolivia, Bali, Japan, Easter Island and Haiti (I hope I haven’t missed any), many of these trips happening around New Year’s Day of the year, “when hopes are brightest.” His leaning towards eastern mysticism is obvious from his encounters with the Dalai Lama, his attendance at a Zen retreat where he meets none other than Leonard Cohen, another seeker, and his walks through Deer Park in Japan where individual lives are rendered infinitesimal. Many of these destinations are financially if not morally impoverished: China is trying to obliterate Tibetan culture, two and half million unexploded land mines encircle Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and the bush begins just outside his luxury hotel in Haiti. He takes a detour in some of the essays to  the books of two writers who also lived as expatriates: W.G. Sebald and Kazuo Ishiguro. Sebald, haunted by the fallout of WWII, with his mysterious photographs and 19th century German prose, developed a new voice as a German living in England and writing in German. Ishiguro is of Japanese origin, but writing in English, recently the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Both authors represent the conundrum: “The person who looks like us, may not be of us, and the one who doesn’t look like us, could be one of us.” And Iyer, with his Indian ancestry, born in Oxford, grown up in the USA, and now living in Japan, is in the same boat as these two “internationalized” authors. Even the Dalai Lama, living his pop-star image out of a refuge in Dharamsala, India, just to keep the plight of six million Tibetans alive in the global consciousness, is one of these displaced ones on a mission.The two pieces that interested me the most was not so much about travel but about the consequences of it. The nightmarish recounting Iyer’s dealing with jet lag due to his constant long distance travel, particularly due to frequent visits between Japan and Los Angeles to visit his mother, a debilitating condition that occupies a sixth of his life, is compelling. Under jet lag, everything slows down and blurs, and efficiency goes out the door. The other piece, humorous, was laced with examples of how the occupation of India has impacted the English language, evidenced by the outlandish signage on Indian streets. Call it Indlish, Englian, or Hindlish, if you may – but India contributed fully 26 thousand words to the English language during the course of the colonial period. I shook my head at words like “cashmere,” “tycoon,” “thug,” “pundit,” and “mantra” – yes, all made in India! And the Indian philosophy of “Never use a word when thirty will do,” now now becomes more uderstandable!What comes across to me when reading writers like Greene and Iyer, even Martha Gellhorn, is their absence of fear, or lack of awareness of it. There is an expectation that despite the dangerous situations they may get into, they will always get out safely. No mention is made of the escape. Iyer has his passport confiscated in Bolivia and not returned, and he doesn’t seem to care; he is taken for a terrorist and put in a cell for interrogation later in the same country. He has to take a nightmarish six-hour dash in a rackety car between Aden and Sanaa to catch a plane, on pitch dark mountainous roads, being stopped by armed militias several times enroute. How he gets to his destination safely is never quite clear, nor what he felt during those prickly situations is revealed to us. I wish they were, for that would have made for a more compelling book with a more accessible and human narrator.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/131103.Sun_After_Dark

Enter sexually transmitted and other infectious diseases, kings and armies, wars and famines. He debunks the popular theory that we have good and evil within us. However, he agrees that while manifestations of Terrorism and Nazism do not reflect our decency, it is those ideologies that are evil, not the people caught up in them.Most interesting are the stories, and there are many, from the genesis of the mysterious stone statues of Easter Island to the identical twin brothers who fought on either side of Apartheid in South Africa. Here are a few popular events and philosophies that he puts his own spin on:a)	75% of killing in WWII was remotely activated (by bomb, grenade, mortar, aerial bombardment etc.)b)	Modern soldiers are drugged and brainwashed into killingc)	Democracy is no more people-power than its name implies. We elect people who will govern us and not fulfill our wishes.d)	The US Constitution, Capitalism, Rule of Law and other institutions of the supposed developed world are based on the assumption of our innate selfishness.e)	The market was created by the state to make farms and other enterprises more efficient by parceling them out to individuals with the means and money to afford them.f)	The “broken window” theory (i.e. “keep a window broken and the bad guys will come in”) practiced by law enforcement groups like the NYPD and LAPD were dismal failures.g)	The Colombian civil war was ended by an advertising company bombarding the FARC guerillas with messages to return home to their mothers.h)	A family unit is governed on the system of Communism – i.e. “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.”i)	God was invented as a Super Leviathan to keep tabs on us.I could go on. But let’s talk about his remedies for our crazy world:a)	The Norway Model for our prisons, where the accent is on rehabilitation not punishment.b)	The remedy for prejudice, especially racial prejudice, is Contact.c)	Practise Compassion as opposed to Empathy. The former is rejuvenating, the latter exhausting.d)	Get rid of office cubicles, taxes, and political hierarchies.e)	Playfulness as a means of learning. Schools and curriculums should be determined by students, not teachers.f)	Assume positive intent, pessimism is a self-fulfilling prophesy – an example cited is Nelson Mandela.However, Bregman stops short of asking us to turn the clock back 10,000 years and return to the nomadic life, to before the rot started. There is no turning back history, and our evolutionary path has led us to this pass. We have to play to the better nature within us and not to our evil twin, he says. The multiplicity of stories notwithstanding, Bregnan’s Radical Idea still does not convince me that the evil twin isn’t lurking within, looking for an opportunity to surface and make its presence known. That said, I still applaud Bregnan for producing this book with its myriad examples and stories to back up the fact that all is yet not lost and that Humankind could still be saved....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Feb 05, 2022","Apr 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52879286-humankind

I was shocked, irritated, and humbled as I rolled through this collection of stories written in Brooklyn around the fictitious Greeks Bar in the 1960s.Selby has the credentials to write about the underclass. Born partially brain-dead, cashiered out of the navy with tuberculosis in his teens, spending four years in a hospital where several of his ribs were taken out so that doctors could get to his collapsed lungs, living on welfare, marrying three times, slumping into drugs and alcohol well into his thirties until he had an epiphany of wanting to amount to something before he died, then turning to writing because it was the only thing he could do, and going on to do for the American novel what Charles Bukowski did for its poetry. A man given up for dead several times, who lived to the ripe age of 75, who never had a high school education or won a literary award, but who went on to teach at university and produce several ground-breaking bestsellers, Last Exit to Brooklyn being his breakout novel. Enough said.The stories, short at first then getting longer, focus on a principal character in each story, and then Selby brings them all together in the last story, titled “Landsend,” in which the entire ensemble gathers to form the inhabitants of a low-income housing project. The character are: rival gangs (adult and children) who go at each other, get beaten up, and claim victory for their side; disgruntled and trapped couples living on the poverty line with or without children, who beat each other up, cheat on each other, have violent sex with each other, and drink until they are senseless; gay men (called fairies – this was the 1960s before politically correct speech was invented) who snag married men with closet homosexual tendencies in clubs and sponge off them; well-endowed women who do the same until they drown in an excess of sex, drugs, and alcohol; unionized workers who hate their bosses; gossiping women who gather at street corners (before TV kept them homebound), pick their noses, fart, and say nasty things about their neighbours. Selby is the master of getting us to see, smell and taste these lives in their unvarnished states.Selby doesn’t care a hoot for punctuation. There are no apostrophes – you get slashes instead, for the slash key was the lower one on the typewriter and Selby couldn’t bother to depress the shift key to get to the apostrophe. Some words are combined just for effect and whole paragraphs are in upper case to signify that people are shouting at each other. Dialogue between two (or several) characters run into each other in the same paragraphs, quote marks are absent, but eventually you get who is saying what to whom. It is as if he is thumbing his nose at academia and the grammarians to say, “We don’t need all your rules to be understood.”The saddest story for me was “Strike” and the character of Harry Black (apparently Selby had a Harry character in all his books to represent himself) who can only achieve self-actualization by being the union boss and local strike organizer. Harry hates his factory job and his sexually charged wife. Domestic fights explode into punch-ups. Harry drinks and entertains on the union’s expense account and wants everyone, including the local hoodlums, to love him and see how important he is. He also has a secret passion for gay men and chases this urge pathetically with fairies who are only out for a good time. His downfall, when the strike ends, is tragic.Obviously, Selby stretched the form of the novel with his writing, obscene though it may be in places. And he paid for his candour by facing obscenity trials and by having his books banned until those bans were later overturned. Is this literature one reads for pleasure – certainly not. But certainly, it is a literary form that rubs our faces in the shitholes of life that we try to paper over with the veneer of middle-class manners and respectability. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 18, 2023","Apr 04, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn

Mom is not totally free; she is addicted to abusive men and gambling. And she will beat young Kiese with a belt if he slacks off in his studies, sleeps with white girls, or uses contractions in his speech, all of which he does. The burden of being black is the “heavy” weight that drags them down. All the intersectional fangs are out in force here: black kids growing up in fatherless households, black teenagers treating their girlfriends like sex objects for lack of proper male role models, black mothers working for low wages even when qualified, and black folks having to be “twice as excellent” in order to get noticed. And always having to keep one’s head above the discriminatory barb lest one succumb to despair and give up : “It’s not about making white folks feel what you feel, but about not feeling what they want you to feel,” as Kiese’s Grandma says.The memoir captures the unique conversational voice of Laymon, replete with jargon, patois, elegant turns of phrase, and repeating lines like “I laughed and laughed and laughed, until I didn’t.” It is refreshingly written in the second person—Kiese is writing this memoir to his mom. The love between them is palpable, vigorous, even violent. Kiese is emotionally wounded when his mom is beaten up by overbearing boyfriends; he goes raiding the larder for food, even looking inside dustbins, to feed his hurt. He despairs when she runs through her money in casinos, money that he sends home once he is working in academia. On the flip side, he is an attractive hulk sought after by panting white girls and brown ones alike.Kiese follows his mother out of the Being Black trap by studying and writing. He conditions his body to lose its 300-plus pounds by running 8 miles twice a day, playing basketball, and starving. As his academic credentials grow, his weight drops. He finally becomes an academic himself, just like his mother. Mom’s advice follows him during his ascent: “Help your students breath by modelling responsible love in the classroom.” And yet she cautions him about taking academia for granted: “Pain awaits those who made a home of their job.” The fragility of his existence is all too evident, for the slightest crack in the wall—one he is building between himself and his origins in order to merge into the white man’s world—and he is back on the weight gain snowball. He even follows Mum into the casino, with disastrous consequences.This is not a “rags to riches” story. It is more a “rags to riches and back to second-hand clothes” kind of story. We are left with Kiese still burdened and heavy, unmarried and childless at 43, but having earned a PhD and tenure at a university after a hard struggle, having published books to his name, and emerging as a new voice to complement those of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin. He remains a work-in-progress, giving voice to the bitter reality of being black in 21st century America, as the last chapter in the book attests—a lament, a prayer, a wish, and a premonition—conveyed in haunting prose that makes it and the rest of this book a compulsive read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 27, 2021","Mar 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430746-heavy

A hapless son caught between a controlling professional mother and a loser musician father in “The Association”; a woman with a brain injury who always puzzled about a free-spirited neighbour abandoning her child, is driven by domestic circumstances and a deteriorating mental state to commit a similar act in “Upholstery”; a university student having an affair with her professor learns that one always ends up sad in these situations, despite the “happy drugs” you take to get by in “Again, the Sad Woman’s Soliloquy.”In the stories of memory, I liked Lisa Moore’s “The Curse,” where a random event triggers memory from different stages of the narrator’s memory: of clothes bought and worn, children, student days, dysfunctional small town characters, an orphaned girl getting into trouble with drugs. “A Room at the Marlborough” takes the photographer protagonist, who has come back to attend his mother’s funeral, back to his teen years when he went on a vacation to Normandy with her while she was on the verge of straying from her marriage at the time; his hobby of reprocessing old negatives at his photo studio to recapture memories of people he once knew ends up being an empty exercise, reflecting the emptiness of his life.The sci-fi pieces were interesting: plants take on the role of procreating by cutting off their dependence on bees to do the job in “The Second Coming of Plants.” The piece that stuck with me the most was “Alice & Charles” – a dystopian story situated in a world where women are in constant danger of attack and rape and are therefore issued with guard dogs by the government; it is a filthy world full of excrement (dog shit) and menstrual blood (sanitary pads are hard to come by), and the messages of misogyny, survival, feminism and social dysfunction are strong. In keeping with our sensitivity to inclusion and diversity, it was refreshing to see two indigenous stories included as well. I particularly liked “Young Warriors in Love” which fuses indigenous and settler practices into a young man’s quest to woo the woman of his dreams.The short story seems to be moving away from the traditional character and plot driven one towards language and image as drivers. The language in this collection is wonderful with beautifully constructed sentences, and the imagery is quite telling. However, being a traditionalist, I still long for “story” in “short story.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 19, 2021","Mar 19, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44791509-best-canadian-stories-2019

He has an opinion on everyone and everything, backed by a lifetime in journalism that covered in-person visits to various hot-spots around the world and meetings with prominent people whom he likes to name-drop liberally.Let’s see, according to Hitchens, Churchill was a charlatan (so were Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More); Kipling was a racist, homosexual, imperialist, sadist and anti-Semite; Huxley was interested in eugenics, breeding, and LSD; Graham Green too was an anti-Semite; Lord Byron was sexualized as a child by his female nurse; Borges wasn’t as libidinous as Joyce; Kennedy was a walking pharmacy; and Michael Moore’s movie Fahrenheit 9/11 was “an exercise in moral frivolity and a spectacle of abject political cowardice.” Got the picture?Despite this very opinionated fellow, and they are often only opinions, for sometimes I found very little fact to support his positions, he must have lived a very eventful life by getting to the core of the difficult issues and asking the tough questions, especially of those in authority. Although a leftist, he idolized America, choosing to live there, but was also critical of his new home: “The US has been the patron of predatory regimes in five continents, exports violence by means of arms exports, and has evil clients.”The most interesting sections were his on-location journalism pieces: travelling along Sunset Boulevard or on Route 66, visits to Cuba, Montenegro, North Korea, Kurdistan and Pakistan. He spends a lot of time covering 9/11 and the soul-searching that went on during its fallout. The anecdotes in each story are also very interesting and form a kind of flotsam gathered over the peregrinations of an itinerant journalist. There are some interesting book s with the focus more on the author than the work, although I inferred that his favourite writers got better treatment, writers such as Saul Bellow, Bob Dylan, and Leon Trotsky.Writing from the personal is a powerful viewpoint, and Hitchens’ writing is more intellectual than journalistic, even though many of these articles are culled from journals like the New Spectator and Vanity Fair that he wrote for consistently. He accuses other writers of pleonasm, but his own verbosity knows no bounds. Evelyn Waugh is described as “The very rotundity is its own cumbrous self-criticism. If he (Waugh) became a byword for post-sodden Blimpery, it was because his face shaped itself to fit a mask that predated that heavy, bilious terminus.”I’ve heard such a lot and viewed videos of this man who insisted that God didn’t exist even when he was in the last days of his life, suffering from cancer. Therefore reading this wide sampling of his writing helped to put him in context for me. Certainly a member of the angry young male writer cohort who came of age in the 60’s and 70’s, who captured the world in all its contrariness, and became contrarians themselves to gain a toe-hold on the platform of celebrity thinkers. Despite his bombast and contrary opinions, Hitchens seems to have cared for the world he lived in and exited so early. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 14, 2021","Mar 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/304268.Love_Poverty_and_War

Strane pulls all the strings of the classic predator and spins his web around her artfully, drawing her in. He even gives her a copy of Lolita to read, which becomes her favourite novel and a token to remember Strane by. Once enmeshed, he sexualizes her to the point of Vanessa becoming the aggressor, hence the book’s title. For the most part, the sexual activity seems consensual, for Strane always asks for permission to go further, and the aroused and panting Vanessa has no hesitation in saying, “yes, yes, YES!”When discovery inevitably comes, Vanessa takes the fall to protect Strane; she is expelled, but continues on and off with him over the next 16 years as he compulsively continues to grope other victims, but none with the level of depth and depravity as what he had going with Vanessa. She remains confident, as new evidence come to light of his ephebophilic activities, that she was the only one he loved, and therefore maintains that she was never abused. When later victims come out to expose Strane, and seek her collaboration, Vanesa declines, for after all, she was special, and why can’t these other women just get over a little groping?Of course, someone so marked so early in life can never have a satisfactory relationship with another person again, the book seems to say; nor can she have a successful career, for Vanessa, once Strane’s most promising student, ends up in string of dead-end jobs and finds relief only in alcohol and pot. Even the professor she meets in university, Henry, a smaller, younger version of Strain, and for whom she develops a hunger, is no match for her former Svengali. And forget, men of her age, she is focussed on the “older man,” another result of her early induction.This is a very insular book, for most of the action is centered around the secret interactions of Vanessa and Strane, and after awhile the story becomes episodic, with alternating chapters between the year 2000 when she first went to Browick and the year 2017 when the consequences of the master-slave relationship surface.For his part, Strane too is trapped in his fatal attraction for adolescent girls, and in his twisted way, cares for Vanessa. Despite his cravings, he is able to say “no” to her when he realizes that their continued relationship is destructive to her life. Coming out at the height of the #MeToo movement when prominent movie producers and other men in positions of power were being outed as heinous sexual predators, this book attempts to a put a vulnerable, human face on these male monsters.The legacy of abuse is guilt. Long after Strane has departed the scene, Vanessa and those who knew about the affair and kept silent, are left with indelible guilt that keeps them insulated in their private hells, unable to reconcile the acts, or with each other. It’s a cautionary tale for young female students who have crushes on their teachers and decide to act upon them....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2021","Mar 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44890081-my-dark-vanessa

His erudition and insights are deep, there is no obscenity in this book, and he calls into question what we take to be traditional literature. Miller had a late but tortuous start in writing. In his words: “I wrote for seven years in America without once having a manuscript accepted. I thought that a man, to be a writer, must do at least five thousand words a day. I thought he must say everything all at once—in one book—and collapse afterwards. I didn’t know a thing about writing As a foreigner in Paris, without friends, I went through an even worse ordeal. The naive English critics, in their polite, asinine way, talk about the “hero” of my book (Tropic of Cancer) as though he were a character I had invented. I made it as plain as could be that I was talking in that book about myself. I used my own name throughout. I didn’t write a piece of fiction: I wrote an autobiographical document, a human book.” In fact, he writes only (and best) about himself. He believes in creation over literature. And he believes in living life to the fullest from its happiest to its seamiest, and then recording it. Yet he spent a lot of time procrastinating on the first Tropic book he was going to write, and there are plenty of brilliant stream of consciousness passages in this book written before he actually got down to the act of writing Tropic of Cancer. However, when he was writing Plexus, the second book in the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, he says, “Huge blocks—particularly the dream parts—came to me just as they appear in print and without any effort on my part, except that of equating my own rhythm with that of the mysterious dictator who had me in his thrall.” A Voice would possess him and spew buckets of words at him without a break, he says. He is drawn to the great teachers: “For me the only true revolutionaries are the inspirers and activators, figures like Jesus, Lao-tse, Gautama the Buddha, Akhnaton, Ramakrishna, Krishnamurti, men who have experienced life to the full and who give life—artists, religious figures, pathfinders, innovators and iconoclasts of all sorts.” His take on literature, on the other hand, is: “A man writes to throw off the poison which he has accumulated because of his false way of life. He is trying to recapture his innocence, yet all he succeeds in doing (by writing) is to inoculate the world with the virus of his disillusionment.” Wasn’t his Tropic books about that? And about transcribing that Voice spewing buckets at him – wasn’t that also writing? He is a the supreme egotist: “I have absolutely nothing to show for my labors except my genius. . I am a cosmological writer, and when I open my trap I broadcast to the whole world at once.” Miller holds special opprobrium to those who tried to classify his writing as Obscene, for his work was banned in the USA for many decades, and for some years in Europe as well. “Nothing would be regarded as obscene, I feel, if men were living out their inmost desires. The cattle breeder may write his pamphlets and treatises; the physician may detail his psychopathic case histories; the anthropologist may describe his researches into the sexual habits of primitive peoples—but the writer who is interested purely in creative literature, the writer who would likes to describe the life about him fully and freely, is forbidden to speak.” Obscenity in art is a technical device intended to awaken and usher in a sense of reality, according to Miller. Miller’s other target is Morality. “This word morality! Whenever it comes up I think of the crimes which have been committed in its name. There exists one morality for peace times and another for war. In times of war everything is permitted, everything condoned. That is to say, everything abominable and infamous committed by the winning side.” I have quoted extensively from Miller in this  because his profundity is the highlight of this book. I wrote down many of these little gems for reflecting upon later. They are the thoughts of one who loved life and lived it in all its dimensions. And to quote him one last time: “If it isn’t literature, call it what you like. I don’t give a damn.”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 22, 2021","Feb 22, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23292311-henry-miller-on-writing

Vietnam inverted that paradigm and we were given an open window into the drugs, dysfunction and destruction this conflict waged on attacker and defender alike, leading to anti war protests that shook America. This book, a compilation of vignettes of the author’s tour of duty in 1969-70, takes us into the mind and predicament of the American soldier in this hopeless war and hammers home the message from multiple directions.The title story, sums up most of the book. It focusses on what a soldier carries with him into war, not just equipment, rations, weapons and uniforms, but germs, scars, dreams, letters, photographs and talismans. And also fear – of the night, of the tunnels hiding the enemy, of the booby trap that picks off soldiers at random. The death of a colleague leaves, guilt, loss, second-guessing, and anger. There are shocking set pieces that create vivid imagery:-	The dancing girl outside her house, inside which lie all her dead relatives, killed by the US military.-	A soldier plays with a hand-grenade mindful not to dislodge the safety pin, only to step on a land mine and be blown up into a tree.-	The platoon camps for the night in a field of excrement beside a flooded river. In the ensuing enemy bombardment, a soldier is drowned in the shit as that is the only cover provided.-	Another soldier wears his girlfriend’s nylons to around his neck to protect himself from death. Even after they break up, the good-luck-charm continues to protect him.O’Brien obsesses over the Vietcong soldier he kills with a grenade – the image haunts him even twenty years later. When shot in the butt, he plots revenge on the colleague who saved him – why? Wounded pride? And how does one pull pranks to exact revenge on one’s mates without being court martialed for posing as the enemy?War transforms. Mary-Ann, a 17-year-old girlfriend of one of the soldier’s, is smuggled into the camp and is consumed by Vietnam. She becomes a sniper, a killer more deadly than the Green Berets she defects over to. Other relationships also break up, as war changes not only those in it, but also those left behind.War makes the return to peacetime easy for some over others. O’Brien is able to integrate back into America and become a writer specializing in war stories. But Norman drives round and round the lake in his small town upon his return, unable to reconnect emotionally, until he is faced with making a fatal choice. The emotional damage wreaked on all of them spills into a whole generation of post-Vietnam America.O’Brien works on the reader’s emotions with conversational prose, repeating sentences, and by using words to exact maximum impact; he paints vivid scenes and returns to them from different viewpoints to hit the reader several times over. Quite cinematic. There have been many books written about the Vietnam War, and I guess movies like Apocalypse Now and the Rambo series have coloured our perceptions of this much publicized war. And yet the inside view from one who actually trod the path, who suffered the fears, uncertainties, and who witnessed the wastage is worth a read even so many years after the ending of that conflict. Would it deter us from entering similar conflicts again? I doubt it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,not set,"Feb 07, 2021","Feb 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/133518.The_Things_They_Carried

Reading it again today, this novel, one oThis was the first Greene book I read nearly 50 years ago, a book that ignited my desire to become a writer. Reading it again today, this novel, one of the author’s most pivotal, has not lost its power on me.Greene wrote A Burnt Out Case when he was at the height of his literary powers, albeit burned out by the gruelling routine of generating an average of two books a year amidst his peregrinations to obscure corners of the world as a journalist (and spy?). He was burned out, and like his protagonist Querry (a world famous architect), had lost his desire to write again. However, unlike Querry, Greene was to get a renewed charge of vocation after the publication of this book and go onto produce as many novels, short-story collections, non-fiction, and plays as he had done before the burnout.Querry retreats from his fame to a leper colony run by Catholic priests and nuns in the Belgian Congo in the mid 1950’s. He has lost his capacity to love and to create. Like Greene, he is a lapsed Catholic, who has seen the churches he built disfigured by the masses with their cheap imagery and ornamentation. Lepers are burnt out cases, like him; yet as Dr. Colin, the colony’s doctor, reminds Querry, “Leprosy can now be cured physically. It is a psychological disease.” In the colony, Querry starts to heal when he helps build a hospital and do other acts of service.Greene’s archetypal villains, in the form of the self-righteous Catholic and the femme fatale, spring to the fore in Rycker, a former novitiate and now the manager of a palm-oil factory in the Congo, and his young wife, Marie. Ryker can only get sexually aroused when he talks religion, and he is starved for intellectual company – Querry is his solution. Marie is looking to escape a loveless marriage and a dull existence in the middle of nowhere – Querry is her ticket out. The spectre of fake news, a phenomenon endemic today but present back then too, is represented in the form of Parkinson, the syndicated journalist on the hunt for a sensational story where a few lies only help juice up the offering – and Querry is his target. In a cleverly paced plot, Greene leads us to a fulfilling climax where everyone gets what they desire, including Querry, in a fatalistically tragic way.Querry’s pre-occupations are Greene’s, if you consider that both creator and his subject are at the top of their game, yet disillusioned with the outcome. “Success is a mutilation of the natural man,” says Dr. Colin. Other “Greene-isms” dot the pages, even though Greene is not considered a great moral philosopher:“A vocation is an act of love, it is not a professional career.”“Sex and vocation are born and die together.”“A talent should not be buried, but obsolete coins have often been found in graves.”“Self-expression is a hard and selfish thing.”“Suffering puts us in touch with the human condition.”The one sour note in the book is the constantly repetitious denial by Querry that he has nothing more to live for even though his behaviour proves otherwise– it gets a bit tiresome. His long-night-of-the-soul moment with Marie in which he lapses into a parable—and it is obvious to everyone (including Marie) that it is all about him (tout a toi)—is overdone. Hubris leads to his undoing when he ignores social convention and accompanies a married woman to a hotel while her husband writhes in fever back home, while a journalist is holed up in a nearby room with a camera, angling for his next scoop. “I’m disturbed by a man without fear,” says the Superior of the léproserie; Query is feared, praised, and respected as a saint among mortals. Yet, as Christ was easily ridiculed and crucified when the winds changed, these lesser mortals are not averse to pounce on Querry at the first hint of transgression.Plot contrivances and soul searches notwithstanding, this is an excellent book. I am glad to have rediscovered it after so many years and enjoyed it for a second time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2021","Jan 30, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/347629.A_Burnt_Out_Case

Fiona is appalled and humiliated when Jack openly proposes that he plans to have an affair with a 28 year-old employee and seeks Fiona’s permission. Instead, she locks him out of their apartment in Gray’s Inn. She focusses on her work and her classical piano instead, the latter because she is used to playing by rules, unlike Jack who likes jazz.And there is much to engross her, case upon case of tangled human relationships, the resolution of which has sapped her energy over the years, leading perhaps to her loss of sexual desire. Some of the cases are topical to our times:-	A traditional Jewish couple divorcing and fighting over child custody. The mother wants the daughters educated in a secular school while the father wants a traditional school.-	Conjoint twins, where the healthier one has most of the organs they share. One has to die for the other to live.-	A Moroccan father abducts his British-born daughter to live with him in Rabat despite prior assurances to the contrary that he would allow her to live in the UK with his divorced wife.But the most engrossing case and the one that dives into the woman behind the judge is that of the 17-year-old Adam, a Jehovah’s Witness, who is dying of leukemia. A blood transfusion will save him, but his parents refuse it, and Adam refuses it as he has been fed on that belief by his faith that has enveloped him since childhood. Fiona suspends judgment until she can visit the patient in hospital. What follows is a symbiotic relationship between the boy and the judge that borders on a love attraction. They share poetry and music during that visit. For Fiona, he is the gifted child she never had; for Adam, she is the one who will save him from the sect that he is wedded to. Is there more than this? I’m sure each reader will form their own opinion. In the process, we get a furious court debate on the pros and cons of the Jehovah’s Witnesses slant on Christianity.Fiona ends up passing a controversial judgment regarding Adam, and the case comes back to haunt her later, posing the next question, one she had not been able to answer even with Jack: can you repair a relationship after one partner has been rejected and irretrievably hurt?I found the writing immediate and engaging, and Fiona’s peregrinations to work and back around the Holborn area, and her travels on circuit are well depicted. You feel the heavy judicial atmosphere of the courts with their swirling human dramas that take place within enclosed courtrooms, the humour and self-absorption of the legal folk, and the entertainments, like concerts and dinners, they put on to amuse themselves while always maintaining the highest standards in everything they do.

He is at times in conflict with himself when he says that his best writing is political and yet later declares that a person’s literary activities and political activities should remain separate: “When a writer engages in politics he should do so as a citizen, as a human being, but not AS A WRITER. Just as much as anyone else, he should be prepared to deliver lectures in draughty halls, to chalk pavements, to canvass voters, to distribute leaflets, even to fight in civil wars if it seems necessary. But whatever else he does in the service of his party, he should never write for it. He should make it clear that his writing is a thing apart.”He takes on the literary greats of his time, mainly in the role of a book er (His essay “Confessions of a Book Reviewer” is worthy of a separate , for it has so many gems for readers on this forum, and eerily rings true with what is happening today). Some of his prize quotes to whet your appetite:-	“He (Twain) even for a period of years deserted writing for business; and he squandered his time on buffooneries.”-	“He (Yeats) is a great hater of democracy, of the modern world, science, machinery, the concept of progress — above all, of the idea of human equality.”-	“The most immoral of Wodehouse’s characters is Jeeves, who acts as a foil to Bertie Wooster’s comparative high-mindedness and perhaps symbolizes the widespread English belief that intelligence and unscrupulousness are much the same thing.”-	“Tolstoy was capable of abjuring physical violence, but he was not capable of tolerance or humility, and even if one knew nothing of his other writings, one could deduce his tendency towards spiritual bullying.”-	“Shakespeare was not a systematic thinker, his most serious thoughts are uttered irrelevantly or indirectly.”Orwell stands as a respected outsider in the literary establishment, without allegiance to anyone. His comment on the Spanish Civil War sums up his position: “Wherever there is an enforced orthodoxy — or even two orthodoxies, as often happens — good writing stops.” Indeed, no good local writing came out of that conflict, Hemingway notwithstanding.Through this collection of essays, a portrait of Orwell emerges. A frightened schoolboy sent off to public boarding school at age eight; he was humiliated in front of his peers for bedwetting and soundly thrashed until the “bad habit” was cured. He followed his father at the age of 19 into the British overseas civil service and witnessed the underbelly of colonialism, resigning his cushy job after five years in Burma. Orwell chose thereafter to mix with the downtrodden even though he could have gone home at the end of the day to a warm bed in middle-class England. He joined the Spanish Civil War to fight Fascism and Communism which he saw as existential threats to Democratic Socialism. His prescience resulted in Animal Farm and 1984, books that ensured him literary immortality. Interestingly, those two books are the least mentioned in these essays which cover a broader swath of life, history, literature and politics, and present a more comprehensive picture of the author’s breath and depth.Upon finishing this collection, I had a sudden thought. I would like to have spent time with this man, despite him dying a few years before I was born. Given our mutual colonial upbringing, and having had to spend life as outliers in the literary field, we would have had a lot to talk about, I’m sure. In particular, I would liked to have asked him, given the great literary gifts he was bestowed with, why did he choose the squalor?...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jan 19, 2021","Jan 19, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42439909-collections-of-george-orwell-essays

Rowling stacked up as an adult story teller, now that she had conquered the YA universe. And I selected this particular novel, the second in the Cormoran Strike series (all four are in the house somewhere), because it deals with the world of publishing.Off the bat, I can say this book is too long for the amount of plot and character it covers. I wondered whether Rowling’s (make that, Galbraith’s) mighty shadow that hangs over editors to say, “How dare you edit me?” was the cause. There is a lot of talk, repetitions, summing up, and introspection that goes on with very little action—barring a hair-raising car-chase, the discovery of the grisly murder, and the dénouement—to warrant 450 pages. And yet there are facets that raise this novel above the mass of detective pot-boilers.The prime attraction for me was the glimpse offered into the world of publishing, in particular, it’s seamier side. There are writers, publishers, editors and agents that P.I. Strike and his loyal but unappreciated assistant, Robin, have to navigate through; each of these literary types are flawed and egotistical, with a passion for big lunches on other people’s expense accounts, fierce in their criticism of peers, desperately seeking adulation, and living in morbid fear of being forgotten. They come up with the most cutting comments that reflect the current state of the world of letters:1)	“Have you any idea how many people think they can write?” - Liz Tassel, literary agent2)	“We need more readers. Fewer writers.” – Daniel Chard, publisher3)	“I’ve never met a writer who wasn’t screwy.” – Jerry Waldegrave, editor4)	“The greatest female writers have been childless.” – Michael Fancourt, author, who goes on to say, “The whole world’s writing novels, but no one’s reading them” – I agree!The backdrop of London in the winter is well drawn, as the one-legged Strike painfully walks and stalks the wet and snowy streets of the city, sometimes falling, often stopping off for a beer, or several, and always ending up with a sore stump at the end of the day. Thus, we get to visit housing estates, pubs, restaurants, gentlemen’s clubs, and country homes. Everyone seems to want to talk to the quiet Strike who is a good listener and has great recall.The other draw is the quiet sexual tension between Strike and Robin, both still entangled in, or dealing with the ghost of, another relationship. She wants so much to prove herself as an investigator to him, and he dreads falling for her good looks and crossing the line of boss and employee. In the process, he can be callous and inconsiderate, while she can be reckless and snippy. Together they make a good team, supporting each other in the strangest of circumstances.The plot is skimpy: a rather nasty writer disappears and is found dead a few days later in a copy cat killing described in his latest unpublished manuscript that also tars and feathers everyone who is anyone in the publishing industry. This starts a round of interviews and repeat interviews by Strike and Robin to find out whodunit, with the police fixated on the wrong suspect. The fact that the interviews happen mainly in the domiciles of the suspects help paint their characters better and provides for movement in a rather static story – I was waiting for the second body, and possibly a third body, to fall somewhere along this long narrative, but was disappointed. And then I got rather ticked off, for the stereotypical crime novel device—of showing the detective having an epiphany and thereafter concealing all evidence of whodunit from the reader until the dramatic revelation could be made when all suspects are gathered together—was introduced in typical Agatha Christie-cliché style. I can see why Rowling-Galbraith has got into controversy with the LGBTQ community. Her rather masculine author pseudonyms notwithstanding, there are inferences to hermaphrodites and other categories of gender fluidness in this narrative, required no doubt for advancing the plot, but certain to be frowned upon in this politically correct landscape we currently traverse. I don’t think I will be reading any more Galbraith novels. The focus on the puzzle and only the puzzle, with very little other exposure (the literary backdrop saved this one), through 450 pages is enough to tire me. Perhaps when she is done with Strike and Galbraith, Rowling may be motivated to re-invent herself again, as a literary writer with no pseudonym this time – then I will be sure to sample her work once more....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2021","Jan 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18214414-the-silkworm

I captured some one-liners that summarises his views on them:Alphonse Daudet: “He may not be an artist, but he comes near the truth as some of the greatest.”Guy De Maupassant: “He forgets to strew paper roses over the tombs, making him cruel, cynical and hard.”Anatole France: “He perceived that political institutions are incapable of securing the happiness of mankind.”Ivan Turgenev: “All his creations, are human beings, not strange beasts in a menagerie knocking themselves to pieces in the stuffy darkness of mystical contradictions.”Stephen Crane: “He knew little of literature, either of his own country or of any other, but he was himself a wonderful artist in words, whenever he took a pen into his hand.”Marryat and James Fenimore Cooper: “Champion writers of the sea.”Overall, Conrad is complimentary of his peers and extols the virtues of the novel and the novelist: “Of all the inanimate objects, of all men’s creations, books are the nearest to us, for they contain our very thought, our ambitions, our indignations, our illusions, our fidelity to truth, and our persistent leaning towards error. But most of all they resemble us in their precarious hold on life. Where a novelist has an advantage over the workers in other fields of thought is in his privilege of freedom—the freedom of expression and the freedom of confessing his innermost beliefs—which should console him for the hard slavery of the pen.” On the political front, Conrad captures the swirling sentiments in Europe that led to WWI. He laments the Russian-Japanese war of 1904-05 as an example of Russian posturing – Japan ultimately won that war. He mourns the splintering of his native Poland into three, under German, Austrian and Russian sectors, and implores the West to restore the country back to its whole after boundaries are re-drawn at the end of WWI. He has special sanction for Russia and its Tsarist regime, foretelling the revolution that was to come, and declaring that this huge country did not belong to either Europe or Asia. Departing from merely political views, he details a trip he took back to Poland from his domicile in England, just as Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, triggering WWI; the Conrad family had to take a lengthy detour over several months, via Austria and Italy, before catching a Dutch freighter enroute from Java to London. The last third of the book is where Conrad returns to the sea, where he spent twenty years of his life and picked up the material for his fiction. He has strong opinions on well-known naval accidents involving vessels like Titanic, Aquitania, Empress of Ireland and Storstadt. He berates ship owners for taking short cuts (“Less life boats? How about selling less tickets?”), praises seamen for their courage under pressure, and advances technical solutions like stuffed rope fenders to reduce the severity of collisions.  A staunch supporter of the British Empire and the Merchant Navy, he pays tributes to ships and sailors: “The ship we serve, is the moral symbol of our life. A ship has to be respected, actually and ideally; her merit, her innocence, are sacred things. Of all the creations of man she is the closest partner of his toil and courage. I venture to affirm that the main characteristic of the British men spread all over the world, is not the spirit of adventure so much as the spirit of service.”This is an odd assembly of material for a single book, but it covers the areas that Conrad played in, and under his erudite and penetrating observations, brings to life the obscure first generation that led to the greatest cataclysms and upheavals of the last century....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2021","Jan 03, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18924108-notes-on-life-and-letters

From this late blooming (or awakening) Martin goes on to match his father in literary heft.This book is mainly an elegy to Kingsley, for we see him and his ghost throughout the book,  but it is mostly of the elder Amis coming down the mountain from the literary heights he attained after the success of his breakout novel, Lucky Jim. Kingsley loved his booze and his women and drove his wives away with his bad behaviour, even though they both remained loyal to him until the end. Kingsley is an enigma: he refused to drive and refused to fly, and couldn’t easily be alone in a bus, a train or a lift, or in a house after dark. Martin sums his father’s decline well: “With him, getting fat was more like a project, grimly inaugurated on the day Jane left him in the winter of 1980. He ate for comfort; the tranquillising effects of starch and glucose helped to allay fear. But I now see that his nocturnal gorging was a complex symptom, regressive, self-isolating. It cancelled him out sexually. It seemed to say that it was over: the quest for love, and the belief in its primacy.”Martin’s literary heroes are Christopher Hitchens, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, James Joyce, and of course, Daddy. Yet these literary stars were querulous and critical of each other:  Nabokov criticized Joyce, Kingsley criticized Nabokov, and Hitchens destroyed a visit with the ailing Bellow by talking outrageously. Similarly they ooze literary wisdom:1.     Don’t start two consecutive paragraphs with the same word, but you can start three consecutive ones.2.     The writer is the opposite of the suicide, constantly applauding life and, furthermore, creating it, assigning breath and pulse to ‘a nonexistent progeny.’3.     If the trick is to work, the unreliable narrator must in fact be very reliable indeed: reliably partial, reliably unaware of his own egotism.4.     Writers write far more penetratingly than they live. Their novels show them at their very best, making a huge effort: stretched until they twang.The narrative jumps back and forth in time, as if Martin prefers to dive deep into each recollection rather then try to stich them into a chronological order. Letters he sent his father and stepmother—candid ones that are quite literary and usually end with a request for money—open many of the chapters, and we see the budding and bold writer trying to match up to the established father. I got the impression that either Martin has a very impressive vocabulary or he was using ancient thesauri to pull out lesser used synonyms to pepper his narrative.Martin’s misfortunes with his bad teeth, that embarrass him no end, and Kingsley’s lingering death get more than required air time in this book. Also floating around to provide an air of mystery and tragedy is the murder of Martin’s first cousin, Lucy Partington, by one of Britain’s most prolific serial killers. Noteworthy is that the “villain of the piece” turns out to be Kingsley’s biographer who writes and sells an unflattering account of the elder Amis to the tabloids upon his subject’s death. Descriptions like, “He is Thersites: a one-speech phenomenon in the Iliad, but a fully developed argument in Troilus and Cressida. ‘Thou crusty batch of nature’, as the (here) despicable Achilles calls him. ‘[T]hou core of envy.’ Thersites — ‘A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint.’ He is the ‘deformed and scurrilous Greek’, compelled by his own baseness to see deformity everywhere” – didn’t enamour the biographer to the Amis family. I concur.This is a good book to glimpse into the life of a literary giant who did not have to struggle to get published (his father’s agent and publisher published Martin’s first book and got him off to the races without the required mandatory years committed to wandering in the literary wilderness). His career flourished in the company of well-known personalities of the literary and entertainment world. In Martin’s own words, he was an Osric, the unworthy courtier who found himself among royalty. This memoir is his attempt to succeed in the new world of experiential writing which he recognizes as ascendant – “We live in the age of mass loquacity. We are all writing it or at any rate talking it: the memoir, the apologia, the c.v., the cri de coeur. Nothing, for now, can compete with experience.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 29, 2020","Dec 29, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19260978-experience

However, given what I now had in hand, or on my tablet, I ploughed on.Henry Pulling is a retired banker, 55, bachelor, who spends his time looking after dahlias. He has never had much excitement in his life. Then his mother dies and he meets her younger sister, Aunt Augusta, 75, at the cremation. Aunt Augusta is the opposite of Henry, a worldly woman, who has been a racketeer, prostitute, drug smuggler, art smuggler, and is involved with shady types trying to overthrow overseas governments. She lives and thinks grand, and has a soft spot for Henry. She lives with a black manservant, Wordsworth, who appears everywhere and nowhere, following Augusta like a devoted puppy, despite her callous attitude towards him.Augusta invites Henry to travel with her and see the world. After a cautious and safe trip to Brighton, their itinerary expands to Turkey aboard the Orient Express and Paraguay. Shady deals go on throughout the journey, with frequent visits by the police. At one point, Henry lands in jail through no fault of his own but for sneezing. Augusta seems to be pursuing her dream man, Mr. Visconti, while Wordsworth seems to be pursuing her. And others, especially the American O’Toole’s, father and daughter, also keep appearing in the most odd places, their identity dubious – are they spies? If so, whose side are they on?This book is Greene letting loose, having fun away from his more serious works of the heart and soul. There are of course many dark secrets that get revealed along the way: is Henry’s mother really his mother, is Wordsworth more than a manservant, what is Visconti’s game, and is Tooley (O’Toole) really working for the CIA? All is revealed at the end, of course, and Henry is restored to a life beyond looking after dahlias. Although, I thought his choice of life partner was a bit…well, pedophilic… or was this Greene getting a shot in at the reader, turning the knife in at the last minute when we were beginning to think that all was well that ended well?I was left hoping I had read the novel.

He captures the American West with great flair and understatement, and avoids all the Hollywood cliches, even though many of his books have been turned into films, and he himself had a screenplay writing career in Tinseltown.Lonnie Bannon is the sensitive 17-year-old living with his grandparents, having lost his parents along the way (we are not told much about when, where, or how). He idolizes his 86-year old Grandpa Homer, who is resisting change and trying to make a go of it at raising cattle. Hud is the villain of the piece, Homer’s stepson, misogynistic, opportunistic, sadistic. Hud hates his step-father for sending him off to the war, and doesn’t do much around the ranch except run around at night, partying and sleeping with other men’s wives. Hud’s openly stated ambition is to usurp the Bannon ranch from his aging stepfather.There are also some secondary characters who are well drawn: Halmea the black domestic help, and Jesse the lonesome cowhand who has spent his years in the rodeo business amassing many experiences but not a nickel to his name. The suppressed sexual tension oozing between Lonnie, Halmea, and Jesse is palpable, although Hud is the only one able to act upon it—and how he does!With some foreshadowing of what’s to come, we realize that there is trouble when the dreaded Hoof and Mouth Disease strikes the Bannon herd, forcing Homer to make tough choices: kill the herd, liquidate, or sell oil rights on his land? He rails, “What good’s oil to me? What can I do with it? With a bunch a oil wells. I can’t ride out ever day an’ prowl amongst ’em, like I can my cattle. I can’t breed ’em or tend ’em or rope ’em or chase ’em or nothin’. I can’t feel a smidgen a pride in ’em, cause they ain’t none a my doin’.” One wonders whether this cattle disease is too convenient for Hud or whether he has had something to do with it, although according to Lonnie, “Hud had done everything he could to keep Homer from buying the Laredo cattle—he hated the whole South Texas area, and especially the Mexicans that were in it.”The annual rodeo comes to town and Lonnie tries to escape his domestic strife by looking for girls, booze, and entertainment, all of which seem hard to come by for him, given his deeply introspective and sensitive nature. McMurty evokes the atmosphere of the rodeo very well, a time when women and men drink to excess and cross boundaries, when animals go onery and maim their riders, when everyone lives an unnatural existence for four days and returns to normal life a bit changed. There were some elements of stagecraft that were lost on me. I couldn’t understand how Hud had such a hold over his step-father, and how old Homer made it so far from home in his nightshirt on the fateful last night of the rodeo. And most importantly, why someone didn’t beat the crap out of Hud for his in-your-face, upstart and immoral behaviour. Cowboys, you custodians of the upstanding moral code of the American West, where were you hiding?This is a tale of loss. For not only is the beloved herd lost (midway in the book, so no spoiler), but Lonnie starts to lose the people who matter to him, including his home. And even though the events leading to the ending are dramatic, the climax fizzles out. The avenging cowboy laying the bad guy low does not happen, cliché though it is; instead the ending reinforces that Might is Right in America, that change is hard-to-impossible for the older generation, and that crooked people win over honest ones. I was reminded of that Shakespearean quote “The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.” McMurty seems to modify it slightly to imply, “The evil men live after the good ones are interred with their bones.”...more",Notes are private!,3,9,1,not set,"Dec 12, 2020","Dec 12, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/38206835-horseman-pass-by

What I read was a series of long essays still mired in disparate source quotes, woven into complex, run-on, and fragmented sentences, some that spanned whole paragraphs – certainly not your everyday journalistic writing.Many of these pieces were written on the eve of a presidential election – so the focus is on the buildup and not the outcome – i.e. Bush Sr. vs. Dukakis, Clinton vs. Dole, Bush Jr. vs Gore et al. There is also an implied belief that the reader understands the issues of the day, which at this point is historical and faded from memory. As these essays were also published in the New York Review of Books, and refer to several books within them – Newt Gingrich’s To Renew America, Bob Woodward’s The Choice and Marvin Olasky’s The Tragedy of American Compassion among others – one needs to have read these books to get a deeper appreciation of Didion’s essays – unfortunately, I haven’t read these books.A theme emerges of the evolution, or a straying away from the core, of American politics between the ‘80’s and the year 2000, the time span during which these essays were written. Beginning with Reagonomics that reduced regulatory barriers and unleashed the “Me, Myself and I” culture, to the fall from grace that this hedonism attained with the impeachment of Bill Clinton, to the resurgence of the religious right under George W. Bush where a return to binding the state to religion (termed Reconstructionism) was advocated, Didion portrays the see-saw swings of political ideology and the manipulation of the electorate by a few college-educated, establishment types (and the partisan press). The photo-op, the undecided voter, the negative attack ad – these election-winning devices reared their heads during this 30-year span to become the monsters they are today.What I liked best, if I were to confer the title of Literary Journalist upon Didion, was her character portraits of the personalities within this book. Ronald Reagan was the quintessential movie actor, even in his role of president: organized, superficial in relationships, managing his daily schedule like a film script, always looking for the drama in his interactions, even making up stories to deepen character. Bill Clinton always talked about the pain of his childhood, and seized upon hate speeches made by others to show what a clean guy he was. Newt Gingrich was the self-reliant man with outlandish ideas on the how much the individual could achieve – including space travel and a modern Jurassic Park. And Bob Woodward had a problem describing what his books were about. Being often in the coterie of journalists invited to accompany presidential candidates on their campaign trails, Didion had an incredible closeness to the personalities and issues of the time while writing these essays.I am pretty sure these pieces would have been lapped up during the time they were written, for the author adopts an objective stance, dissecting liberals and conservatives alike.

I guess we will never truly know, except that her writings reveal the world at its worst and most shameful.This book is termed her masterpiece, for it has gone into many editions, with a new section being added every time she went to yet another theatre of war after the previous edition had gone to press. In all, she covered the Spanish Civil War, WWII, the Vietnam War, The Six-Day War, and the guerilla wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The dispatches she sent from the battle front, many of them published by Colliers Magazine, form the chapters in this book.There are so many set pieces described from her grandstand view, tableaux of life at the battle front, that they are too numerous to include in this . Suffice to say that this book is a collage of images that highlights the randomness by which winners and losers are picked during conflict; who will live, who will die, and who will be indiscriminately maimed. Flying fragments of shrapnel and bullets pick off body parts at random—a leg here, an arm there, a head here, a stomach there, an eye here, an ear there. Lives for the survivors are indelibly changed thereafter. Gellhorn miraculously escaped getting hurt during all her missions, testament perhaps to her divinely anointed role of witness to the atrocities of the 20th century.Her earlier dispatches are subjective, where she focusses on the unfairness of the politics and on the plight of the victims. In Spain and during WWII, she laments, “We were guilty of the dishonest abandonment of Spain and the quick cheap betrayal of Czechoslovakia. We niggled and refused asylum to doomed Jews; we inspected and rejected anti-Fascists fleeing for their lives from Hitler; we were full of shames and ugly expediencies.”Battles and age hardens her, and by the time she gets to Vietnam and Central America, she is broadening her reportage with statistics: Vietnam—“Fifty-eight thousand twenty-two Americans died in Vietnam, in combat and from non-combat hazards. 300,000 Americans were wounded”; Nicaragua—""To the end of 1984, U.S. taxes have paid for the murder of 3,954 harmless men and women and 3,346 children, the uprooting of 142,980 people now refugees, the destruction of 137 hopeful modest infant centers, clinics, schools, co-operatives, built by the Sandinistas for the peasants.” Her statistics on nuclear proliferation is even more cutting (albeit these are 1983 numbers): “Global military expenditure—$728.3 billion—and global health care, $545 billion. In ten years to 1985, Third World governments ran up a debt of $240 billion for imported weaponry. Armed conflicts have been a tragedy for the poor people of the Third World every year since 1945, with a death toll calculated at 20 million and mounting. In 1984, 26,980,000 men and some women wore the military uniforms of 140 nations: global armed forces of nearly 27 million people.”Her condemnation of US complicity in the mini-wars around the world is total in several quotes:•	“These peasants had survived the Vietcong since 1957, on whatever terms, hostile or friendly, and the war however it came to them. But they cannot survive our bombs. Is this an honorable way for a great nation to fight a war 10,000 miles from its safe homeland?”•	“There is never enough money for life, though money can always be found for armaments, nuclear and conventional, and for our immense military establishments.”•	“We should stop calling ourselves the Free World and instead call ourselves the Free Enterprise World.” Totalitarianism is rejected but Authoritarianism is accepted.”•	“In 1823, the Monroe Doctrine established the claim that the U.S. had a backyard and the right to supervise it. Since 1909, when the U.S. ousted a popular Nicaraguan President, the American government has actively supported its own choice for President of Nicaragua, sending the marines if there was any sign of revolt. No American President denounced the long and real Somoza tyranny.”Despite the desolation of war, there are some bright and philosophical spots in the book. Here is how she describes the life of a war correspondent: “Meantime you could sit on the sand with a book and a drink of sweet Italian rum and watch two British destroyers shelling Rimini, just up the coast; see German shells landing on the front three kilometers away; follow a pilot in a slowly sinking parachute, after his plane had been shot down; hear a few German shells whistle overhead to land two hundred yards farther down; and you were getting a fine sunburn and life seemed an excellent invention.” Or the outlook of a Jewish survivor: : “He was thinking of the future; he was thinking of the world that would be safe and honorable and free. It was amazing that he never commented on the Germans at all.” Or the words of the Polish spy tortured by the Germans: “It is possible that disgust can be greater than hate; that disgust can be the strongest emotion of all.” Call her a bleeding heart leftist if you will, or a Zionist (she was unshaken in her support for Israel), but she was a very courageous woman, far ahead of her time. She served as witness to the unfairness in the world and was not daunted in writing about it, even if it cost her sanction or censor. Her concluding remarks attests to her belief in a better world just out of reach: “The state has fallen down on its job: instead of a fuller life, the state has led man to a haunted life. There has to be a better way to run the world and we better see that we get it.""Unfortunately, Martha Gellhorn did not live to see that better world....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Nov 28, 2020","Nov 28, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25595123-the-face-of-war

What I have learned since is that not all Nobel authors are that accessible, for many were trying to “stretch the form” or invent a new one, some experiments that worked for me (like Hemingway) and others that didn’t (Bellow being one).Reading through the pages of this book, trying to find it’s core premise and latch onto a narrator I could hang my hat on until the end, I drew a blank on both counts. I got the foggy idea that Bellow was trying to conjure up an image of Depression-era Jews in Chicago, scrambling frenetically to cobble together a living in their ghettoized sections of society, by hook or by crook. However, I was hoping that I wouldn’t be subjected to a frenetic narrator who spewed more words than were required, who floated everywhere and nowhere at once, and who left me pretty much where I had begun 60 pages earlier. And if I was going to be subjected to another 500 pages of rambling sentence gymnastics, which was making me skim big time, this was not the book for me. Therefore, read this if you must read the great Bellow experimenting with yet another literary form, i.e. the survivalist mind of a frenetic Jew, called Augie March.

I witnessed this in his previous memoir, Fortunate Isle, in which he landed in the Canary Islands by fortuitous circumstances at the age of 18. In this later memoir, The Kilt Behind the Curtain, chronicling two years of living in Romania in the late 1960’s as a visiting English professor under government auspices, he takes that devil-may-care nonchalance to a whole new level.Ron gets this appointment via an intergovernmental exchange of university professors. Unlike normal diplomatic personnel, he is free of the strict protocols by which he must live his life and is able to stretch the law with impunity. Conversely, he enjoys no diplomatic immunity. Thus, although supposedly confined to the city limits of Bucharest, Ron travels into the Carpathian Mountains, Transylvania, and all the way north to the Russian border on weekends and longer excursions on the premise that “if the Romanians set my limits, they can enforce them.” His art of the bluff works well throughout his stay and he is left to discover this paradoxical country unfettered, although his apartment is bugged, spies are set on his tail constantly, and his academic colleagues shy away from him for fear that they will have to report their meetings to the dreaded “Base.”This memoir is part history of the country, part socio-political exposé, and part travelogue, and I was intrigued on all counts, as Romania seems to be constantly relegated to the backwaters in all these areas and plays a minor role in our quotidian consciousness. Yet, there is a lot to unpack here. I learned that Romanians are leftovers of the Roman Empire and consider themselves Latin, although their industriousness, self-control, and persistence likens them to their northern neighbours. They are highly educated and speak multiple languages – four per citizen is average; three, not good enough. It is a nation of many migrations and occupations, with Hungarians, Germans, Saxons and Jews adding to the ethnic mix.The cloak of Socialism that enveloped the country in 1947 and tightened into a chokehold under Nicolai Ceauşescu in the 1960’s set the country back generations. Everyone dreaded the security service, Securitate; many were induced to become informants. Imports were banned and essential good were in constant and rotating short supply. Even for Ron, coming out of the WWII-ravaged UK, shortages had become a thing of the past in his native country by the ’60’s. Consequent to this scarcity, Romanians believed that Westerners had two of everything, and every transaction was viewed with commercial gain in mind. When he plans to give his Romanian girlfriend “M” (name withheld for obvious reasons) a farewell gift, it was suggested he retrofit his typewriter with Romanian letters, as that would make good barter for an exit visa.Life in Romania is a struggle: elbows and fists are required to get into busses—and watch out for getting electrocuted; shop shelves are thinly populated; you need to buy empties before you can exchange them for bottles of milk and yoghurt at the travelling street vendor; barter is a more effective form of currency, yet Romanians do not want to get into anyone’s debt for fear the pay-back may have political connotations.Despite social limitations, Ron is a frequenter of US and UK diplomatic cocktail parties and selectively makes clandestine meetings with some of his bolder Romanian colleagues to get glimpses into their lives. Many live in one-bedroom apartments of single family dwellings, subdivided between several families – a Ceauşescu innovation to free up accommodation for rural migrants streaming into cities. Many in one of those rooms owned the entire house before it was nationalized. Some are contemplating defecting to the west and confide in Ron, seeking his help on the other side. Others are looking for favours from their present political masters by trying to get some “western dirt” out of Ron.Colourful characters dot the pages: Karen, the glamourous spy planted to date Ron and take him out to upscale restaurants and cultural events that his British diplomatic colleagues can only salivate over: Petru, the homosexual, who takes over from Karen, when Ron showed he was not willing to cross the line with Petru’s now-redundant colleague; Alexandru from Alexandria who takes adult education classes from Ron, and who is anything but whom he claims to be; Dudu and his abortive defection to the west; Dino who invents the most convoluted secret rendezvous process to give Ron a glimpse of a printer’s proof copy of James Joyce’s posthumous love poem translated into Romanian; “C,” the deposed writer from the national writers’ union who shows up uninvited at diplomatic soirees to steal cigarettes. The list goes on…The most interesting parts to me were the descriptions of Ron’s travels through Romania and into neighbouring Bulgaria, some undertaken with his mother Pearl (another avid and fearless traveller), and others with British and Romanian friends. Scenes of Transylvania, small towns along the Danube Delta, Wallachia and Bucovina are vividly painted with description and incident. Making hotel reservations is anathema to these travellers; they just show up and see what’s on offer at each off-beat location, even if it’s only the back seat of their car. Going off the beaten track to peer into the Russian side of the border is routine stuff for our intrepid Ron, even if the upshot is to be discovered by a Romanian tank brigade, having the tank brigade commander peer into the car, which also carries two unauthorized Romanian women, and having to think on his feet to get out of this jam! Ronald Mackay has covered a very important time and place in history, one that has vanished, as Communism was dismantled in Romania in the late ‘80’s and the internet made us all similar in boring ways. It’s a testament to vanishing cultural vestiges in a country at the cross-roads of European migration, and to the fearless human spirit that demands the world to be a safe place, despite its quirks, one that we must be free to travel in and experience without fear....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2020","Nov 02, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55244758-the-kilt-behind-the-curtain

Now, as I enter my golden years, I picked it up again to see whether it had the same pull as before. The pull was greater this time.Hesse, perhaps out of respect, and wanting to create fictional protagonists out of religious leaders, creates the fictional character of Siddhartha, one who has the same name as the Buddha. He lives during the time of the Buddha. Siddhartha’s life follows a similar path of the Buddha: born into privilege, rejecting comfort and taking up the ascetic life at a young age, discovering its limitations and taking the middle path to enlightenment, and ending his days as a great teacher and spiritual leader. In fact, the fictional Siddhartha meets the older Buddha and tells him that living by others’ teachings, something he had done as a Brahman and later as a Samana, is insubstantial; Siddhartha wants to experience enlightenment, just as the Buddha has done. The Buddha smiles, as if to say, “The road ahead is long and tortuous.”Siddhartha, therefore, leaves the life of an ascetic Samana where his only skills are of waiting, fasting and thinking, to lead the sensual life. He takes up with the courtesan Kamala, becomes a successful businessman, and accumulates wealth. He gives into lust, and gambling, but finds both to be masks that hide his continued dissatisfaction. “I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself! I searched Atman (soul), I searched Brahman, I was willing to dissect my self and peel off all its layers, to find the core of all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate part. But I have lost myself in the process.” He finally leaves the worldly life too, heading for the river, a place where enlightenment will finally come, but only after learning the pain of love.The river is a metaphor for the circular nature of life and the confluence of all desires and sufferings: flowing, evaporating, condensing and flowing once more. Everything and everyone that goes upstream, finally returns downstream, and the water flows everywhere simultaneously, making the past and the future irrelevant, making only the present matter.There are some beautiful words of wisdom in this book, although Siddhartha claims that wisdom is intrinsic to the individual and cannot be transferred, as he had once complained to the Buddha.1)	Everyone can perform magic; everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, to wait, and to fast.2)	Writing is good, thinking is better. Intelligence is good, but patience is better.3)	“There was nothing that the wise one or thinker possessed that put him above the rest of them except for one single, small, tiny thing: the awareness and conscious thought of the unity of all life.”4)	“I therefore see whatever exists as good. Death is like life to me, sin is like holiness, wisdom is like foolishness; everything has to be just as it is, and everything requires only my consent, willingness, and loving agreement to become good to me and work for my benefit, unable to ever harm me.”5)	“When someone is searching, then it can easily happen that the only thing his eyes see is that for which he is searching. He is then unable to find anything or let any thought enter his mind because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search. He is obsessed by a goal; searching means having a goal. But finding means: being free, open, and having no goal.”The story is told in the form of a parable, full of wisdom and philosophy, low on the other elements of novelistic importance.Hesse was supposed to have had a less than fulfilling visit to India before he wrote this novel. But I suppose the insights in this book did not only come from that visit but from a continuous preoccupation on the purpose of life and the search for meaning.I highly recommend this read....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Oct 24, 2020","Oct 24, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43811099-siddhartha

As the title suggests, I think Roth is pulling a deception not only on his wife and his lovers, but also on his readers in A Deception on the Reader? As the title suggests, I think Roth is pulling a deception not only on his wife and his lovers, but also on his readers in this book which reads like a radio play for want of narration, action, or scene depiction.At first the novel seems like a peep-show into an adulterous affair. The man, a 51 year-old American writer living in England is called Philip by his 34 year-old English lover. She is married with a child, a job, a nanny, and a husband who parades his mistress in her face. She is severely conflicted about everything and is contemplating divorce. He is suffering the alienation of an American in England. They meet regularly for sex and talk, in his studio. This talk is the subject matter of the book. Occasionally, they stray into other pet Roth subjects like fathers, mothers, misogyny, his work, and the Jews.But then the talk shifts to other female voices: a jet-setting Czech prostitute who wants Roth to help her write a novel; a 33-year old Polish woman with a child who also wants him to help her write; an English woman from his past in New York who is suffering from cancer; his wife who accidentally discovers his notebook with all these “conversations.” Roth defends his notebook, saying that all the women recorded within are fictional characters. He sums it up as, “But then I am not the only man who thinks about imaginary women while in the bedroom with the woman he regularly sleeps with. There may even be women who behave just as impurely in their bedrooms with the men they regularly sleep with. The difference is that what I impurely imagine, I am impelled to develop and write down. In my imagination I am unfaithful to everybody, by the way, not just to you.”During these post-coital periods of euphoria and unburdening, he postulates about adultery and the life of a writer with pearls of wisdom such as:1)	“One of the unfair things about adultery, when you compare the lover to the spouse, the lover is never seen in those awful dreary circumstances, arguing about the vegetables, or burning toast, or forgetting to ring up for something, or putting upon someone or being put upon. All that stuff, I think, people deliberately keep out of affairs.”2)	“By the time a novelist worth his salt is thirty-six, he’s no longer translating experience into a fable—he’s imposing his fable onto experience.”3)	When asked where he stands : “Yes, somewhere between desire and disillusionment on the long plummet to death.”4)	When asked why he likes East Europeans (in real life Roth was helping dissident Eastern Block writers at the time) he says: “Displaced persons have things to tell me. I’m interested in suffering.” One wonders whether that is true of his lovers too.5)	On the role of the writer: “The nose in the seam of the undergarment—that’s the writer’s nature. Impurity.”6)	“But discretion is, unfortunately, not for novelists. Neither is shame.”Other Roth creations flit in and out of the narrative: writers Lonoff and Zuckerman, for instance. In fact, Roth claims he is writing Zuckerman’s biography, the fictional writer having died at age 44 after writing only 4 novels—we know that Roth changed his mind on Zuckerman later, for this alter-ego rose from the dead to write many more novels.So what is this novel all about, then? First of all, it is Roth further exploring the prime subject in all of his books: himself. Second, it covers a period in his life when he was feeling displaced and diminished as an expatriate and took refuge in adultery. Third, it shows his passion for digging up people’s stories and fictionalizing them. And finally he was trying out a new form – dialogue with no attributions, just voices plumbing into human nature and unearthing disturbing truths. I don’t think he had much consideration for the reader – if you are able to follow who is saying what to whom and when, then well and good, if not… put it down to another deception on the part of the author.His (fictional?) lover sums him up well in the end: “You love your typewriter more than you could ever love any woman.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Oct 15, 2020","Oct 15, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19440440-deception

Sitting between the three emperors in age (he is the adopted grandson of Augustus, the nephew of Tiberius and the uncle of Caligula) Claudius witnesses the grandeur, folly and mayhem these rulers unleash upon Rome.Augustus is the great empire maker, bringing the far flung colonies of Rome under central command and creating a working form of government. Universally revered by the populace, he is destined to be crowned a god upon his death. He is, however, henpecked by the real power behind the throne, his second wife Livia of the Claudian line. Livia is the villain of the piece, forcing Augustus to divorce his first wife, Scribonia, on trumped up charges that she was carrying another man’s baby (when it was Augustus’); she poisons an ever-lengthening list of nobles who are perceived threats to her reign – after awhile, if anyone dies suddenly, just put it down to Livia’s work. She even resorts to exotic forms of poison: Julia, the supposed love child of Scribonia, is given “a mixture of crushed bodies of certain green flies” which turns her into a nymphomaniac. Some of those who fall out of favour are exiled for life on remote islands of the empire.Tiberius keeps Livia close to him when he ascends the throne. He is a mean and ugly man, distinguished in battle. His reign is filled with informers; trials by trumped-up charge of anyone suspected of treason are de rigueur. His ally is Sejanus, Head of the Guards, who fills His Excellency’s head with the dirty (and false) secrets of those who must be gotten rid of. Counterbalancing Tiberius is his nephew and Claudius’ brother, Germanicus, the truly noble and courageous Roman. Germanicus distinguishes himself in battles in Germany and France and challenges his uncle’s unsavoury practices, only to end up poisoned. Sejanus’s reward for his poison-tip whispering is to be dismembered by Tiberius. Everyone lives in fear, and loyalty has an expiry date.Fear ramps up to a ridiculous degree when the mad Caligula has his grand-uncle assassinated and ascends the throne. Sports, arts, and entertainment-crazy young Caligula runs through the empire’s coffers in a non-ending debauch; he passes laws that force the citizens to pay for his excesses; he openly sleeps with his trusted senators’ wives, after running through four wives himself; he murders people at will, just for the heck of it. Claudius lives in mortal fear of his crazy nephew, placating and humoring him at every move.Of course, this mad reign has to end in carnage, and it does, leaving no one to rule in the royal family but the crippled and cowering uncle Claudius, who is quickly elevated to emperor to quell a mutiny in the ranks of the military. Claudius’ enlightened 14-year rule is the subject of the sequel to this novel.Given that Claudius is a writer and a historian, accredited with documenting the history of the pre-Roman civilization of Carthage and compiling a dictionary of the Etruscan language, his style of narration is ponderous and full of historic detail. There is event upon event piled in here, far too much to list.Ancient Romans do not come across as deep thinkers, but are practical people who work on expediency. Marriage is a convenience and respected for its legality, but immorality and infidelity are rife. Among the nobility, the birth rate is declining, and it is every emperor’s duty to see that the right people marry and breed to keep the royal line alive. Conversely, the emperor has to be prepared to sacrifice family members who put the line in jeopardy. This is a very good book for those wanting an insider’s glimpse of the last days of an empire. Graves has created a great insider in Claudius. This period reminds me of another empire that is in decline during our lifetimes; the antics at this modern version of the “imperial palace” which flashes across our social media screens is no different from the one in Claudius’ time, although perhaps poison is not on the menu, but Covid-19 seems to be – and we can leave poison to that other Cold War adversary. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2020","Oct 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18765.I_Claudius

This compilation of Martha Gellhorn’s letters during the formative years (1930- 1949) of her long journalistic career is an excellent glimpse into the intimate corners of a complex woman, a woman from—and connected to—privilege, who risked her life to display the world’s warts and fight for the underdog.Starting from her doomed affair with a married, older man, Bertrand de Jouvenel who could (or would?) never get a divorce, and an absentee marriage to Ernest Hemingway, Gellhorn goes onto have many relationships with men of influence. Even the doddering 69-year old sex fiend, H.G. Wells, falls “ass over tea-kettle” for 26 year-old Martha at one point and helps get her first book published. Many of the letters are love letters, of pining from a distance (mostly suffered by the men, particularly Betrand and Ernest), a distance Martha seems to have sought, for she was self-confessed about preferring being desired by men rather than having sex with them. Some of her letters to Hemingway and Wells amount to overt flattery just to string them along. There were times when I felt she was flagrantly using her contacts to further her career, although as a journalist she was often without money and constantly on the move without acquiring firm roots.The letters also expose a very close and sometimes mutually fawning relationship between Gellhorn and Eleanor Roosevelt, a relationship that opens many doors for the young journalist, particularly to provide her with letters of safe passage from President Roosevelt during her peregrinations in war-ravaged zones and to get her preferential treatment when, having no success at giving birth to a child, she adopts one as a single parent. This latter move was something unheard of at the time, and would not have happened if not for the intervention of Aunty Eleanor.Although claiming not to be only about Hemingway, the bulk of this book, focusses on the affair Martha began with him while Ernest was still married to Pauline Pfeiffer, while they were both covering the Spanish Civil War, and during the subsequent five years when they were married to each other. Most of those married years were spent apart, as these two ambitious writers selfishly pursued their respective careers. Professional jealousy permeated the marriage, and while Gellhorn helped Hemingway with his masterpiece, For Whom The Bells Toll, during this time, and he was able to get her a better publisher in Scribners, her letters indicate that she roiled in the shadow of his literary greatness. “You are a very great writer and what you see gets compacted into a book. I’m not a very great writer and function more like colonic irrigation.” For his part, Hemingway wanted a wife minding the home fires, taking care of him, and not gadding about the world covering hot spots. The final straw snapped when Ernest stole Martha’s press pass to cover D-Day, leading her to stow away aboard a hospital ship to get to the war zone and scoop him.Gellhorn was the consummate writer and used the craft for mind and spirit purgation, not for just earning a living, although as her war correspondent’s reputation grew, she earned top dollar for her on-location pieces with Colliers Magazine, more than she did with her early books. The angst and rejection of the writer comes out in some of her letters as she tries valiantly to aim for the masterpiece but always falls short, in her opinion. She was also born at the wrong age – she espoused feminism in an age of femininity, and bemoaned that being a woman didn’t help perform her dangerous job. Her desire to throw herself in harm’s way was also driven by the need to be recognized and escape her drab hometown life in St. Louis, Missouri. “If you are part of a big thing, you are safe.”And yet, I feel she believed in some form of immunity for her class, nationality, and sex during her travels through theatres of war. Somehow, it was somebody else’s job to get wounded or die, not hers, for why else would she have left her gas mask back in New York when she travelled to the European battlefront, or embark upon torpedo-infested seas to get to Finland to cover the Russian invasion, or live in a hotel that was smack in the line of fire between Nationalist and Republican forces in Spain? The value of her writing, both in her fiction and non-fiction, is the insider’s view that she brought to the reader. She was the quintessential witness to the horrors of the 20th century – this is probably the underlying motive that drove her, for even the promise of literary greatness is not sufficient to put oneself in harm’s way repeatedly, like she did, like a punch-drunk boxer looking for the next fight.Her summation: “Half of the world is bullied and terrorized by dictators, and the other half is soppy with cowardice and selfishness. The young men will die and the old, powerful men will survive to mishandle the peace.” True today, as it was then, making me wonder whether Martha gave of herself in vain—the world is not going to change overnight, selfless journalists, notwithstanding....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 20, 2020","Oct 31, 2020","Sep 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44765548-yours-for-probably-always

Reading it now, nearly twenty years into my writing journey, it is a goldmine of information and a reassurance regarding this perilous profession.Somerset Maugham, one of the most celebrated popular writers and playwrights of the 19th and 20th centuries, has often been dismissed by the literati for not being a serious literary writer. And yet, many envied the lifestyle he enjoyed as a writer with his home on the French Riviera, his travels around the globe into hot-spots and playgrounds, his many plays in London and Broadway, and the movies made of his novels and short stories.In this book, condensed from 15 manuscripts, which spans from 1892 when the author was 18 to 1944 when he was seventy, we see the man behind the mask: the philosopher, the product of empire, the acute and intrusive observer, the restless seeker, the spy, the consummate healer, the atheist, the man with his secret sexuality, and the celebrity who believed that his success was fleeting. From his early thoughts on the purpose of life, he dedicates separate chapters to travel (in the South Pacific, South-East Asia, Europe, America, and India), to the people he encountered and who made it either whole or in part as characters in his fiction, to his practice strokes of place descriptions spurred by criticism that his writing was flat, to his wartime exploits as a doctor and spy (WWI) and Allied promoter (WWII), and to his ruminations on a life-lived to the max as he enters his seventies.Along the way, we are exposed to his philosophy of life, insights that elevate him above the average writing hack (literati – take note!):-“Unselfish parents have selfish children” – he justifies the selfishness in children.-Wisdom is only available to a minority – hence the world cannot act wisely. -The attainment of pleasure is the object of all actions.- A novelist must never grow up, or else he will lose interest in his craft.- The ego causes our wickedness. But it also gave us music, poetry, painting and art.- Being famous? Like wondering whether the string of pearls you have is real or cultured.- Americans are more concerned with their plumbing than their cooking.I found his descriptions of the outer reaches and trading outposts of the British Empire and its denizens to be the most interesting. Many of the characters he paints are expatriates who are missing something in their lives, who drink copiously, are married to local women, or are of mixed blood themselves. They live lives of isolation with a marked lack of intellectual stimulation, like deformed trees that have grown up on a beach under a one-directional force of wind.As he sums up in his three-score-and-tenth year, he accepts responsibility for his earlier self-righteousness, although he still believes that “might is right.” He still has trouble with the soul and its transmigration as he was exposed to in India, and he believes in death being a full stop. He doesn’t mourn the loss of his boat, his house on the Riviera, and his artwork – all confiscated by the Axis powers – at least in this respect he has realized that you can’t take your earthly wealth with you. However, like a good writer, he laments that there are four novels he yet has to write but doesn’t have the energy to get to them; but also like a good writer, in a footnote written five years later, he apparently finished three of them.This is a writer’s notebook, and should be appreciated as such: scraps of disparate information and sketches that paint the life of an itinerant writer and the places and people he touched. Unlike his fiction, it has no beginning, middle and end. However, for a writer, it is an engaging companion for those long days when we feel we are going nowhere....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Sep 13, 2020","Sep 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/758496.A_Writer_s_Notebook

The tales go beyond the usual cloak and dagger stuff to pry into the empty and deceptive lives of the characters, and it makes one wonder whether these spy games ever advanced the lives of their players or the fates of nations that set them in motion. Everyone in Geneva is a spy of some sort – it’s a lucrative profession during a war when other occupations have restricted opportunity.Ashenden's job duties can be summed up as: “He saw his spies at stated intervals and paid them their wages; when he could get hold of a new one he engaged him, gave him his instructions and sent him off to Germany; he waited for the information that came through and dispatched it; he went into France once a week to confer with his colleague over the frontier and to receive his orders from London; he visited the market-place on market-day to get any message the old butter-woman had brought him from the other side of the lake; he kept his eyes and ears open; and he wrote long reports which he was convinced no one read.”Some jobs are ruthlessly executed, even if it means luring a spy from the opposing camp over to the Allied side under false premises to meet his death. Sometimes the job is botched, and the wrong man is bumped off. And some stories have nothing to do with spying but consist of matters of the heart or of events that reveal human character.Interesting characters make entrances and exits: Manuel Carmine, The Hairless Mexican, is a dispossessed feudal lord from his country, now acting as a British spy; The English Ambassador to Country X—stiff, formal and uncompromising—who had an affair with a gymnast, during his youth, and would rather be dragged into the gutter by her than live his pretentious life as a diplomat; Harrington, the Loud American, who cannot stop talking, and in the midst of a revolution complains of not having sugar for tea, butter for bread, and not getting his washing back; Giulia Lazzari, who is badgered to betray her lover but will not leave the scene of the crime without reclaiming the watch she bought him for 12 pounds sterling.There is no room for love. Maugham notes that artists do not make good lovers, They love themselves above all. But Ashenden has one love interest: the married woman, Anastasia Alexandrovna Semenovitch alias Delilah. He had planned on marrying her once, but after a week spent in Paris with her, after eating only scrambled eggs every morning, her favourite, Ashenden fled to America.Spying involves a lot of waiting. Ashenden passes the time in book shops turning over the pages of books that would have been worth reading if life were a thousand years long. Yet, the lifestyles of the well heeled, among whom much of the spying goes on, are well drawn. Ashenden and his contacts are housed in hotel rooms that look like apartments, replete with living rooms, and his official existence is categorized as “orderly and monotonous as a city clerk’s.”Ashenden is not a James Bond, although he may have given 007’s creator, Ian Fleming, the frame upon which to create his spy. Ashenden is instead a bundle of nerves during most undercover encounters; he suffers from train fever (arriving at the station an hour before departure lest he miss his train), and yet he can be cold blooded too. When faced with whether to give the order, or not, to bomb a whole lot of people, he flippantly tosses a coin for it. And, I wonder whether Fleming decided to call Bond’s boss “M,” by borrowing from Ashenden’s equivalent minder, “R,” perhaps?I struggled a bit with the style, which is now a century old. This is a very “told” story, or a series of events, some connected, others not, with most of the recounting being conjecture going on in Ashenden’s head. Terminology is also dated: “Orientals"" in Maugham's day extended to Indians, Turks and Egyptians. Interweaving pronouns and possessive pronouns clutter the sentences: “He found him slightly aloof. But as the hazards of his work brought him from time to time into contact with him he discerned that the distant manner was due merely to shyness and as he came to know him better he was charmed by the uncommon sweetness of his disposition.” Take out your pencil and go figure out which “he,” “him” and “his” belongs to whom!Maugham begins the novel with a treatise on writing, which I found interesting. Here are some nuggets I picked up:•	When it comes to fifty pages or more, a story needs a supporting skeleton, its plot. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. The unexpected twist, which the imitators of Chekov despise, is only bad when it is badly done.•	Fiction should use life merely as raw material which it arranges in ingenious patterns. Like a painter creating a work of art by rearranging reality to achieve coherence and balance.•	It was left for the Impressionists to paint what they saw. They tried to catch nature in its fleeting beauty; they were content to render the radiance of sunlight, the colour of shadows or the translucency of the air. They aimed at truth. They wanted a painter to be no more than an eye and a hand. They despised intelligence.•	The method of Claude Monet is the method of that master of the short story Guy de Maupassant.A leisurely read, as leisurely as the lifestyle Ashenden has in Switzerland, punctuated only with some moments of tension when our hero has to emerge from a book shop or a solitary meal, and actually work for His Majesty’s Secret Service....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Sep 08, 2020","Sep 08, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44292906-ashenden-or-the-british-agent

Sandwiched between two other Zuckerman books of a personal nature, Zuckerman Unbound and The Counterlife, The Anatomy Lesson has our hero suffering from a mysterious and incurable neck pain going on for nearly 18 months. “One doctor prescribed a regimen of twelve aspirin per day, another prescribed Butazolidin, another Robaxin, another Percodan, another Valium, another Prednisone; another told him to throw all the pills down the toilet, the poisonous Prednisone first, and ‘learn to live with it.’” We suspect his pain comes from a hurt ego caused by a bad book  from fellow Jewish critic Milton Appel, and guilt from the damage Zuckerman brought upon his now-dead parents by the publication of his bestselling fourth novel Carnovsky (a proxy for Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint). That writing is an act of imagination seems to perplex and infuriate everyone. Life and art are distinct, posits Zuckerman; what could be clearer?To be raised as a post-immigrant Jew in America is to be given a ticket out of the ghetto into a wholly unconstrained world of thought. Both Appel and Zuckerman fit this mold. Yet Appel turned from friend to foe after the Carnovsky novel, categorizing Zuckerman as anti-Semite. The Zuckerman-Appel conflict can be summed up as: “I’m a petty, raging, vengeful, unforgiving Jew, and I have been insulted one time too many by another petty, raging, vengeful, unforgiving Jew.”Hopped on drugs and fueled by alcohol, Zuckerman comes to the conclusion that he has to give up his career of writing, recognize his four dead marriages as being a consequence of the writer’s claustrophobic and self-absorbed life, give up his current four mistresses who each nurse him at different times without colliding into each other, and study to be a doctor, even though he would end up qualifying at the ripe old age of 50. He leaves New York for the University of Chicago to enrol. Enroute, his mental state starts to unravel, and he takes on the role of “Milton Appel, pornographer and men’s club owner,” telling all and sundry of how he makes his living as such. This gives him the thrill of revenge, the spur of invention, and an outlet for his seething anger and pain. His antics on planes and limos during this meltdown is hilarious, bawdy and downright brilliant— Portnoy Redux.Some brilliant lines come out during this headlong flight to the bottom:“The only patient being treated by the writer is himself.”“Without fanaticism, nothing great in fiction could ever be achieved”“I am changing American f***king forever! I am setting this country free!”“Stand alone. Like Swift and Dostoevsky and Joyce and Flaubert. Obstinate independence. Unshakable defiance. Perilous freedom. No, in thunder.”“While doubt is half a writer’s life. Two-thirds. Nine-tenths. Another day, another doubt. The only thing I never doubted was the doubt.”When the collapse finally comes (and Roth seems to make them happen in familiar territory like cemeteries, a-la- Sabbath’s Theatre, and Everyman) and he gets his chance to see the insides of a hospital and what doctors face day in, day out, Zuckerman realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side, that the journey from typewriter to stethoscope is indeed a long one, perhaps one never to be completed, or even attempted, although many successful authors like Cronin, Maugham and Conan Doyle made the journey successfully in the opposite direction.This is fresh, energetic, and brilliant writing.

Separated from his loved ones, he cherished the hope that the family would be re-united one day, and that hope sustained him. Upon his liberation, he discovered that they had all perished. Hope postponed is destructive, he concludes, and is glad he held on to his dreams for life on the outside until the war ended.Frankl’s three pillars of the branch of psychiatry he developed, later to be named logotherapy, play out in this book. They are also expanded upon in his masterpiece Man’s Search For Meaning. The three pillars are: 1)	Actions: meaningful acts that outlive us, whether that is in creating art, invention or in social acts of good.2)	Love – loving people and having people who love you.3)	Suffering – this provides meaning to our lives through lived experience and should be embraced, not avoided.He spends a lot of time on Suffering, something he endured a lot of in the camps. He recounts anecdotes of camp experiences that support his principles. Suffering is unique to each individual, some have more, some less, but always in the right doses to extract meaning from each individual’s life. Given his embrace of Suffering as a giver of meaning, he is a strong opponent of Suicide and Euthanasia – we each have to “die our own death.”Part of his psychology of the concentration camp also involves a reflection on the collective guilt that hounds survivors. He concedes that the best and most talented people died in the camps, and the survivors were just the lucky ones. The collective guilt rising from this incarceration spurred survivors to spread the word and educate those who weren’t affected or pretended that “they didn’t know.” He also sadly concedes that many survivors forgot this unwritten oath once life returned to normal.Frankl’s work is an antidote to those facing difficult or end-of-life situations....more",Notes are private!,0,11,2,not setnot set,"Aug 17, 2020not set","Aug 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48711165-yes-to-life

It is also an indictment on the unruly and untamed frontier when viewed through the prism of her uncompromising Presbyterian upbringing. Mattie Ross, a 14 year-old farm girl, strong-willed, intelligent, and brave is determined to avenge the murder of her father by bringing his killer to justice, by hook or by crook. She enlists the aid of a one-eyed US marshal, Rooster Cogburn, the meanest of the US marshals patrolling the area. A Texas Ranger, LeBeouf (pronounced Le Beef), also on the hunt for the killer for a higher reward, tags along, much to Mattie’s displeasure. What follows is a series of adventures until the killer and his buddies are brought to justice over in what was then called Indian Territory. I watched both movies made of this novel while reading the book and was surprised at how faithful they both were to Portis’ masterpiece, even down to the dialogue. Of course, despite Mattie’s strong narrative voice, the character who looms largest is Rooster Cogburn, right from his dramatic introduction in the courthouse scene where one wonders whether he is the witness or the accused. He is the epitome of the Wild West, someone even Mattie, after some initial skirmishing, comes to respect, even love, for his bravery, steadfastness, and aloneness. Despite her scorn for the desperados of that period, demonstrated by her condemnation of wild-west heroes like Frank James (of the Jesse James gang), she withholds her moral condemnation of Cogburn and even honors his memory. And Cogburn intrigues us with his rambling tales of the west and with his wayward life, as the trio of man-hunters venture deeper into the badlands in search of their quarry; he gets merrily drunk along the way, and tries to shoot bottles using only his good eye. His philosophy: “A man will not work for a woman, not unless he has clabber for brains.” Yet, he works for Mattie.I found Mattie a bit hard to digest. At her tender age, she negotiates stronger than grown businessmen in a man’s world. She is uncompromising against ridiculous odds; she recounts shootings, stabbings, and public hangings frankly and flatly, and she is not a warm person. Her descriptions are sparse: one character is introduced as “a tall, long-backed man with a doorknob head and a mouthful of prominent teeth.” Her singlemindedness towards seeking revenge for her father’s death betrays her Christian upbringing. Perhaps, she is a precursor of the extreme Christian Right. And yet, her flawed and self-righteous character provides for an interesting narrative twist to an otherwise routine cops and robbers wild-west show. She has been called a version of the Huckleberry Finn character, although I thought Huck had a lot more soul and a sense of humour.As for LeBeouf and the bad guys, they come across as cardboard cut-outs, props against which Mattie and Rooster play out their destiny. I read this book as it has been proclaimed a masterpiece of the west. I think its value lies not so much in the cops and robbers plot, which has its own twists and turns, but in the juxtaposition of the moral code of its Presbyterian narrator upon the lawless swamp that was the American West, and the resulting conflict that surfaces from this mismatched union....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 08, 2020","Aug 08, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43612456-true-grit

When this energy is integrated, a city is “born.” But the birth of a city also comes with much destruction and consumption. When the avatar fails, the city dies, like Pompeii and Atlantis. Under this definition of a “born” city, the only ones that qualify are Sao Paulo, Hong Kong and handful of others around the planet. New York is the next in line, about to be born, but it has a problem: it has five boroughs under one metropolitan area, and they don’t all get along with each other. The borough avatars must be consumed by the principal avatar representing the entire City of New York for the “birthing” to take place. If the avatars fail, the Enemy will institute its own master city over New York, and what exists will be obliterated.This also is a story of race, for the six avatars are quite diverse: black, brown, South Asian, Hispanic and white; male and female. Whereas the Enemy, embodied by the Woman in White, is white only. The only white avatar on the side of the heroes is also sucked into the enemy camp, polarizing the racial divide. That Aislyn, the white avatar from the borough of Staten Island, has a racially biased father who is a cop, accentuates this divide. The Enemy also uses money as a weapon. “They buy out your principles with money,” says Bronca, the avatar from the Bronx, who turns down a $23 million donation from the Enemy, as the offer is tied to replacing high quality black artists’ paintings in her Arts Centre with inferior white artists’ work.The Enemy starts to destabilize the city by growing tendrils on people, creating adapters into the Enemy’s universe, collapsing bridges, even confiscating the property of the avatars’ human personas via legal processes activated through a shadow company. The avatars fight back by channeling the superhuman force of their individual borough’s myriad of citizens, and this is where the whole plot sags, for a fully engaged and charged avatar is never in danger of being overcome by the Enemy. Sometimes, the breathing of a cigarette or the flashing of a credit card is sufficient to drive the Enemy back. Soon, the avatars are joined by their elder brethren, Sao Paulo and Hong Kong, who have come across to provide moral support, and we discover that this battle for the control of cities is going on around the world. The race is on to unite the motley band of quarrelling borough avatars with their principal who is holed up in a disused railway station before the enemy can get to him and prevent the birthing of the city.Even thought the language is fresh and embodies a lot of New York-speak, the pace is slow. We take almost half the book to get to know all six avatars and their backgrounds. They each have two worldviews at any given time: a human view and a city view, and this takes a lot of getting used to and a lot of description on the part of the author. That they don’t all agree with each other probably reflects on the politics between the boroughs at this time. After the predictable grand battle between the avatars and the Enemy ends, the lines of the city are re-drawn on compatibility grounds and it is interesting to note what that new composition looks like (I will not elaborate here in case that amounts to a spoiler). Cities are cauldrons of creativity, commerce and energy. And to see them placed as the bounty that good and evil strive to acquire is a novel concept. And yet the challenge for the novelist, and the story teller—for this is a story as much as an intellectual exercise—is to make it interesting and engaging as much as educating and enlightening.

Reading about Roth’s troubled marriage to Claire Bloom that ended at the time, it is also hard to ignore that it was a revenge novel, for many of the incidents chronicled within bear direct resemblance to those in his crumbling relationship with the British actress.In the novel, Nathan Zuckerman (Roth’s alter-ego) is being told the story of Ira Ringold, a Communist and a radio actor who married the fading Hollywood and Broadway star, Eve Frame, who had wound her way down to radio as she aged and lost star quality. The narrator is 90-year old Murray Ringold, Ira’s older brother and Nathan’s former English teacher, who is retelling the story forty years later. In the 1950’s when the story takes place, Eve has a live-in, grown up daughter, Sylphid, a harpist, who doesn’t get along with Ira, just as Bloom’s opera-singer daughter did not get along with Roth. The daughter is the irritant that brings down the marriage. After three years of bliss, several things go wrong in the Ringold marriage: Eve at 41 wants an abortion of the child Ira desperately wants her to have. Eve is opposed to the birth because Sylphid doesn’t want sibling competition. Ira rents an apartment nearby for Sylphid to move out to, but the girl throws a tantrum instead and pummels her mother; Ira has an affair with Sylphid’s friend Pamela; Pamela betrays him to Eve, saying he tried to seduce her; Eve writes a tell-all letter to the Communist Party. The clincher, in typical Roth’s libidinous humour, is when Ira's masseur gets drunk and challenges Eve to a contest to see who sucks off Ira the best.Ira has a hair trigger temper that first got him into trouble as a teenager, sending him into a drifter’s existence of working odd jobs among the downtrodden, especially in the mines of Zinctown, hence his awakening to Communism. After being discharged from the army following WWII, he becomes a party member and plays Abraham Lincoln on radio, using his popularity to promote his politics. Meeting Eve gives him a taste of bourgeoise life, which he likes, and this is his undoing. When he is unmasked as a Communist, all his pals in Zinctown abandon him; O’Day, Ira’s Communist mentor, condemns him with, “He’s a fake and he’s a dope and he’s a traitor. Betrayed his revolutionary comrades and betrayed the working class. Sold out. Bought off. Totally the creature of the bourgeoisie. Seduced by fame and money and wealth and power. And pussy, fancy Hollywood pussy.”And why was he betrayed? Because Eve writes a tell-all book titled I Married a Communist about her crumbling marriage, insinuating that Ira married her to gain access to the American movie industry and convert it to Communism. What follows is a very public spat that wrecks both their lives emotionally and professionally. Art imitates life here.This is a very told story, for Murray is the neurotic narrator for the most part. I’m not a fan of this form and yet Roth is able to conjure up nuance, anger, freneticism, drama and other emotional states into the narration. I found Murray's sharpness of memory and wit at age 90 a bit hard to swallow. However, Murray provides Roth with a platform from which to reclaim his political views – on McCarthy, Nixon and others. Mixed in with the Commie bashing is Roth’s other pet whipping boy: upper class Jews who hate their lower class brethren, and this is embodied in Eve. “It was a sickness,” Murray says, “that aversion she had for the Jew who was insufficiently disguised. She could go along parallel to life for a long time. Not in life—parallel to life. She could be quite convincing in that ultracivilized, ladylike role she’d chosen. The soft voice. The precise location.”This book fills a void about a dark period which America prefers not to talk about, when lives were destroyed by snitches and grudges were held, and when politics drove a sharp distinction between “us and them.” As Murray says, “In human society, thinking’s the greatest transgression of all. Cri-ti-cal think-ing—there is the ultimate subversion.” This period seems to be playing back again in the partisanized landscape that is America today. However, I felt the novel’s power was undermined by Roth choosing to throw in his own spousal vendetta in with that of the McCarthyists going after the Commies. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2020","Jul 23, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12341534-i-married-a-communist

This is the qThe battle of good and evil within, or without?Does evil live outside and good live inside our souls or do they both co-exist within us? This is the question Hesse puts on the table with this novel he wrote during WWI.The classic bildungsroman, the short novel tells the story of Emil Sinclair who is cocooned in the religious upbringing of his loving family, who sees the outside world as full of corruption, but who is drawn to it nevertheless while mourning the inevitable loss of his safety net at home. He starts to slide into corruption when he swears upon a lie to a bully named Franz Kromer who then proceeds to blackmail Sinclair. Enter the mysterious mind-reader and influencer, Demian, another schoolmate, androgynous in look, who sizes up the situation and releases Sinclair from his burden. Demian is not the classic Christ-like figure of Hesse’s other novels, even though there are inferences to that connection; he is more like the deity Abraxas who combines the godlike with the devilish. Demian’s philosophy extends to killing those who are of no use in this world; he believes that Cain was a strong man and not a murderer, and prefers the unrepentant thief in Golgotha to the one who confessed and accepted Christ on the other side of the cross. Demian concludes, that like himself, Sinclair bears the Mark of Cain, attributed to those who do not follow the herd. Sinclair sinks into a life of drinking and shirking his student duties but is brought back to the virtuous life when he sees a woman at a distance whom he names Beatrice. He tries to paint her image, and the portrait that emerges is that of Demian. He paints another portrait of a bird bursting out of an egg which he gifts to his friend. Demian describes it as, “The bird is fighting its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Whoever wishes to be born must destroy a world. The bird is flying to God. The god is named Abraxas.” Demian believes that Europe, in industrializing, had achieved the world but lost its soul. Europe is heading for war, and towards its destiny.Other guides enter during Sinclair’s oscillation between good and evil: the musician Pistorius who reinforces that good and evil reside in us: “All the gods and devils that ever existed, whether among the Greeks, Chinese, or Zulus, are all inside us.”; Knauer the student who hangs on to Sinclair and believes he is a psychic imbued with supernatural powers. The most influential guide is Lady Eve, Demian’s mother, a beautiful woman whom Sinclair falls passionately and hopelessly in love with. She is not averse to his affections and throws him the challenge: “Sinclair, your love is being attracted by me. Whenever it begins to attract me, I shall come. I don’t want to make a gift of myself, I want to be won.” I was anticipating a Mrs. Robinson-like scene from the movie The Graduate, but had to remind myself I was reading Hesse where the spiritual overrules the sensual.That the war was the catalyst for this novel is obvious, as Demian and Sinclair both enlist when hostilities erupt. Sinclair sees his prescient image of the future of the world depicted in his bird painting, and Demian’s philosophy of the duality of good and evil within us come true when he describes his fellow soldiers in battle: “Those primal feelings, even the wildest of them, weren’t directed against the enemy; their bloody results were merely an outward materialization of people’s inner life, the split within their souls, which desired to rage and kill, destroy and die, so that they could be reborn. A gigantic bird was fighting its way out of the egg, and the egg was the world, and the world had to fall to pieces.”In keeping with Hesse’s style, this is a very “told” story, and an encounter between any two characters is an opportunity to launch into a philosophical and intellectual discussion on the human condition. Therefore, this is a book that leaves you pondering the many intellectual arguments put forth, long after it is finished, and most importantly that seminal question: “Do good and evil reside within us?”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 14, 2020","Jul 14, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43585761-demian

Some are broken out into the minutia of formulae that could be delivered to a class on short story writing, while others cover books and writers that appear to be the author’s favourites, among them Alice Munro, Jane Austen and Albert Camus.Glover opens with Munro and two stories in her book The Lives of Girls and Women. Munro’s style is focussed on chronological threads, repetitions, parallels, constraints and reflectors more than on story and closure. Austen on the other hand, given the tumultuous time she lived in (American Revolution, Industrial Revolution, French Revolution etc.) contrasted with the pastoral and secluded life she led as the unmarried daughter of a not-so-well-to-do clergyman, advocated restraint in her characters. Fanny the heroine in Mansfield Park, the book that Glover dissects, is a heroine by default due to her self-restraint and non-action. Camus (the novel in question being L’Etranger) strays into Hemingway territory with his ellipsis style of showing character actions but not thoughts, often mistaken for Existentialism but vehemently denied by the French-Algerian author.The extensive essay on the short story resembled a college lecture to me, where three short stories of varying length and voice are broken out into their minutia. The old anchor of “plot” around which stories were traditionally built seems to be giving way to other emphases like image patterning, word repetition, thematic passages, backfill and conflict formulae. I wondered whether this drift was due to the increasing influence of poetry on fiction, or whether readers were getting tired of “story” within “short story.” Other essays also get into the craft of fiction, like the ones on time control in narrative prose and on building sentences, and they too resemble classroom lectures. In the very short essay titled “The Literature of Extinction,” experimental literature is discussed; again the old must-haves of plot, setting and theme are discarded in favour of repeated events and images, patterns, sound, dream, and the accidental. The final essay titled “Consciousness and Masturbation” in which Glover examines the short novel Cosmos by Witold Gombrowicz was the most interesting to me. It reminded me of Kafka’s work. Here, there is a chaos of events, with no apparent meaning, taking place, with the protagonist trying to create order. Gombrowicz’s novel brings into focus all the points hitherto raised by Glover in this collection of essays: imagery, repetition, and cross references that usurp a nonsensical and parodic plot. Masturbation is presented as a way to create a private world from the chaotic one outside one’s control. Some of the other imagery borders on the obscene. Although dubbed a quasi-detective novel, Cosmos ends up a horror story.Reading this book of essays I realized that if I were to be conscious of all the elements of fiction as outlined here while creating a short story or novel, I might be so self-conscious and paralyzed that I might not write a single word. It is therefore better for the writer to create and the academic to analyze. The creator is free to take the analysis, or reject it. However, keeping these learnings in mind during revision and sculpting of a first draft can help to deepen and enrich it. It is a tribute to an author like Glover who is able to balance both roles of creator and academic in his presentation of this work.With the rapid evolution of fiction, one wonders whether it is easy to become dated quickly. However, Glover provides one nugget of hope: “What is old and discarded becomes fashionable again.” Testament to Austen’s renaissance 200 years after her passing!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2020","Jul 07, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52259387-the-erotics-of-restraint

The Age of the Feuilleton that we lived in has imploded, and scholarship has become a monastic calling. The unknown country in which this story takes place has decided to fund and house its academics in a province called Castalia. Castalians are free to pursue any branch of study for as long as they desire as perennial students. Castalia, in turn, offers the broader country its teachers. The crowning event in Castalia is the Glass Bead Game, one based on music and symbol, one that can be evolved indefinitely by writing new components into it, all of which are archived and integrated into the overall Game, a replacement to the arts that had fallen out of favour. The Game is conducted for a period of ten days annually, with trained gamers participating, a sort of Olympic Games of the Mind and Soul. The custodian of the Game is the Magister Ludi. Joseph Knecht, an orphan of high mental, musical and spiritual abilities, is groomed to be a future Magister Ludi. He readily puts himself to the task by attending the Elite Schools designated for Castalians, skilling himself in the Game, and undertaking assignments abroad to teach the Game to amateurs. When he is elected into the Order of the Game, he laments the loss of freedom to study at will, for he is now burdened with the duties and responsibilities of office, some political, some questionable. He nevertheless plays the loyal soldier and ascends the pinnacle to become the youngest Magister Ludi while still in his forties. He executes his role with finesse, but after 10 years in the job, doubts start to plague him. His childhood friend and opposite number, Plinio Designario, also educated in Castalia but now married and running a business in the outside world, reminds him that all is not well in his cloister—Castalia is living on the largess of the country, and the Game, a pure Castalian creation, will be the first to go if funding and support is cut. Like Siddhartha, in Hesse’s novel by that name, Knecht is faced with the dilemma of staying put or renouncing his exalted position as Magister to enter the outside world which is treacherous beyond what he had ever learned within his safe cloister walls.Accompanying the story of Knecht is a section on the poetry he wrote as a student. They start with promise but end with a premonition of an end coming to the Game – perhaps a reflection on Knecht’s state of mind.The most interesting section to me was the three short stories at the end of the book, a collection written by Knecht as an academic exercise when he was a student and which is titled “Three Lives.” The first story has him living as a Rainmaker in a pre-historic matriarchal tribe. In the second story he (or his protagonist) is a Confessor around the time of the early Christians. In the final story, he is an Indian prince, living at the time of Siddhartha. In these three dramatically told stories, Hesse brings out the themes that pre-occupied him throughout his work: the Christ-like sacrifice of one's life for the rest of mankind, the protagonist—antagonist conflict, the life of the hermit-prophet, integration and unity, the master—student relationship, and the lesson that life is an illusion.The only negative I found in this novel was that Hesse chose to tell Knecht’s life as a biography. So, the biographer/historian (Hesse) goes into a very analytical, data-rich, recounting of most of what is happening, telling, telling, telling for most of the time, which in the 1940’s may have been acceptable, but which in our times of shrunken attention spans is a tough slog.And yet, if you take the trouble to ponder the issues Hesse puts on the table, this book will keep you thinking long after the last page is turned....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jun 28, 2020","Jun 28, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17207180-the-glass-bead-game

He has starred in a six-year TV series and is a recognizable face. Now, he is auditioning with Spanish director Miguel Garcia, a Scorsese-like legend every actor wants to associate with because stardom thereafter is guaranteed. Kristin, a troubled American divorcee, who met Henry outside a washroom in an airport and did a heart and brain flip, is his stalker.But after this nice set-up, the novel takes off in a different direction. We follow Henry as he lives a solitary, self-absorbed life between acting gigs, amusing himself with one-night stands, drinks with acting peers, porn and masturbation when female company dries up. We follow him to Qatar to attend a film festival, where he is contracted to be the cultural entertainment. We get to sample the interiors of hotels and private tours of the Gulf state. Henry picks up a model, Virginia, who appears to be a hired along with a coterie of “girls” to spice up the party by the Arab sponsors. Henry and his actor cohort do not look kindly upon their Arab hosts, who have dry (alcohol-free) public events and film screenings, and private “wet parties” that include heroin. I am not sure this book will be welcome in the Arab Gulf States for its candid “lifting of the kantura,” as it were, and for the snarky comments from Henry & Co. unless the likes of Al Jazira have indeed raised the Qataris to look frankly upon themselves. We get a parallel tour when Kristin comes to the UK to pursue Henry: her transatlantic flight, the hotel in London, the museum visits – it was as if the author, for lack of content, had pulled out his travel diary of a similar trip taken to these destinations and was laying it on thick. The marked absence of conflict until the last few pages was as apparent as Henry’s boredom with his non-life.Kristin is not your Glen Close from Fatal Attraction. She is rather grounded and yet flirts with the hair-brained notion that she and Henry are soul mates. To him, she is just another one night stand, picked up at an inconvenient time when his libido overruled his judgment. The fallout from this crossing of stars, or star-crossed lovers is the outcome of the book. One thing the author does well is to reduce film stars to a very human dimension – they reek of sweat, battle with indecision, worry about their self-image, starve to stay trim, shoot up when the pressure gets too much, hunt for pussy like animals in heat, and are not very deep thinkers. And their egos have no bounds. Had Kristin realized that of Henry when she first met him, she could have saved the money from her transatlantic trip and perhaps gone to the Caribbean, and picked up a more satisfying sexual partner with no strings attached....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 18, 2020","Jun 18, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/39731657-dream-sequence

But there is a caveat: the superior white race cannot be sent to jail for committing a crime against the lower races, white men are allowed to sexualize coloured and black girls as long as their wives don’t hear about it, but blacks and coloureds will get skinned alive for even stepping off the kaffir path into white territory. So how does an investigator with racial ambiguity and his black assistant conduct a comprehensive investigation that requires crossing all racial lines to get to the truth? Add to that the obstructionist Security Branch (white cops who act like the German SS) who have their own agenda for white supremacy and wish to interpret every crime to further that goal. A rather narrow field to play in as a detective. It’s easy to see that justice does not get done, but that each person gets only what they deserve and what is their right based on their race.Yet, recently divorced Detective Sergeant Emmanuel Cooper, who is dubbed an Englishman, perseveres to solve the murder of Police Captain Pretorius, an Afrikaner as blue-blooded as they come but who has a weakness for coloured women. Pretorius, the police chief of a small town, Jacob’s Rest, has five hot-blooded sons who run roughshod over everyone in town, while their mother believes that she belongs to God’s chosen people: the White Race of Africa. During the course of the investigation, Cooper has to suppress the urgings of his loins towards those he has power over, dodge the Pretorius boys and the Security Branch, dodge his shaky past that could see him disqualified from the case, and manage his ambitious boss in Johannesburg who cares only about his own promotional prospects.What is also revealing is the consequence of crossing racial lines in procreation. Many illicit white-on-black or white-on-coloured unions begat offspring who were either closer to white or closer to black. The off-white ones, if they could conceal the fact, opted for the white designation thus being privy to many professional and property entitlements while the off-black siblings were cast into the margins. Entire families kept these dark secrets for many years with disastrous consequences for both the off-whites and the off-blacks.I found the writing to be rather amateurish, and the choice of writing Cooper, the narrator, in third person, as probably a poor choice, for often we hear this outside voice conjecturing, concluding, arranging facts, telling us what is happening or going to happen. Why did the author not choose a first-person narrator instead, one who would have legitimized all the “telling”?Of course, as is to be expected in this society, justice is not fully served and those looking for all loose ends in this crime to be tied up will not find it, not in this society, not even in the fragmented one that has since emerged in South Africa post-Apartheid. But the novel makes for an interesting social commentary on those who try to create exclusionary societies and reap the foul results of what they sow. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,not setnot set,"Jun 07, 2020not set","Jun 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2991868-a-beautiful-place-to-die

And in Adolf Hitler we have the perfect product of incest, a first degree incestuary: Adolph’s father was also the father of Adolph’s mother, as the novel makes claim.This book was supposed to be the first of a trilogy, but Norman Mailer died soon after its publication. So we are left with a story, that sticks closely to the documented history of Adolph as a child growing up to the age of about 15. The novel covers mostly the stories of the future Fuhrer’s father, Alois, and mother, Klara, and their lives. The twist that Mailer introduces is the narrator, who is a devil named Dieter, and who is sent by Satan (the Maestro, in this book) to shepherd Adolph through his formative years, for young Adi has the potential for much destruction in the world.Dieter is the hardest to digest, for he is quite a pompous narrator who tries to be funny but comes across as dry. He wades into lots of detail of quotidian family life of the Hitlers that do not have much dramatic content, into vast tracts on bee-keeping—which Alois upon retirement from his Customs job takes up with vigour—and then leaves the Hitlers from pages 214-261 to take a detour into Czarist Russia to stir things up during the coronation of Nicholas II. These historical events, including the Oscar Wilde sodomy case in Britain and the assassination of Elizabeth (Sisi) of Hungary, that surrounded Hitler are important, no doubt, as formative inputs into the creating of a megalomaniac, but I think they are a bit excessive. All I could take from these digressions were that (a) the lives of bees are analogous to the Nazis: nationalistic, obedient to a single ruler, disciplined, hard-working, and sacrificing everything to the colony,(b) sodomy was a vital component in the lives of Adolph and his older brother Alois Jr. who fall under the pedophilic spell of a master bee-keeper living in the forest, Der Alte. I skipped the Nicholas II episode for Dieter was getting on my nerves at that point.Adolph comes across as a smelly kid (according to Dieter, smell was God’s mark on evil people, which the Devil countered with the inventions of soap, bath oils and deodorant), quite average in his studies, a bed-wetter, and sexually repressed. He suffers from the guilt of believing that he killed his younger brother Edmond by kissing him and giving him measles. Adolph was devoted to his mother, Klara, a religious woman weighted down by the childhood deaths of four of her six children by Alois. She believes it was God’s punishment to her for the carnal acts she performed with Alois – no wonder young Adolph, who heard the sounds from his parents bedroom, was so sexually conflicted.Alois is the most interesting character. Of robust girth and vile temper, he bedded multiple women, sometimes three in a day. He took them all: kitchen maids, farm girls, barmaids, and even his three older step-sisters, one of whom was Klara’s mother. His parentage was doubtful (some said he had a Jewish connection, but that was soon discarded by the Nazi propaganda machine), he married three times and produced a total of eight children, and loved to drink and hob nob with the gentry. And he beat his kids relentlessly, so much that Alois Jr. ran away and was never seen again.I wondered why Mailer chose to write this book that has been chronicled elsewhere. The fictitious element of the devil’s agent shepherding young Adolph through his formative years, exposing him to incidents that would make him the man he became, is interesting, but is it enough? I was left, strangely, wanting more novelistic value.

If not for trA great history lesson on the evolution of our world, anchored by an activity that humans are naturally predisposed to engage in: trade. If not for trade, the world wouldn’t be where it is today, is the lesson from this book. Even though I have read about several epochs of history at different times in other books, this book brings them all together in chronological order and compellingly integrates the evolution of these separate epochs.Beginning with the Sumerians in 4000 B.C (dubbed World Trade Organization 1.0). and ending in Seattle in 1999 (where the WTO conference was riddled with tear gas and rubber bullets), the book highlights the vital commodities that gave rise to trade; it covers the technology and methods of transportation used to deliver such items of trade, the forms of money that consequently evolved, the politics that helped or hindered, and threats like war, pestilence and conquest that mutated prevailing trade patterns. Copper gave way to bronze, then to silk, then to spices, then to sugar (and its derivative rum), then to coffee, then to slavery, then to tea, then to opium, then to corn – there was always one prime commodity that acted as the new gold and drove the engine of trade. Sumeria and the Indus Valley were the early trading centres. The Silk Road (and Belt) was the next loop that connected China to Rome via land and sea, where silk was traded until about the 6th century. With the coming of Islam, The Fertile Crescent, encircling the Middle East and Indian Ocean was the next large centre that lasted for nearly 800 years, before Vasco de Gama of Portugal circled the Cape of Good Hope and brought the Europeans back into the game that had by then switched to the hot commodity of spices. Privately funded expeditions gave way to joint-stock corporations for the next 400 years, notably the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and the British East India Company (EIC) and their western counterparts that scoured the New World for deals. The New World, discovered by Columbus, also proved to be an easier and more attractive venture for investors as the journey was infinitely shorter than the long trek to the East Indies. A chapter on the diseases that accompanied trade and drastically altered progress is of interest given these pandemic times we live in. The Black Death hit twice: once between 560 – 800 AD, plunging Europe into the Dark Ages; the second time in the 13th century, putting paid to the Mongol expansion westwards. The battle of Kaffa, a city in the Crimea in modern-day Ukraine (or Russia, based on who you believe has claim to the territory today) tells of how the Mongol invaders who had besieged the city used catapults to lob the dead and infected over the city walls to overcome those inside; which is also attributed to why the plague spread further into Europe.Around the mid-nineteenth century, we take a detour into economics, with theories of free trade vs. protectionism taking root. Britain and America veered between these two extremes based on the ups and downs of their domestic fortunes; the former with its protectionist corn laws that ran for over 50 years until 1846, when Britain caved and adopted free trade; the latter with its protectionist policies that lasted from Herbert Hoover until the end of WWII, and which now seem to be resuscitated under Trump. The two industries that seem to consistently convince governments to stay protectionist have been textiles and farming.There is a lot in the book to cover, too much for a short  like this. I haven’t even covered the very entertaining voyages of Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta, Columbus and Magellen, nor the fierce battles between the Portuguese and the Dutch for hegemony in Asia, nor the hotspot that everyone fought over: The Spice Islands, also known as the Moluccas, located in present day Indonesia.There also needs to be a mention about the technologies like cartography and refrigeration that enabled trade, and the methods of transportation that ranged from sail boats to land caravans, to steam power, to railways and highways. As distribution costs declined, the trading universe enlarged, and competition was enabled, thus levelling prices and making traders hunt for the next hot commodity. And of course, we must not forget human greed that pushed traders into uncharted territory, often to fail but to always return to the mast, because in pioneering times even one out of ten shipments getting through enabled huge profits for its investors.I recommend this book for anyone trying to understand why we face today’s economic dilemmas.

The subtitle: A History, A Financial Adventure, and a Warning, might be a more appropriate title.As a history, Christopher Ondaatje gives us the evolution of paper (from tablet and papyrus to it’s current form), the history of money (from coin to complex paper contracts that tend to fizzle out when financial bubbles burst), the evolution of trade and commerce (from the East India companies of European colonizers to convoluted national and international corporate structures that magically create wealth), the evolution of economic theory by such heavyweights as Ricardo, Smith and Keynes, and the evolution of global capitalism with the founding of such organizations as the World Bank and the IMF.As an adventure, he intersperses the narrative with details of his own charmed career: of being wrenched out of high school in England due to a family bankruptcy in distant Ceylon, of landing penniless in Canada in the early 1950’s and going on to build a stellar career in finance that made him rich beyond his wildest dreams, helped restore the family fortune, and allowed him to pursue writing and exploring the world. I found these sections to be the most interesting and wished he had carved them out into a separate autobiography, as an inspiration and guide book for us immigrants from Ceylon (Sri Lanka, by the time I left) who followed in his wake, albeit a generation and half later. His heroes were Canadian tycoons such as Sir Herbert Holt, Lord Strathcona, Sir William Van Horne and E.P. Taylor. He laments that he came to Canada too late to partake in the opening up of the country that these pioneers enjoyed. And yet Canada’s economy trebled between 1945 and 1957, clocking an annual growth rate of nearly 11%—contrast that to the 6% contraction we are facing today as a result of the pandemic. It is also ironic that Ondaatje’s first venture to launch his meteoric rise was a publishing company, Pagurian Press. I bet publishers today, including myself who owns a small press, are mining furiously in his tapped-out vein for a few overlooked nuggets. And we salute his impeccable timing to get in and out of ventures that rose and fell with the business cycle.As a warning, Ondaatje goes onto paint a rather gloomy picture of the 21st century. This book was published in 2006, before the world’s financial collapse of 2008 and before Covid-19 in 2020, but the author sees the writing on the wall. He projects our time as the final Age of Decadence in an epoch that started with the Industrial Revolution back in 1760. Epochs last 250 years on average and we are in the end days of this one, according to him. He is clear on the causes: too much easy credit, an unwarranted belief that the stock market will always perform, and that house prices rise over time. Irrational Exuberance, is the label. He quotes the warning from Sir John Glub, author of The Fate of Empires, a warning Ondaatje made his personal motto when he went onto create his fortune : “Material Success is the result of courage, endurance and hard work.” I found all the information contained in this little book, which is elegantly designed on thick glossy paper, with illustrations and pictures, to be very useful. But I wondered whether it suffered by Sir Christopher wandering all over the map on his intellectual charger, making it a hard product to peg from a book seller’s viewpoint.

Love and Lust are pitted against each other with disastrous consequences for those who make the wrong choice.The older Sanin is reflecting on his life from thirty years ago, when in 1840, as a 22 year old, he arrived in Frankfurt on his way home to Russia after completing his studies. The younger Sanin visits the confectionary shop of an Italian émigré family, the Rosellis, and his life immediately spins out of control. He is instantly enchanted by the beautiful Gemma Roselli who is betrothed to a rich clothing store manager, Karl Kluber. When Gemma’s younger brother, Emil Roselli, has a fainting fit, Sanin resuscitates the boy. As his reward, Sanin is invited into the inner sanctum of the family and meets the crafty Widow Roselli, the matriarch who is intent on the store surviving by making a rich match for her only daughter. A duel to defend Gemma’s honour follows in which Karl comes off badly while Sanin is elevated to saviour. Gemma breaks off her engagement to Karl and veers towards Sanin while Mamma Roselli expresses her dissatisfaction unless she can extract similar economic concessions from our hapless hero that had been assured under Karl Kluber.Love trumps economics and Sanin is prepared to journey to Russia, sell up his modest land holdings, and return to Frankfurt to marry Gemma and invest in the Roselli confectionary shop. Then contrivance enters, and this is the one sore point of the book, for the arrival of the Russian Polozov and his temptress wife Maria Nikolievna in Germany are just too opportune. Polozov is the quintessential cuckold husband who serves as his wife’s errand boy and is trapped by her wealth. Looking to save himself a trip back to Russia, Sanin offers Polozov the opportunity to buy his land back home. Polozov defers to his wife who controls the purse strings, but she has much deeper designs than just a plot of land. Sanin descends into a quicksand of desire as Maria seduces him and leads him a like a moth to the flame: a theatre performance, a horse ride up a mountain and into the forest during a pelting rainstorm. When Sanin emerges from this maelstrom, he is her sexual slave. Gemma is betrayed, and he can never return to her with honour. But all those who make choices of the flesh also pay the price of flesh. Sanin meets the fate of many a man who has been sucked in and spat out by this femme fatale. Although he goes onto attain economic security in later years, his personal life is left barren.When we return to the older Sanin, he has tracked down his former true love, Gemma, who is now married to a wealthy merchant in New York and is the mother of five children. His letter to her is met with compassion and understanding, and buoyed by this response, he starts to sell his property again to head off to the New World this time and do what he failed to do 30 years ago. But one wonders whether matters not “taken at the flood” can ever lead to success? Is this effort doomed to fail even more drastically given that Gemma is now a happily married woman with a lovely family? Is this her turn now to roll the dice and sacrifice everything for an old passion? Is this a last foolish gasp of an old man? Turgenev mercifully leaves us to figure out this outcome. As there are Russian, German and Italian characters, all three languages pepper the narrative in this English translation. Although the pace is fast and the machinations of plot weave in an out rapidly, there are also moments of great description. A German meal is described thus: “Watery soup with knobby dumplings and pieces of cinnamon, boiled beef dry as cork, with white fat attached, slimy potatoes, soft beetroot and mashed horseradish, a bluish eel with French capers and vinegar, a roast joint with jam, and the inevitable ‘Mehlspeise,’ something of the nature of a pudding with sourish red sauce; but to make up, the beer and wine first-rate!” Social conditions in Europe among the middle classes are well portrayed, as are the terms of the famous duel, even though it was considered to have been outlawed in Europe by the 17th century.Sanin is left contemplating the vulgar falsity of all things human, but I was more struck with the fact that even in the most romantic of love relationships, economics and politics play a significant role....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 28, 2020","Apr 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1054622.The_Torrents_of_Spring

This time, after a five-year gI picked this book up in the sole bookstore in Varadero, Cuba, a shop I visit every time I go down to that resort town. This time, after a five-year gap, the books looked just like they had been on my last visit, no new titles, more curling and dog-earring of the tired wares on offer, and most covers that featured either Che Guevara or Fidel Castro or both. Signs of the regurgitated US embargo were clear. There were more of the 1950’s clunkers on the road, forced back into service, less food in restaurants, but the grit to survive as embodied in the father of their republic was never more alive. Oh, and the bookstore was now accepting credit cards, so there was one sign of progress, at least.Fidel & Religion is a series of interviews between Castro and a Dominican priest, Frei Betto, who is wedded to Liberation Theology. After a lengthy prelude describing how the priest gained access to the secretive Fidel (the Commandant must take a liking to you first), we get down to the conversations that ran late into the night over several days in May 1985. The date is significant, for this was during the height of Fidel’s political strength, when he was able to take pot-shots at the capitalist west, while still being wedded and supported by his ally, the USSR, before that empire ended in glasnost and perestroika. Fidel talks about his humble beginnings: a bright athletic child of a Spanish father and an illiterate but extremely religious Cuban mother. His father fought on the Spanish side during the Cuban war of liberation but returned to Cuba to live and become a wealthy landowner. Fidel’s schooling was in Catholic institutions: a multi-racial primary school run by the La Salle Brothers, followed by whites-only Jesuit schools in Santiago de Cuba and Havana. He despised ritualistic practices like mass and prayers; he cultivated the ability to think, reason, feel and acquire conviction—the essentials for political consciousness. He elaborates at length, and quite candidly, even admitting to mistakes made, on his evolution as a revolutionary. Although Cuba had been liberated from Spain with the help of the US in 1896, the Americans had acquired all the land and wealth from the locals. Batista’s regime was ultra-corrupt. Castro’s abortive attack on the Moncada Garrison in 1952 is elaborated on in detail, but the final battle in 1959 that saw the overthrow of Batista is skimmed over, as is the time Fidel spent in prison and the period he spent re-arming in Mexico. However, he spends some time talking about the Bay of Pigs invasion that Cuba repulsed. While Frei Betto seems more concerned with questions concerning Fidel’s family’s embrace of religious philosophy, practices and iconography, the Commandant is more interested in boasting about the accomplishments of the Revolution. He admits that Catholics were not allowed into the Communist party in the early days of the Revolution because they had always been counter-revolutionary and supporters of the USA, and he couldn’t risk schisms in his party. He openly lays bare the misinformation campaigns by the CIA, the attempts to assassinate him, and the embargo aimed at crippling Cuba. He claims there were 6000 doctors in Cuba in 1959, and when America allowed Cubans to enter the USA freely in order to thwart the Revolution, 3000 doctors emigrated. As of the time of the interview, Cuba had rebuilt to 20,500 doctors and were exporting them on mercy missions around the world. Fidel goes onto claim other victories: in education, in helping the poor and exploited, and in punishing Batista’s war criminals and expropriating their ill-gotten gains.He debunks being a dictator and says that the US President and the Pope have more unilateral power than he has. He has a word on Liberation Theology too: his prior concept of the Church was one of exploitation and conquest (citing well known villains like Pizarro and Cortes who went forth with sword in one hand and cross in the other). He posits that it is only when the Church follows the path of Christ, who sided with the poor, that Christians will be in harmony with the Revolution. Frei Betto hastens to re-assure Castro that Liberation Theology is just that, a revolution within the Church, shifting the focus towards the poor and questioning past elitist practices.There is much repetition in this book for the interviews are recorded verbatim. I was impressed by Fidel’s breath of knowledge of history and world events. Unlike the bloody dictator he has been portrayed as by western media, he is also a deep thinker that few of us give him credit for. And Frei Betto is to be commended for undertaking this project to give a counterpoint to the tsunami of vilification that has gone on in the western press against Fidel Castro. Castro even takes a punt at solving world poverty: forgive Third World debt and turn those crushing interest payments into funding development projects in the developing world. While some debt has been since forgiven, the Developed World instead chose Globalization to boost economies in the developing world and reduce costs at home, and that strategy has landed us in another muddle.Fidel reserves the last few pages of the book to pay tribute to his friend and fellow revolutionary, Che Guevara. Contrary to the popular rumour that Fidel and Che had ideological differences leading to their ultimate split, Castro refers to Che and fellow Cuban revolutionary Camilo in warm and glowing terms, honouring their courage, intellect and sacrifice.It is unfortunate that in order to survive the pressure from his bullying and powerful northern neighbour who was looking for any loophole to bring his regime down, Castro had to lock his people up in a vacuum for over 60 years. The vacuum is all that the overseas visitor sees today, leading him to exclaim, “Oh, see what communism had done for this country—impoverished it.” I wonder whether they would be still saying that after they read this book?...more",Notes are private!,1,9,1,not set,"Apr 17, 2020","Apr 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1123717.Fidel_Religion

Theirs is not a marriage of passion and commitment but one of fulfilling the procreational expectations of their generation while partaking selfishly of what the sexual revolution of the 60’s bestowed upon middle-class, entitled and bored America.The first seven years of marriage and the arrival of the three older children keep them engaged and interested in each other. Richard fantasizes over his wife’s earthiness as she starts to gain weight while also lusting over Joan’s close friends. Then comes the fourth (probably unplanned) child and the drifting apart of this married couple. Sex becomes boring. They take a trip to Rome to revitalize their romance, but conclude that he is Classic while she is Baroque.The crisis of a possible separation temporarily averted, Joan gets actively involved in the Civil Rights movement which Richard finds boring. One night, while drunk and driving home from a party, Richard wraps his car around a telephone pole. While Joan goes for help, Richard gives in to his lust and passionately goes at it with their separated friend Eleanor inside the damaged car. But he is not the only transgressor, for soon afterwards, Richard catches Joan and Eleanor’s husband Mack kissing in their kitchen. These transgressions amplify over time – while in bed, Joan even discloses to Richard all the lovers she has had on the side, and all the lovers she knows he has had on his side. They don’t only have lovers but red herrings to try and divert each other off the scent of infidelity. They still need each other though, for the relationship has moved from Behaviour to Being, and Joan needs Richard in her life although the sex between them is lousy. When the final separation comes after 19 years of marriage, and the news is broken to the children, the question on everyone's lips, expressed only by Richard Jr. is: “Why?” After Richard moves out, the separated couple meet regularly for dinner and discuss each other’s new lovers. And yet, there is something these lovers cannot replace, something that Richard and Joan had between them:He saw through her words to what she was saying – that these lovers, however we love them, are not us, are not sacred as reality is sacred. We are reality. We have made children. We gave each other our young bodies. We promised to grow old together.After the split comes the remorse, for one year afterwards they are miserable and regretful. The divorce ceremony, when it comes, despite much preparation and trepidation turns out to be a non-event, due to the new “ no fault"" rule.The final linked story sees Richard and Joan as expectant grandparents, now long married to their illicit lovers at the time of their split, Ruth and Andy respectively. They are meeting for daughter Judith’s confinement. This is no different than any set of couples of second marriages interacting in the close confines of a hospital amidst the great anticipation and nervousness of the first grandchild being born. Despite the abundance of life and procreation around him, Richard realizes that he cannot claim any credit for it. Updike delivers a superb closing line to illustrate this: “Nobody belongs to us, except in memory.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 07, 2020","Apr 07, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8531111-the-maples-stories

All he desires is that he be able to create without interference and with total artistic freedom. And when his creations are tampered with, he is prepared to destroy them, despite society viewing those acts as criminal. Although the supposed hero of this book, he gets away with a lot, including rape.Peter Keating is the archetypal collectivist, who uses others to ascend the pinnacle of the architectural world. Devoid of the talent to create at the level of Rourke, he resorts to manipulation and subterfuge to reach financial and reputational success, which Rand, with her objectivist philosophy, portrays as flimsy and insubstantial, and doomed to failure.Elsworth Toohey, is another collectivist. A journalist, architectural critic, and general busybody in society, he makes and breaks careers, whether that be in theatre, literature, journalism or architecture, through his s, endorsements and influential criticism. He is described as a “corrosive gas that eats lungs out.” Gail Wynand is the illiterate from Hell’s Kitchen who rises from the gutter to command a giant newspaper empire aligned with the mob and focussed on salacious stories that appeal to the collective. He has a habit of buying out honest artists and seeing them compromise their principles through the lure of money and the threat of sanction.Dominique Francon is the beautiful and mercurial woman who is a slave to the men she choses as lovers. She is frigid and bored, and only awakens to desire when she is raped. She alternatively weds Keating, Wynand and Rourke in that order, drives them mad with desire, and brings them to the brink of ruin. She is certainly a product of her time and would not find much identification or sympathy from the modern #MeToo woman.A host of secondary characters populate this giant tome, each falling on either side of the Egotist vs. Second Hander divide. The backdrop for their adventures is New York City in the 1920s and 30’s, when the rich are buying immortality by commissioning impressive architectural structures. It is the age of the dying skyscraper and the emerging housing project. Rand uses this canvas to project her own philosophy that Man is above God, that as much as we respect other people’s rights we are not responsible for them, that actions are decided by rationality, and that feelings are the outcome of actions and not the catalyst for action. In fact, most of these characters come across as entirely unfeeling people who live totally in their heads. Rand is also a romanticist, so the writing style is full of grand gestures and dramatic statements, and most of the dialogue is riddled with philosophical expositions. The storyline follows the lives and careers of the principle characters during which many magnificent buildings are constructed; some are original and are mostly criticized; others are copies and mash-ups of earlier styles and are mostly praised. The builders are Rourke and Keating respectively. Each of the principal characters interact with and react to each other, sometimes catastrophically. The Creators find common ground among their lot, while the Second Handers stick with their ilk. Those transitioning from one camp to the other, upon examining their conscience, end up hopelessly lost. The action culminates in a trial where the Egotist is placed in the court of public opinion, pitted against the entire cast of Second Handers, and accused of a crime against society. I will not add a spoiler to tell you the outcome of the trial, but knowing Rand and her leanings, you could easily guess who will win.The book leaves us with a striking image of Creator Man suspended high in the heavens, a proxy for God, perhaps?

Part of the Timeless Wisdom series, Struggle and Success is a 2020 release, and I hope it goes onto become a regular series capturing real stories of personal struggle. The twenty-five stories are short pieces of approximately 1500 words apiece, and are easily identifiable because many of the situations are part of our daily life: the travails encountered with home appliances that don’t behave as specified, dyslexia, school bullying, bulimia, alcoholism, cancer, suicide, discrimination and reverse discrimination. But there are stories that also go to deeper levels, and I will call out a few here:1)	People who take on a second career later in life by putting themselves back to school and facing the age old downer, “You are too old for this.”2)	The child, raised in a fundamentalist Christian family that doesn’t celebrate Christmas, who decorates her secret Christmas Tree in the woods.3)	The woman from a remote village in Tanzania who marries a westerner and makes the giant leap to her husband’s culture for the benefit of her progeny.4)	The woman who started as an extra in a theatre, a costumed rabbit with no lines, goes on to become a well-known playwright, scriptwriter and teacher.5)	And the one that is most topical for these times: the drought-plagued farmer who has to face his city-slicker banker for more credit. I’m sure many small businesses are in that position today due to the pandemic.Many of these struggles are based on an unavoidable personal experience that starts these authors off in their direction of struggle and ultimate success: the woman who is forced to become a caregiver to her gambling-addicted husband; the woman disfigured in a car accident who becomes a counsellor for deformed people; the woman scorned as a child for her peculiar eating habits as a Pommie in Australia who goes onto become a foodie. The parallel for us today is that we have all been hit by something we least expected, and our known world has been changed – will we give up in resignation, or will we adapt and morph as humans are known to do? And what will success be defined as in this new world?I am not going to talk about my own submission, “My Writing Life,” except to say that I was glad it was published in its entirety this time.

Depends where you come from “Memorable life experiences” can be a bit of a trap. What is memorable for some could be quite mundane to others, depending on one’s background, life history and country of residence. To assemble this wide collection however must be a labour of love and is a bold attempt on the part of the publisher, to capture moments in ordinary lives where the extra-ordinary or out-of-the-ordinary take place.The stories come from all over the “Five Eyes” countries, with a heavier weight from the Antipodes. The writers themselves range in age from their twenties into their seventies, with the bulk of them in the “retired and now given over to writing” category. Many have been published before and others are gainfully engaged with local writing groups, submitting work to journals and anthologies, and looking for that big break. For all the reasons mentioned above, therefore, there is an unevenness in this collection: some are strong stories, and others less so.I quickly skimmed over the pieces that dealt with slices of ordinary middle-class life: weddings, reminiscences of ancestral household objects, memories of friends or pets, camping, teachers in classrooms etc. While they are personal experiences to the writer, some even memorable, they are the stuff of normal life and failed to excite me. The travel stories however, some written with dramatic flair and others as descriptive travelogues, held my interest, for they covered a wide part of the globe:•	Battling altitude sickness while climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.•	The changing of the guard at a hostel when the Janata Party ousted the Congress Party in India for the first time in 30 years.•	The impoverishment of educated and cultured Cubans after Castro closed his economy.•	Fighting dishonesty without losing face in Argentina.•	Developing PTSD as a child due to a volcano eruption in Adak, Alaska.•	Bicycling in Vietnam.•	Portugal inspiring poetry.•	Fruit-pickers in Scotland behaving badly.•	Antipodean guest workers having it rough in England.•	Looking for traces of Leonard Cohen on a Greek island.In particular, I wanted to call out the work of two writers: Ronald Mackay and Tina Mattern. Their writing went beyond the descriptive and the reflective to the dramatic. In a couple of Mackay’s pieces, he deals with the challenges of juggling farming and an academic job to pay the bills, strained marital relationships, mental illness, and death in the unforgiving Ontario farm belt. Mattern writes a string of linked stories chronicling her unhappy childhood with an abusive step-mother, her adoption by foster parents, and her attempts at go-go dancing where going topless becomes a requirement.Overall, a mixed bag.

But does she? The teenagers are raised by shadowy but caring characters nicknamed Moth and Darter and others who flit in and out of their home in London. They pick up some interesting jobs: washing dishes in restaurants, recovering art treasures from tunnels, and ferrying illicit greyhounds on barges to populate the 150 unregulated dog racing tracks around England. As an adult, the cloistered and secretive Nathaniel, enters the British Secret Service and is given the job of poring over old war files to extract information that may still be of interest to authorities. In the process, he decides to track down what happened to his mother.Rose, the mother, emerges as the most enigmatic character in the book. A secretive sort herself, who was recruited into the secret service by a man who fell off a roof and whom she fell in love with but never married, Fallon. She went onto become a legend in that world of secrets, codenamed Viola. Her marriage to Nathaniel’s father gets short mention, in fact the father disappears after the first chapter and is dismissed as “smart but damaged.” Along with Fallon, who was also a ladies man with not only Rose among his conquests, she ranges across the world on secret missions, acquiring enemies along the way. For the safety of her children she has them entrusted to buddies in her cohort, such as Moth and Darter. When her children are threatened with harm, Rose quits the service and takes to a life of solitude and exile in her family home in Sussex. But her reputation tragically catches up with her. All this emerges from a combination of the service files and from Nathaniel’s memory and imagination, and the picture of Rose’s life is completed in a series of chapters that jump forward and back in time and place.This was not one of Ondaatje’s stronger books for me. While uncovering a mystery in fragmented memory recall is an effective device, the danger and menace implicit in this story is dulled and leaves more questions. For instance, how did Rose escape her torturers? Rose comes across as a cold-hearted person, hated by her daughter, and unknown by her son. Her duty to country overrides her care for family. The British stiff-upper lip and reticence is quite evident in this family of secrets. That she and Fallon had sex while on mission is clear, but did they love each other? Why was he living in exile not too far away from her and not getting in touch? A lover’s rift, perhaps?— not explained, and subject to the failure of memory, which also becomes an easy out for the author from having to tie loose ends.Just like with previous Ondaatje novels, I learned new things that do not fall under the popular radar: WWII-spawned vendettas that went on long after the war ended, the canal system of England, the area called the Saints in Sussex, and the peculiar and unsanitary habits of British boarding schools.On the credit side, this is an unusual angle at which to approach the old WWII story, from the eyes of a 15-year old looking upon his world which the adults are doing their darndest to destroy, leaving him a solitary in his adulthood, content to live in a house with a large wall around it. I wonder whether millennials today view their climate-destroying boomer parents in the same way?...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 29, 2020","Feb 29, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35657511-warlight

It's as if he decided to explore every nook and cranny of Russian society, poking into some areas in depth and side-stepping others, unearthing some fleshed-out characters and leaving others as cardboard cut-outs. The result is a family story of the four brothers Karamazov and their profligate father, and a large cast of external characters, with a central murder trial and a half dozen sub plots that either connect with the main story line or not, and with some characters who are embroiled right through while others fizzle out midway. The plot is simple (simple?). Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov has four sons: the first, Dmitri (Mitya) from his first marriage, who is given to passion and profligacy like his father; the second, Ivan, is an intellectual, writer and researcher, who challenges organized religion, and yet succumbs to brain fever and begins conversations with the devil; Alexei (Alyosa) is pious and studying to be a monk in a monastery under the tutelage of the saintly elder Fr. Zossima; and Smerdyakov, the illegitimate son, prone to epilepsy, is working for his father as a servant. Fyodor and Mitya are vying for the hand of an “enchantress,” Grushenka, while Mitya’s spurned lover Katarina Ivanovna is burning with revenge in her heart, a heart that is being quietly stolen by Ivan. Alyosa drifts between all these parties carrying the story for us. The Karamazovs are born sensualists and are a reflection of Russian society that espouses mysticism and chauvinism unlike the rest of Europe that looks towards idealism and liberalism. “They have their Hamlets, we have our Karamazovs.” Events bubble to a head when Fyodor disowns Mitya who has stolen Katarina’s money to have a debauched weekend with Grushenka. Desperate to repay Katarina, Mitya runs in circles to find money, threatening to kill his father and commit suicide. When the patriarch is found murdered and 3000 rubles stolen, the main suspects are Mitya, who is found drunk and carousing with Grushenka while spilling money out of his pockets, and Smerdyakov who has just had the most violent epileptic fit that evening. Enter a raft of new characters: prosecutors, defense counsel, police inspectors and witnesses, and the trial gets underway full of big speeches from everyone—giving credence to Dostoevsky’s polyphonic style: many voices from many directions.Lest I give off spoilers as to whodunnit, let me describe the sub-plots instead: Fr. Zossima’s final hours and his life story that had nothing to do with the Karamazovs; Ivan’s conversations with the devil and his treatise on the Church; the impoverished peasant family of the Snegirigovs and the sickly son Illusa who defends his father’s reputation by throwing stones at and stabbing his tormentors (strangely, when Illusa dies his body does not smell, but saintly Fr. Zossima’s cadaver does); the Hohlakovs, a graceful mother (she is 33 years old at one point and 40 at another – Dostoevsky had poor continuity management, it appears) with an invalid and mercurial daughter; the Krassotkin family and it’s wunderkind, 14 year old Kolya, who talks like an adult and who once slept on the railway lines and wasn’t killed by a train passing over him, who is an avowed socialist and has “no knowledge, but unbounded conceit” per Alyosa. Then there are characters who walk on and walk out or get lost along the way: Miusov who is suing the monastery, Kalgonov who is heading to university, the two Poles, one of whom is a former lover of Grushenka, the monks in the monastery, Maya and Grigory who are serfs at the Karamazov residence and who decided against accepting their emancipation, Smurov the cheeky student, and the unknown narrator himself who appears to be a resident of this town of Skutoprigonyevsk (which gets only one mention in the book) where this tale largely takes place. One could argue that there are reasons for these lesser characters and subplots: that Snegirigov is a better father than Karamazov despite the former’s humbler circumstances; that Miusov exists to point out “in dealing with Russian officials, Catholic Socialists are the most suspect”; that Illusa is the saint over Fr. Zossima; that Kolya is the embodiment of the Communism to come, and Grigory is an indicator that change can be legislated but needs to be adopted to take root; that the mentally ill Ivan cautions us against jousting with the devil which reduces atheists to madness, and so on with all the rest of the cast, primary or peripheral. Therefore, these digressions only enrich the canvas that Dostoyevsky draws his final masterpiece upon.The narrative and the characters brim with freneticism and energy, another Dostoyevsky hallmark, that keeps you reading. The female characters are capricious and forever lapsing into hysterics. “Never trust a woman’s tears,” says the most balanced Madame Hohlakov. The ladies suffer from “self-laceration”; they hurt and betray as much as they love their men. And everyone, men and women alike, is in a state of “aberration.” Being a devout believer in God, Dostoyevsky leaves us with hope that there will be better days in the end, even for the surviving Brothers Karamazov, each trapped in their respective hells, as we attend a funeral and wish everyone in this very long book, including Dostoyevsky, goodbye. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Feb 16, 2020","Feb 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov

Both writer and subject were born into the colonial British Empire, during its decline, both saw a dramatic change in living circumstances when they lost their fathers at a young age, and both came of age outside the land of their birth—Woolf in Ceylon, and Ondaatje in Britain and Canada. The difference between their journeys through Jaffna, Kandy and Hambantota, cities in the north, central and southern parts of the island, was that Woolf undertook his as part of being assigned as a civil servant and having to spend several months, even years, in each place, while Ondaatje journeyed as a tourist along with three trusted locals to help him along the way.Woolf was brutally honest about his character limitations, which he elaborated on at length in his six-part autobiography (the second part, Growing, covers Woolf’s entire Ceylon period from 1904-1911). Despite being a hardworking but strict disciplinarian, he was arrogant and offensive, and was not liked by the more educated locals. He enjoyed the perks of imperialism but suffered the moral ambivalence of his position. He administered beatings to the locals, even presiding at executions of criminals whom he tried and sentenced, as the civil service ran almost everything during his tenure. He was more interested in the Sinhalese rather than the Tamils and preferred Buddhism over other religions. He would let civil cases drag on so he could discover more about the Sinhalese and their way of life. He liked travelling in the jungles, often alone. He was prone to crippling bouts of depression following the recovery from an encounter with typhoid.Some interesting factoids on Ceylon in the early 1900s emerge: the Kandyans practiced polyandry; British sponsored opium fuelled the Tangalle economy; Hambantota had the largest proportion of Malay Muslims in Ceylon; the houses or Jaffna were surrounded by cadjan fences. Along the way we are entertained to a lengthy treatise on Woolf’s most famous novel, Village in the Jungle, which went onto become a school text in Ceylon while being condemned as a book about “blacks” by the racist Bloomsbury Group in London. “Man in the jungle is closest to the beast” and “the jungle subsumes everything in the end just like the destructive evil in the human heart,” are a couple of the themes in this book, along with greed, desire, superstition and religion. Woolf was credited as the only westerner who was able to get inside the mind and spirit of the Ceylonese local.The book also covers Woolf’s life after he left Ceylon in 1911 and includes his married life with Virginia upon his return to England. Theirs was a dysfunctional marriage. She was racist, anti-Semitic and had no interest in Ceylon. He was sympathetic to brown people (although relishing his role as a colonial). His alienated lust (i.e. he consorted with an abundance of prostitutes while in Ceylon) and her terrified frigidity (she was abused by two older half-brothers as a child) were at opposite ends of the sexual spectrum. Was it therefore purely intellectual and literary interest that brought and held them together?Ondaatje’s own journey a hundred years later takes place during the civil war in Ceylon (now renamed Sri Lanka), albeit during a period of ceasefire and negotiation between the battling Sinhalese and Tamils. The scars of war are everywhere in Jaffna, and the many photographs in the book are testament to this. Alas, this war too was a legacy of colonization, for the “divide and conquer” rule of the British played its part in keeping these two ethnic communities apart, and the hasty independence granted in 1948 didn’t work out as favourably for minorities such as the Tamils. In fact, Woolf, during his 1960 visit to the country, had second thoughts about his advocacy for self-government when he saw creeping nationalism, the “Sinhala first” policies, and the take-over of the civil service by politicians. This is a very well researched book for the Sri Lankan expatriate, especially for those who missed the war years in the country. It is also a good primer on Woolf. As much as Leonard Woolf’s sojourn in Ceylon was a journey into himself, Ondaatje’s journey through Sri Lanka helped him to understand his birthplace. It filled a vital gap for me who went back to an almost fully restored Jaffna in 2016 and wondered what the heck had gone on there during the civil war....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2020","Feb 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/80076.Woolf_in_Ceylon_

And this is a fighting book from a brave woman who has thrown caution to the winds and taken on the big bad boys who rule Sri Lanka, exposing the house of cards on which that society is built.Sharmini Serasinghe has written the book, she claims, no publisher would touch. In it, she takes on the ruling Rajapakse clan for their demagoguery, nepotism and corruption, the Buddhist clergy for their lapsing into thuggery and racism, the impure practices built up in Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, child slavery in the monkhood, animal cruelty, the oppressive caste system, the decline of the fourth estate, and the confused identity of the man on the street who has to categorize himself by ethnic and religious group rather than call himself a Sri Lankan.The author has all the credentials and has earned the right to make these challenges. An accomplished broadcaster, journalist, communications director, and writer for over 30 years, she has seen much of the war’s collateral damage unseen by average citizens; she has worked diligently on many peace-making attempts between Sri Lankan government authorities and the Tamil Tigers during the country’s 26-year civil war. “I have only known war in my life,” she says, and deftly dismisses the death threats she frequently receives in the wee hours of the morning by telling those who threaten her not to ruin her sleep.  The book is a series of short chapters, written as op-ed pieces or blogs, compiled since the Rajapakses first came to power in 2005. They are high on condemnation and assume the reader knows the subject matter under discussion. As I don’t live in Sri Lanka anymore, I would have preferred longer chapters with more facts to support the author’s arguments.There are no sacred cows under her stinging pen: the Mahavamsa, the Tooth Relic, the Esala Perahera, the merit-seeking worshipers in temples—all are fair game for exposure. Dubbing herself a Philosophical Buddhist, she takes on the Cultural Buddhists who have reduced the Dhamma to pomp and pageantry. The book reflects a work in progress, for the dilemmas facing Sri Lanka since Independence in 1948 remain unresolved. Democracy did not take hold as expected back then, people still needed a king, and what transpired since has been a country raped and pillaged by successive generations of politicians, all feathering their own nests while sowing racial and communal discord. “We need a Lee Kuan Yew or a Mahathir bin Mohamed,” a benign but firm dictator who will steer Sri Lanka through a prolonged period until democracy finally, and firmly, takes root. They thought they had it in Mahinda Rajapakse, until he got corrupted by power and became a tyrant in his second term. And now his brother, Gothabaya, a man accused of war crimes, is president. Is Gota the messiah? Time will tell.This is a hard hitting book. A rant shouted from the rooftops for someone to take notice. I applaud the author’s courage to go through with self-publishing this book in an era when journalists disappear in white vans belonging to governments. It is a good primer on the alienation felt, not only by the minorities, but by those in the Sinhalese Buddhist majority who have by legislation and muscling attempted to make Sri Lanka “their country,” at the exclusion of everyone else. If you believe, Sharmini, at this point of history, that promised land, “Apey Rata,” is a seething cauldron. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,2,not setnot set,"Jan 28, 2020not set","Jan 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50706908-sri-lanka---the-elusive-miracle-of-asia

This “novel” is all of the above, and definitely stretches the imagination and the form. By this book having won several international fiction awards and recently garnering the author the Nobel Prize for Literature, I wondered whether prize juries, being frankly sick of the structure the novel had been boxed into by writing mills and creative writing schools in recent years, were looking to break the novel out into unexplored territory.The author studied psychology but never practiced it. She worked with experimental specimens, which comes out clearly in some of these stories and essays. She became a writer instead and has spent a lifetime travelling: “I was a waitress, a maid in an upscale hotel, and a nanny. I sold books. I sold tickets. I was employed in a small theater for one season to work in wardrobe, making it through that long winter ensconced backstage amidst heavy costumes, satin capes, and wigs. Once I’d finished my studies, I also worked as a teacher, as a rehab counselor, and—most recently—in a library. Whenever I managed to save any money, I would be on my way again.” She admits to the defect of Recurrent Detoxification Syndrome : “My set of symptoms revolves around my being drawn to all things spoiled, flawed, defective, broken.” The “stories” in this novel come in fragments that occur and recur in intervals throughout the book. The ones that stuck out for me were: 1) A man loses his wife and child on a holiday in Croatia, only to find them three days later. The obsession with what happened during those three lost days threatens to destroy his marriage.2) Dr. Blau, who specializes in plastination of human body parts, fraternizes with his female students shamelessly but is unable to respond sexually to the widow of his mentor.3) The 17th century anatomist, Veryehen, who suffers from phantom leg due to an amputation, carries his severed leg around with intent to bury it with him, only to end up dissecting it into minute pieces before he dies. In the course of the Veryehen story we travel through the most secret passages and organs of the human body.4) Another anatomist, Fredrik Ruysch, ships his collection of specimens to the Russian Tsar, only to have the sailors on board the ship stranded at sea and drink the preservative (brandy) in which the specimens are stored. The decaying specimens are tossed overboard.5) An 80-year old professor specializing in Greek history and his younger wife go on a lecture tour of the Greek isles annually until the inevitability of death arrives.6) Anushka, the runaway mother of a perennially sick child and the wife of an ex-con, takes to travelling throughout the day in the subway system and sleeping in an abandoned boiler room, frequenting with other homeless people rather than return home.The essays cover Travel Psychology, the structure and meaning of airports, human anatomy, linear time vs. circular time, islands, language, and space. They make you re-examine these topics that we may have once given only cursory attention to. The essay on motion vs. stasis gives a clue as to the unifying theme of this book—that we are constantly in motion over the time allotted in our lives, and place halts that motion, for it forces relationships with people and objects to form in the place where motion is interrupted. The chapters therefore cover a mixture of motion-related or static subjects.The travel memoirs and trivia are the most interesting. Many of the author’s observations are of fellow travellers in airports and bus stations, on trains, planes and in hotels. Countries touched on or visited in her travels include Jordan, Turkey, Croatia, Russia, Polynesia, Poland, India and Iceland among others that I failed to record as I was too absorbed in the book. There are far too many trivia items to mention, but a few stuck out for me:	In Prague, in the year 1677, you could go to Saint Vitus Cathedral to see the breasts of Saint Ann, totally intact, kept in a glass jar.	The Jesuits had the head of Saint Ursula and the hat and finger of Saint Francis Xavier.	The nuns of Saint Teresa would show interested visitors a sister deceased some three hundred years earlier, sitting behind bars, very well preserved.	Often, the most striking similarities are ones we find on opposite sides of the world. e.g. Gotland and Rhodes, Iceland and New Zealand.	In Holland, they don't use curtains. At dusk, people become actors in their own play.	The Chinese went in search of the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha gained enlightenment, only to find it less enamouring. The journey, not the arrival, mattered more to them.So there you are—how does one evaluate and  this book as a novel? There are no protagonists, no antagonists, no central plot, no novelistic arc, no...none of those elements of fiction that they teach in writing school. Go figure! But did the book engage, educate and enlighten? It certainly did.

He is the quintessential starving writer who made it to the safe shore (i.e. teaching and editing gigs to supplement his writing and publishing income) through perspiration and perseverance, and he has now won a prestigious literary award that threatens to make him respectable, politically correct and boring. We pray that he does not go over to the dark side.His book Confessions of a Small Press Racketeer is a distillation of his life over 25 years (the book was published in 2005, so there are still many more years in his life to chronicle, that I suspect come out in the sequel) as a writer, poet, magazine publisher, book editor, and general encyclopedia on the small press literary scene in Canada. His dedication to his craft is total, spending years selling thousands of chapbooks on the streets of Toronto, attending every literary festival he got invited to, slumming around with every known and unknown poet and writer, irritating some and endearing himself to others. The picture of the small press world he paints is starkly funny: everyone knows everybody, everyone owns his own micro-press and publishes everyone else’s writing under the aegis of a benevolent government funding program, everyone compliments and bitches about everyone else, everyone can’t resist the temptation to perform their work in front of an audience, and everyone dreams of winning a big prize in the literary establishment that they are kept at bay from. His advice to budding writers:1)	Forget about making money.2)	Read like crazy, then steal.3)	Buy books, if you expect others to buy yours.4)	Start your own magazine or press.5)	Don’t take creative writing courses, unless your instructor is Stuart Ross.6)	Start performing your work (although he doesn’t really like open mics for their accent on “performance” over “quality”).Being the owner of a micro-press myself, which Ross graciously elevates to “small press,” because he too has one, I have to agree with him on all these points, although I would modify the second half of point # 5 to read “no matter who your instructor is.” I believe that creativity is inherent and cannot be taught. The writing mills were just an industry that sprang up to supplement writers’ incomes. Sorry Stuart, upon reading your book, I am starting to become an upstart, just as you are!Small press poets and writers try to gain attention by writing about a crazy reality, and they use monikers that are spelled in combinations of upper case and lower case letters applied out of established grammatical norms – attention grabbers, or branding, as one would say today. Their readings can be bizarre, such as reading a failed grant application on open mic, or reading the table of contents of their book only, or just thumbing the pages of their manuscript in front of an audience while making rude noises before walking away. They are glad when someone, unknown to them, looks up their website or recognizes them in the street. As to the evolution of the industry, more nuggets fall out:a)	American suck at most things such as world peace, but they produce great writers.b)	Readers prefer funny and light instead of dark and heavy.c)	Poetry is more about personality and performance than about the writing (hence his disfavour of open mics).This book was strangely re-assuring to me, a fellow small presser, for Ross candidly expresses what many of us suspect but are sometimes reluctant to voice. As for small press writers and publishers, I wonder what their purpose in the world is, given that so little of their work is read due to narrowed or suppressed distribution? Would they have created a better world with their work, or would they merely leave the world a duller place when their technicoloured personalities die out? Strangely, Ross didn’t answer this question in his book. I think I’ll read the sequel to find out....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2020","Jan 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6323363-confessions-of-a-small-press-racketeer

He says he needs to tellMalone is dying, as the title suggests, and unlike Molloy in Part 1, prefers to tell us his convoluted story in first person. He says he needs to tell three stories before he dies (or takes inventory, in his words).He is in some sanatorium, in a room with a bed and window. He feels everyone is out to get him. His body is failing him, his limbs are immobile, and he is impotent. But he is more coherent than Molloy, at least his syntax is more understandable. Food is dropped in via a hole in the door to him. Slop buckets and food dishes are replenished regularly. He is not in discomfort or unclean. He lies naked on the bed with a stick that he rubs himself with dreaming that it is a woman. He has a notebook and pencil to write his story.The stories: the sickly Saposcats have a son, Sapo. He boxes and wrestles well, is fleet of foot, sneers at his teachers and sometimes even gives them impertinent answers. Sapo loves nature, takes an interest in animals and plants and willingly raises his eyes to the sky, day and night. He isn't very bright and comes last in class. Then Malone switches to the story of the Lamberts, pig farmers. Big Lambert is on his fourth wife and has two children. There is incest in the Lambert household. Sapo is a visitor to this household. Then Sapo becomes Macmann who is struggling his way through a rainstorm. Then McMann becomes Malone, being cared for by a nurse called Moll in a sanatorium similar to the narrator's. And they are having old-age sex “folding and stuffing his penis into her and enjoying the gratification thereof.” She has a loose tooth. Then she gets yellow, bald, vomits and dies. Enter Lemuel, the new nurse, who likes to bang on his own head with a hammer. Malone suspects Lemuel has come to kill him. Lemuel takes all Malone’s multiple personalities on a trip by coach, then by boat, then on foot to the land of the dead, and there he kills them all off quite matter of factly. See where this is going? The ramblings of a dying man where memory is caving in and getting all muddled? Or the ramblings of a poet who is using this series of connected stories to give us a virtuoso performance of poetic prose? Malone the narrator switches back and forth from his story to his own situation in the sanatorium and to his daily challenges of just staying alive. There are no chapters in this book, just some sub breaks.“All is pretext,” says Malone, giving us a hint as to what this novel is about. “Sapo and the birds, Moll, the peasants, those who in the towns seek one another out and fly from one another, my doubts which do not interest me, my situation, my possessions, pretext for not coming to the point, the abandoning, the raising of the arms and going down, without further splash, even though it may annoy the bathers.” The readers are presumably the bathers here.I had to put this novel, like the other two in this trilogy, as Beckett’s attempt to recover from a nervous breakdown. I am told that in the final piece The Unnameable, everything comes together, but I am finding the effort taken to read through this plotless, verbal diarrhea of a book quite tiring, so it will be awhile before I attempt the third and final piece of this trilogy...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2020","Jan 13, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54042.Malone_Dies

Although the storyline hangs on a retired writer’s journey through his pasThis was a rather difficult book to read, in style, structure and sequence. Although the storyline hangs on a retired writer’s journey through his past stomping grounds back to his family home, it looked like a self-indulgent romp in time and memory by Peter Handke with nary a care for the reader, as if “through his writing he could re-order time according to his own pace and escape reality.”In summary, a retired writer (Handke?) summons a group of loyal friends to his boat house on the Morava River for a meal and to a recounting of his recent journey through Europe. The tables on board the boat are each arranged for a single person, each positioned so the person sitting at it is pointed away from the rest of the guests. There is an attractive woman on board whom no-one knows and who flits in and out of the dinner party. That these guests, summoned at such short notice, would linger long into the night while the host rambles on about his travels suggests that they are total admirers of his work and are dedicated to his well-being.The ex-writer’s peregrinations go from the Balkans to the edge of Portugal and Spain, back through an eight-mile tunnel into Germany, and on to the family home in Austria. The narrator is always a third person or persons, sometimes someone at the boat party and sometimes an unnamed one, and I wondered why Handke chose this complex narrative structure, for it is difficult to read and follow; the style is a confluence of many streams of consciousness, flowing and overlapping like the currents of the Morava River.The places the wandering ex-writer winds up have shades of the macabre: a cemetery where one half of a town has killed the other half; a young girl he had once had an affair with, who has now been reduced to begging and to hurling curses and excreta at him; a symposium on sound where all the delegates have been damaged by it and yet one delegate, a monk, says, “Silence can also destroy”; hiking in the countryside with a poet who knows nothing about the novelistic craft, while our writer in turn does not get poetry; meeting a populist writer who states that only the language of journalism is alive and that literary writing is dead; meeting his brother, a world traveller, who feels the world in his body parts and has not read any of the ex-writer’s books. Our wanderer is even seen behaving irrationally on some parts of his journey by some of his guests on the boat who then take up the story on his behalf.He meets odd characters: a young rock climber in Austria, an old man in Portugal editing a manuscript, and the idiots of Santiago de Compostella, to name a few. The woman appears and reappears on this journey, loving him and then being beaten by him. I struggled with the allegory and the symbolism here. Was she his nemesis? His muse? Does she have to be beaten like he has to batter his books to give them character? Why is she now at peace with him on the boat? Because he has finally given up writing? And what does the dog symbolize, for this animal also shows up in places along his journey?I got it that he is mourning the break up of the Balkans into fragmented states: “new borders have cropped up, new countries carved out of old.” There is even a dying band of Central European partisans meeting annually to resuscitate a unified Balkan state. Handke has a soft spot for the Balkans due to his maternal ancestry being from that side of the world, and which was brought into focus by the recent Nobel Prize furor over his expressed sympathies for Slobodan Milosevic.At the cemetery where his parents are buried, he has a revelation: he attains a heightened state of awareness and describes the minutia of ant colonies, bumblebees and grasses. Upon his return home to the Morava riverboat he finds that time away on his travels has changed what was home. There are bomb craters now, the signage in the enclave he lives in has changed from Cyrillic to English, the river has dried up, and the boat has been pulled ashore. Symbolism? Meaning? Go figure!The only redeeming elements here for me were the complex but fluid sentences, the powerful imagery, the writer’s connectedness with sights, sounds and smells, and the reflections of a writer who has passed his “best by” date. Maybe the Nobel was conferred upon Handke for his boldness to go into these areas....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jan 07, 2020","Jan 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28514451-the-moravian-night

That seems to be the hinge of this book, for Dostoevsky, chooses not to impute meaning but sticks true to his calling as a writer and just records the actions of his eccentric characters, following them through to the tragedies (and comedies) that ensue.Lef Nikolovitch Myshkin is a prince from an aristocratic line that has run out and is the “idiot” of this novel, so called because his Christ-like nature is out of place in a world of double speak. He suffers from epilepsy and has missed much of coming-of-age life after being in a sanitarium in Switzerland. Upon his return to Russia, he is exposed to two military-aristocratic families: the Epanchins and their three daughters of marriageable age, Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya, with the older two creeping into old-maid status and the youngest one spurning suitors left and right (and with the Prince being one of those spurned); the dysfunctional Ivolgins, in which the patriarch is a drunk and makes up the most fantastic stories that cause embarrassment to the rest of his family. A host of other characters make up the cast that flit between Petersburg and the country resort of Pavlosk during the summer, living, or feeding off, the lives of the idle rich: the dying Hippolyte who is intent on blackmailing everyone with his suicidal threats, Evgenie Pavlovitch, also from the military, who is one of Aglaya’s hapless suitors, Rogojin, the young and devilish nemesis of the Prince, and the mysterious but manic-depressive Nastasia Philipovna who has the Prince and Rogojin in her web of on-again-off-again love. The cast—comprised of military officers, young women seeking husbands, money-lenders, clerks, boxers, radicals, widows, matriarchs, consumptives and drunks—is a cross section of Russian society on the eve of the death of the aristocracy and the advent of the “Coming Men,” termed Nihilists here, but soon to be identified as Communists in the next century.The novelistic style is theatrical, Shakespearean and polyphonic, where the entire cast assembles at crucial scenes for speeches dominated by one of the characters, and which usually leads to a crisis and plot-inflection point: whether that is Hippolyte with the gun that fails to fire, or the Prince breaking the vase during his diatribe on Roman Catholicism, or Burdevsky trying the expose the Prince as a fake with fake evidence, or Nastasia with her baiting of the Prince and Rogojin, or Mrs. Epanchin’s hysterical outburst condemning the Prince for appeasing swindlers. In between these set pieces, the convoluted plot veers back and forth furiously. One moment Nastasia is to be married off to Ganya, the elder son of the Ivolgins, the next the Prince is madly in love with Nastasia, the next Nastasia has run away with Rogojin, the next the heartbroken Prince is pledged to Aglaya, the next we find that Aglaya is pledged to no-one but has only been leading everyone on. Sometimes the promises and claims made by the characters (except for the Prince) cannot be believed, for, remember, they are engaged in double-speak, often meaning the opposite of what they say. And when a plot point is needed, Dostoevsky just throws one in – like the convenient way the Prince suddenly flashes a letter to say that he has become the heir to a vast inheritance left by a distant relative, thus elevating him from rags to riches in a flash just when the story requires it.Within this crumbling society, the Prince is considered a Nihilist, for he is exposing all that is bad in the corrupt world by just speaking the truth. Nastasia puts the sins of the aristocracy on display when she plays a game with her guests where they each have to mention the most shameful act they have committed in their lives, and thereby we get an insight into the shallowness of this supposedly well-to-do society. Dostoevsky also gets to talk about what it means to be a prisoner facing execution (an experience the author had, before he was reprieved from the firing squad at the last minute) – and this section makes for riveting reading. And yet, despite his simplicity, the Prince is able to turn the tables on some deviants by sticking to his principles: he exposes Burdevsky, he gets Rogojin to see Nastasia’s limitations, he foils the proposed marriage of Ganya and Nastasia. He sees into people’s souls and speaks the truth, and they recognize his innocence and integrity and respect him for that. But we know that inevitably this world will get the better of him, hence the moniker given to him by many: The Idiot.The tragic finale is macabre, and not as I had expected - well, at least I didn’t anticipate the way in which the predictive end would pan out. But given Dostoevsky’s experiences with firing squads, I’m sure he never planned any pat endings to his novels that followed. My one criticism of this work is that it is unbalanced and meandering in places, although it bravely explores the issues of the times in those dying days of the Russian aristocracy....more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,not setnot set,"Dec 26, 2019not set","Dec 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12505.The_Idiot

Ettie is widowed when her beloved Vince, a former judge who was ostracised by the Communist regime for 23 years, dies. Her take-control daughter, Iza, urges Ettie to leave the rural hometown and live with her in Pest, in an apartment. The adjustment from rural to city life doesn’t go well for Ettie; Iza pushes her mother around and does the thinking for Ettie, often chastizing the old woman for her behaviour in the little apartment that could easily set the place on fire. Ettie withdraws and slumps into silence and takes to roaming about the city on the tram system. Iza is a doctor, divorced from Antal who is also a doctor. Iza is the quintessential soldier, ready to react to any situation, whether it be to a patient in the hospital, to acts of rebellion in support of her political convictions, to when she is denied university entrance due to her father’s fall from official grace, to her father’s untimely death, or to her husband Antal abruptly asking her for a divorce. What Iza lacks is vulnerability and that drives people away from her, even though she desires their company. Antal, on the other hand, who was an orphan and got his breaks by leaning on people, considers Ettie and Vince like his parents and cares for them both, even after his divorce from Iza. He buys the old family home and adopts the family dog after Ettie leaves to live with Iza in Pest. To have a more equal partner, Antal settles for Lidia, a nurse from his old village who also nursed Vince in his last days. Iza settles on Domokos, a writer with a deep interest in people and places, a relaxed bohemian and the opposite of the uptight doctor.Things come to a head when Ettie goes back home to place a gravestone on Vince’s grave and is invited by Antal to spend time in her old house. The cozy confines of her former home make her snap, leading to a series of unfortunate events that ultimately reveal the cracks in this family.Many themes play out here: the loss of control, whether that be through aging or being in an unfamiliar environment, or due to the creep of the city rendering its inhabitants faceless, friendless and faithless; the quest for survival that makes us suppress emotions; the depersonalizing effect of Communism. Glimpses of life in Hungary in the 1960’s emerge: the tankard men who deliver hot water from the thermal springs in carts to customers, risking their lives in the process, village life and its characters, city life and its archetypes, married life among professionals living under a Communist regime.I found the style rather difficult to get by: an omniscient narrator who pops around into each person’s head and then settles back while a third person narrator takes over—this happens often; a grammatical style whereby a person’s name and the subsequent singular third-person pronoun used in the same sentence refers to two different people.Some things are never fully explained although they are subtly hinted to: why did Antal ask Iza for a divorce when everything was going well for them professionally and socially? Why did Domokos walk away, when he too was sitting pretty with Iza? Why did Ettie rush off into the rainy night, after a hot bath and a good meal at her old home? Was the force of Iza’s aloofness behind it all? “I was hers. She was never mine,” mourns Antal in some form of grudging revelation. The dying Ettie asks Lidia for water, not for Iza. Is the cost of survival the loss of love?

In these two months, Germans, especially the women, descended into a hellhole reminiscent of Dante’s Inferno, for which they have only their blessed Fuhrer to thank.The writer of this diary is titled Anonymous, although her identity became well known after the book was initially published, and her life story makes for interesting reading. Yet, in this book, she is a nameless 34-year old journalist whose publishing company has closed down, just like most businesses in Germany did as the war wound to its close. In dispassionate terms she goes onto describe—each chapter being a day’s events—the bombing, the loss of water, food and civil order, the advancing enemy, and the talk by German women as they hunker in their bunkers about the “impending humiliation,” being under no illusions that what the German soldiers did to women in captured Russian territory would not be visited upon them.I guess one must mention the rapes for it is central to this book. In Berlin, a city of 2 million survivors, between 95,000 to 130,000 women were estimated to have been raped at the end of WWII. Rape was an instrument of war, an expression of revenge, and no woman of any age was spared. Our narrator was raped by about four different men, and, because she couches these incidents in veiled language, there could have been more. The Red Army soldiers are portrayed as underpaid, overworked, and undisciplined, with their eyes set on plunder and rape, shitting and pissing everywhere; they are sexually starved beasts who can only approach a woman after consuming large quantities of alcohol. Some are 15-year old adolescents with unbroken voices, pleading for a deflowering that would turn them into men. The German women in turn become wily after the first wave of rapes sweep the city; they take on “protectors” — soldiers of rank who can keep the riff-raff at bay. Our narrator moves up the ranks from a sub-lieutenant to a major for protection, providing sexual favours in return. She unabashedly confesses to becoming a prostitute, trading her body for protection and for something to eat. The graphic descriptions take you to a place where people have no privacy, live without electricity, have to scrounge for food, line up for a trickle of water, have no work or money, have no news about what is happening around them other than for rumours pouring out of anecdotal grapevines, have to make unfamiliar and temporary relationships for survival, and who are waiting for the next assault on their bodies, being too tired from the many already exacted upon them. New terminology like “plunder wine,” “coal filching,” “rape shoes,” and “my major’s sugar” enter the vernacular. Two women meeting at the communal water tap may open a conversation with, “And how many times were you raped?” with the response being, “Four—and you?”As April goes into May, glimmers of light, revelation, and hope emerge: the Soviets ban their soldiers from consorting with German women (a few still break the law with impunity), the survivors are organized into work teams to clear away the rubble, and a few entrepreneurs start new businesses to capitalize on the reconstruction that is to come. News filters in about the Fuhrer’s death, and the deaths or capture of his inner circle members; the horrors of the concentration camps come to light, and so does the crushing realization and humiliation that Germany has fought two world wars and lost them both.Given that this was a diary written in the moment, there are some limitations in it. It lacks the drama of this dark period as the writer is trying to mask the horror while describing the events. Continuity is lacking in places where people filter in and out without their motivations or purpose being described. Some chapters are short and others long, depending on how much time the author had to document the day’s events. With the view being so narrow—the author’s sojourn in her apartment building and the surroundings she travels to for work and foraging, all located within the Russian sector of Berlin—we don’t get a picture of what was happening in the larger Germany during this crucial period.Much was done to discredit this book after it was initially published in 1954. Germans, still smarting from their defeat, were affronted that their women would conduct themselves in such a way with the enemy in order to survive. The author therefore withdrew the book until after her death in the early 21st century, and this version was published posthumously to critical acclaim from a younger, more enlightened and unaffected audience in Germany.This is essential reading for those interested in the lesser documented events of WWII. It is also a brilliant testament to the indomitability of the human spirit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 14, 2019","Dec 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30851.A_Woman_in_Berlin

The angles at which Oates comes at these stories is always oblique: an assault victim trying to figure out why he was singled out for a police beating, a scholarship student befriending a troubled woman on a Greyhound bus and being led far off course, a woman associating the milestones of her life with the different guns she has handled, another family measuring its milestones by the different hitchhikers they have picked up or ignored, a journalist fighting a losing battle against the death penalty and getting energized every time he witnesses an execution, or an elderly couple calmly arranging their deaths at their cottage in the wilderness.It is hard to try and categorize these stories. The subtitles say “Tales of Transgression” but isn’t that the stuff of all fiction, i.e. those events that lead to conflict, with transgression being one of the prime drivers of conflict? What I found common in these tales was that after the premise is unloaded on you and events seem to be heading towards a predictable conclusion, Oates reigns us in and steers us down a completely different path at the end. In “Ugly” the waitress with a poor body image shuns the older teacher, who is courteous and loving towards her, to cavort with her lecherous boss on the presumption that “irony is the repository of hurt, and hurt is the repository of hope.” Therefore, some stories like “Questions” and “Physical” were also inconclusive and implausible to me; how does the sexually charged teacher in the first story deal with the two needy men she is sleeping with, a father and his suicidal son? How does the physical therapist in the second story indicate to her client who has fallen ass over teakettle for her that she either favours or disfavours of this attachment with only her fingers pressed upon his aging body? There is a lot of older woman-younger man relationships going on as well. Apart from “Questions,” in the story “Murder 2” a 42-year old defense attorney falls in love with her 17-year old client accused of murdering his mother; in “Tusk’, a 13-year old smuggles a knife into school to kill his 15-year old girlfriend to demonstrate his power over her; in “The High School Sweetheart Mystery,” a 15-year old student drugs his 17-year old amateur starlet girlfriend during rehearsals, just so he could have her body to himself without rejection. And a character by the name of Roland or R_ keeps popping up in several of the stories—I wondered whether this was a pen name of the author or whether she had cycled through so many names and had to start all over again?My favourite was the title story, “Faithless,” in which the device of the grandchild narrator trying to uncover the murky history of her farmer grandparents she never knew is used very effectively to give us a complete story for a change. This approach is repeated in “What Then, My Life”, also set on a family farm, where the grand-daughter is trying to find out why her grandmother never liked her, even though the sexual assault she suffered at the hands of her older male cousins when she was ten sets the stage for much of that conflict. Another child narrator emerges in “Manhattan Romance” in which a 5-year old narrates her last wonderful day of shopping, restaurants and amusement with Daddy, a fraudulent lawyer—a day that ends in heartache.Some of these characters are so emotionally hurt that “the wound is so deep, it hasn’t bled.” In “Vigil”, a divorced man is plotting the murder of his wife’s current lover, by rehearsing the murder every night before carrying out the deed; we are left hanging as to whether he has indeed carried out his intention, for the man is an unreliable narrator. “Lovers” follows a similar “jilted lover” plot with a more concrete ending.The “story within a story” concept is also on tap: In “Vampire” two jurors are discussing a woman who sucked an artist friend of all his money and artistic works and may even have been responsible for his early death. In the “High School Sweetheart Mystery” a celebrated writer makes a confession about how he became a murder writer by telling his stunned audience a real story from his high school days during his acceptance speech as President of the American Mystery Writers organization.I marvel at the cross section of American society that this university professor who has ostensibly lived a sheltered life is able to conjure up with such deft strokes. Is it pure imagination and reading, or do the troubled people of America come in procession to lay their troubles before Oates and make confessions that form the grist for her prolific writing mill? Given the myriad of styles and voices she is able to evoke with ease, I wished she had been the writing instructor I never had. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2019","Dec 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/249363.Faithless

It takes a lot of energy to dive into these books that don’t translate well in English, where the style is archaic and even amateurish by today’s standards, and, being in the Realist style, where nothing much happens other than for a lot of talk that highlights the pre-occupations of the age.Arkady is a recent university graduate returning to his widowed father Nikolai’s farm home with his friend and mentor, Bazarov, a doctor and a nihilist. Arkady ascribes to nihilism too, as in the complete annihilation of czarist society, but is more of a blind follower of Bazarov rather than an activist with the strength of conviction. Arkady represents weakness, while Bazarov represents strength and is a precursor of the Bolshevik revolution to come. It is a time of reform when landowners are forced to “share the land” with their serfs in exchange for rent. The serfs however have not risen to the equality bestowed upon them and are content to fritter their money away on booze. As Bazarov observes, “I have looked at all your father’s establishment. The cattle are inferior, the horses are broken down; the buildings aren’t up to much, and the workmen look confirmed loafers; while the superintendent is either a fool, or a knave, I haven’t quite found out which yet.” Nikolai has taken in a destitute young woman, Fenitchka, as a ward, but has given her child in the process. Completing the dysfunctional farm is Uncle Pavel, a solitary bachelor, who “is entering upon that indefinite twilight period of regrets that are akin to hopes, and hopes that are akin to regrets, when youth is over, while old age has not yet come.” Pavel fell in love with a princess once who broke his heart and ditched him; he has retired to Nicolai’s farm, adopted English manners and clothing and stands up for the peasants, while supporting his brother financially. Brother Pavel has the hots for Fenitchka too!The two nihilists carry the story by travelling between their parents’ farms and the manor home of a wealthy widow, Madame Odintsov and her unmarried younger sister Katya. Turgenev thereby opens us up to the lifestyles of the Russian landed gentry who seem to spend their time visiting each other unannounced and spending long periods during those visits, taking long walks, having long intellectual and political discussions, and reading books in quiet niches of their vast properties. They also feel inferior to their counterparts in England and France, for they adopt many English and French affectations. Through the peregrinations of our nihilist duo, we see a pairing off between Arkady and Katya, and Bazarov and Madame Odintsov. The younger couple give into love and Arkady’s unformed nihilist tendencies fly out the door. Bazarov falls passionately for Madame Odintsov and expresses it as strongly he does his nihilist views, yet the widow is a rather shallow person—in her own words: “I am unhappy because... I have no desires, no passion for life. I love what you call comfort, and at the same time I have little desire to live,” and she is unable to reciprocate his passion.Bazarov is a restless soul, wanting to change the world, wanting to love—he even makes a pass at Fenitchka that lands him in a duel with Pavel who represents the established order and who despises all that Bazarov stands for. When love is not reciprocated, Bazarov returns like the proverbial prodigal son to his family farm (better managed than Arkady’s), where he is greeted with warmth and affection by his parents. There he practices as a district doctor until he contracts typhus. The climax of the novel comes when Madam Odinsov visits the sick Bazarov, and both come to realize the depth (or shallowness) of their emotions and the limitations of their idealism.Turgenev sums up for us in the last chapter and tells us where each of the characters will land up over time, and this telling, apart from other “old fashioned” novelistic devices—intrusive omniscient narrator, commentary by author to the reader, granular and catalogued descriptions of characters that fill entire paragraphs—make for laboured reading. In addition, this edition also has several typos and clearly lacked a proof reader.The moral of the story seems to be that idealism ultimately succumbs to love, and although we may want to change the world, the world may not want to change. As for the Fathers and Sons as mentioned in the title, the fathers come across as loving and vulnerable, beaten down by time and circumstance; the sons are idealistic and cold until love whacks them on the head, for better or worse....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2019","Nov 17, 2019",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19117.Fathers_and_Sons

Maugham was noted for being told stories by people he met at random that he later turned into profitable novels, short stories and plays, but if this story was told to him, as he claims in the opening chapter, with not a single embellishment on his part, he must have been the Father Confessor of his era, or a damned good liar.The premise of battle-scarred veterans coming out of WWI and looking for something more than just the material pursuits and indulgences of the post-war restoration era is a good one, although dated, for we have had so many movements prior to and since WWI that have gone looking for similar “back to basics” approaches in the face of unbridled capitalism and greed: hippies, communists, greens, off-grids, protestants, and evangelicals, to name a few. In this instance, our hero Larry, an airman who escaped death during a sortie, returns home to Chicago and decides to “loaf” around the world trying to figure out the difference between good and evil, while his childhood sweetheart, Isabel, a rather shallow materialistic girl, waits for him to come to his senses, get a job, marry her and raise a family, and do all the things that “normal” people do, like play golf, tennis and bridge, and go to parties. Isabel’s wealthy uncle Elliot is the epitome of shallowness; he’s an art dealer to the wealthy, lives in Paris and the Riviera, and thrives on attending and organizing parties where he trades on gossip and knows everyone of influence, including Maugham, whom he takes into his confidence and into his extended family circle. Elliot’s dream is that he be buried in the clothes of his ancestor, an Italian count, whose title has been bestowed on him by a grateful Catholic Church because Elliot built and tastefully decorated a church at his expense. Larry’s opposite number is his friend Gray Maturin, tall, good natured, whose career is assured in his father’s stock brokerage firm. At a time when untold millions are to made by anyone investing in America, it is of great consternation to everyone, including Gray, to see Larry continually rejecting employment in favour of leading the contemplative life.Isabel ultimately marries Gray after Larry breaks off their engagement because he is unwilling to follow the prevailing ethic that a man must work in order to be counted. Larry goes off to experience life as a humble miner, then onto Europe as a sailor, by which occupation he ultimately winds up in India to learn the art of hypnosis and study reincarnation. Yet he is unable to fully buy into the concept of the transmigration of souls and he reconciles to the fact that good can only exist in the face of its opposite, evil, to give each other definition. He helps desperate women such as the prostitute Suzanne (a friend of Maugham’s) and the self-destructive Sophie (a friend of Isabel’s) to turn their lives around by having them live with him and renounce alcohol, drugs and promiscuity; he even promises to marry Sophie. He helps Gray from crippling headaches brought about by depression. And yet Larry’s ascetic lifestyle is not for all, and few stay converted for long. The stock market crashes, Gray’s firm is bankrupted and the destitute Maturin family is given a home in Elliott’s Paris apartment while Gray recovers from a nervous breakdown. Elliott ages and is no longer invited to parties on the Riviera, and Maugham finally sees his wealthy friend for what he is: a racist who dislikes Jews, who mourns the decline of the aristocracy and the expansion of the middle class, who is a bore, a snob and a scandalmonger. And so we see the inversion of the wealthy and privileged who become silly, useless and trivial, while the “loafer” Larry emerges as a force for good. There is a one chapter that narrator Maugham tells us is not material to this story, and yet it contains the crux of the underlying philosophy upon which this book is based, and it amounts to a lengthy discussion between Maugham and Larry on the outcome of the latter’s quest for enlightenment. I found this chapter insightful, for although it is a bit dated in today’s context and is more Socratic than novelistic in its treatment, it surfaces the rot that will lead to the next fall of western civilization. Maugham then adds a bit of a whodunit to spice up the ending when he and Larry go in the search of answers to the tragic life and death of Sophie.And talking of dated, one has to realize that this book was written almost a century ago, and archaic words like “gay” (for “happy”), “delayed shock” (for PTSD) pepper the narrative. That Maugham was not a literary writer but a great raconteur, a short story and travel writer, is clear, for in-between the main narrative he digresses to give us descriptions of the seamy side of Paris and the characters that people its streets, the cafes and whorehouses, as well as the pompous lives of the rich and famous of the Riviera where he lived for many years.This is not my favourite Maugham book, but considering the issues existing at the time which this novel bravely tackles, I can imagine its impact on his readership on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first released.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Nov 08, 2019","Nov 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31196.The_Razor_s_Edge

To discover the pure teaching, we need to go back to the master and his message, which, having taken place at a time where only the oral tradition prevailed, is bound to be wrapped, interpreted and changed through the fallible lenses of his disciples and followers.

He cooks, swims and writes in his diary, but he writes about everything else but the memoir on Clement, although he makes many false starts in that area. Then a series of people from his past life in London start showing up on the doorstep, to stay with him, argue with him, haunt him, taunt him and live off his largesse. There is Lizzie, a forty something actress and former lover, who is still very much in love with Charles, and her gay roomie, Gilbert; the wicked temptress Rosina and her drunkard ex-husband Peregrine (Charles stole Rosina from Peregrine long ago but they are still good friends); James, Charles’ rich and celebrated cousin who is a general in the army and a Buddhist with a passion for Tibet; Hartley, Charles’s first and unrequited love, and her bullying husband Ben; and Titus, the adopted son of Hartley and Ben, whom Charles would like to adopt.In a sudden, irrational desire to relive and put right his aborted prior relationship with Hartley, Charles kidnaps her and holds her prisoner in his house, much to the chagrin of his houseguests. The stakes ratchet up and people are mysteriously pushed into the sea, others drown, and those least suspected confess to the crimes. In between, Murdoch slips into her preferred mode as philosopher over author, and, using James the Buddhist, spouts off pearls of wisdom for the reader and for the hapless Charles. Some interesting lines caught my attention:“Emotions lie at the top or bottom of personality. In the middle, they are acted. That is why all the world’s a stage.”“Every persistent marriage is based on fear.”“White magic is black magic. A less-than perfect meddling in the spirit world can create demons for others.”“Leave the past in the past. It cannot be recreated.”The last statement is the moral of the story, for Hartley is no longer the youthful beauty of Charles’ youth; she is now a frumpy, indecisive, fear- ridden old woman, whom Charles woos with desperate entreaties that border on the ridiculous. Through his insane love for her, Charles also comes across as selfish, conniving, jealous and possessive. He likes the chase, but loses interest after the conquest. The relationships between the houseguests and Charles are like the effervescence of soda bottles: bubbling with warmth and caring one moment, flat and tepid the next. Charles is eventually brought to his senses by James that kidnapping a woman who is wedded to her husband through a combination of fear and bullying is not going to work, and Charles is forced to reverse plans.After this tempest blows over and tragedy has struck the house by the sea, the remaining characters pair off and leave to form other ventures and associations, some in remote parts of the world. Charles is left alone, back where he started, with questions such as his relationship with Hartley and James answered, but with many more new questions stemming from what has transpired at the house by the sea, and he is forever to be preoccupied by them. And, alas, the memoir of Clement is never written. Yet, Murdoch is able to use the goings on in the house to surface questions on moral philosophy, and use the setting of the sea as a metaphor for the turbulence within Charles—at times he is in harmony especially when left alone, at others he is whipped into a storm of passion and rage by Hartley and Ben, or one of guilt by Toby, or one of jealousy by Lizzie and James. Magic intrudes in the forms of imaginary sea monsters that Charles sees on the eve of catastrophic events taking place, and James’ mastery of the dark arts provides for some interesting twists in the tale. Although this book won the Booker, it is not my best Murdoch novel, for I found the relationships of the characters rather superficial, unless that was the author’s intention when depicting theatrical types. The actions of the characters were also contrived: people show up when a character is needed and then leave just as casually. The foreshadowing is crude: Charles simply tells you that something is going to happen, and then it does. There was also a lot of overwriting: Charles’s never-ending mental gymnastics when he puzzles over things can be irritating, and I kept skipping. The saving grace is the dialogue, which is funny and eccentrically British.I guess for the Murdoch-aholic, this will be an essential read, for this novel is recorded as one of her defining works. I beg to differ.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Oct 28, 2019","Oct 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11229.The_Sea_the_Sea

And in typical Hemingway-esque style, when her journalistic powers waned due to age and illness, she popped herself off with a cyanide capsule. This book covers six trips that didn’t go as smoothly, but then one wonders, whether they were of her making...Her first “disaster” trip is to China in 1941 with a companion called UC (Unwilling Companion) whom we soon discover is none other than Hemingway, aboard planes that deliver freshly minted money in the millions to General Chiang Kai Shek’s Republic of China in its battle against the invading Japanese. She admits to being contemptible when it comes to condemning the impoverished Chinese way of life. She is particularly allergic to hawking, scraping throats, and spitting, and to “night soil” which is human excrement, the national manure. Unusual situations abound: UC drinks his Chinese colleagues under the table (at breakfast!) and gets on the boat by lunchtime; there are dead snakes in the wine jug, only discovered when pouring out the dregs, and the Japanese use the walled city of Kunming for bombing practice, hitting it daily.Her next journey is to the Caribbean to spot German U boats. She charters a local sailing boat in the middle of hurricane season for the purpose, visiting St. Bart’s, St. Maarten, Sabah, the Virgin Islands and Antigua. “On St. Bart's I met the schoolteacher, a middle-aged Frenchman married to an island black. He wasn’t bubbling over either, and talked about the mistake of marrying a black woman; you sank into their slovenly customs, and fathered litters of noisy stupid half-breed kids.” Her biting criticism of people not of her kind will qualify her as a racist today. Later, in Africa, on another trip, she feels ashamed when she starts to smell like the blacks after a leper celebration. She is convinced that although we are all of one genus, we are not of one species. The difference between black and white, foreigner and local, colonial and colonized, journalist/explorer and guide, help to maintain distance as she travels alone with teams of local men, on storm-wracked seas, through jungles and muddy rivers, and stays in flea-ridden hostels in derelict cities. There is also hubris: she has the balls to tell the townfolk in one place to release the woman whose screams she overhears. Her conclusion on the Caribbean is that the Dutch ran the best colonial shop down there.Her next trip is across equatorial Africa in 1962, from Cameroun to Kenya, via Chad, Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania, travelling part of the way with a thoroughly inept guide/driver named Joshua who can neither guide nor drive, leaving Gellhorn to do all the heavy lifting. She observes the unmanageable diversity: Cameroun alone has 200 tribes and 122 dialects, Uganda has 40 tribes. In Kenya, she observes, “The social structure was clear at once: Europeans, Asians, Africans (‘black’ being abusive here); First, Second and Third Class citizens. Perhaps, I felt the supremacy of white skin in this British colony with more force because I had just arrived from independent African states where white skin was carefully unassertive.” On democracy in Africa, her prophecy is, “I think all these countries will have one election, supervised by the retiring colonial power, and that the President then elected will stay in for life, unless (until?) there’s a palace putsch or assassination; and I do not see how it could be otherwise.” How prescient!She travels to Moscow in her 60’s to meet an unknown, ailing female writer whose husband was executed as a traitor for writing four lines of anti-Stalin poetry. Gellhorn frequents the salon run by the Russian writer, meets intellectuals, dissidents and other artists, and treats them to imported goods from the west. Her view on Russia is dim: “Main sensation is pure Big Brother fear. The fear (based on facts and fed by everyone’s imagination) serves the regime – keeps the people silent and in line. If the rulers ever released the people from fear, it could be a great nation. But then, released from fear, the people might string up the rulers on the nearest lampposts.”Her final journey is to Israel, where she stays in a settlement with young foreigners who are taking a vacation from the rat race. “Books were either non-existent or a hidden vice. No one expressed any interest in man-made beauty; art and architecture were for old squares. They littered the landscape (superb landscape) while condemning Israelis for doing the same.”Although supposed to be writing for Colliers during her travels, I wondered, given the connections she had with the authorities, and its underlying tacit understanding, whether she was safe wherever she went....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Oct 16, 2019","Oct 16, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20667456-travels-with-myself-and-another

It's an unwashed and honest account of an immigrant's struggle in China and Canada, one that eventually led to success, despite the obstacles, and which has now left him in a good place in life as he enters his eighties.Of particular interest to me were the horrors of the Japanese invasion of China in 1941, and the civil war between the Communists and the Nationalists in China after WWII ended, narrated from a Chinese perspective. Alan Joe was caught up in both these conflicts and miraculously survived. The patriarchal Chinese society, where men can take multiple wives, even abandoning them when war threatened, and yet be considered honorable men was an eye opener to me. The dream of a Chinese man in the middle of the 20th century was to ""sojourn"" in a more prosperous country for their entire working lives, most often without their families, and retire back home after having made enough money. Alan breaks that stereotype by coming to Canada, educating himself here, building a career in dentistry, starting a family and planting firm roots in his adopted home. His love for his long-suffering mother is exemplary and is a force that drives him to succeed.Being an immigrant myself who came here from a similar war-torn country, this book was strangely re-assuring, for it made me examine my own life and determine that, as the song goes, ""Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could.

However, is this a cold-war spy story, or an autobiographical slice of McEwan’s coming of age as a writer in the ‘70’s, is it a love story, or a Bildungsroman of the narrator Serena Frome (pronounced like plume)? The book has a long set-up, as we find out about narrator Serena Frome and the circumstances that lead to her being recruited by MI5 for this operation. An attractive daughter of a bishop, in love with an older man, Tony, who dumps her unceremoniously, Serena possesses a literary bent but is pressured into studying mathematics at university. Now she is looking for the next best thing. At page 86, we get to the heart of the matter: Operation Sweet Tooth is explained. And that is for Serena to act as a runner for right-leaning, emerging writer Tom Haley, who is completing his PhD at the University of Sussex (McEwan’s alma mater) and thus far known only for his short stories and essays. She poses as a representative of an arts funding organization and offers Haley a pension in exchange for devoting his life to writing, in the hope that his output will severely condemn the Communist way of life. A key term in the arrangement is that the funding organization would stay clear of dictating what the writer creates, yet the tacit implication is that by choosing Sweet Tooth candidates wisely, the writer’s output would always favour liberal democracy. In the process we are let onto the secret that possibly George Orwell and Theodore Dreiser were also funded by the Secret Service to make their books into bestsellers—fact or fiction? You decide.Haley’s maiden output, a novella, ends up being anything but a condemnation of Communism and is an embarrassment for his handlers. His short stories, however, which Serena reads to us as a proxy, keep moving in a predictable direction: a man, the protagonist, hopelessly drawn to flawed and dangerous women. Serena finds herself falling in love with Haley, and is soon breaking all the rules of client-sponsor protocol. But this is the ‘70’s when Britain is on the edge of collapse: labour unrest, the IRA, Vietnam, the Middle East oil crisis. It is also a time when women are at the lowest rung of the corporate ladder and are expected to stay there, especially at MI5. Therefore, sexual indiscretions are allowed, as are office romances, as we discover, between Max and Serena before Haley comes along, and smear campaigns when Max is rebuked by Serena in the post-Haley world.The crippling doubt that Serena has to contend with is not having told Haley that she had befriended him under false pretences, and that she is a secret agent. But that is not the only deception we find out, for everyone is into the same game of cheating, concealing, lying—espionage has crept into normal life. Even the author McEwan is not absolved from this deception, for in the final chapter, the tables turn, and Haley decides to make this his novel and not Serena’s, and a lot of loose ends get answered, some in more detail than warranted. I was engaged more by the life of Haley as an emerging writer—and I am sure that McEwan drew heavily from his own experiences for this—than in the Serena story, and I wished the author had written this novel from Haley’s point of view, thus severely shortening or totally eliminating the unnecessary 86 opening pages. I also wished that this heavily “told” story from Serena’s point of view had been animated with more dialogue, a feature that seems to be missing in most McEwan novels.This isn’t my favourite Ian McEwan novel, but it is a good inflection point in his trajectory as a writer....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 02, 2019","Oct 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13562049-sweet-tooth

Sarah Wode-Douglass, editor of a prestigious British literary magazine, accompanies her late mother’s former lover, John Slater, himself a celebrated poet, to Malaysia, to come to terms with their relationship that has gone downhill ever since Sarah’s mother committed suicide in a public and gruesome way when Sarah was a child. In Malaysia, they encounter Christopher Chubb, creator of the mythical poet, McCorcle, whose work is supposed to be one of genius, and who got former editor Weiss into trouble on an obscenity charge from which the only escape seemed to be suicide. Are you reasonably confused? Good. It gets worse. McCorcle comes to life during the obscenity trial, hurling insults at Chubb and Weiss across the court until he is escorted out. From that day forth, McCorcle becomes Chubb’s nemesis, kidnapping his daughter, Tina, and destroying Chubb’s literary reputation. Given Slater’s involvement with Chubb’s girlfriend at the time, we are not sure whether he is actually Tina’s father. All this is revealed when Chubb is intent on telling Sarah his story, and Slater is keen to prevent that from happening. For her part, Sarah is only interested in getting her hands on McCorcle’s poetry so she can publish it and save her magazine from the penurious state it is in.In the telling, and this is a very “told” story, we get vivid descriptions of cultural and historical life in a Malaysia heading towards independence from Britain. The violence exacted on the locals during their brief occupation by the Japanese during World War II is barbarically described by Chubb, as are the local arts of poisoning and decapitation of enemies, and the conduct of local rajas and Kaya Kayas who run their little fiefdoms under British rule. The absence of quote marks and punctuation in the novel made me often wonder who the “I” was. After awhile, I didn’t care, for clarity would eventually emerge from the muddle. And this was my beef - i.e. with Carey’s chosen format. My belief that punctuation was invented to make it easier on the reader was re-affirmed while reading this book. Sure, creative writers often use different variations on the form, they even invent newer forms to replace the old as part of evolving the novel; but sometimes these inventions fail, and I think in this case, it failed. Writing should be invisible and should not distract the reader from the story, and I was often distracted. The writing, when presented this way, also lost its elegance. The characters are by far the best and most descriptive: Chubb with his leg sores and crumbling suit; McCorckle, the violent giant who is ever-so-gentle towards the kidnapped Tina; Slater who materializes from thin air whenever Sarah is about to interview Chubb; Tina covered with scars; Mulaha, the Jaffna Tamil, who has a poison for every situation; and Sarah herself, whose sexual ambiguity is revealed only midway.The idea that one’s creation can come back to haunt you, is a good one, like the Frankenstein monster, or Gregor Samsa’s giant insect. This conception poses many questions, though. Is McCorcle Chubb’s soul, as it is implied? Is Chubb himself a ghost, a hantu? Does the soul outlive the person, as we see with McCorcle’s work? Is the soul outside of the person, as we see with Chubb and McCorckle being separate and distinct? Is the soul purer than the person? These questions are left when we finish the book. I’m sure every reader will form his or her opinion on it, and from that standpoint this is a book that does not end with its reading. In an era when fake news takes on a life similar to the real news, we wonder whether Carey is taking us into a twilight zone, or pointing to the real world and saying, “Go find your own McCorcle — he is out there.” (Perhaps, I should have removed the quote marks!) ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2019","Sep 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/111102.My_Life_as_a_Fake

When magic realism creates a fusion between reality and fiction, intereA parody of contemporary life in America modelled on the story of Don Quixote. When magic realism creates a fusion between reality and fiction, interesting truths are revealed, while some questions remain unanswered and are left to the imagination of the reader.Sam de Champ (also known as Brother) is a mediocre spy novel writer. Breaking from the genre, he embarks on his masterpiece, a novel called Quichotte, based on the travels of a retired pharmaceuticals salesman across America, with his imaginary son, Sancho, to meet with the love of his life, Salma R., a celebrated TV talk show host who revels in unearthing queasy human interest issues. Quichotte is a proxy for Sam; they are both of Indian origin (as is Salma R), they come from dysfunctional families, are estranged from a son and sister, and this is their last gasps at immortality: love for Quichotte at the end of his trip and recognition for Sam at the end of this book. Quichotte is also media obsessed, spending most of his time in hotel rooms, devouring TV.The parallel stories of these two characters interweave as Quichote crosses his seven mythical valleys, heading from west coast to east to meet with Salma, who is a secret drug addict, given that she is bipolar but needs to be always “on” in order to perform on her show. The parallel with Oprah is strong here, but is deflected conveniently when Salma’s show is rated as the “second best talk show in America,” next to Oprah’s. Salma’s sort-of-boyfriend and protector is Andersen Thayer (do I need to spell out the real-life equivalent?). And there are bad guys (also of Indian origin): Dr. Smile, the millionaire pharmaceuticals magnate who is distributing unwarranted opioids through a network of unscrupulous doctors; Evel Cent (real life equivalent needed or not?), the millionaire scientist who is creating a parallel Earth for those who can afford it to escape when our dying planet implodes from stupidity, ignorance and bigotry, and when the masses start turning into mastodons. When Dr. Smile employs Quichotte as his mule to carry a super dose of the deadly opioid InSmile to Salma, the stage is set for a meeting of the ill-fated lovers.What ails America today is on parodic display: the opioid crisis, racism, active shooters, gender confusion, political polarization, spy networks, hacking, fake news, media obsession, the blending of the real with the unreal in our entertainment culture, the disappearance of cursive writing, and the inability to spell correctly. While Rushdie’s humour softens the blows, it is difficult to ignore his sarcastic dissecting of all streams of society. By having his characters come from an Indian background, he sticks close to his voice and worldview, and also suggests that Indian immigrants have contributed much to America, but aren’t recognized for their efforts. Through Quichotte’s odyssey, he invokes other classic search literature: Jason, Sir Galahad, the Pilgrims, Dante, Rama et al. There is however a lot of overwriting and there are places when the action seems to be spinning in the same place, or looking for a way to launch the next plot point.Seeking forgiveness, and receiving it, is the key to releasing Sam and Quichotte from their entrapped worlds. Approaching death is also a catalyst for forgiveness. And when forgiveness ultimately takes place, Quichotte is free to proceed with meeting his beloved, while Sam is able to make the reverse journey with his son from east coast to west, retracing his fictional character’s footsteps. After the bad guys get their come-uppance (just like in a TV show) the fictional and real worlds merge in a dramatic finale, that left me with questions. I’m sure Rushdie wanted it to be so. Questionable endings make for good literature and become talking points on the cocktail circuit.This is not my favourite Rushdie book, for I think he tried to tackle all the ills that plague America and spread himself too thin in the process. I preferred his previous attempt at portraying dysfunctional America in The Golden House, for he picked a few themes and executed them very well....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 08, 2020","Sep 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43811212-quichotte

Literary greatness eluded MaughA novel of ironies and social commentary by an immensely popular writer who never quite achieved literary recognition. Literary greatness eluded Maugham for he was more intent on storytelling than in form, style and grand theme, his hunting ground being the lives of British colonials stranded in outposts of the once great Empire on which the sun never set. His is a gentler treatment of these lost souls, without the grittiness of an Orwell.Kitty is a cheating wife, who has had an affair with a diplomat, Charles. Her jealous and withdrawn bacteriologist husband, Walter, finds out and takes her from their home in Hong Kong into the interior of China to help quell a cholera epidemic, with the intention that she will contract the disease and die for her treachery. Kitty never loved Walter, and considered him a bore; she married him in desperation as she felt she was headed for spinsterhood, and because her younger sister had managed to snag a husband before her. She admits that she is trivial and sees only the superficial in others - “just pretty and gay,” in her words. She is racist and sees the Chinese children as ugly. The British men too are superficial and are merely “fond” of their wives, but below the surface of their elegant manners lie seething emotions. The power of the institution of marriage being so crucial for the stability of society and the empire makes people live fake lives.In the cholera-ridden station, Kitty comes into contact with a group of French nuns who have stayed on to combat the epidemic. They too are dying from the disease and have given up the thought of ever returning to France. The Mother Superior has a profound influence on Kitty who finds purpose to her life in helping the nuns and glimpsing into their lives, while Walter works demonically to help quell the outbreak and is considered a hero by the community. Suffering the cold silences of her husband, Kitty befriends Waddington, a customs agent who has also stayed behind. They take walks around the walled and diseased city and talk, and Kitty tries to rationalize her wayward life with his help. Waddington is a colonial relic himself, having picked up a local woman as his mistress. When tragedy strikes, a pregnant Kitty has to give up her work at the cloister and return to Hong Kong where Charles and his wife, Dorothy, put her up, and where Charles shamelessly seduces her again. Detesting her weak moral character, and realizing that her experiences in China had also been superficial, Kitty returns to England and plots the next phase of her life with the help of her now-widowed father.There are several ironies: Walter exposed Kitty to cholera in the hope that it would kill her - it did the opposite; Kitty thinks Charles will divorce his wife for her - he doesn’t; Kitty’s father was bored with his family, and Kitty ended up being bored with her husband; Kitty’s mother kept pushing her laid-back, henpecked husband to climb the colonial career ladder - he received his promotion just after she died; Kitty tries to avoid Charles after their affair was discovered, only to land back in his clutches upon her return to Hong Kong.The writing is in very short chapters, some as long as only a single page, so there is a cinematic feel to the book - no wonder it was made into a movie, three times. The dramatic arc of the novel weakened after Kitty returned to Hong Kong, and I wondered where the book was going after that. Where it ended up was dubious and less satisfying than the impressive premise it began with. I was left with the impression that Maugham was a better short story writer than a novelist. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Aug 31, 2019","Aug 31, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99664.The_Painted_Veil

The Court and Abbey have an additional separation by an artificial lake in between them. The transition from outside world to the Court and then to the Abbey is symbolic of a progressive journey deeper into the spiritual life, and only the beautiful and neurotic Catherine is expected to make the complete journey through all three zones. The conceit of a group of people voluntarily cut away from the world and wrestling with their human frailties and moral dilemmas is ripe with conflicts that normal lay people may never encounter.Conflict from the outside world comes to Imber Court in the way of Dora, a transgressive housewife, who has no intention for, or concept of, the moral life, who has left her academic, bullying, and control-freak husband, Paul, only to return to him because she knows that she may just end up in another affair by being on the loose. Paul is living at the Court and working at the Abbey on some 14th century manuscripts. A host of other characters populate the Court, and Murdoch displays some amateurish novel writing when she introduces them like a reception line-up:‘This is Peter Topglass,’ said Mrs Mark. A tall baldish man with spectacles swayed in a bow to Dora. ‘And this is Michael Meade, our leader.’ A long-nosed man with pale floppy brown hair and blue eyes set too close together smiled a rather tired and anxious smile. ‘And this is Mark Strafford (Mrs. Marks' husband), with the beaver.’ A large man with bushy hair and a ginger beard and a slightly sarcastic expression came forward to nod to Dora. He smelt strongly of disinfectant. ‘And this is Patchway, who is a tower of strength to us in the market-garden.’ A dirty-looking man with a decrepit hat on, who looked as if he did not belong and was indifferent to not belonging, gazed morosely at Dora. ‘And this is Father Bob Joyce, our Father Confessor.’ The cassocked priest who had just come into the room bustled up to shake Dora’s hand. Rounding the cast of characters are deputy head James Tayper Pace, who shares a different philosophy than Michael, and budding Oxford student Toby Gashe who has come to Imber to get a dose of the spiritual life. The villain of the piece is Nick, Catherine’s twin brother, mercurial and alcoholic, who had a homosexual affair with Michael fourteen years ago and railroaded the leader’s plan to become a priest by ratting on him. And yet, many of these characters come across as caricatures, casting only their positional markers on the page. It is with the three POV characters, Dora, Michael and Toby, that we get to plumb at a deeper level of motivation and moral conjecturing.There is an element of magic and superstition in the novel, which seems to dog Murdoch’s works, not forgetting the obvious moral philosophizing that goes on ad nauseum. The superstition is bound up with the curse of the old bell that is supposed to have toppled off its tower in the Abbey and sunk into the lake when a nun transgressed and took a lover. Disturbing the old bell from its watery grave is supposed to cause a death in the community. The old bell is therefore to be replaced with new one in a consecration ceremony conducted by the Bishop, after which the replacement would be rolled over the causeway from Court to Abbey, just like a new nun would enter the cloister, just like Catherine is due to do shortly. But Dora, who has spent most of her life in small flats and rooms, is getting bored with the ordered life at Imber Court, and having discovered the location of the submerged bell, conspires with her willing acolyte and love-struck Toby to switch bells and perform a miracle just to spice up the dull old place. The bell serves as both a metaphor for buried secrets that are best left alone and as a catalyst for a series of farcical incidents that trigger the simmering tensions within the residents of Imber Court and bring them to the boil, spelling the end for this fragile community. In fact, metaphors abound; the reader is left to puzzle over the butterfly in the train carriage, the lost luggage, the lost shoes, and the causeway among others. The tensions are mainly of a sexual nature, or more pointedly, occur where sex conflicts with morality. Even though the sex amounts to nothing more than hand-holding, cuddling and kissing, the implications of those actions to this community that seems to have renounced the world and bound itself by conventional roles, is staggering. The philosophy is worth mentioning. James Tayper Pace is a traditionalist and believes in innocence over experience: “obey the rules.” Michael, battling with his homosexuality, believes in knowing one’s capabilities (and fallibilities) and in not over-reaching them. Nick believes that a good man should recognize sin in himself and in others and be prepared to confess. It is the Abbess who has the most profound insight: ‘We can only learn to love by loving. Remember that all our failures are ultimately failures in love. Imperfect love must not be condemned and rejected, but made perfect. The way is always forward, never back.’ I suspect that Murdoch was expressing her viewpoint through the Abbess.This a very “told” novel in the firm hands of Murdoch. I had difficulty trying to figure out how “a narrow stare of anxious suspicion” could be shown. Words like “rebarbative” occur frequently. And we are left with a lot of loose ends, as the community dissolves and disperses. We never know who sabotaged the causeway, we never know whether Dora will ever get back with Paul, or whether, as she suspects, Michael will marry Catherine and have lots of kids. I believe that Murdoch was more interested in creating situations where moral dilemmas could be brought into focus and examined rather than in writing a novel where every loose thread is knotted in a bow, and where everyone lives happily ever after—in fact, except for the nuns in the cloister who come across as the most balanced, no one does. They all seem to disperse from Imber Court with a heavy bell of secrets tied around their necks....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2019","Aug 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11230.The_Bell

I picked up her autobiography the same day at the art gallery’s gift shop. Repetition and Multiplication is her approach, whether it be the mirror balls in the Infinity Room or the multitude of polka dots of her first exhibition in New York in 1959, or the profusion of penises that followed and send her down the road into the sexual revolution of the 60’s and ‘70’s.Kusama served her time as a starving artist in New York in her early years, living in a garret and eating potatoes, and all the while creating, creating, creating. From a young age she could see auras of individuals and heard the voices of animals and plants; she saw hallucinations of lights. Painting was born out of a fever of desperation to find a cure for her mental state. She had a morbid distaste for sex, given that her father was a prolific womanizer, and her mother forced her to follow him and find out what he was up to. “Create and Obliterate” became her mantra: create the very thing that revolted her, and create lots of it (hence the legion of penises), and thereby cut through the revulsion.Even though the book starts with her arrival and rough beginning in New York, Kusama reveals to us gradually that she was already an upcoming artist in Japan during her early twenties, and through a persistent correspondence with American artists and other financial benefactors, such as Georgia O’Keefe, she wound her way to New York in 1957, the place she had always wanted to be. Her first exhibition in the Big Apple two years later placed her on the road to success, from which she never deviated. Soon, she was exhibiting all over America and Europe, and later evolved into the Happening, a performance art piece performed in the open, where the actors would end up stripping naked and having sex while a fully clothed Kusama would paint polka dots on their bodies. This led to brushes with the law, for Kusama’s performance art skirted the borders of legal propriety even in the permissive west. Given the Vietnam war occurring at the time, flag and bible burnings were introduced into the act, and I wondered how she managed to keep her US visa from being cancelled. Unfazed, she ventured into other forms of art: publishing, theatre, fashion, clothing, and organized them along business lines. She is also liberal in sprinkling the narrative with the many kudos she received from prominent arts figures, that sometimes turns this book into a glory parade.Her ambivalence towards sex is interesting. She claims that inasmuch as she arranged orgies for both heterosexuals and homosexuals, she never participated in the act, her childhood fear and loathing of sex being so strong. Yet she had a lover in Joseph Cornell, the artist, who himself was a sexual cripple. Sex for them was getting naked and sketching each other; in their ten-year relationship they never had sex. Salvador Dali was another close friend.The last half of the book covers her return to Japan in 1973. Now famous and artistically developed, she sees how much Japan’s spirituality has been lost in its quest to become an economic superpower. Money was chasing culture, there was no investment in developing art, and Japanese artists disparaged each other, whereas elsewhere artists helped each other. Her Happenings got busted by the police in Japan. She dismisses her home country as a corrupt fourth-rate state where the patriarchy is firmly entrenched. And yet, when her mental illness began to overcome her, she permanently hospitalized herself in Japan in 1975, and has never left the hospital to this day. She built a studio in the hospital to continue her work and launched another phase of her career with single minded focus; she became a novelist, short story writer and poet (in Japanese) in addition to being an artist, and has won many Japanese awards.Today, she is a recluse from the art world, furiously creating at the age of 90, with the clock racing against her. Her new subject: death. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Aug 17, 2019","Aug 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11916354-infinity-net

I just finished reading Black Water, another Independence Day disaster novella, only to be confronted with Rape - a love story, that covers a gang rape in Niagara Falls, NY to round off the fireworks and alcohol consumption on the special day that celebrates American independence.Unlike Black Water, I didn’t skip pages here, for Rape - a love story, is a tight thriller, not only focussed on the victim’s plight but also on the outcome for her attackers when vigilante justice surfaces, a form of justice that seems more effective than the traditional courts, for offences such as rape are hard to prove without damaging the victims all over again.Teena Maguire, a 35-year old single mother and her 12-year old daughter, Berthie, are taking a short cut home after a Fourth of July party, when they are accosted by a local gang of no-gooders high on crack. Teena is dragged away to a neighboring boathouse, gang-raped, and left for dead, while her daughter hides in the vicinity. The damage to Teena is horrible—physical, mental and societal. She struggles to emerge from life support, is left with permanently damaged vision and other private body parts, breaks up with her boyfriend as she can’t stand being touched anymore, and self-medicates with alcohol, dreading having to appear as a witness at the upcoming court trial.The subsequent rape trial turns out to be a fiasco, where the defence attorney is able to wield the full force of American Justice and turn the tables around with a countercharge that Teena solicited the no-gooders for sex in exchange for money and then went crazy on them, leading to the violence by the men in self-defence. Public opinion sways from support for the attacked to the attackers. Berthie is ostracized at school as “the daughter of that tramp.” We are also introduced to Dromoor, an ex-soldier turned cop on the Niagara Falls Police Department, a family man with two small daughters, who is attracted to Teena, but knows he can never go beyond sharing a drink with her. Dromoor served in the Gulf-War where he killed many enemy fighters, before becoming a cop; he also killed a bad guy while he was a rookie on the NFPD, saving the life of a colleague—he is no stranger to death, and to killing. When he answers the rape call at the boathouse, he finds the damaged woman and her daughter, and decides he has to protect them. And so, one by one, the rapists start dying or disappearing.Oates skillfully delivers the narration in third and second person and simulates the voices of the many characters—victims and perpetrators alike—according to their educational and social levels. She focuses on the ugliness of rumour, the vindictiveness and meanness of small town society, and the perversions of justice that a democratic society provides for. She also takes the long view, by transporting us many years into the future to show us how the lives of the affected are transformed by this seminal incident, for the effects of rape are indeed life-long.The subject of rape is a difficult one to handle, and having it as the book’s title, and then subtitling it “a love story” leaves many questions in the reader’s mind. Is this irony, a joke, or deathly intentional? What I took from the novella was that while rape is not an expression of love in its act, it does bring out the expression of love from others, love that the victim never knew existed.

In the meantime, success had led to a profligate life of booze and sexual flings, and a job at the New Yorker, where he is paid a handsome $3000 for his first 1500 word story (boy, he doesn’t know how good he had it, based on today’s price for a story, if indeed there is one today!) Time gets crunched and convoluted, for his New Yorker colleagues number Updike and Salinger, who both last worked at the venerable magazine in the 1940’s and 50’s respectively, while this story is happening in the ‘90’s from what I can make of it. The editor is the legendary William Shawn, known for his staffing methods of keeping promising writers on payroll for decades while they produced zip for the magazine. The rag is also being run by the Mafia who claim they killed those innocent people in Kansas so that Capote could write his bestseller, and who run a critiquing racket that nets them $195.49 per critique (that racket still runs today, except that it is not run by the Mafia anymore). Larry falls into the dreaded Writer’s Block at the magazine when Shawn casually declaims that Larry’s writing is too self-conscious and “girlish.” In the meantime, Larry’s long suffering wife Iris, herself a fierce defender of the downtrodden, pursues her various socialist causes back in St. Paul, Minnesota, waiting for Larry to grow up and return home. In his blocked state, Larry discovers his true calling: working under the pseudonym of Mr. Blue and dolling out advice to troubled souls via an agony column in a St. Paul newspaper, as he hibernates in a New York apartment, drinks, and has sex with strays while waiting for the dreaded Block to clear. Very soon, formers lovers, friends, Iris, and even Larry himself start corresponding with Mr. Blue and receive replies! The correspondence of Mr. Blue comes to dominate the middle section of the novel, and Keillor cuts across middle class, Middle America, upending its neuroses that are usually hidden behind tranquilizers, church, booze and sex, all now revealed via Mr. Blue’s Happiness Quiz. Some people run their love lives with Mr. Blue as the fulcrum. Mr. Blue’s answers to the letters he receives convey the loneliness of the writer who sacrifices home to pursue fame in an impersonal city like New York. Then of course, we must have the traditional Gunfight at the OK Corral ending, a given in American Literature it seems, and Keillor plays it up for maximum effort: Larry takes on the mob to save the New Yorker from extinction. The last bit of the book however, drags, when Larry “grows up” and returns to St. Paul to win back Iris’ trust. This is a long drawn out affair, for although Larry and Iris go to community events together and even have sex regularly (better the known devil than the unknown one!), they live separately, and Trust Regained takes as long to arrive as Writer’s Block to leave. This is also the most tender part of the book.The humour however, is the best part, and Keillor flows with it: Larry describes himself alternatively as “Turgenev of the Tundra,” “Prairie Proust” and “Poor Man’s Maupassant”; Larry’s encounters with the nurse in the fertility clinic where he has to leave a “deposit” is hilarious; his verbal skirmishes with Mafia boss Crossandotti makes one squirm; and Larry landing in Alaska with Alana is mind bending. These are just a sampling of the outlandish situations in this book in which the prose brims with sarcastic wit.I think I will read more of Garrison Keillor. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 03, 2019","Aug 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/117955.Love_Me

By cleverly transporting the event to 1990 from 1969, Oates fictionalizes the real-life incident while retaining the moral, social and sexual issues that sprang from it.The action of the book circles around the “incident,” i.e. the accident when the Senator’s car went off the bridge into a muddy bog, drowning his female passenger, Kelly, as she is fictionally known. Narrated in Kelly’s voice, we see this incident in various replays from different angles, each version revealing some additional information on the victim, on the Senator (he is only known by this title and has no name), and on the Fourth of July party they were at where the spark of sin first ignited between them. He initiates the trespass by kissing her, and all resistance dissolves on her part. She is 26 and he is in his mid-fifties; she is as young as his own children; he is estranged from his wife; they both share a passion for social justice and are opposed to capital punishment and in favour of Medicare. Yet when it comes to survival, he kicks himself free of her and their watery grave, leaving her to embrace the empty possibility that he is in love with her and will soon return to rescue her. When he contacts friends back at the party from a pay phone, he has already given her up for dead and is already planning on how he will dodge this rap—so much for Social Justice, Medicare and Capital Punishment!The one weakness with this novella is that it is framed within the single automobile accident event, and therefore all of the characterization, setting, and story has to be situated within and around it. Quite a bit of the repetition could have been cut out (yeah, yeah, we got the accident down pat, yawn!), while narrowing this work down to a tighter and still insightful short story. If the repetition is intended to make it a mood piece on dying, or to instill the horror of infidelity upon us, then I guess it succeeds, but I’m sure the intelligent reader will skip ahead more than a few times.I have to chalk it up to yet another stylistic departure on the part of the author who demonstrates a wide range of styles in her rather bloated oeuvre. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2019","Jul 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15974.Black_Water

This is a incestuous and insular business and we have to be kind to everyone within it, goes the wisdom. However, Rupert Heath takes the gloves off and voices some truths we always suspected existed.Take, for example, advice like:1) Make multiple simultaneous submissions. It improves your odds.2) Offering a trilogy is okay.3) Self-publishing is the way of the future.And skeletons unloaded from the closet, like:1) A majority of agented submissions are rejected.2) Editors have no time to edit today. They are busy heeding the demands of marketing departments.3) Publishers are getting into fee-based writing courses - i.e. monetizing the slush pile.4) The majority of marketing funds are spent on retail merchandizing. The entrances of retail book stores are tranches of real estate.5) Launches and book parties are now thrown by the author.Reading this very short book, I realized that most aspiring authors are caught up in a publishing model that existed in the 1960s-80’s — a time when many of them came of age and were inspired to become writers. The writer of the 21st Century is a different beast. Even though pickings are slimmer today, and in order to earn a decent living we need other jobs to supplement our income, the professional commitment to writing has to be continuous and sustained over a long period of time. Heath cites Robyn Young’s Brethren trilogy, for which the author, neither a journalist or an academic, spent seven years studying its historical period, including the arts of falconry and horse riding, in order to render a sense of verisimilitude to her work. On the other hand, Heath points out to a notorious lack of knowledge in Frederick Forsyth’s Day of the Jackal, in how obtaining a false passport is described. I was however left with the question on Forsyth’s faux-pas: in today’s world of fake news, does anyone care?I wish this book had been longer and had exposed many more skeletons hidden in the slush pile. What Heath is alluding to, but never quite prescribes, is that for the vast majority of writers, the writing of books will remain an artisanal business: a limited run of books, most likely produced via POD technology or as e-books, distributed to a small circle of trusted readers from which they would grow outwards by engaging those readers on a one-to-one basis. Writing is an art, publishing is a business, and many of us will have to content ourselves with just the art side, if luck, circumstance or the odds don’t thrust us into the publishing side.I didn’t fall across any sex though, as alluded to in the title. Perhaps that was Heath’s marketing gambit. Sex sells, and that was what prompted me to buy this book in the first place, for I thought there would be scenes of bodice ripping and panting going on inside the hallowed halls of the publishing houses.

Or an immigrant story unravelling in the next Canadian-raised generation, as past mistakes are repeated in a more open society and the old ones are healed with acceptance. Combine them and you have an explosive mix.Tom Zondervan and Paul van Hoop are childhood friends, growing up in Canada and now entering their forties; their wives are also best friends. The two couples are members of the True Reformed Church, a splinter Calvinist group that immigrated from the Netherlands after WWII. The Canadian branch of this immigrant community is spiritually led by Rev. Arendt van Hoop, Paul’s father, a strict disciplinarian, bound by the rules of his faith, except when he makes compromises to suit his career aspirations, who is unable to show affection beyond his fiery pulpit oratory, and who is riddled with personal guilt and anger while nursing a dark secret. In fact, secrets abound. Elsa, Tom’s mother, has one. Tom and Paul’s wife, Maria, have one, Tom’s wife, Alyce, has one, Paul’s younger brother, Dan, has one, while Dan’s twin sister, Brenda, melts down under the strain of all these secrets. In fact, the inability of the family members to voice their secrets provides for much of the tension in this book, for the cast and the reader. And lest they amount to spoilers, I too will refrain from revealing these secrets here.The catalyst for the bursting of the dam of secrecy comes when Paul is seriously injured on a boating trip with Tom. Relationships start to fray and re-form differently, others that have simmered below the surface are given free reign, and the Reformist faith that held this group together starts to erode as new Canadian values such as abortion and gay rights gain ascendance while obedience, patriarchy, and the Church start to diminish in importance.Tom is the narrator. He is adrift due to the loss of his Christian faith. His guilt regarding the accident that imperilled Paul, his subsequent involvement with Maria, and his long-running ideological battle with Rev. van Hoop are the key drivers of this book. In many respects, Tom is a copy of Rev. van Hoop, guilty of the same errors of judgment, a generation apart. That said, Tom comes across as an introverted intellectual lost in the wrong career (we don’t really know what he does for a living, except that at one point he becomes a District Supervisor of some corporation but doesn’t seem to care much about what he does. I thought he would have been better cast as an academic, because he acts like one). However, Tom draws great character studies of others, by their gestures and statements, and through his acute observations of them. When he plays Big Brother to the younger Dan and Brenda, he comes across as preachy. Tom has great opportunities for putting his cards on the table with Rev. van Hoop but self-admittedly squanders them, and I wondered whether Hogeterp too squandered some opportunities for dramatic confrontation that could have moved this well-crafted plot up another notch? And why I say “well crafted” is because there is always some incident, entirely plausible and uncontrived, that flares up consistently and regularly to keep us turning pages. But when I say “squandered,” I ask why did scenes like the one in which Rev. van Hoop bursts into Dan’s affirmation ceremony end like it did, a non-event revealing only the old man’s mental deterioration? How does forgiveness come without the explosion of emotions that is necessary in literature. But no one bursts a blood vessel, everyone suffers inside, like polite Canadians, except for this reader who nearly blew an artery, shouting “more, more! Go for the jugular!” It was like watching the Toronto Maple Leafs charging an open net, unable to score, again! The healing, when it finally comes, only heals a few.All that said, this is a bold and sensitive exploration of tight-knit immigrant families and their loosening insularity upon arrival in the land of milk and honey that is the New World, and the resulting fallout that usually hurts the first arrivals most, for they have the most explaining to do and the most acceptance on their hands. They are the ones, like Elsa and Arendt, who pay the highest prices for their errors of judgement during acts committed in the old country, which in the next generation, and in the new morality, take on gargantuan consequences. And they have to accept this new morality that runs counter to everything they have been taught—the next generation expects this of them. We, or our antecedents who first immigrated, have had similar experiences, making this a topical tale of the Canadian mosaic.The prose is tight yet elegant and I put this down to Hogeterp being a good editor in his day job, although an additional proof reader may have helped. However, most of the conclusions are reached in Tom’s head, and I would have preferred if they had been revealed in action or dialogue with little or no narrator interference or explanation. Given the interiority of the scenes and the character focus, this book would also make for a good theatrical presentation. The constantly shifting plot kept me turning pages to find out more about these characters who are very easy to care about....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2019","Jul 09, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51023098-smitten

Having taught creative writing for 30 plus years, Johnson is able to dissect creative writing into its myriad forms (realism, naturalism, romanticism, modernism, post-modernism), and break it down into its elements (plot, character, voice, paragraph, sentence and word), and compare it to various branches of philosophy (existentialism, Buddhism). He posits that a well educated literature student’s arsenal should include a firm understanding of New Criticism, structuralism, feminism, deconstruction and race theory, but advises that in the process of creation, which is discovery, all theories and explanatory models should be set aside—I found the last part of this statement refreshing.He owes his success to mentor John Gardner who helped get his early work published and sponsored his employment as a university professor. Although he claims that childhood trauma creates good novelists, Johnson himself was an only child with a relatively stable childhood. He wrote six novels and turned down an early publication offer for one of them, as the seventh he was working on appeared to be of the calibre of a debut novel he could live with. A debut defines a writer’s career, Garner advised him. “If climbing past your debut is going to be difficult, don’t publish it.”The many pearls of wisdom spewed out were the most interesting for me to ponder, and I quote a few here:a) You extend the form only after you understand the formb) Hand-copying an established writer’s work will give you a sense of meter and rhythm.c) Publishing is an aristocracy. With digital publishing it has become a democracy.d) Education without imagination is empty, and imagination without education is blind. e) What makes a great writer is a great vision.f) Art is the community’s medicine for the worst disease of the mind, the corruption of consciousness.g) Event reveals character and character leads to event.h) Voice gives way to Viewpoint and ultimately to Character.There are many more third party quotes from Aristotle to Virginia Woolf that dot the book. Johnson is clear that even though he started out his literary life as a journalist and cartoonist, the writing of utilitarian prose (literary pork) is to be eschewed in favour of “words that are the flesh of thought,” i.e. well constructed and thoroughly revised literary language. “A literary work is a performance of language.” And yet, plot is important to him as well. He also devotes an entire chapter to opening lines, which are crucial to the success of a novel. Having only one literary hit over a body of work is okay to advance literary culture, he posits; doing it twice reveals a major literary talent; doing it three times vaults you into the ranks of Twain and Shakespeare.Much has been said about the self-adulation that goes on in this book, and although I found it only mildly distracting, I put it down to the earnestness of this consummate devotee of the art of writing who needs to establish his credentials with his reader and who also needs to show some of the benefits that have accrued to him over a life dedicated to this perilous profession, where one is only as good as one’s last book.

And yet he became the dissenting voice in a fading colonial empire beset by Fascism and Communism brGeorge Orwell was one heck of a miserable fellow. And yet he became the dissenting voice in a fading colonial empire beset by Fascism and Communism brewing on its doorstep, a voice that has presciently endured to this day.Empire was against young George from the outset. His father, a colonial officer in the Opium Department in British India, was focussed on selling the drug to China, resulting in two wars; his mother was the descendent of teak merchants in Burma where the locals were exploited; another relative was a slave owner in Jamaica. Orwell, chronically plagued by weak lungs, went to the right public schools: St. Cyprians “where snobbery, philistinism, homosexuality, racism and sadism were engendered” and Eton which was “a lukewarm bath in snobbery, although it helped shape character and individualism.” He followed his father into the colonial service by becoming an undistinguished policeman in Burma for five years on a good salary, only to give it up and end as a tramp in England and France, because he needed experience to fuel his art of writing political literature. Guilt was the reward for his colonial middle-class origins. His novel coming out of Burma, Burmese Days, has no redeeming characters in it, neither natives nor colonials.Orwell was a masochist and found contentment amidst squalor. Whether that was in bumming around London and Paris to prove the desirability and dignity of work, or descending into abandoned coal mines in Wigan to expose the evils of capitalism, or living in a dilapidated farm in Wallington “with infrequent bus service, water flooding the kitchen, backed up sewers, mice toppling the china, no electricity and irregular heating,” or living in bombed-out flats in London during the blitz to work for the Home Guard, or writing his masterpieces in Joura on the Hebrides in the most uninhabitable house on the British Isles that finally put him in hospital from whence he never returned, he relished discomfort and privation. “The progress of the artist is the continual extinction of personality.” He didn’t care for the wellbeing of his long suffering wife, Eileen, as long as he had the squalid space to do his work. When Eileen succumbed to a neglected cancer, Orwell was away reporting on the Continent.He was a vocal supporter of Socialism and a denouncer of its evil cousins, Communism, Fascism and Imperialism. He joined the Republicans in Spain to fight against Franco, but with the collapse of his side due to infighting with Stalin’s Communists, he was soon on the run for his life along with Eileen and a bullet wound in his neck as a “thank you” for participating. He took on prominent figures like H.G. Wells, Salvador Dali and Wyndham Lewis for their counter political views. His writing was criticised for not having the creativity of the true novelist and for being better suited for essays and reportage. His earlier books, dubbed novels, were political morality tales, and his best book (in his estimation) Homage to Catalonia sold only 600 copies; he voluntarily suppressed the reprinting of his second and third novels A Clergyman’s Daughter and Keep the Aspidistra Flying, as they were not up to snuff. But his last two novels, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four, launched him into superstar status, where he has been for over 75 years. In his later years, he also found steadier employment with the BBC, the Observer, and the Manchester Evening News, giving him conduits for his political writing. And yet he quit the BBC and modeled its puritanical culture at the time in Nineteen Eighty Four. A lanky, tall, man with a frail constitution, he had a poor self image, and often did not succeed with the women he pursued. Many refused to marry him or sleep with him. His deathbed, second marriage to Sonia Brownell, 18 years his junior, was a bit of a joke; she did not love him, was scared of sex although she had a myriad of affairs, was cold to his adopted son, Richard, and looked upon Orwell as a cause rather than a husband. The marriage was never consummated. Sonya went onto marry a homosexual (another unconsummated marriage), squander the Orwell estate over half-baked artistic projects, and end her days drunk and broke.This is a hard book to get through, not because it is poorly written (in fact, it is very well written, and Meyers covers a lot of material that seems to be well researched and cross referenced) but rather due to its wretched principal character, Orwell himself.He was the most enigmatic of writers, a saint to some, who lived and modeled his work. He sensed the cruel, the macabre and the disgusting, and loathed what was fake. He despised humanity and fought for ideas. He had a gentle temperament towards some and was cold to others (especially women); he displayed violence by kicking his servants in Burma, using his fists on his classmates, and caning his students, the last punishment being one meted out to Orwell himself as a child, especially when he wet his bed at St. Cyprians. Some of his terminology such as “Big Brother is watching,” “Some animals are more equal than others,” and words from a whole new language called “Newspeak” used in Nineteen Eighty Four have entered the vernacular. The word “Orwellian” alone spells dystopian disaster. His dire warnings and predictions have endured, most recently re-surfacing with the advent of Donald Trump and other tough-man leaders around the world, making Orwell a writer for the ages.Given Orwell’s stature, I guess reading at least one of his many biographies (there seems to be more written about him than by him) is a must for any ardent scholar of Literature. This book will keep you engaged, if you can put up with the squalor and the misery. “Orwell?

This collection of short stories uses an array of complex sentences built with an unusual syntax that doesn’t flow (well, at least for this reader), has sparse dialogue (some stories have none) and has the point of view of a scientist observing her lab rats under a microscope.The collection is a grab bag of subjects, with no unifying theme, probably written over a long period of time and for different audiences, given that they were all previously published in magazines from as diverse as the New Yorker to Harper’s Quarterly to Playboy. Let me try to summarize the stories:1) In the title story, in post-Apartheid South Africa, whites go to great lengths to establish even one-sixteenth black blood in their lineage, because that is the colour in vogue now. The white protagonist goes into the diamond fields of Kimberley to find his ounce, given that his great grandfather spent five years prospecting there without having sex - hard to believe! There had to be some black girls somewhere who made up for great-grandpa’s libidinal drought.2) The life-cycle of a tapeworm living on the body of a human, narrated by the worm. The symbiosis and co-dependence between the two is palpable.3) The author has a dinner date with the ghosts of Anthony Sampson, Edward Said, and Susan Sontag, and various intellectual discourse take place, Sontag even defends men against the women’s movement.4) A middle-aged Jewish flapper is transplanted into South Africa due to the Nazis in Germany. Her shallowness shields her from the tragedies befalling the Jews at the time.5) A writer’s pre-occupation with Kafka causes a mysterious roach to appear inside her typewriter.6) A business executive survives an aircraft’s emergency landing. The mysterious woman sitting next to him provides the answer.7) A young German wife goes to live with her new husband in South Africa. Exposed to African culture she realizes that not having had a past with him in this country is a serious deficiency.8) A grieving South African widow travels to London to meet her dead husband’s male lover. They spar over trying to claim his memory. She wants facts, he offers feelings.9) An ancient talking parrot observes life in a family owned French restaurant that has recently been sold to a German. The former owners are taking the parrot to live with them in retirement by the seaside. The parrot is not happy, and voices it.10) A child actress has to choose between her spellbindingly attractive birth father who is also an actor, and her rather dour but steadfast adoptive father who is a neurologist. Will nature win over nurture?12 The last story breaks out into three parts titled The First Sense, The Second Sense and The Third Sense. Each story has a husband and wife in its centre, but they all have different endings. As these three pieces were each originally published in different magazines, I suspect they were grouped together in this collection because they had a similar theme:(a) The First Sense features a PhD husband who emigrates from Eastern Europe and winds up as a dead-ending storeroom manager in South Africa, while his dressmaker wife goes onto become a wealthy jetsetter selling real estate in their new homeland.(b) The Second Sense features a talented cello player and his government employee wife. She pays the bills and keeps the home fires burning. His cello’s tunes signal what is right and wrong in their love life; it even tells of mistresses gained and lost.(c) The Third Sense teams up a domestic airline-owner husband and a university professor wife. The airline is heading for bankruptcy while the husband is having an affair.It is only in The First Sense that the actions of the couple lead to something concrete, while in the other two stories the conflicts remain as pre-occupations of the mind. So there you have it - a smorgasbord. Read it if you are willing to work at wrestling with the unusual form.

It is also an unflattering portrait of the artist as a young man, long before he reached immortal fame with his water lilies, when he struggled to feed a young family, and struggled to get the world to recognize his form of painting that went against the grain of the establishment at the time.The chapters are broken out in annual or biennial chunks, chronicling the significant events that took place in those time periods, and hence the novel has an episodic feel rather than a dramatic arc. Interspersed between the chapters at critical points are the reflections of an older Monet (circa 1909, at the age of 69) reflecting on his life with Camille and trying to come to terms with the loose ends left there. The writing is gentle, like the colours of Monet’s palette, even though the lives of artists of the nineteenth century were anything but gentle, despite many of them, Monet included, coming from middle class families and having the means of running back home to live with parents or of asking for family loans to tide them over the rougher patches.After an aborted military service in North Africa, due to illness, Monet, declines his father’s offer to take over the family’s ship chandler business in Le Havre and pursues his education in art in Paris. In the City of Light, he meets other budding artists—Manet, Cezanne, Pissaro, Renoir, Degas and Bazile—to form a breakout art form from the traditional, soon to be known as Impressionism, consisting of visible brushstrokes, changing colours, and focused on scenes of modern life in the countryside. The young painters rent a studio and live to paint, often running out of rent money and being evicted, only to return after some paintings sell or a relative offers a handout. Camille and her sister, Annette, meet the young painters when they pose as models, but Claude claims he has had his eye on Camille ever since he saw her at a railway station many years earlier, and that she had become his invisible muse. In fact, he paints her over and over again throughout their life together, and his painting, “Woman in the Green Dress,” which Camille modeled, gets him into the official Paris Salon and on the path to eventual fame.Claude and Camille’s life together is constantly plagued with the lack of money. While he paints incessantly in all weather, she tries hard to keep the home fires burning. Her attempts at becoming an artist herself, first an actress, then a novelist, all end up half-baked as the family constantly has to move residence, either due to the lack of money or to supports Claude’s career. Claude is the consummate artist, willing to destroy his work that does not match his expectations, emotional to the point of suicide when things start falling apart. And yet, the passion between the couple is palpable and triumphs over illness, hunger, third-party affairs, and artistic disappointments. The Franco-Prussian war interrupts the lives of the young artists, and many are recruited to fight. Monet flees with his family to England to sit out the war, and to paint another series of outdoor scenes that will eventually add to his oeuvre. The war ends with some of the Impressionists losing their lives and seeing their promising careers cut short. Monet is left bereft when his close friend Frederic Bazile falls victim, leaving a schism in their friendship that involves Camille, one that is never to be repaired.In the last years of Camille’s life, the wealthy textile family Hoechede enter the scene, after Claude is commissioned to paint wall panels in that family’s country mansion.

I’m glad this book was written to restore her due place in the Monet legend.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jun 16, 2019","Jun 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6797515-claude-camille

But I have to say I was held enthralled by the complex and talented man who emerges from these pages of reflection, observation, personal philosophy, confession and instruction.The preface, written by his son, quickly dispels the myth that Gauguin woke up one day, abandoned his family in France, and took off for the South Seas where he cavorted with the natives, while painting until he dropped dead at his easel of a morphine overdose, taken to lessen the pain of a profligate life. On the contrary, he left with the full agreement of his wife, the marriage having broken down. After two sojourns in Tahiti, he settled in the remoter Marquesas Islands, defined a post-Impressionist art form that captured the essence of the Pacific islands, was active in local politics, more often as a dissenter against the Church and the corrupt colonial administration, and quietly contributed to a reputation-in-absentia back home in Europe. This journal appears to have been written during his final years in the Marquesas, when he was trying to assemble the pieces of learning from his nomadic life, for the recollections of his early life in Europe (and childhood in Peru) are sketchier than those recorded on the islands. Yet, he spends some time detailing his relationship with Van Gogh and the last days that he spent in the company of this other tortured genius who committed suicide while they were sharing rooms in France. He also spends a few pages on his relationship with Degas who was a mentor.Experts and academics had difficulty boxing Gauguin into a particular school of art—was he an Impressionist like his colleagues, a post-Impressionist, or a Primitivist—for he lived at a time when art was bursting out of traditional boundaries into something yet undefined. Gauguin resisted categorization: “The difference between a painter and a mason is that the mason builds to a plan, a frame, a model. The painter paints from memory, sensation, and intelligence, and his soul will triumph over the eye of the amateur.”His quotes of personal philosophy characterize the man best, and I’d like to quote a few gems from this book :1) Precision often destroys a dream.2) Take care not to step on the foot of a learned idiot. His bile is incurable.3) No one is good, no one is evil. Everyone is both.4) Toil endlessly. Otherwise what would life be worth?5) The tenderness of intelligent hearts are not easily seen. 6) The lower genius sinks, the higher talent rises.Yet, despite these incisive observations, he claims that the subterfuges of language and the artifice of style are not suited for his barbaric heart, although he does not disdain such. “There are savages who like to cloth themselves now and then.” He rambles on in this book, just like he did in life: taking a walk through an art gallery and critiquing the paintings therein, discussing their respective styles; reliving the storm that flooded his house upon arrival in the Marquesas; talking about the process of making Japanese Cloisonné, discussing the finer points of fencing and boxing; he talks at length of his dislike of Denmark, from the habits and customs of the Danes to their localization of art: “Venuses turned Protestant, modestly draped in damp linen”; he recounts his youthful voyage as a seaman to Rio De Janeiro where he had a series of sexual escapades with older women; he laments for the Marquesan islanders ravaged by western diseases, corrupted by colonial officials, lacking efficient services, burdened by crushing taxes, and helpless against the proliferation of prostitution.And although he was unconsciously building this aura and reputation that was to follow him to this day, his last days were spent in debt, in pain, and forgotten at the far reaches of the French colonial empire.“This is not a book,” he maintains after this circulatory journey through his intimate journal. And then stubbornly defends what he has written by concluding, “It is my right to write, and the critics cannot prevent it.”  ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jun 07, 2019","Jun 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/249798.Gauguin_s_Intimate_Journals

There is a rumour that many on board are part of the terrorist group, the Tamil Tigers, that recently lost its 26-year civil war to Sri Lankan Government forces. What follows is a lengthy and painstaking eligibility-determination process where the new arrivals are subjected to a battery of hearings while being housed in a prison in Canada. The mood of the Canadian political establishment is that they don’t want refugees jumping to the head of the line, especially ones with terrorist ties, and the more of this batch that can be deported the better.The narrative is covered from three viewpoints: Mahindan, a widowed mechanic in Sri Lanka who has escaped on the boat with his five-year old son Sellian; Priya, a Canadian-born law articling student whose Sri Lankan father and uncle share disparate views on the civil war back home; Grace, the third generation Japanese adjudicator who is battling her own family’s demons caused by their incarceration during WWII. Mahindan comes across as the most credible and interesting character, for through him we are able to visit the horrors of the final years of the Sri Lankan civil war. We witness the stranglehold the Tigers had on the freedom of their citizens, where forcible conscription took place for children as young as ten. We witness the fall of Kilinochchi, the Tiger stronghold, in 2009, and the retreat by surviving civilians to a strip of land between the ocean and a lagoon where the Tigers made their last tragic stand. Mahindan is a survivor, doing anything that will save his life and that of his son, whether that involves fixing Tiger vehicles, or stealing ID papers of dead people for resale to those looking for escape to foreign lands. Mahindan’s “never give up attitude” and his unflagging love for his son are bright lights in this dark narrative. Priya is conflicted with her role as a budding lawyer and is more concerned with what field of law she should follow after she is called to the bar; her family history in Sri Lanka, which is dredged out slowly—especially her uncle’s dark secret—is more colourful than her own life. Grace, politically appointed to “send them back,” comes across as a cold-hearted, disinterested and distracted woman who has no sympathy for her refugee claimants. She suspects everyone; it is Grace’s mother, Kumi, suffering from dementia, and Grace’s twin teenage daughters, who keep alive the spectre of injustice that was committed by Canadian authorities on disenfranchised Japanese during WWII, and maintain a semblance of grounding for the adjudicator. What is clear is that whatever conflict it was that made a generation of refugees flee their homeland, living in Canada tends to dull those emotions over generations of that family’s residence in this country. Scenes alternate between prosaic ones in Canada (children organizing birthday parties, teenagers arguing with parents, families playing card games etc.) and diabolical ones in Sri Lanka (civilians being bombed to smithereens while forced to act as shields between the Tigers and the Sri Lankan military). The Canadians are unable to understand what these refugees have gone through as they view the foreigners’ experiences through domestic lenses. Mahindan is exasperated, “These Canadians, with all their creature comforts, have such meagre imaginations.” Gigovaz, the refugee lawyer, replies to Mahindan, “You have come to a place where people are spoiled. It is easier for them to call you a liar than to believe what you say is true.” Mahindan sees that in his own son, who in a matter of months of arrival, is becoming “Canadian” by the day and distancing himself from the traumas that had once united them.As the months go by, some refugees, especially the women and children, are gradually released into Canadian society while others go through many failed detention hearings, and others are summarily deported. Not everyone takes kindly to a deportation; some verdicts lead to tragic outcomes, and the adjudicators wonder whether they have indirectly become judge, jury and executioner through this process.I was a bit disappointed in the inconclusive climax and wondered whether by ending where she did, the author was indicating to us where Mahindan’s own case was headed, and therefore why not leave us with him enjoying his best day in Canada with his son? Or whether she wanted each reader to figure out Mahindan’s fate given the flawed refugee determination system we had been exposed to in this novel? The one chilling certainty is that the process hasn’t been refined yet, and the next boatload of refugees arriving from a war zone where allegiances are hard to determine will be faced with the same set of dilemmas. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"May 31, 2019","May 31, 2019",,,view (with text),/book/show/34128675-the-boat-people

Burmese Days reminds me of novels Somerset Maugham and Graham Greene might have written in the later stages of their careers had they been trapped like timber merchant Flory (a proxy for Orwell) in an obscure Indian station with no way out.Orwell spent five years in the Imperial Police Force in Burma and drew heavily from his experiences in that period. The fictitious station of Kyauktada is a miserable place for British colonials. Surrounded by jungle, festering in drought that is only alleviated by drenching rain, irritated by prickly heat that breaks out over white bodies at random, isolated from the natives who surround them and who are still dominated by the yoke of a fading Empire, these Brits have only the traditional Club in which to centre their activities and drink copiously to drown out their loneliness, decay and self-pity. When Dr. Veraswamy is touted to be the first native to gain membership in the club, given the relaxing of colonial laws in favour of locals, and his rival U Po Kyin, a corrupt local magistrate, is all out to thwart the appointment, the stage is set for an eruption of violence fuelled by the seeds of discrimination that engulf colonial and local alike, with tragic consequences for both sides. The Brits at Kyauktada are unapologetically racist. Characters like Ellis, a manager of a colonial company, thinks nothing of bribing witnesses to lie, or torturing locals, and shooting them, all if it means that British hegemony in the area is preserved. And Mrs. Lackersteen is the quintessential burra memsahib, lording it over her domestic servants, trying to keep an eye on her alcoholic husband and his frisky hands with the ladies, and hatching brazen plots to snag a husband for her impoverished and orphaned niece, Elizabeth. Elizabeth too has all the trappings of a budding memsahib; she is materially and socially focussed; she prefers horse riding and hunting to reading and mixing with the locals. Flory is madly in love with her and rescues her from wild buffalos, leopards and crazed mobs, but she spurns him for the wastrel, Verrall, commander of the Military Police detachment sent to Kyauktada to fend off a loomimg local rebellion being secretly organized by U Po Kyin. Why is Elizabeth so stupid? Because Verrall has “Honourable” attached to his name and is considered to be going more places than Flory will ever do with his sympathies for locals such as Dr. Veraswamy. Flory too has his demons; one particular loud and cunning one is Ma Hla May, his former mistress, who embodies the warning: “hell hath no fury like a woman spurned.” Some of Orwell’s observations are didactic and more like condemnations:1) The British official holds the Burman down while the British businessman goes through his pockets. 2) The army provides protection to the British fools who work in the colonies.3) Colonialism is despotism: you are free to be a drunkard, coward, fornicator, idler and back biter, but you are not free to think for yourself.4) The Oriental hates himself and looks to the Britisher; the Britisher hates himself and look to the Oriental.5) The key to success is to sell out your partner in crime.6) Half-educated people (those in the colonies) develop late in life, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life.Descriptions of village life, the jungle, the empty club life, and the eternal arguments about the filthy natives are well drawn. After some earlier scene setting, especially through racially charged arguments in the British club that provide us with the lay of the land on each person’s sensibilities and sympathies, the action moves at a fast pace towards a thrilling climax. Yet the device of the omniscient narrator—one who not only jumps into everyone’s heads to tell us what each is thinking, but who also attempts to explain certain plot points to us—gives this book an amateurish feel. Perhaps these devices were allowed in the 1920’s when Orwell wrote this novel; perhaps, this being his debut offering, Orwell needed the crutch of the omniscient narrator to get him through the writing of it. As the omniscient narrator sums up in the end, each character gets his dues, deservedly or not. The opportunists come out ahead of the honest ones, and even Mother Nature intervenes to thwart some of the best laid plans of master Machiavellians such as U Po Kyin. Kyauktada shrugs off its wounded and dead and continues to fly the flag of its colonial master, chewing up those who are not resilient enough to play the survival game; and all its denizens, colonials and natives alike, continue their roles as pawns in the service to this vast business empire on whom the sun eventually was to set a couple of decades later—unfortunately, it was not to be in this book!

Portnoy is a boy scout romp compared to this book which is a dark celebration of the life force embodied in the sexual drive.Mickey Sabbath is a 64 year old ex-puppeteer, unemployed and broke, yet virile as ever, grieving the death of his lifelong lover Drenka who had an insatiable sexual appetite, one stoked by Mickey and unleashed upon the world until it consumed her and left him bereft. Sabbath has plunged into a depression with her death and flees his recovering alcoholic wife, Roseanne— someone with whom he once also enjoyed a vibrant sex life, before things cooled—to visit his past, before intending to commit suicide. And yet, his life force is so strong, his lust for carnality so vibrant, that suicide is a tough sell.There is a flimsy story line as Sabbath traces his path back to New York, visits his old pal Norman, defiles Norman’s house and family with his out-of-control sex drive, then retreats to his childhood neighbourhood to retrieve his dead brother Mort’s belongings (Mort died at age 20 during WWII), drapes himself in the flag and tries to “off” himself, all the while lamenting and reliving his sexual escapades with wives Nikki and Roseanne, and lover Drenka, and the myriad of younger women he entrapped into threesomes with his wives and lover over the years. As Norman says, “You live in the failure of this civilization, the final investment of everything in sex. And now you reap the lonely harvest.” What also lurks and poses the question behind Sabbath’s rampant sex drive is a dead mother who haunts him and will never release him from the guilt of being the survivor brother.No act is too shameful or private to be revealed. It is almost as if Roth wants to grind us down into our basest instincts, into the piss, shit and sweat of human stain, making us acknowledge what we are capable of even though we choose to gloss over them, or even deny them, while elevating this activity to art. Thus we have acts of phone sex, polyamory, urination, masturbation, fetishism, and necrophilia that go on for pages, written in energetic and frenetic prose that elevate it from formulaic erotica. The sardonic humour that drips from the stream-of-consciousness sentences and situations Sabbath gets into help soften the pungency and differentiates the narrative from pornography. But, like Sabbath, Roth is skating on pretty thin ice here. All the while I wondered whether master puppeteer Roth was yanking the reader’s strings and asking the question, “Have you had enough? Shall we take this up another notch?” On the other hand, I wondered whether he was sticking it into the noses of the literati, suggesting that he could stretch literature beyond its existing sexual boundaries that had only been periodically broken and extended by novels such as Lady Chatterley’s Lover and Lolita— maybe another course correction was being called for.I guess Roth, like Sabbath, chose sex to be the linchpin of his work, and Sabbath’s Theatre seems to be a comic appraisal of that work to say, “Well, see where this has gotten you to? This is as high as you will ride this gig.” His books that followed Sabbath’s Theatre show the decline of the life force as the author ages and the sex drive diminishes, and regret for what is lost dominates that later work.That Mickey Sabbath is an unforgettable character, a villain with a conscience and an uncontrollably frisky penis, is never in question. His complexity sustained my interest because there is only so much one can read about sex before losing one’s hard on, so to say. Sabbath’s planned epitaph seems to sum him (and the book) up:Morris Sabbath“Mickey”Beloved Whoremonger, Seducer,Sodomist, Abuser of Women,Destroyer of Morals, Ensnarer of Youth,Uxoricide,Suicide,1929 - 1994Enjoy!...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"May 11, 2019","May 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11654.Sabbath_s_Theater

Dickensian it is, and I wondered whether Donna Tartt was also being paid by the chapter like Dickens was, for it indeed took a chapter to describe something that may have been covered in a page, or in even a paragraph. In these attention-deficit times, that’s a bit of a stretch, literally. The fact that this book won the Pulitzer Prize only five years ago made me wonder whether the prize jury was signalling that it was time to return to the long sentence and the long novel.The premise is great: a bomb explosion in a museum turns a child victim into an art thief. In the process we are treated to a glimpse into upper crust New York society, lower tier Las Vegas society, the art world with its customs, rituals and codes, and the criminal underworld that specializes in using stolen art for collateral on drug deals. We are also introduced to a plethora of mind numbing recreational drugs and their damaging effects.Theo Decker, a 13-year old, sees his mother die when the museum explodes while he is visiting. In the ensuing melee, he dazedly grabs onto a priceless painting, The Goldfinch, whose creator also died in a fire in the 17th century. Theo hangs onto the painting as it’s the only memory he has of his mother’s last moments, and keeps it safe for several years, only to discover that it is priceless and on a list of paintings that were considered thefts from the museum at the time of the explosion. Theo is torn between the upper class but dysfunctional world of the Barbour family that temporarily houses him, and his alcoholic father who descends from Las Vegas to claim him. Life in Las Vegas is a very unhappy one for Theo who finds companionship with Boris, another abused but worldly teenager, who is no stranger to alcohol and drugs and even a bit of crime on the side. The amount of drugs and alcohol these two teenagers consume is enough to keep a whole village on a permanent high for years. At the heart of this indulgence is a desire to wipe out the emptiness in their loveless lives. Theo’s heart lies with Pippa, a girl who was also in the museum at the time of the blast, and whose uncle died in the blaze. Before breathing his last, the uncle gives Theo a ring as an introduction to his business partner, Hobie, who is to become Theo’s mentor and business partner over the years to follow. Hobie is the only father figure who represents masculine strength and integrity while Mr. Barbour and the boys’ fathers are all losers.After a few wasted years in Las Vegas, Theo returns to New York to finish his education and join Hobie in the business of art restoration. His conditioning by Boris in the dark arts soon turns him into a seller of art fakes. One thing leads to another, and we wind up in Amsterdam where Theo and Boris end up fighting for their lives against a bunch of hoodlums. They are intent on restoring the Goldfinch to its original state in the museum and be absolved of the stain of art thieves.What was disappointing was that for all the length of this book with such a few plot points and twists, even though some issues were resolved, we were left hanging on others. I never understood whether Theo’s unrequited love for Pippa was resolved, or whether he ever got married to the “other woman”, Kitsey, whom he was never in love with and who was cheating on him. And what of Boris? Or does Boris remain the Artful Dodger to Theo’s Oliver Twist? And are all these loose ends a foretelling (heavens forbid!) that another 850 page Goldfinch II is on the horizon? And what the heck was that last chapter about the merits of the Goldfinch painting all about—what a way to end?!Even though the writing was fluid and the descriptions minute, this was a too long a book for the length of its story.

However, I felt that this book would not have come to be published if the writers of this anthology hadn’t chosen to write about their subjects (many of whom are not writers and would never have been able to tell their stories otherwise), and the best thing I could do as a writer was to highlight to the world, that these kinds of stories also do exist apart from those of the rich and famous, and that they too are well worth reading (and for me, writing) for their authenticity.These twenty-five, 1500-word pieces come from the English speaking world of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, and the USA. They are written by mature writers (i.e. 60 years and above) and deal with the fear experienced in venturing into the unknown and how the overcoming of that fear lends the doer the mantle of courage, leaving lessons behind for others. Some examples: 1)	The 69-year old camping in Florida is bitten by a recluse spider and develops gangrene2)	The 65-year old circumnavigates Ellesmere Island and discovers the difference between pain(unavoidable) and suffering (avoidable).3)	The 21-year old social worker, investigating a case of child abuse, has a shotgun pointed her by the abuser.4)	The 65-year old Canadian-Italian grandmother tells her adult granddaughter how Grandpa wanted to use a condom for more regular sex after the Catholic Church permitted birth control, leading to a schism in the marriage.5)	The 12-year old boy escaping the London blitz to Canada witnesses a Canadian convoy being bombed by German U boats.There are stories of “first time plunges,” whether that is a gay woman “coming out” in the 1980’s in conservative Toronto, or a swimmer’s first dive off a diving board, or the first time a naturist disrobed in public, or the public singing debut by a 70-year old. There are stories of illness, of cancer not only striking the protagonist but also members of the family at the same time. There are indigenous stories: the Maori woman sailing 800 km over four days in a gale to die in her beloved Chatham Islands; or the Maori man going inside an MRI machine for a shoulder scan, suffering the anguish of incarceration, and fleeing the hospital when he is told that he may have to come back for a retake. My story was about my father, an 88-year old who has cheated death so many times that I titled it “Outliving the Cat.” I am glad I did, for Dad is not a writer, and this was one of the best gifts I gave him by leaving his life lessons for others to gain from.Each story is headlined with a quote from a famous writer such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Maya Angelou or Stephen Hawking. But the one that stuck for me was a quote by 70-year old in one of the stories who is dying: “In acceptance lies peace.”In these times of shortened attention spans and the trend towards non-fiction, this collection makes for a quick and timely read.

Also a guarantee of best-seller status.Matthew Pearl has hit on this formula and his first three books cover Dante, Poe and Dickens mixed in with the dark shadows of a whodunit in each. In The Dante Club, his debut, we are introduced to literary luminaries such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes and James Russell Lowell, along with publisher J.T. Fields, all stalwart members of the Dante Club, a loose association of intellectuals connected with Harvard University. Led by Longfellow, the club is intent on translating the works of Dante into English for publication in America, much against the desires of the Harvard Corporation and other Boston Brahmins (local aristocracy) who want to maintain their Unitarian and Presbyterian beliefs and do not wish to be polluted by Catholic and sinful Italian literature. The earlier part of the book dwells on the political and literary challenges facing the translation and gives us a glimpse into the lives of the principle characters, mainly into the life of Dante, a man exiled from his beloved Florence, who wrote his masterpiece while under banishment, and who was never allowed to reunite with his lover Beatrice. “Dante writes like Rembrandt, with a brush dipped in darkness and a gleam of hellfire as his light.” We also get a good depiction of post-civil war Boston, with its demobilized and discarded union soldiers struggling to survive, it’s intelligencia, it’s academic hegemony, its divided police force, and its rivalry with New York for supremacy in publishing. We learn that black police officers were not allowed to wear uniforms or arrest a white person without another officer being present! We even get some choice period words like “lushington” and “delirious tremendous,” uttered by the inebriated lower classes. Pearl, being a Dante scholar, spares no pains in painting this period thickly in a clunky vintage narrative style. A bit too thickly I thought, if the other side of this book—the murder mystery—was going to quickly engage into gear and take us at a faster clip.And when we do finally engage, people start dying, in ways that resemble Dante’s journey through Hell. The deadly contrapasso falls upon each of the victims based on some bad deed they had committed during their lives. Whether being eaten by maggots while alive, or being buried headfirst with feet afire, or being sliced up and left to die, or being buried alive in ice, the killings are brutal and is the work of a maniac. The victims are all opponents of the Dante Club’s project, and its core members who are men of letters and not of action are soon bumbling along head over heels in search of this elusive killer who is able to pre-empt the next chapter of their translation and kill according to its narrative. That’s when the plot deteriorates into contrivance. The killer’s ability to listen in on key conversations of the Dante Club and the Harvard Corporation, and his ability to be everywhere at once is a bit of a stretch. So is the sudden attack of hoof and mouth disease that conveniently (or inconveniently) lands all the city’s horses in quarantine. I also wondered how Dr. Holmes, an asthmatic, was able to outrun his attacker and crawl into narrow underground spaces with little or no air. The author also has some difficulty with stagecraft when it comes to actions scenes, especially when many players are on stage and many voices are talking in the same scene. I am hoping that his later books tackle this element better, for it is not an easy skill to master.Of course, all is revealed at the end, and the literary luminaries of the Dante Club go on to greatness as the history books will attest, and this little episode will be conveniently excised so that it remains only in the annals of fiction. I found this novel an engaging spotlight on the lives of Longfellow and Co., a good primer on the interesting bits of Dante, and a revelation on the conditions of the American North at the conclusion of the civil war. It appears that America had its own Inferno during that disastrous war, and that the poets of the Dante Club, with access to the survivors still proudly wearing their uniforms if nothing else, could have written a “Made in America” version of the Divine Comedy to rival the original.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Apr 24, 2019","Apr 24, 2019",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18402.The_Dante_Club

It is a tale of the wages of business success which is not always rewarding. It is also a tale of the inequality between men and women, the latter being helpless pawns in the hands of their powerful lovers. Two story lines, one set in Piura in northern Peru and the other set in the capital of Lima, interweave in alternating chapters before they come together at the conclusion; both stories have remarkable similarities in father-son relationships and business fortunes, and both are connected by two sisters, one living in Piura and the other in Lima. Each chapter ends in a surprise, making you want to read on, reminding me of those old Superman radio plays where I couldn’t wait for the next week’s episode as we had been left hanging after the present one ended.Felicito, the Piuran protagonist, owns a transport company and is being blackmailed for protection money through a series of letters signed with a crab motif. Felicito has two sons who work in the business with him, his wife is a silent partner at home, and he has a young mistress, Mabel, whom he has set up with an apartment and an allowance. Felicito is driven by the sacrifices of his farmer father who raised him and advised him never to let anyone push him around. Therefore, Felicito will not acquiesce to the blackmailers’ demands. In Lima, there are two protagonists: Octogenarian Ismael, owner of an insurance company, who is marrying his maid 40 years younger to him and wants to disinherit his wastrel twin sons; and Ismael’s loyal employee, Rigoberto, who is taking early retirement to enjoy the world of art that he had given up for a business career, while his teenage son, Fonchito, is seeing troubling visions of a Mephistopheles like man called Edilberto Torres.As the plot thickens we glean surprising insights into this cast: Felicito suspects that his older son, Miguel, is not his; Mabel has a younger lover; Ismael is not as beneficent as he appears; Fonchito, the angelic child, has a trickster’s nature; Rigoberto’s wife is bisexual; Rigoberto himself gets off sexually by viewing works of art and talking dirty with his wife; Ismael’s evil twins want to sue Rigoberto for allowing their father’s “illegal” marriage to go through. The men are passionate and romantic and make no bones about their need for sex, whether with their wives or with others. Peru is emerging as a prosperous nation after years of neglect and mismanagement. The translator is having difficulty introducing a Piuran figure of speech che guá or “hey, waddya think,” in English—in the most dramatic moments, a character may end his speech with “hey,waddya think!” and crack me up into laughter, causing the opposite effect of what the author intended.Many of these characters also appeared in Llosa’s earlier book The Green House which was a very difficult read given the oodles of scene-splicing that went on there. In this novel too we have scenes woven into others between consequent lines of dialogue, which I guess are intended to convey a split screen cinematic effect but which can be very difficult to read. However, I guess Llosa is older and wiser in this book, and the scene-splicing is not too distracting and is at its tolerable limit. However, be prepared to be reading a scene in which Rigoberto and Fonchito are discussing Edilberto Torres, only to find Edilberto and Fonchito discussing Rigoberto in the next line. The two story lines converge with phalanxes of reporters mobbing Felicito in Piura and Rigoberto in Lima respectively. Treachery is uncovered and dealt with, and the surprise for me is how cold-bloodedly Felicito disposes of the transgressors; even the police sergeant Lituma remarks on it. And the downtrodden sisters in the story are rewarded for their long suffering loyalty. I did feel sorry for Mabel: wives have it easier in the end than mistresses. As for the elusive Edilberto Torres, I will henceforth look behind my shoulder whenever sitting on an airplane in case he is lurking around, for he represents the mendacity within us: the cold-blooded drive of Felicito, the evil in the twins, the anger of Miguel, the duplicity of Ismael, the kinkiness of Rigoberto, and the trickster in Fonchito.

Mr. Blank— the unknown old man who wakes up in a sterile but clean room with a bed, an adjoining bathroom, a swivel chair and desk, some manuscripts and a pile of photographs—is either a spymaster or a writer. Perhaps Spymaster is an apt description for Fiction Writer. Mr. Blank is on some treatment regimen that has robbed him of his energy and memory. He has a series of visitors, each revealing a piece of his past, each featured in one of the photographs on his desk; each has been in his employ during which he had sent them on dangerous assignments abroad, the results of which did not often end satisfactorily. A camera takes a picture per second, recording all his movements, burps and farts. He is ministered to by nurses, Anna and Sophie, who also provide him sexual favours, given that his incarceration is devoid of touch and love, and he is still capable of sex even though his body is failing him. And yet, Mr. Blank is afraid to check the door to his room to see whether it is unlocked. Instead he spends his time perambulating around the room on the swivel chair, reading the manuscripts, and trying to recall his earlier life. He appears to have agreed to this incarceration, a clue perhaps to the fact that he is a writer, safest while spending his time in his room in isolation with only his characters and stories for company.The manuscript that he reads has an eerie resemblance to his own life, that is, as much of that life which is revealed through his visitors and his own faulty memory. However, the story in the manuscript is set in the early 1800’s in some fictitious country and appears to be a metaphor for how the west was won in the USA, replete with the decimation of indigenous tribes by white settlers. If he was writing about what he knew, was Blank himself a racist who committed murder and genocide? When the manuscript ends abruptly, Mr. Blank is intent on finishing it and dives into the myriad possibilities on where this story could go. This is where Auster treats us to a showcase of storytelling virtuosity and provides us the second clue to the fact that Mr. Blank is indeed an author living inside his own fiction. The title “Scriptorium” alludes to this too. That Blank likes certain characters, even loves them like Anna, and dislikes others like Flood, strengthens this supposition. An unknown narrator appears at the end, summing up the case, and this adds another dimension to the “story within the story”; perhaps there is a third story, or many more—the classic Auster labyrinth.Is there a way out of this maze? Auster seems to suggest not. The author once ensconced in his world reaps the reward and the punishment for creating it. His characters punish him too, for the descriptive labels that have been stuck to various objects in the room get moved around mysteriously, and Blank struggles to restore the order by sticking them back properly, again conveying that very human of drives, of needing to control one’s environment if only for one’s sanity. Is he suffering from Alzheimers? This thought crossed my mind at one point, but Blank seems to dredge up characters we haven’t even met, leading me to believe that under that cloud of medication lies a sound mind trying to assert control. The temptation for the reader of such surrealistic novels is to try and make sense of them. Some have compared this book to Kafka or the Kabbalah. But I never made sense of Kafka or Kabbalah, both were too deep for me, so let me skip the comparisons and make one punt at a more surface level possibility. I could be wrong, but this is only one reader’s perspective: Auster was visioning his own end as a writer. If so, it is a story without a happy ending. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2019","Apr 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/454.Travels_in_the_Scriptorium

This is one of thosA Rothologist's Collector's ItemJust when I thought I had read the most bizarre of books from Philip Roth, I stumble upon another. This is one of those, written at the time when Roth was recovering from a nervous breakdown after taking the drug Halcion for pain management that reduced him to paranoia, a deadly state for a novelist who already skirts that area of the mind.Fact merges with fiction in this book. The facts are that Roth uses his own name for the protagonist and relates his visit to Israel to interview author Aron Apelfeld, a holocaust survivor. While in Isreal, Roth also visits the trial of John Demjanjuk who is being tried for potentially having been Ivan the Terrible during WWII. The fiction is that there is a doppelganger in Israel claiming to be Philip Roth and stirring up support for another Jewish diaspora, this time a migration out of Israel and back to Europe where the memory of the Holocaust is quite not extinguished; the rationale is that the Israelis face certain extermination by their Arab neighbours but that Europe will never let Holocaust II happen.Everyone is not who they claim to be: the two Roths who keep switching roles; Damjanjuk is not Ivan the Terrible, or is he?; is Smilesburger a seller of antiquarian books or a Mossad agent? The book is seeded with long swaths of dialogue where the pros and cons of Diaspora vs. Settlement are discussed ad nauseum. Roth and his doppelganger emerge as representatives of the diaspora and Apelfeld as a supporter of settlement. In between, Roth is gifted the diaries of Leon Klinghoffer, the victim of the Achile Lauro hijacking, and we are entertained to a travelogue on Israel. The Palestinian viewpoint is presented by Roth’s old university friend, George, who is eternally spewing anti-Israeli comments and dubs himself a “word-throwing Arab, not a stone-throwing one”. And sex? There is no Roth book that is complete without the urging of the loins. The sex bit is provided by Jinx Posseski, the fake Roth’s nurse, who sleeps with the original and the double, and physically makes love to the latter even after death does them part.The twist in the book is the last chapter, which is purposefully omitted, and which ostensibly describes a “task” Roth performs for the Mossad that he wants to put in the book but which they want to keep out. Roth, the career novelist, is committed to his art and abhors censure. In his words: “The writer redefined the permissible. That was the responsibility. Nothing need hide itself in fiction.” And yet the penalty of crossing the Mossad is not death on a dark road for Roth but the worse sentence of loshon hora—evil speak—that which can destroy his literary career. And so we get another twist that leaves the plot, in Roth’s words, “the story is frivolously plotted, over-plotted, too freakishly plotted, with outlandish events so wildly careening around every corner that there is nowhere for intelligence to establish a foothold and develop a perspective.”Plot inconsistencies apart, the fluency of prose with this author is at its height in this book, and so is his manic expression, which is understandable given his addled mental state caused by Halcion. I wondered why Roth wrote this book, other than to keep up his regular output that must have been demanded by his publisher, sickness notwithstanding. And I toyed with the idea that perhaps it may have been his attempt to atone for his Jew-bashing by showing himself undertaking work for the Mossad. But since the missing final chapter holds the key, we really wonder whether that assignment, which is the title of this book, is also a work of fiction. Given the platitudes to Roth as an imminent novelist and political influencer that dot the book, I wondered whether this novel was Roth’s own pat on the back to himself; in George’s words, “Philip, you are a Jewish prophet and you always have been. You are a Jewish seer.” Smilesburger has a less than complimentary view and describes Roth as “one who has made his fortune as a leading Jewologist of international literature.”Overall, a good addition to the library of an ardent Roth-o-logist, which I am....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 26, 2019","Mar 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12881.Operation_Shylock

Stream of consciousness novels are either the work of a higher genius or the prattling of an addled mind, I have never been able to figure out which. And this is a mind-boggling work of what, I really don’t know. Given that Beckett wrote this book during his recovery from a nervous breakdown, I think the addled mind theory is more probable to me.The book is split into two equal halves: the first covers the voice of Molloy, a crippled, derelict of a man who can still ride a bike, who is going to see his mother (I suspect she is dead and this journey is his way back to his maker), he may even have killed her; he meets and falls into various misadventures along the way; the second half is narrated by Moran the inept investigator, or agent, who is on the hunt for Molloy for a crime the latter has ostensibly committed, and what that crime is we never know. Both men have eerie similarities: they have game legs, their minds wander although Moran is a bit more coherent than Molloy, sex is a chore, just get it done and out of the way, whether it is by Molloy picking up derelict women for anal sex or Moran masturbating while his son is not around; both do not know why they are going or where they are going or what they are going to do when they arrive except that something is pushing them on. Shades of Waiting for Godot.There is poetry in the rambling prose, and words that I couldn’t pick up in the dictionary, like “absterge” and “podex.” There is an element of criminality. At one point Moran has killed a man and dismembered him but he doesn’t know why, and because he is our narrator, we don’t either. At another point he has “a savage row” with his son who is accompanying him on the hunt for Molloy, how savage we will never know, but sufficient for the son to abandon his father. Both stories end inconclusively: Molloy gets lost in a forest and Moran doesn’t get his man. And I asked myself, what the hell was this story about? And why was it only called Molloy, why not Molloy & Moran? Or Going to Godot?Of course this is the work by none other than Samuel Beckett, and we should not say unkind things about him, other than pay homage to his superior genius that we will never comprehend. I looked at the s of this book on this forum and even the most cynical of ers rate it a respectful 4 stars. So let me cast the first stone and be stoned in turn. If I were to judge this book as a novel, or as an extension of its form, I think it’s dismal. The essential element of story is missing or badly mangled. I think Beckett is better to have stuck to poetry and theatre—at least, I understood those. Writing a novel to heal oneself from a nervous breakdown and then inflicting its maniacal prattling upon a faithful readership is unkind. And now I face the ultimate unkindness: the other two novels in this trilogy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable, sit in my Kindle, crying out to be read. They will just have to lie there.

But the comparison ends thereThis novel reminded me of the movie Chocolate, where a strange woman arrives in a small town and starts to transform it. But the comparison ends there for the light hearted movie does not end with the same dramatic and tragic revelations contained in this book. Helene is a middle aged French woman, skilled in playing piano and in the craft of piano making. She is well dressed, walks with a limp and drives a brand new car. It is 1933 and she arrives via Montreal at a rural Nova Scotian village, St. Homais, on the French Shore. Rather quickly by displaying her talent for music, she obtains work and accommodation at the parish church, playing piano and conducting the choir. Like with all small towns, she attracts both fans and detractors, for she is from away. And she has secrets. Big ones. Some even leading to murder. When her dark secret is outed and she is placed under house arrest in the church pending trial, business booms in St Homais, for everyone wants to attend church to see a suspected killer, everyone wants to attend a murder trial. The fans and detractors alike, except for Helen's inner circle of loyal friends, become gawkers.We are quickly introduced to two story lines: one in the present day beginning when Helene arrives in St. Homais; and the older one of Helen's childhood, her apprenticeship in the family piano factory, marriage, and business partnership with a man, Nathan, who was to shape her future in more ways than one. The two story lines interweave slowly and build up to a rapid-fire climax when they become inseparable from each other, one scene from the past leading to the next from the present and vice versa. A very clever device on the part of the author to maintain suspense and interest.In the process, we are given glimpses into the affects of World War I on survivors and on the occupied territory, France, in this case: the conscription of men, the inevitable news of a loved one dying, the futility of love when the men are transient and very soon dead, the shutting down of businesses due to the lack of labour, the monotonous meals scrounged from anywhere, even hunted in one's backyard, the scramble for firewood during winter, the routine billeting of soldiers in citizens' houses. We get an insight into piano making, and the sale of antiquities that Helene gets into with the aid and coaxing of Nathan, an older man who once desired her but had to settle for being her business partner. Hers is a charmed life amidst the devastation of war and the perils of travelling to colonized foreign lands to secure treasures paid for so richly by colonial museums and private collectors, a practice now considered illegal with former owners seeking redress. Inevitably Helene too has to face the occupational hazard of the lure of filthy lucre. To discuss the plot any further would be to create spoilers, so I will refrain other than to say that Palka spins a good tale, backed with rich historical data and exercising strong narrative control. As much as he will dwell inordinately - perhaps to create suspense and mood - on a scene where Helene paces her bedroom awaiting trial, he will rush through the entire year she spent in Indo-China in a few pages. I thought he would get into trouble depicting the platonic, non-sexual relationship between Nathan and Helene but he manages that well, for it is a pivotal hinge and could have snapped the story apart like being caught in a bear trap.I have read Palka's earlier novel, Clara, and I saw shades of similarity: war and its effects (In Clara we were dealing with WWII), strong women with tragic flaws who marry soldiers, converging story lines. However while Clara, read like a family history being fictionalized, The Piano Maker is a suspense novel and is far more interesting to read once you get through the early set-up chapters.

And that’s exactly what Auster does in this autobiographical novel covering his life ranging from the years 0-25 of age, in which he renames himself Ferguson and sends this fictitious self down four possible life paths, subject to the winds of chance.The book is a ""novel"" construct, if I could pun on the word: seven distinct phases during Ferguson’s 25 years, each life repeating after the next as in 1.1, 1.2,1.3,1.4 and then onto the second phase of 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 etc — I think you might have the hang of it by now. The problem for the reader is that keeping track of the divergent paths of each life is difficult and I had to keep notes of what happened in 1.1 so that I could pick up that particular life of Ferguson again in 2.1. Not all of the lives will make it to the final phase 7, and that speaks to Chance, Auster’s pet theme that occurs in many of his books, but all lives are tortured, because all four Fergusons aspired to be authors. Only one of the lives may be attributed to the real Auster, or so we find out. The opening chapter 1.0 was by far the most interesting for me for it reveals the genesis of the Ferguson family, starting with our quartered hero’s grandfather, Reznikoff, who arrives at Ellis Island and is urged by a fellow émigré to change his name to Rockefeller lest he become an outcast; Grandpa forgets his new name when he faces the immigration official and says in Yiddish, Ikh hob fargessen (I’ve forgotten), and winds up being named Ichabod Ferguson—in one fell stroke of chance, a Russian Jew is converted to a Scottish Presbyterian. Welcome to America!The other problem that glares in this book is Auster’s telling style. He is known for very little dialogue (and even that is never in quotes) and for a strong narrative preference. Well, when you have four repeating stories that have the same cast of characters alternate roles, and where the same incidents have to be altered as well, the novel becomes a pile up of incidents and a long, repeating journey through the mind of Ferguson for almost 900 pages. The characters get muddled up and it is difficult to get a fix on them. I began skipping.The book covers the period starting at the end of WWII and ends around 1970 when the Vietnam War was tearing America apart. The early years show the birth of the post-WWII American Dream: courtship, marriage, economic growth, jobs, consumerism, the buying of houses, pregnancies, deaths, and scams - the stuff of middle class life during a boom. In the later years, we see the death of the American Dream as the young men of Ferguson’s age hover on the brink of being drafted into a war crafted by Nobodaddy (the term used for old men who send young men to war to achieve their own selfish ends). The only hope for those who can afford it is to continue their post-secondary education or damage parts of their anatomy so that they would be considered ineligible for the draft. Ferguson comes of age amidst the college protests in Columbia and Kent State, prison riots in Attica, the flower power of Woodstock, and the sexual revolution when sleeping around was de rigueur. The libidinous scenes are well done, including the homosexual ones.I was left wondering why Auster needed this doorstopper to record his early life, when one of the four lives, the real one, would have sufficed. I came up with the following possibilities:a) He was writing to please himself, now that he is at the end of his career and really doesn’t have to give a damn about the critics.b) All of his early life’s experiences wouldn’t fit into a single linear narrative and he needed four to cover them all.c) His need to experiment with Chance required many permutations and combinations.d) In prepping for this novel, he had scoped out four story lines and was reluctant to let go of any of them when he got down to the writing.e) He was trying to develop a new form for the novel, the achievement that most novelists are remembered for—remember Joyce, Hemingway and Proust?Well, if it was the last reason, this new form doesn’t inspire me much. Although I liked the glimpse into the world of the writer that he offered me. Young Ferguson, in each of his lives, begins writing from an early age. He is also involved in the world of small presses, which on reflection doesn’t look much different from the small presses of today; they are usually started by a bunch of young writers looking to get their own work published; they have limited circulation and provide little or no monetary reward, are backed by a rich patron, and inevitably go belly up when the patron loses interest or the life circumstances of the founders change. And Nixon-era America doesn’t look any different from Trump-era America, probably worse.  I wondered about the four lives of Ferguson and about my life at that stage. How easy was it for a chance incident—a falling tree, a runaway car or a carelessly thrown cigarette—to have altered or short circuited a life, my life or anyone’s life. Auster is not easy reading for this very reason. His existentialist stance implies that the best of efforts may amount to nothing in the end.As for Rockefeller, despite all his prior attempts to govern the country, he too ended up as Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford only by sheer chance....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2019","Mar 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30244626-4-3-2-1

JL (like us) has elevated her father to God status, and then discovers his activities in the local citizens’ council that is opposed to the civil rights movement. What results is a metamorphosis for JL, showdowns with her father, Uncle Jack, Aunt Zandra and long-enduring boyfriend Hank, and a coming to terms with her new reality, not the idealized one of her childhood. She is forced to accept her father for the fallible man he is. And so are we.The first hundred pages are a drag as they serve only to introduce characters, setting, relationships and past history. There is a decided lack of conflict in this opening, something not tolerated by publishers today, unless of course the author happens to be Harper Lee. I was at the point of setting this book aside when the “discovery” is made. Then the book vaults into the melodramatic with JL exhibiting convulsive physical symptoms of her mental anguish. This is followed by verbal showdowns, which amount to political arguments between the North (JL) and South (everyone else in Maycomb) that have existed since the Civil War, and yet they provide the fire in this book. We are forced to reframe our view of Atticus and his cohort. They are not opposed to black emancipation, but it has to take place over a long period of time, not overnight, for they believe the South is only just beginning its Industrial Revolution and the consequent drift from farms to factories. They stand for less government which should only be present to prevent crime, preserve contracts and provide common defence. They oppose the collective conscience and believe in each person for himself, the reason why men of the South entered the Civil War, leaving farms and lands behind to fight for their personal and political identity. This is a lot for JL to stomach, for she is colour blind having been raised by a white father and a black housekeeper, and who looks upon blacks as people with souls in need of hope, just as white people are. JLs ultimate subsiding into acceptance comes as a slap in the face to her, as well as to the reader, and I thought this turning point was contrived rather simplistically. I am glad however that all her conflicts are not resolved through this act, which today would be referred to as a misogynistic one.This is a southern novel with shades of Falknerian streams of consciousness. The dialogue is stilted and melodramatic in places, especially during the showdown scenes. Eccentric characters abound: like the man who carried a dead fish in his suitcase and kept a jackal in his room, or the man who disinters his grandfather to steal the corpse’s gold fillings to pay off a debt, or the woman who writes a cow obituary in verse for the local newspaper. Uncle Jack compares the South to England: both were agrarian countries that went industrial, and both believed in slavery.What was revealing to me was that this was the first novel submitted by Harper Lee to her publisher and also the more sincere one. Yet, she was persuaded to write another more popular one that would appeal to the zeitgeist, and so Mockingbird was born. It was as if Lee was back in writing school, being ordered by her creative writing professor to reverse roles of characters for her next writing exercise. Although, back then, I doubt that writing schools even existed. By the time her second novel was written, the amateur style of Watchman had also been straightened out. Should Watchman have been published these many years later? There is divided opinion on this. I’m glad it was, for although it killed the Mockingbird for me, it also enlightened me on the evolution of a writer....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Feb 24, 2019","Feb 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman

Although the fantastical eleA book that attempts to cover a wide geographic canvas of six eventful years in the life of a gifted and lucky slave boy. Although the fantastical elements of the story spurred me on, and the brilliant prose was a pleasure to read, I found some serious shortcomings that made me question this book winning the Giller Prize.Washington (Wash) Black is a 13 year-old slave in a plantation in Barbados. He doesn’t know who his parents are but is drawn to a slave woman, Big Kit, who cares and protects him from their cruel master, Erasmus Wilde, and from other slaves. The cruelty towards slaves displayed by their white masters is so bad (and so well depicted) that Big Kit promises to kill herself and Wash, so that they will be reborn in Dahomey from whence she originated. Erasmus’s younger brother, Christopher (Titch), takes a shine to Wash and acquires him as a manservant cum research assistant in a project to create a hot air balloon, thus putting a crimp on Big Kit’s plans. When cousin Phillip descends upon the Wilde brothers, plans go a-kilter and Titch and Wash are soon fugitives, escaping in the half-baked balloon; a trip that leads them to the ends of the earth: from the frozen Arctic to the Moorish desert, to London, Virginia, Amsterdam and Nova Scotia. They separate and re-unite and the underpinnings of their unusual relationship are laid bare, surprising us. In the process we get a rollicking good adventure story covering some of the pivotal events that took place during the 1830s: the abolishing of slavery in the Caribbean, the Underground Railroad, and early iterations of air flight, marine biology and photography.All this was great, but where I had difficulty was in swallowing the contrivances around Washington Black himself. This scared and scarred 13 year-old emerges as a skilful research assistant, educated marine biologist, project manager, prodigious painter and proper English gentleman in his speech and manners, all by the time he is 18 when the novel ends. As there is no indication that this is a much older Washington Black narrating the story of his teen years, one has to conclude that the narration is happenings when the events are occurring or not long after. Everyone wants to tell Wash their private affairs and stories for the benefit of the reader, including his white masters. I think the use of the first person narrator in Washington was a serious limitation of the book and forced these contrivances upon the author. A third person or omniscient narrative would have created more plausibility.That said, the first part of the narrative, set in Barbados, is very well drawn with the subtle relationship changes between characters clearly delineated. Washington is cast aside by his own kind when he is snatched up and promoted to live in the Big House. The Wilde brothers are torn apart with the coming of Phillip with whom they have had a troubled past. The constant fear that slaves live under is captured well, and this spectre follows Wash even after he leaves Barbados when a reward placed upon his head by the angry Erasmus attracts bounty hunters like the evil Willard. When we get to Wash’s travels through other parts of the world the narrative speeds up and the plausibility weakens. It was as if the publisher, believing the Barbados episode wasn’t enough, had ordered the author to touch on every significant event of that period and spice it up with a liberal dose of picaresque. And yet the whole idea of flight, exploration and attaining the intellectual heights that a slave like Washington achieves is a testament and metaphor to the indomitability of the human spirit. I pondered the book’s ending in depth for I wasn’t happy with it. After all the high adventure, why was this book ending like a damp squib? I ran through many possibilities: was the sandstorm a symbol for the blowing away of the fog after the frightful final revelations unleashed by Titch? Was Titch vanishing into the other world in an orange cloud, something he has done before (in a white cloud) in the Arctic? Or was Washington himself taking a walk south through the desert to his promised land of Dahomey? Was this ending mirroring some other classic novel that I couldn't quite put my finger on? I guess award winning novels have to get us thinking long after we finish reading them, and this novel certainly has that quality if you get invested in Washington Black, which I was not, given how hard I had to come to grips with his contrived character after he left Barbados....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Feb 18, 2019","Feb 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38140077-washington-black

Updike had Rabbit, Roth had Zuckerman, and Naipaul has Willie Chandran.This novel, the first of two Willie Chandran books cover’s the protagonists life until his early forties. It’s a novel about displacement and the quest to belong. Willie’s great grandfather left the protection of the temple to seek his life in the big city, a migration that was transformative, for he rose to prominence as a scribe in the employ of the maharajah of his state in India. Willie’s cowardly father went the other way, from courtier back to the ashram. It is for Willie to step up to the plate and find his place in the world and he ends up as a student in England, just like Naipaul did.Willie’s desire to write gets him into bohemian circles in London where his first book of stories from his homeland is published. Yet, Willie is rootless, lacking in social graces and class. He is unable to date a woman and instead sleeps with his male friends’ girlfriends, as he already knows them and is able to approach them for larger “favours.” He gravitates to prostitutes until he falls in love with Ana, a Portuguese emigré. The book then takes a dramatic turn as Willie gives up his blossoming writing career in England to follow Ana to her home, a Portuguese colony in East Africa never mentioned by name, but which I took to be Mozambique.The second half of the story in Africa is a told one for it is Willie now recounting his 18 years in that continent to his sister Sarojini whom he has returned to in Berlin. This part has a remarkable lack of dialogue. However Naipaul gets to expose the plight of the immigrant in this section. Just as Willie tried his damndest to become an Englishman in England and failed, the locals, who are African, half-breed or Arab, try their best to become Portuguese in his new home, for becoming like the ruling class confers the highest privileges. Naipaul describes the colonial farms run by the Portuguese gentry very well, right from the furniture to the lifestyle, to the side deals they do to amass money. Ana gets the legitimacy to run her farm with Willie as her man of the house, although he is even more rootless than in England, and very soon takes up with prostitutes, again. History repeats when he is rescued from the emotionless whores by falling in lust with Graḉa, Ana’s friend married to a drunk. The existence of this colonial society that was formed after the first world war is at risk due to the encroaching guerilla war, fermented by dissent, foreign support, and inequality. And when the transference of power happens, Willie lives through the breakdown of systems, estate take-overs, scarcities, and the transition to everyone becoming poor. But like much of Africa today, the locals who gain power then start fighting among themselves, snapping Willie’s last straw, making him flee, not only Africa and Ana, but his own wasted and deprived life. He accuses Ana, “I’ve been living your life for eighteen years, not mine.” Then why the heck did he go to Africa? That question is never quite answered, although race riots occurred in Notting Hill at the time. Like I found with the second of the Willie Chandran novels, Magic Seeds, that I read a few years ago, Naipaul seems to be losing his novelistic edge at this point of his career, although this book has a bit more legs to it than the sequel does. He seems to be more interested in exposing the social, political and psychological impacts of immigration via a thinly veiled story, than in the story itself. There were gaps in the narrative in places, for instance I didn’t know that Willie and Perdita (another of Willie’s London friend’s girlfriends) had lit a spark, I didn’t know he had given one of his prostitutes half a week’s wages—had an eager editor cut these bits out, or had Naipaul forgotten to write them in? That this is an incomplete novel requiring a sequel is obvious, for Willie is no more resolved at the end than when we first meet him. However, given my disappointment in the sequel, I wondered why Naipaul bothered to create this alter-ego. Naipaul was a far more interesting character in himself, and books like Sir Vidia’s Shadow do better justice and shed far more light on this enigmatic writer. I think Naipaul would have been well placed to have written about the real world, using his insightful observational and narrative powers to make sense of it for us, rather than to examine his complex life via Willie Chandran.   ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2019","Feb 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5853.Half_a_Life

I concluded that it was a bit of all three, and hence this combined treatment ended up diluting the focussed impact of a pure-play history, novel, or memoir. In many respects, this is a book about women as it is about the impact of war. Clara and her girlfriends, Mitzi and Erica, are part of a cohort of educated women, some with PhDs, who are breaking out of the mould their mothers had been encased in, one of going to university and then going home to raise a family and never work again. Clara majors in literature and philosophy and is exposed to some of the foremost thinkers of the time: Freud, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger, who were her professors. She studies Nietzsche and Kierkegaard and aspires to teach in university. Sometimes the philosophy overpowers the narrative, when Freud postulates at length from the podium, or when Clara’s philosophy professor, Emmerich, waxes eloquent on “In the absence of God, strive to go Up, not Down.” She meets and marries an Austrian soldier on the military career track, Albert. Class tensions surface in the marriage as Albert’s parents are working class and Clara’s are academics loyal to the monarchy. The book has two story lines: one from the ’30s -’50 as we follow these women traversing the genesis, the horror and aftermath of WWII, and the other in the present when an aging Clara has just buried Albert and is revisiting her memories of that previous dark but defining period.We often read books written by the victors, and, in the case of WWII stories, it is mainly written by authors from the Allied countries. What makes this book unique is that the viewpoint is of a reluctant Nazi. When Austria outlaws Nazism that is rising across the border in Germany in the mid 1930’s, and Albert’s brother, Theo, is martyred for being a Nazi, Clara’s fortunes begin to change. Albert is dismissed from the Austrian army, her father-in-law is imprisoned and Albert’s family assets are lost. Albert however gets a better job in the military in Germany where Nazis are espoused. He spends the entire war as a soldier in General Rommel’s tank regiment. When Austria is overrun by Nazi Germany, Clara’s fortunes are changed again: her father’s museum is shuttered and she is denied her job at the university as the subjects she teaches are considered too liberal. Even though she is the wife of a Nazi soldier, she is unable to escape the misogyny, racism, blackmail, spying and sexism endemic in that regime, culminating in the killing of a depraved SS officer in order to escape being raped.Scenes of war, especially the bombing of cities, are well rendered in Palka’s sparse but elegant prose. The randomness and suddenness of death caused by a piece of flying shrapnel, a firing squad, a hastily applied bullet, or a marauding mob of thieves in a country where law and order has broken down is a constant companion as we enter the war period. This suddenness repeats in the second storyline as well, when Clara recounts how her friends and relatives also died after the war ended. The cruelty and bestiality of humans in times of war is subtly laid out for our digestion. And the women dust up, suck it up and carry on, trying to restore a modicum of normality where possible while they await their men to return from the war, “when all this will be over.” The post-war period is farcical for the losers, when the de-nazification process involves lengthy tribunals, and when ex-Nazis (including children of suspected Nazis) are forced to visit mass graves and watch war movies with the accent on “You did this! This is your fault!”Some details are captured at their grainiest: “She held out her hand to let snowflakes settle in her glove, on the stitched ridges of the black leather, and on her fingers as they moved.” And yet there are times when the narrative races ahead recording details of people’s lives as if it is ticking off a family history. While I understood that the “racing” was an attempt to fill in the gaps of a 70 year period, this exposition took away from the dramatic aspects of a novel. I wondered whether Palka would have written a more effective novel if the story had ended circa 1950 and whether the focus could have been placed on describing the tumult of feelings raging during those war days? Despite the minute descriptions of certain events and characters, others were left out. For example, I did not get a clear physical image of either Mitzi or Erica, or of Clara and Albert’s parents—all pivotal characters in this novel.That this was a book personal to the author is obvious, for he is a product of these female characters that he so poignantly portrays. An engaging read for someone seeking an alternate history of WWII, similar to Irene Nemirovsky’s Suite Francaise, where we hear from the Other instead of from the victors. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Feb 03, 2019","Feb 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17133916-clara

Everyone keeps secrets, some destructive when finally revealed. The incidents are equally unusual: a decapitation of Biblical proportions, an exploding TV set, Grandpa Domenico’s fantastical life story, the whodunnit search for the real father of the Birdsey Twins. Then there are the syrupy, Nicholas Sparks moments: a girlfriend suffering from AIDS, a mother dying of cancer, tragic falls off rooftops, drowning deaths, SIDS, suicides by waterfalls, tear-jerking moments of atonement between characters. It appears that Lamb took all the elements that are considered necessary for a bestseller and dumped them into this book, and it took him 900 pages to accomplish that.The central conflict is the anger in Dominic Birdsey, tired of being his schizophrenic brother’s keeper from the day they were born. Dominic hungers for his mother’s affection which she showers on the vulnerable Thomas instead. Dominic tries to stand up to his bullying stepfather, Ray, to protect Thomas, and is not always successful; the scars the twins endure from Ray spill into adulthood. Dominic tries to protect Thomas while the latter is incarcerated in mental institutions, again not always successfully. When he finally springs Thomas from the Hatch correctional centre, Thomas does not repay him as expected. Dominic’s anger also ruins his relationships; with his wife Dessa, with his girlfriend Joy, with Ray; only his friend and brother-in-law Leo, himself a colourful character who fancies himself a Hollywood actor but is only a humble car salesman, sticks by Dominic through the ups and downs. Lamb re-incarnates the same conflicts in each generation: mysoginy, betrayal, secrecy, sibling rivalry and mental illness. Dominic, the stronger and healthier twin, begins to come apart at the seams and submits to the help of a psychologist, Dr, Patel, in trying to unravel his convoluted family burden. I found the sessions with Dr. Patel were too long, almost as if I was sitting in real sessions with my psychologist.Three story lines weave in and out of the narrative: the early life of the Birdseys from 1950 - 69 culminating in Thomas’s diagnosis of schizophrenia, 1990 and beyond beginning when Thomas self-mutilates in the library, and the autobiography of Grandpa Domenico Tempesta that Dominic is reading in dribs and drabs in the attempt to unravel who his real father is. I felt that given the book’s voluminous length, we could have ended when Domenico’s story concluded, leaving us with a hint of who the twins’ real father could have been, but Lamb went for certainty and for tying up the loose ends, and so we plodded along for another 60 pages. Given the setting, and the last half of the 20th century in America being covered, it appears that Lamb used quite a bit of autobiographical detail to plumb deep into this dysfunctional family story.Having finished the book, I sat back and reflected on what its central messages were: that success comes after plunging through trial, that secrets destroy relationships, that love surfaces no matter how hard we try to submerge it, that the sins of the fathers and grandfathers are poignant signposts for us in life, no matter how dastardly they were, and that anger needs to be sublimated. The title seems to emphasize that Lamb wanted us to learn these lessons, because he knew them to be true.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an engaging but long read.

A.N Wilson was Murdoch’s husband John Bailey’s student at Oxford. He affectionately calls them IM and JOB respectively. Wilson is conflicted about his decision to become an Anglican priest and is falling in and out of his faith when the Bailey’s take him under their wing, neither to encourage or discourage but to support and later promote his literary career. In the process, Wilson is exposed to the cloister-like literary and academic community at Oxford, where male professors ride their bikes to the college halls for dinner at night while their wives eat baked beans at home and look after the kids. There are tea parties and dinners organized by the Baileys which Wilson and his family are constantly invited to. Given this familiarity, Wilson finds it difficult to refuse Iris when she requests him to write her biography, and he is unable to probe behind the “affairs” she has been associated with due to his relationship with her. All he knows is that IM was a single child of Northern Irish heritage (she traded on the Irish connection a lot although she never lived in Ireland), was raised in a “trinity of love” by her parents and had no children of her own; she and JOB have an arms-length marriage, she absorbed in her work and a stream of lovers, he absorbed in his work and quite celibate, but both with an affection for each other and a bond that endures until death do them part. And it doesn’t end there, for roles reverse and JOB who had always played the support role to IM, goes onto become a successful author and IM becomes the permanent poster girl for Alzheimers victims.Given that her sexual adventures were out of bounds (except on one occasion) Wilson turns his attention to IM’s philosophy and her literature. IM came of age when existentialism was a continental fad and when the English preferred the narrower Logical Positivism; although she denied being an existentialist, many of her novels were existentialist and she also wrote a book about Sarte. A fan of Kant and Plato, Moral Philosophy was her official beat which she taught at Oxford and London. JOB and his colleagues beat God out of her, although she claimed to be religious. She was a Marxist who fell out with Socialism after the war and became a right winger instead.On the literary front, she meticulously outlined her novels before starting. She drew heavily from her exploits with lovers to write about people in love, usually upper middle class, educated people living unhappy lives with their spouses; extra-marital affairs were required to keep everyone grounded. She never portrayed lesbian love although that was her stronger leaning. She used family names for characters. There was usually priests and nuns grappling with their faith or the loss of it, a guru-like character who commanded his disciples (allusions to a couple of sado-masochistic affairs IM had with Elia Canetti and Professor Fraenkel) and the philosophy was sprinkled in as material that she had gathered, no different from an author who had been in the army throwing in war scenes, or a sailor adding in ships into their books. She refused to admit that she wrote philosophical novels. She refused editing and was accused of many inaccuracies. After awhile, her plots developed a sameness and she started to repeat herself. Wilson spend a lot of time in this book analysing some of the novels that made her famous and this is a strength of this biography, I feel.The tragedy in Iris’ story is when she starts to lose it. The house starts to become a pigsty with the lack of maintenance. The cars (they had to be VWs only) smell of animals and stale tobacco. Very soon, IM is walking around, shitting everywhere and crying like a three year old. What baffles the biographer, a frequent visitor to the Baileys, is why this eminent couple, with two million pounds sterling to their name, could not have hired domestic help and a nurse to help Iris in her last days. We are however spared the gory details that were made explicit in the movie Iris, based on the two memoirs that JOB wrote after his wife’s death, which Wilson considers resentful, misogynous and envious of IM. However, one wonders whether this was JOB hitting back for years spent in the secondary role of this power couple, for the ignominy of the “cuckold” title bestowed upon him by his free spirited and freely loving wife. We can only be humbled when we realize that this story is a great example of the frailty of life: the mighty shall be humbled in the face of death, and Iris Murdoch was not spared, just as none of us will be....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jan 17, 2019","Jan 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/253955.IRIS_MURDOCH_AS_I_KNEW_HER

A kid from the sticks with an over-critical mother, she has no relationships, abhors human touch, and is maniacally focused on publishing her second book of philosophy and obtaining tenure at the university she has been teaching at for the last six years. Academia is her way out of an impoverished upbringing. She is envious of a younger faculty member, Helene LeBec, who has just arrived on the scene after publishing her first book to critical acclaim.

Del finds herself coming under Lebec’s crosshairs.Del is also drawn to a hobo, Cody, who hangs out under a stairwell in the university.

But second chances do not mean better outcomes.There is no hope in this book, and I wondered why we would read it. For the fresh and punchy language? For the subtle exposé of academic life? As a cautionary tale about the long term effects of sexual abuse? Perhaps. But there is no way through in this book and its dilemmas, and the narrative subsides into admitting that sexual and power abuse just leads one way: to the complete annihilation of the victim. I also found my pet peeve of CanLit prevalent here: no location is mentioned, although LeBec is mentioned as hailing from Idaho—is this clever positioning for sales in the USA?What I took away from the device of using a frenetic and rambling narrator is that it provides an opportunity for selective revelation. Scenes can be revisited and new nuggets of information can be dropped without lapsing into contrivance. And for a book like this, where Del’s academic perseverance is at war with her inner demons of failure, that is a useful method of plunging us deeper and deeper into her scary world and creating an unforgettable character....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2019","Jan 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39794269-black-star

Homo Sapiens (us) is a post-truth species whose power depends on creating and believing fictions; therefore all religious myths and stories are fake news. Corporations are fictions. There were three dominant stories at the dawn of the 20th century: Liberalism, Fascism and Communism. Then Fascism died in 1968, Communism in 1998,and Liberalism in 2008, leaving us, in the early 21st century, without a new story. In reaction, we are reaching for old stories that are equally redundant: dictatorship, caliphate, Tsarism, imperial monarchy, biblical law, Sharia law, and nations are dividing along tribal, racial and religious lines.National governments were once effective at certain things, like education, healthcare, welfare and the taming and harnessing of large tributaries like the Nile that ran through many tribal lands. However, the three challenges facing us at a global level today are (a) the renewed threat of nuclear war (b) climate change and (c) technological disruption. These global challenges render national governments impotent for they can only be addressed effectively at a global level with the full cooperation of every country.The greater part of the book focuses on the technological disruptions in store for us. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing rapidly to the point of learning how to manipulate our feelings. Algorithms are waiting to hack us, not our phones or laptops, and this will come about when the merger of info-tech and bio tech takes place, when technology is able to go inside our bodies and not operate at the surface level only. The rise of the robot will render us “useless.” Relearning and retraining for new jobs will exhaust us, as it’s pace will only increase. Even universal Basic Income will be useless unless it is applied across the globe simultaneously. Human-robot collaboration, something that could delay this tsunami, will ultimately swing in favour of the robot as machine learning enables the robot to learn faster and deliver more accurately than humans. On the chopping block for redundancy are doctors, engineers, equipment operators, sales people, clerks, although nurses will be harder to replace for the human empathy they bring to their jobs. And yet not much is said about why we would rush headlong along this path, knowing the devastation we will leave in its wake. Even Harari admits that “just because something can be done it does not mean it must be done.” But who is listening?Given that he is a historian, Harari provides many examples of earlier civilizations that followed similar paths albeit with different technologies but similar outcomes. He debunks all religions, and in particular his own people, the Jews, for their “chosen ones” status. How can Judaism claim to be one of the three main religions (along with Christianity and Islam) with a mere 18 million adherents, Harari posits, when there are one billion Hindus and half a billion Buddhists standing ahead in the queue to be counted? If the Universe is 13.5 billion years old and the Jewish people only 3000 years old, they are a pretty recent happening in the scheme of things. The Christians are not spared either for giving birth to “Hocus Pocus” (derived from the Latin “Hoc est Corpus” or “This is the Body.”He throws out a few lifelines to hang onto: science fiction will be the most important literature for the 21st century, and as the world of work will be ever changing learning the four Cs (creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication) would be more meaningful than amassing technical skills.We arrive at the last chapter, aptly titled “Meditation,” exhausted and as cynical as the author. Everything we have come to believe in has been exposed to be a fiction by him. And then Harari delivers his messianic message: “If you want to know the meaning of life try to observe suffering.” I found this revelation a bit deflating, for “desire is the cause of suffering” is a fundamental precept in Buddhism that’s as old as... well...as old as Buddhism is. It appears that Harari is a devout adherent of Vipassana Meditation (the only form he knows), meditates for two hours a day, and goes on an annual meditational retreat to put some meaning into his life. He separates the mind from the brain, and admits that while science has made strides in understanding the brain, it has not been able to understand the mind, as only each individual understands their mind, therefore collecting scientific data on the mind will always be second hand. He holds jealously to his mind and will not surrender it to computer, as the mind is the last bastion of our sense of control of ourselves. While proposing that we all meditate as the answer to today’s problems, he also acknowledges that it would indeed be hard to get seven and half billion people on the planet to do that daily. So I had to conclude that perhaps this chapter should not have been written, for it came across as another fiction, one that only Harari and adherents of Vipassana believe in. Perhaps if we had surfaced all the questions and issues that were so well articulated in the previous chapters and left them at that, this would have been a more satisfying but frightening book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 05, 2019","Jan 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38820046-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century

He has a barb or a laurel for everyone from Aristotle to Vonnegut; ratJohn Gardner’s controversial book takes no prisoners in the literary firmament. He has a barb or a laurel for everyone from Aristotle to Vonnegut; rather sassy for a relatively less acclaimed author known more for his academic experience than his literary genius. I was expecting the logical approach of the academic who takes one subject at a time, lays out its pros and cons and then sums up before moving onto the next topic. Instead, I found his approach to this book like a dog attacking a piece of fleshy meat: ravenously tossing it this way and that in no coherent order, unearthing morsels of value in the struggle and then leaving it a shapeless mass in the end.I tried to come up with some distinct topics within his rambling treatment of this book, and thought I would lay them out in an order that made sense to me:Art: Gardner claims that art builds, instructs, never stands pat, tells the truth, and destroys only evil. He quotes Tolstoy: “art expresses the highest feelings of man.” He claims why so much art in the world is bad today is because the artist is not well-educated, wise or careful, cannot find beauty in the world, and is thus expressing his disappointment, pain and anger. Trivial artists reflect society’s trivialities. The intermediate artist reflects his time but hints to something greater. The great artist breaks through his reality, makes a new one, a better one, and makes it stick. Gardner gives the great artist permission to drink and womanize in reaction to bad artists. Sanctimonious?Morality: True art is moral. Morality is doing what is unselfish, helpful, kind and noble hearted, and doing it with an expectation that we won’t be sorry for what we have done. He then goes onto separate moral writers from those who have failed his test. Tolstoy, Hemingway, Faulkner, Henry James and Malamud make his cut while Mailer, Doctorow, Coover, de Maupassant, Barthelme, Updike, Vonnegut (trash culture elevated to art, per Gardner), Heller and Bellow don’t. He explains the debilitating guilt that the failed ones suffer from is caused by (a) the determinism of Freud, (b) the pessimism of Sartre, and (c) the logical and linguistic cautiousness of Wittgenstein. Love is the missing ingredient here; the moral writer needs to share affirmations of love with his reader through his characters.Modernism vs. Post-Modernism: Being a writer and academic during the period when these two forms intersected and overlapped, Gardner sides with modernism over post-modernism. He claims that the post-modernists seem to favour language over plot, texture over structure. He levels the same charge against other art forms, i.e. drama and music of the period. I found this a bit hypocritical given Gardner’s rambling arguments delivered through complex sentences, digressions and sub clauses that go on forever. He too seems to be in the trap of the post-modernists, indulging in their Linguistic Sculpturing, as he calls it.Fiction: This subject permeates the entire book and gets his most attention. He considers “serious fiction,” i.e. that which the writer starts off knowing what he wants to say and will not be changed in the writing of it, to be propaganda. He prefers the artist to work out of his imagination and have the work change, and change the writer upon completion, allowing him to alter course as he receives new epiphanies. Literary art is not mere language, but language plus the writer’s experience and imagination and the whole literary tradition he knows.The Critic: “The words of a confident critic can lock up museums, keeps books from publications, and enhance the sale of things unworthy.” He claims that criticism is easier to read as it doesn’t engage as many faculties of the mind. And yet it is incumbent upon a critic to highlight the noble aspects of a work as well as to point out what has gone wrong in that work—(I hope I am doing that here!) Most critics would agree, at least privately, that an “important work of art” needs to be (a) aesthetically interesting, (b) technically accomplished, and (c) intellectually massive.The Artist: He is kind and makes allowance for the creative artist, claiming that creativity has to do with an obsession, a wound. It is the pain of the wound that spurs the artist to do his work, and it is the universality of the woundedness in the human condition that makes the work significant. Displacement and the moving of homes, be it across countries or across the city, is common among artists and a pre-condition for success. Displacement leads to “a healthy doubleness of vision, to disorientation and emotional insecurity, the anxiety and ambivalence of the neurotic.” This argument than leads onto a discussion on “the artist and madness,” and Gardner quotes psychotherapist Jay Haley who says, “the artist is too complicated to choose a convenient madness.” The true separation between art and madness seems to be that the artist can wake up and psychotic cannot.Overall, this is a difficult book to get through. Gardner seems comfortable in his world of moral art with nary a thought for his reader who has to drag himself along for the ride, navigating a maze of convoluted ideas and arguments, arriving exhausted and somewhat enlightened at the end....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 31, 2018","Dec 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/596242.On_Moral_Fiction

Despite his socialism, he boldly postulated that “there is no dictatorship of the proletariat, only a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (who were once the proletariat).” This book covers the war years, takes a diversion into the suicide of Virginia in 1941, then moves onto the story of The Hogarth Press, and finally journeys through Woolf’s post war years when he continued to work hard per his Jewish work ethic, but took the time to revisit the places of his youth, like Ceylon, and summed up his life as “much ado about nothing” —in other words, his journey was better than his arrival.Woolf is candid in this book. He was not a fan of Israel although he was a Jew. He thought the Pope was an ass. Theology, metaphysics, economics and sociology in his books were phony. He was an atheist who believed in Justice and Mercy. He preferred imbecile children to be sent to mental homes. He decried the wars of 1914 and 1939, casting them as repetitions of human folly similar to the Greek wars of 490 BC and 480 BC. He held sacred the rights of the individual, the “I” that came to prominence during the Renaissance, so much so that drowning the excess puppies in his dog’s litter—as was customary at the time—was anathema to him. He espoused civilization and condemned barbarism, and yet promoted self-government in the colonies, urging the British parliament to prepare its far flung dominions for this eventual role—which didn’t quite happen, as was experienced in Africa and Asia during his later years.Life in England during the war is vividly rendered. The fear of bombs landing at any time, the charred buildings that were vibrant dwellings only moments ago, the disruption of transport and supplies, and the resulting boredom of spending hours to do what formerly took minutes takes their toll on the Woolfs, more so on Virginia; her depression returns with a vengeance. Intellectuals, especially Jews, talk openly of committing suicide rather than be captured by the Germans if they landed on British beaches. Virginia finally succumbs to her fears, despite her husband’s best efforts to save her.The section on The Hogarth Press, one founded on a shoestring by Leonard and Virginia in 1917, will be of interest to writers and publishers, of which I am one. Woolf stubbornly resisted going big with his press, which to him would have become a race to the bottom to cover mounting overhead . He compares books to soap in a manufacturing sense: the difference is that each bar of soap is the same while each book title is different and will experience different fortunes in the market. Despite its smallness, THP, amassed an eclectic collection of writers at the time, among them numbered Katherine Mansfield, E.M Forster, and T.S. Elliott. But the marquee name that made the press’s reputation for exemplary literary output was Virginia Woolf. The English translations of Gorky, Dostoevsky and Freud also helped. Ironically, the war created a shortage of paper and every remaindered book was sold due to pent-up a demand, a direct opposite from today’s reality where unending supply chases diminishing demand.Little is mentioned about his ongoing relationship with Trekkie Parsons, a younger, married woman with whom he had a peculiar living arrangement (after Virginia’s death, Trekkie lived with Woolf part-time when she was not living with her husband; the husband subsequently helped Woolf unload The Hogarth Press on a larger outfit, Chatto & Windus, that in turn was absorbed by Random House). Trekkie accompanied Woolf on his overseas travels as well. His references to her in the book are always respectful and avuncular.In the final part of this book, Woolf dwells on his travels, to Israel and Ceylon in particular. In the latter country, where he had served 50 years earlier for a period of seven years as a civil servant—acting as judge, administrator and businessman—he is feted and escorted with respect around the island. His first novel, The Village in the Jungle, set in Ceylon, had gone onto become an academic text in that country. But the villages in the jungle are giving way to the encroachment of civilization on Woolf’s later visit. The new generation of Ceylonese civil servants admit that things were better under the British, that the politicians were interfering too much these days. Having lived in that country in the ’60’s, I have to agree with them, although our man Woolf looks upon the land through rose coloured glasses and sees only the validation of his original idea that self-government was good for the colonies and that it had paid off in Ceylon.Woolf sums up his life by admitting that we all create a magnetic field around our selves that blinds us to reality, a field driven by our profession and ego. Extreme examples are publishers, politicians and popes. He faces the fact that the nearly 200,000 hours he spent on volunteer work to advance socialism was a waste of time, it didn’t change the world one iota, although it helped him realize his own insignificance in it and kept him sharp and active until the age of 88. Great humility from a great man who finally recognized the assets of old age: “the storms and stresses, the competitions and ambitions are over.” And through this recognition, he arrived upon the title for this final volume of his autobiography: The Journey not the Arrival Matters....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2018","Dec 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18838.The_Journey_Not_The_Arrival_Matters

I tried GaloEver since reading The River Thieves by Michael Crummy, I’ve been looking for his next book to top that classic but haven’t found it yet. I tried Galore, came up short, and then tried this one Sweetland, and came up shorter.This is a story about the settler community (is that the politically correct description?) living on a small island, aptly named after the principal character, Sweetland, located off the southern coast of the larger Newfoundland. Fishermen have eked out a living on this harsh coast for centuries, until the Federal Government declares a moratorium on fishing and pays to relocate the citizenry. Sweetland refuses to leave and ends up the last man standing on his isolated island.The premise raises the question of whether it is economically viable for governments to fund one-resource towns that run out of that resource and depend of federal largesse to maintain their lifesyle and culture. Why not go to where the opportunities lie, like the many immigrants who brave the long journey to come to Canada’s shores, like the Sri Lankan boat people who flit in and out of this story?In the process of Sweetland’s peregrinations across his island we are exposed to a host of eccentric characters: nephew Jesse is in a constant conversation with Sweetland’s brother Hollis who died 50 years earlier; Queenie, the smoking reader of romance novels; Duke who offers haircuts and shaves that no one partakes of except Sweetland; Loveless and his drunken wife Sara (now dead), another one reputed to be staying behind; Ruthie, Sweetland’s sister, who seems to be constantly visiting the Reverend; Claire, Ruthie’s daughter and Jesse’s mother, who also has her child by an unknown father; the Irish twins, the Priddles, born ten months apart and up to mischief on the island, not restricted to violating the rabbit carcasses in Sweetland’s traps and burning his stage down at the harbour. Many of these characters perish not out of old age but due to the harshness of their existence. Even the buffalo stock transplanted under sedation from Manitoba don’t survive for long. I wondered what happened to the Sri Lankans?We go back and forth in time, to the time a young Sweetland did in fact leave the island and go to other parts of Canada to make his fortune, but his attempts ended in failure and in some cases serious bodily harm; hence his retreat to the island and never wanting to leave it’s known confines again despite the fish moratorium.My biggest beef is that this book is so damned slow! Why do I have to be exposed to the constant daily activity of our hero Sweetland, which includes chatting with the other denizens on this island (before they take the money and run), sailing his boat to all sorts of nooks and crannies, trapping, fishing, and drinking? Is this what it means to get exposed to Newfoundland culture? Sweetland’s peregrinations get better when he is finally alone on the island and the harsh winter closes in on him. Even the seasoned Sweetland discovers that “no man is an island,” and falls into a downward spiral driven by unfortunate climate-driven events. Delusion is his constant companion, and he faces the prospect of death with no one to come to his rescue.In Crummy’s conclusion I took away that Newfoundland is not the Wild West, it is harsher; it is no place for single white men or women; it is a place for community, and when community is destroyed the land returns to its former self: a hostile rock beset by some of the world’s worst weather and surrounded by masses of fish that tempt the greed of man. ...more",Notes are private!,2,9,1,not set,"Dec 26, 2018","Dec 26, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24778574-sweetland

Patriarch Clarence Wilmot is a Presbyterian minister who loses his faith, follows his conscience, leaves the ministry and plunges into a hardscrabble life of odd jobs, impoverishing his family. Son Teddy seeks safety, will not step into a church after what happened to his father, and settles for a predictable life as a mail deliverer for the post office in a small town. Teddy’s daughter Essie breaks out of the middle class trap to become a Hollywood starlet, recreating herself many times over with husbands and facelifts to stay relevant and marketable—she is the quintessential survivor. And her son, Clark, embodies the disillusionment with the liberal-capitalist establishment, seeking his salvation in a doomsday cult. All Wilmots, irrespective of the career they pursue, are selfish, reflecting the individualistic drive of America during the ages they lived through: the two world wars, the decline of organized religion, the postwar boom of the middle class, the rise of the entertainment industry and its lure as an escape from the disappointments of real life, and public disillusionment with the American Establishment that has led to phenomena such as Trump, nationalism and walls.Updike’s pre-occupation with building the perfect sentence is evident in this book, for the eloquence of the narrative is an attraction in itself, easing the reader’s burden when sifting through voluminous historical, social and consumer detail that is offered to paint vivid pictures of the times these characters traverse. I learned that teaching Evolutionary Theory in 1926 was a criminal offence, and that although Methodists were allowed to go dancing and to movies at that time, they were prohibited from card playing, smoking and drinking. Sleeping with one’s agent, producer and director was standard fare for a budding starlet in Hollywood in the ‘40’s and ‘50’s —Weinstein was the poor sod who got caught years later, but guys like Harry Cohn of Columbia sailed through with impunity.Updike throws in words of wisdom along the way that makes one raise an eyebrow: “The abyss of non-attainment is Hell,” “It was for the New Testament to make known the doctrine of pain,” “The Jews could have stopped Pearl Harbour; they got us into the war because it was good for the banks,” “Business is scrupulous method and faithful repetition,” and “Money makes the man, pussy takes.” Essie’s brother, Danny, who joins the CIA, articulates US post-war international strategy: “Know what the other guy won’t stand and go to the edge, but not over it,” as opposed to the “invade and talk” strategy of the two previous world wars.Despite the voluminous detail, the preference for ideas over emotion (the dying man, Orr, has the most lucid and credible theological debate with Clarence, when I would have imagined him doubled up in pain instead), and the pre-occupation with beautiful sentences, there are interesting story-lines associated with these four generations of characters, culminating in tragedy. While Clarence’s story is tinged with guilt, Teddy’s is by far the least interesting, but that reflects his life as the dull postman. But Teddy’s progeny Essie and Clark more than make up for it, ratcheting up the stakes of the novel to a nail biting finish.This is a generational book with a twist on Updike’s Rabbit series, except that in this novel the generations are embodied in different characters of the Wilmot family tree rather than in the different life stages of the same man (i.e. Harry Angstrom alias Rabbit). It is a good reflection of life in middle class America during the 20th century, although certain other pivotal events like the Vietnam War, the drug-fuelled psychedelic revolution, and the Reaganomics period are left out. And other than for Clarence’s older son Jared losing an arm in WWII, the principal characters are spared involvement in any wars. I was therefore left with a question: what the heck had the title, taken from a line in “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” have to do with the novel, other than hint to Clark’s last stand in Colorado?...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 22, 2018","Dec 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85381.In_the_Beauty_of_the_Lilies

They meet at an office party and instantly realize that they are meant for each other. They are ambitious and plan a lifestyle way beyond their means, secure in the fact that David’s parental money will bail them out.The chosen lifestyle is a massive house in the suburbs with four floors of rooms (the mortgage of which is paid for by David’s rich boat-builder father, James), a desire to raise at least 6 children, and have lots of family get-togethers. The plan works up to Child #4, Paul. The four children are lovely and well behaved. Harriet’s widowed mother, Dorothy, spends a lot of time helping. David is always short of money and works two jobs with a two hour commute to the city each way (and James helps out again). The extended family drops in for Easter, Summer and Christmas vacations and the big house is always full (and James helps yet again with the grocery bills). And Harriet keeps churning babies out—all natural deliveries at home. This idyllic, indulgent and engaged life comes to a halt when the fifth child, Ben, is born. Harriet’s pregnancy for Ben is traumatic and painful; the baby fights inside her all the time, anxious to get out. She births him prematurely in a hospital. When he is born, Ben looks like a troll, a voracious eater who sucks her breasts dry in minutes; he yells and screams at night unless sedated, and he terrifies the other children who start locking their bedroom doors at night. The family gatherings dry up. Paul, the youngest to Ben, becomes a target and develops an anxiety syndrome that will last his entire life. Ben is diagnosed as hyperactive, but otherwise normal by doctors, but he is wrecking his family with his tantrums, lack of discipline, terrifying looks, and fierce appetite. He is a late talker, but when he does talk, he begins in full sentences. Dogs and cats start dying in the neighbourhood. The extended family convenes and, much against Harriet’s will, but with David’s full concurrence, decides to send Ben to a home for the incurables, also known as the Institution. Unable to bear this loss, Harriett’s maternal drive overcomes her and she goes after Ben a few weeks later and rescues him from what would have been certain death. What goes on in these institutions to children who are unceremoniously dumped there is frighteningly revealed. Later, Ben goes to school, but he is one of those uneducatables, the misfits of society who float up through the school system until they graduate illiterate and unchanged. The other children in the household seek the escape of boarding school and of spending their holidays with the grandparents rather than come home to Ben. In desperation, Harriet pays for Ben to keep the company of older, biker boys for whom Ben develops a passion and a loyalty. As he get older, Ben develops his own gang of older boys who drop into the now empty big house for food, to watch TV and hang out. They always have money, as news of muggings, break-ins and rapes dog the neighbourhood. It will only be a matter of time before they get caught and enter other institutions of incarceration. Harriet realizes that rescuing Ben from the Institution cost David and her the idyllic life that had been theirs, the dream that they had been living until he was born. David has never forgiven her for that and their marriage has drifted into silences and absences.Children never quite leave their parents, and Harriet and David’s dream is that one day Ben and his gang will tire of the big house and move away, leaving them free to sell up and move away too, into smaller digs. In the meantime she waits, and waits, and wonders whether Ben is part of a Neanderthal strain that lived at a previous time, a stray gene that incarnated in her womb. She sees how lonely Ben is, as if he is on the watch for someone like him, for another stray gene that took root in some other woman...Told mostly from Harriet’s point of view, this is a frighteningly true depiction of what can happen to a family with the birth of a child. All plans are up for grabs and can go awry depending on who emerges through the birth canal. I think Lessing was trying to say that we should be prepared to build lives around what we receive, instead of planning utopian dreams around what is desirable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Dec 17, 2018","Dec 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/546644.The_Fifth_Child

But Ove is more than just in this predicament; he is the quintessential old-timer: cantankerous, honest to a fault, reluctant to change, who sees things in black and white, who hates the 21st century and the next generation—“Nowadays shopping on credit and driving electric cars and hiring tradesmen to change a light bulb. Laying click-on floors and fitting electric fireplaces and carrying on. A society that apparently could not see the difference between the correct plug for a concrete wall and a smack in the face. No one could change tyres. Install a dimmer switch. Lay some tiles. Plaster a wall. Submit their own tax accounts.” Ove swears by Saab cars and considers all others makes inferior and a betrayal of good automobile engineering. He hates people who ignore traffic signs. He laments the loss of the simple things in life: “a roof over your head, a quiet street, the right make of car, a woman to be faithful to, a job where you had a proper function, a house where things broke at regular intervals so you always had something to tinker with.” He is a man looking to end it all by committing suicide. Ove also has a love-hate relationship with Rune, his old friend who moved into the neighbourhood with him before it became a sprawling housing development. Rune buys Volvo while Ove buys Saab, their wives get pregnant at the same time, they are on the Residents’ Association and have divergent views on lawn care, winter maintenance, perimeter security and other concerns of a small community. When Rune upgrades to a BMW, war breaks out between the two friends. But tragedy also stalks them: Rune’s son vanishes off to America the moment he hits twenty, and Ove’s baby miscarries when his wife Sonja has an accident while on holiday in Spain. Rune is heading towards Alzheimer’s, and Sonja has succumbed to cancer after spending a lifetime in a wheelchair when the novel opens.Ove spares no avenues to commit suicide, including methods such as hanging, inhaling carbon monoxide, jumping in front of a train, overdosing on sedatives and shooting himself with his hunting rifle. But his attempts are thwarted by his interfering neighbours who pop over at the most inconvenient times. In particular, the Iranian woman, Parvaneh, pregnant with her third child, is an overbearing but affectionate presence in his life, and the stray cat that takes up residence in Ove’s house begin to show him that, perhaps, life is still worth living. And yet, for querulous man such as Ove, re-engagement with life is necessary, and re-engagement comes in the form of the “white shirts,” government employees who are trying to take Rune away to a nursing home. A fight is in the offing, and fighting has always kept Ove alive.The chapters read like linked short stories, involving pedestrian incidents happening in the neighbourhood: a fall off a ladder, a visit to the hospital, a driving lesson, a visit to a coffee shop, a child’s party. These events are interspersed with Over’s suicide attempts and his patrolling of the neighbourhood, an old habit acquired when he was president of the Residents’ Association. I wondered why almost every chapter had to begin with “A man called Ove...”The ending is predictable and all loose ends are tied up, vaulting this book immediately into the feel-good category. The take-away for me is that there is an Ove lurking inside all of us as we age. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Dec 10, 2018","Dec 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove

Money allows you the power to contemplate, she postulates, while the room gives you the power to think for yourself. Intellectual freedom depends on material things and the poor artist hasn’t a dog’s chance. She then takes on the persona of a fictitious writer, Mary Besson, who goes to a sumptuous lunch, described in elaborate detail, and settles in the reading room of the British Library to cover the works of women writers dating from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. The state of the female writer of yore was terribly restricted: often burdened by a husband and many children, scorned for being intellectual, deliberately deprived of education, and having no money of her own or the ability to earn it (all family money belonged to the husband). A woman who chose the literary life was often shunned and banished to live on the margins of society, labelled a sorceress. “Women live like bats or owls, labour like beasts and die like worms.” Woolf cites Aphra Behn—a 17th century writer, poet and playwright—as the first woman who dared to make a living out of her writing. Woolf even creates an imaginary sister for Shakespeare and contrasts her life to the Bard’s; the latter has the freedom to leave his family in Stratford and immerse himself in the theatrical world of London, while the sister ends up the pregnant and discarded mistress of a theatre manager. It is no wonder that so many male writers wrote about women but so few women writers wrote about men. Woolf believes that Elizabethan literature would have looked a lot different if the women’s movement had begin in the 16th century instead of the 19th.As she ploughs through the centuries at the British Library, Mary Besson (Woolf) arrives at the famous female novelists of the 18th and19th centuries: Jane Austen, the Brontes, Mary Shelley and George Elliot. These women had narrow social lives, often not venturing out of their villages and never travelling abroad. Within the house, being of middle class, they usually had to write in the single living room surrounded by domestic sounds and disturbances. Austen often hid her early work from the eyes of others. Many 18th century female writers wrote for themselves and burned their work at the end of their lives, never published. And given the relative newness of the novel at the time, they picked this emergent form to practice their art. These female writers had no formal training but were skilled in the art of observing character and in the analysis of emotion. They went deep instead of broad and would never attempt a wide canvas such as War and Peace. Woolf praises Austen for creating her own sentences and excoriates George Elliot and Bronte for trying to write like men. “It would be a pity, with all their education, if women continued to write like men. The differences should be brought out, not the imitation.”Woolf then invents another female writer of her own time, Mary Carmichael, and suggests that in her broken sentences and sequences Carmichael is creating a new form, just as Woolf did with her stream-of-consciousness method; Woolf wants Carmichael to go further and explore the relationships between women in her novel, for up to that time women were often defined in relation to men.In concluding her essay, Woolf urges that writers should be gender neutral in their writing, they should be “woman-manly” and “man-womanly.” I wonder whether that was why she wrote Orlando? She encourages women to write more and write from a broad canvas. She sees a time in the future when as many women as men would be writing (well, if she were living now she would find more women than men writing). And she is vehement about preserving one’s voice. “Sacrificing a hair of one’s vision in deference to a headmaster with a silver pot or a professor with a measuring rod is the most abject treachery and sacrifice of wealth.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Dec 2018,"Dec 01, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18521.A_Room_of_One_s_Own

But the chance to read Dame Iris Murdoch’s last novel waIf this had been a book by a debut author, I would have set it aside after the first chapter. But the chance to read Dame Iris Murdoch’s last novel was too tempting, so I kept ploughing through. I ended up with mixed feelings.On the positive side, this book is termed a social comedy, and that it is, peopled by fragile, self-absorbed, trust-fund babies who will never do any good in the world but roam around navel gazing—except for Jackson, that is. Their sexuality and sexual orientation are also in doubt, for many of them gush with angst and loss and express their love in words but with very little action. The pivotal attempt is a proposed marriage between Edward (a trust-fund baby) and Marian (she has a rich mother in Canada) that gets called off at the last minute by the latter who then disappears leaving the wedding party in tatters and tears for almost the entire book. This event provides the drama and tension to galvanize everyone into colliding and pairing off differently, until everyone is matched up again, albeit with different partners. The mysterious Jackson, who appears out of the “derelicts who live under the bridge” to become Benet’s (another trust fund baby, and Edward’s country manor neighbour) servant, is a Jeeves-like figure, a jack-of-all-trades, who knows what these delicate upper class types need. He is also plagued by his own misgivings and guilt, and I never quite figured out what his dilemma was, unless it was the keeping of secrets from his masters as to how he resolved the wedding fiasco.On the negative side, there were many shortcomings in this book. When I read the opening paragraph that had sentences like, “The sun was shining.”, “Edward was good looking.”, “He was twenty-eight,” I knew there was trouble ahead. The sentences got more complex later on, but I felt that Murdoch never quite breathed life into her characters. They functioned merely at the conversational and the “grand theatrical gesture” level. Many of them—like Edward, Marian, Tuan, Benet and even Jackson at times—seemed to drift like people under the cloud of dementia, tired and unsure of their bearings, and I wondered whether this was mirroring the author’s own health challenges at the time. The characters blur into a sameness in their anguish. Jackson’s meticulous list-making, packing, and checking doors before leaving the house, Benet’s innumerable repetitions insisting that Marian had committed suicide, Rosalind’s constant assertions of her love for Tuan, felt like someone wrestling with Alzheimer’s and wanting to constantly get their facts in order. Digressions into philosophy, a Murdoch hallmark, were plentiful, but the timing was inconvenient: why the heck should Benet be agonizing about Heidegger when he is in the throes of organizing a wedding? The elements of novel craft were lacking: key items like Edward’s former relationship with Anne and Rosalind’s love for Tuan are suddenly dropped on us, and the whole Cantor-Jackson episode appears contrived. The novel’s ending was tepid.The lesson from this novel is that an author, or their agent, should know to quit when they are ahead. Given that this book was published during the author’s life and before she was officially diagnosed, it may not have done her any good, other than be treated as an experiment in a new form and style the author was exploring. And yet her determination to keep writing despite the looming health crisis is to be lauded. Also the fact that this was a novel with multiple threads, all of which had to be cleverly and intricately interwoven (sometimes she succeeded and sometimes not) would have kept Murdoch pleasantly challenged as she headed towards the abyss....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 20, 2018","Nov 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56089.Jackson_s_Dilemma

It is difficult A small sampling of Maugham’s writings that attempts to showcase his novelistic, short story writing and travel writing capabilities. It is difficult to select the optimal pieces for a single book from an oeuvre that spans 78 books, but the editor, Jeffrey Meyers, makes a valiant effort here. Given that the selections spans a 25-year period in the author’s career beginning from his first novel, Liza of Lambeth, his style evolves during the collection; from the ham-fisted Victorian omniscient narrator who knows everything and interferes constantly by making his observations and thoughts known on various issues and who pops into the heads of his characters indiscriminately, to the detached writer who merely observes and records actions and dialogue and makes the reader infer the lay of the land.As a novelist Maugham was concerned with social and political issues of the day. He rebelled against a rigid upper middle class that was as ignorant as the lower classes with its regimented domestic practices and habits, with its sense that God had entrusted Britain to rule the world, and who believed that sex and passion were to be hidden under the voluminous skirts of propriety and duty. Every male had to enlist in the army to be worth something and even then there were hierarchies within the enlisted: cavalry ranked above infantry. These issues are covered in detail in the only novel presented in its entirety in this collection, Hero, in which the returning Victoria Cross-winning soldier has been enlightened on the killing fields of Africa and sees through the sham of his ordered life back in England. When he rebels against it, including breaking off a pre-ordained marriage to his long suffering fiancée, all hell breaks loose and the frailties of the Empire are exposed. Only death can heal the rift and return things to normal for everyone else.In Mrs. Craddock, Maugham expands on this theme, inverting the role of the hero to a woman and giving impetus to later novels that came in this vein, notably D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover. The weak hero theme plays out also in his autobiographical novel, Of Human Bondage, where the hero is subject to humiliation in his younger years; I wondered whether Philip Carey’s club foot, the source of most of his persecution was a proxy for Maugham’s homosexuality that had to be kept secret in those Victorian days.Some of his novels are modelled on real life personalities. In Moon & Sixpence, Maugham conveys the final years of Gaugin in Tahiti, in the character of mad painter Strickland who gives up everything, including a promising medical career and a knighthood, to paint, paint and paint until leprosy eats away at him. Strickland is imprisoned by his passion, and his passion is to create beauty. The painter leaves instructions that his final work is to be burned, but his remaining work is recognized after his death and confers genius status upon its creator. The steady decline of the painter is wonderfully constructed and the irony of how the news of his death is received by Strickland’s English family is a bitter condemnation of colonial Britain’s stiff upper lip. In The Magician, Maugham models Oliver Haddo on the real life Satanist Aleister Crowley. Haddo is a striking character: insulting, bragging, and seducing openly with no thought to the anger and hatred he stirs in his wake. Haddo is intent on creating human life, but his evil deeds catch up with him; the finale falls into the realm of magic realism.By far the most polished work is The Trembling of a Leaf: Stories of the South Sea Islands, but I will not touch on it here as I have ed this collection in its entirety on this forum under the title of Rain and Other Stories of the South Pacific. The final pieces relate to Maugham’s travels. The first, ""The Land of the Blessed Virgin: Sketches and Impressions in Andalusia"" is an account of a younger Maugham full of daring who travels alone on horseback through bandit country armed with a loaded pistol (which he never has to use). His aim is to do a circuit around Seville, visiting remote villages. The area is barren and arid and his companions are mainly commercial travellers he meets in isolated rest houses; he is told that the only work for young men is the priesthood or the bull ring. He is open to other stories of the Andalusians who oppose the Spanish involvement in Cuba, who insist that Spain was never conquered, and remind Maugham that even Admiral Nelson was given a hard time by the Spanish. His return trip is drenched in an unending downpour and Maugham concludes that man is powerless under the forces of nature. In ""On a Chinese Screen"", we see a mature Maugham meeting with and observing the peculiar personalities in China, both expatriates and locals. Without telling, he shows us what time away from home has done to westerners. The last character piece “The Vice Consul” is particularly impactful where we see an American embassy official attending a local execution; his reaction at the expatriate club afterwards sums up the man and his predicament.There is more to Maugham’s work than this selection. But it is an executive summary of the work of a great writer who straddled the 19th and 20th centuries and who continued to hold audiences through novels, short stories, travelogues, stage and screen-plays, essays and reportage, one who was able to adapt to the times and stay current during his lifetime despite the tragedies and dark secrets that dogged him....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Nov 09, 2018","Nov 09, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31329.The_W_Somerset_Maugham_Reader

If they were indeed written as claimed towards the end Lessing’s writing career, and were not fillers sketched out during fallow periods between her other books, then she still had a lot of oomph in her late 80’s.I liked the first and third stories better than the other two. The first, “The Grandmothers,” told in an authoritative omniscient voice, covers the covert and happy relationship that existed between two women childhood friends and their sons. Each woman, unhappy in marriage or widowed, is sleeping with the other’s son in a consensual manner. The sex is not mentioned but is pervasive throughout. The women (and their respective sons) live in neighbouring houses by the beach; all four are happy in their older-younger sexual relationships and genuinely care for each other, and yet the pressures of conventional society that demand they abandon this incestuous life and cleave to partners closer to their age, and permit the sons to have families, starts to dominate. The mothers end the sexual relationships, much to the sons’ chagrin and sense of betrayal. The young wives can never be a part of the husbands’ lives and we see the glimmerings of what happened with the grandmother’s happening between the new mothers - an emotional bonding with each other created by abandonment. However, when the past is unleashed upon the present catastrophe results. It appears as if Lessing is questioning the traditional family model and positing that alternative forms are also viable. We are asked not to sit in judgment so that these alternative relationships can survive. The third story, “The Reason For It,” is set 7000 years ago in a foreign land, and is intended to be a first-person account by the last surviving elder that provides clues to how this civilization vanished. There are eerie resemblances with today when mass entertainment, military hegemony, the loss of libraries and other forms of culture are leading us into becoming insular, polarized societies. This civilization follows a typical cycle of Conquest—Consolidation—Destruction—Renaissance—Fall. In its final days, the new ruler DeRod is more interested in building walls around his kingdom, capturing slaves from other kingdoms to do manual work, closing down the Schools of the Storytellers and the Songmakers and spending that money on his military. The youth have grown indolent and are content just to copulate anywhere they wish, even in public and in mass orgies, whenever the mood inspires them. The sad elder also realizes that he and his band of wise men and women were also responsible for this debacle because they picked DeRod as their leader and that they fell for his charm and not his intellect. In these days of Trump, this revelation is very sobering. The other two stories read more like the life stories of their principal characters. Lessing uses the Limited Third Person viewpoint here but is unrestrained in intervening as the omniscient narrator when she wants to move things along or make a point. And this “moving things along” also devalues the craft of story because a lot of data is thrown in at times; it feels as if these stories should have been novels and that Lessing was in a hurry to finish them off quickly, so she would chuck in data to brings us up to speed in a paragraph instead of a chapter. In “Victoria and the Staveneys” we see the world through a working class black girl, Victoria, who is been sloughed off on people as her mother is dead, her unknown father is absent, and her adoptive aunt is dying. She spends an afternoon with a upper middle class white family, the Staveneys, and is shocked that every member has a room of their own. Circumstances keep bringing her constantly into the orbit of this family, where the theatrical parents are divorced yet well off due to the famous father, the older son is interested in socialistic and humanitarian causes, and the younger is interested in black girls. She has a child off the latter, and when reduced to dire straits, throws her lot in with this family. The result: her mixed-race child starts to drift into the white middle class orbit. Victoria herself can only get that far in this social hierarchy, and her other son, born off a very black and now deceased musician, does not even figure in the Staveneys’ plans. Her big reveal she learned as a nine-year old, that “white people do not see black people,” seems to be still playing out in Britain in the 21st century.The final story, “A Love Child” covers the life of a studious, poetic young man, James, from just before he enlists for WWII and into his middle age. The seminal event that shapes his life is a four-day affair he has with a married woman, Daphne, in Cape Town while en-route to India during the war. There are rumors that a child resulted, and reuniting with Daphne and this child becomes James’ sole purpose in life. When the war ends and he is sent home, the ships sail through the Suez Canal and he is unable to travel back to Cape Town until years later when he has already married and has a family of his own. What was most interesting to me was the account of soldiers who never saw combat and had to deal with the boredom of war, the harrowing sea journey from England to India via the Cape for 5000 soldiers who had never sailed in the ocean, and the passionate, dreamlike, four-day affair between James and Daphne. Lessing brings Cape Town and it’s racist society to life: when a white woman can walk naked in front of her male black servants and not feel embarrassed one is again reminded that “white people do not see black people.”These novellas, despite some of their limitations, are engaging and the variations in styles help pick up one’s interest between stories....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2018","Nov 02, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/400608.The_Grandmothers

Nevertheless, the fact that the manuscript was found in the wrecked vehicle in which Camus perished, and that it was published 35 years after he died, gives it a special place in the Nobel prize-winning author’s canon.The book covers Camus’ birth in 1913 until his graduation from school at the age of 15 in Algeria. The narrative is told by an older Camus (or Jacques, per his fictitious name) in his forties, who is visiting the former colony from France to discover who his father was, a father who left the family when Camus was a year old and went to fight for France in the First World War, never to return. The bereft family of the mute mother and two sons (Jacques is the younger) go to Algiers to live with the maternal grandmother and uncle. Life at Grandma’s is unhappy, impoverished and devoid of love. Grandma is the boss and beats Jacques for the slightest transgression. She also wants this gifted student to quit his studies and find a job to help keep the family aloft. Thanks to a benevolent teacher, the family is persuaded to delay their material gratification until young Jacques can complete his education for a higher return on their investment. Two-thirds of the book is the older Jacques’ search for his father, whose family migrated from Alsace to Algeria during the time of the Second Republic in France in 1848. Jacques has difficulty reconciling that his father died at 29 while he is now an older man. In the process, we are treated to his minute recollections of childhood. The complex but mellifluous sentences in this book are its main draw. Camus conjures colonial Algeria in her last days of empire extremely well. The French in Algeria are lost souls, persecuted persecutors, living in a land without forefathers or memory. When Jacques has to fill up a school admission form, he wonders what his nationality is, and settles on “French.” In Algeria, there is a distinction between the French resident and the Arab local, and there is the influence of the Spanish as well who occupy parts of Morocco next door and whose mother country and Balearic Islands sit across the water from Northwest Africa. Grandma is of Spanish heritage.We get detailed accounts of life with Uncle Ernest, the cooper; après-school antics on the commercial drag, the rue Bab Azoun; the “sugar cane: (aka the strap) administered by the otherwise kindly teacher, M. Bernard; summer employment stints that confirm to Jacques he is not cut out for clerical work; life at the lycee, including duels between students; outings at the beach and games played between children. The eccentricity of poor people of a bygone time makes for curiosity. Jacques’ later proclivity towards sensuousness is caused by his mother’s withdrawn nature and his grandmother’s cruelty. “Poor people’s memory is less nourished than the rich. It has fewer landmarks in space because they seldom leave the place they live in.” People struggling to survive have no time for affection.This book made me wonder why such detailed recording of history was important to the author, and to all memoirists, for that matter. Life in colonial Algeria appears no different to life in colonial Ceylon where I grew up, a member of the European colonial remnant. We did the same things that Jacques (or Camus) did. But why is it important to record? A freezing of time? Capturing a society that has all but disappeared? A quest for immortality? I’m sure it’s a combination of all these things. For me, reading this book was a validation that being a colonial relic is as hard as it is to be part of a colonized nation, especially when the balance is restored, nationalization takes place, and the tables are turned. The quest for identity and purpose for everyone becomes fierce at these inflection points....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Oct 29, 2018","Oct 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15694.The_First_Man

At least, that’s how this hastily written book that didn’t seem to have any other purpose than to blow out the first 500 days of Trump’s tenure as POTUS into a set of elaborate scenes, scenes culled from Woodward’s “deep background interviews with first hand sources,” as indicated by the author. To any avid follower of the news, the information in this book would be familiar. We know how Trump came from a 20-point deficit, three months prior to the election, to win, with a little help from his friend and late-entrant campaign manager, Steve Bannon ; we know that the president-elect didn’t have a transition plan; we read about the chaotic scramble to staff key White House positions, and the parade of resignations and firings that followed when the new hires couldn’t cut it with the commander-in-chief; we read about the disruptions and leaks going on in the West Wing, the “predators at the White House” as ex chief-of-staff Reince Preibus called them, each posturing for gain and for the President’s ear, something Trump actively encouraged. What Woodward is able to do is to string these isolated news clips into a narrative that plays out over the first year and half of Trump’s reign at the White House. Sometimes the scenes are redundant, for nothing conclusive comes out of them except that they help encapsulate the quotes of those “first hand sources.” Some scenes, while being descriptive of the “what” that is taking place, don’t delve deeply enough into the “why.” Some bits of information are revealing, for instance, when some aides hide or steal documents off the POTUS’ desk in the hope that he will forget about them, and he does!What is most revealing is the portrait of Donald Trump that emerges. Here is a president who never reads his notes or the background information on the issue up for discussion provided to him by his dutiful staff. He is a leader who runs by the seat of his pants and likes to make impulsive decisions heedless of their gravity and consequence for the world: whether it is terminating NAFTA or threatening North Korea, or pillaging the mineral wealth of Afghanistan. He is obsessed with trade deficits, unable to compartmentalize, defensive of what people are saying about him on the news networks, and wedded to using Twitter to blast all and sundry and communicate directly with his “people.” He claims to be the Hemingway of the 140 byte tweet. Staff have to get used to being dressed down in public, to being contradicted after a decision is made, and to being hired and fired via Twitter. Trump feels thwarted and muzzled by the “process” that a US President has to follow to get things done, and itches for doing the deal his way. And we get to sense that frustration too, for scenes around the unresolved situations in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Korea go in circles with discussion upon discussion leading to stalemates and berating face-offs between Trump and his military generals and/or economic advisors. His staff are constantly caught between respect for the Office of the President and hiding their frustration for the fifth-grader who sits in it. And yet, despite his many failings, Trump shows his humanity when he laments for the children being killed in Syria from poison gas. What this book brought home to me was that perhaps the US constitution needs to be modified to place less power in the hands of one individual. And how important it is to have a loyal and knowledgeable staff to shield the President from making serious errors of judgement. The book tails off in March 2018 and we are precluded from further insights into Trump’s historic visit to North Korea, the conclusion of the new NAFTA (USMCA), and the escalating tariff battle with China, to name a few. We are instead left with Trump contemplating testifying at the Mueller investigation and thereby triggering another resignation, that of his personal lawyer, John Dowd, who is dead set against his client taking the stand and perjuring himself.No doubt Woodward will be lining up the second half of the Trump term at the White House for a sequel. I hope he takes the time (with the sequel) to employ better syntax—even the Washington Post newspaper produces clearer prose than Fear:Trump in the White House does....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Oct 23, 2018","Oct 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41012533-fear

It seems to be a pattern with Oates who periodically takes everything she has published recently and sticks them into a book, and publishers seem game to take this on for the long anticipated but hitherto unacknowledged Nobel laureate-in-waiting.The collection is divided into four uneven parts. The number of stories in each part varies, and I couldn’t understand the reason for this sub-division. Was it even necessary? Family dysfunction dominates parts 1 to 3, while a surreal atmosphere lurks over Part 4. The stories are set in the states of New York and New Jersey, in particular around the small towns on southern shore of Lake Ontario, which interested me as I live in a small town on the northern shore of the same lake. The narratives are non linear and jump back and forth in time. Every story tries to introduce a new voice as its narrator, a new syntax, and this is impressive, in particular the voices of teenagers caught in sinister situations. A strong thread of predatory sexuality runs through the collection, and the stories engage immediately. The guilty ones are alluded to but never openly exposed, as the endings are often open ended to the point that many interpretations are possible— some would consider this a plus for the short story, but I need to have a bit more than a suggestion of guilt. The downer is that a lot of back story has to be covered on the characters and therefore there is a lot of “telling.” The most impactful stories to me were: “Jorie and Jamie” in which the mental illness of a child and its destructive effect on her family is powerfully rendered through the eyes of one of her siblings; “Wolf’s Head Lake” in which a woman ponders the likelihood of a sexual predator casing the joint among the myriad of lakeside cottages in search of a new victim; “The Girls with the Blackened Eye” in which a 13-year old is kidnapped and abused by a sexual predator and forced to watch him do the same thing with an adult woman; “The Instructor” where a young remedial English teacher develops an attraction for one of her students, an adult male recently released from Death Row; “The Skull”, a renowned sculptor remakes the shattered skull of a murder victim to assist the police investigation and triggers a revelation of his real character—but as I mentioned earlier, guilt is only a suggestion. The final story in the collection, “Mutants,” conveys the atmosphere of surrealism when a woman is trapped inside her Manhattan apartment during 9/11 and starts to act out of character. Much has been commented on the Marilyn Monroe story, “Three Girls,” but I thought that the more interesting characters here were the other two girls, and I wondered whether Monroe was a figment of their imagination and desire, triggered by their heightening attraction for each other? What impresses me most is Joyce Caro Oates’ versatility. I have read her novels, non-fiction, and now, short fiction, and she excels in all three departments. And the sheer volume of her oeuvre staggers me, with very little repetition in theme, other than for the Kafkaesque stain that spreads over all her work, a darkness out of character with the staid and sheltered college professor she has been for most of her life. Which goes to show that copious and diverse reading helps us escape the narrow confines of existence, and that imagination works better than experience when it comes to telling a rollicking good story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Oct 14, 2018","Oct 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/303607.I_Am_No_One_You_Know

It will certainly cool any wannabe’s ardour.Nathan Zuckerman, Roth’s alter ego, has just vaulted into the millionaire ranks with the success of his fourth novel Carnovsky, a proxy for Roth’s own Portnoy’s Complaint. The problem is that Nathan doesn’t know how to live like a millionaire: he still visits the neighbourhood sandwich shop, travels on the subway and is not very much into socializing. He has just left his third wife because he tires of self contained women and needs to find his freedom (conversely, his first two wives were needy women whom he needed to escape from too). The additional problem is that he is now considered a traitor by the Jews of Newark for having exposed all their quirks in his novel. He feels he is being followed, that the perpetrators mean him and his family bodily harm; how much of this is paranoia vs. reality is revealed as the book unfolds.Central to his paranoia is a character called Al Peppler who accosts Nathan on the street and sticks with him like a leech. Peppler knows everything about Nathan, and is a two-time war vet who was making it big on a TV game show when he was cut down to size due to his Jewishness, he claims. Peppler is now courting a music producer to get his exposé novel on the state of America converted into a Broadway musical, and wants Nathan’s opinion and approval. When Nathan shies away, he gets threatening phone calls from people demanding ransom money for a kidnap yet to happen on his mother; Nathan wonders whether the voice is that of Peppler.Nathan’s agent seems to know the answers to this condition, as he has managed many artists through their breakout phase with its attendant psychoses, and tries to get Nathan to scale up: date a Hollywood actress, be seen in society circles, buy a car, upgrade his wardrobe, get a bodyguard. Nathan tries to comply but he is stuck in who he really is, and with the guilt that perhaps he did let his people down with his breakout novel.The novel suddenly dives into the family as Zuckerman Sr., Nathan’s father, a veteran sufferer of strokes, suffers a fatal coronary. Zuckerman Sr. was a career chiropodist who was also a great letter writer, writing copiously to presidents and vice presidents to express his views on Israel, the Vietnam war and other hot topics of the time. Family members gather around the dying man’s bed in Florida and the dysfunction within this ostensibly stolid family starts to emerge: Nathan’s inability to talk anything meaningful with his father other than the Big Bang theory; reticent dentist brother Harry who followed the family expectation of duty to family over his desire to become an actor and consequently is having multiple affairs with patients and staff while remaining dutifully married to his first and only wife; Nathan’s mother who is reeling from the shock of caring for an overbearing husband over a lifetime and now has to deal with this final mile. Nathan seems to be the only one who has soared free of the family yoke, but when his father’s last word to him is “Bastard,” he agonizes whether he has heard right. Any other word but the dreaded B word would be okay, for that word would reduce everything he has aspired to and achieved into nothing. When Harry finally bursts out and corroborates what the father had said, adding that Nathan is a “heartless and callous bastard” and a “destroyer of Jews” the grim returns of Carnovsky are clear.  It appears that Roth needed to write this book to show the aftermath of his success as a writer. And the launching of a bestseller, especially one that exposes weak points in a community, is not a walk to the bank but the exchange of one set of traumas for another. Nathan Zuckerman remained a good alternative for Roth during his career as a writer, a persona to be assumed after a major work in his ouevre was published so that he could rationalize its outcome not only from the monetary but from the emotional, psychological and spiritual levels. This is a good book for those who are familiar with Roth’s work, and in particular for those who have read Portnoy’s Complaint and other Zuckerman novels....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2018","Oct 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29747.Zuckerman_Unbound

I wondered whether he is only the master within the tight frame of 20 (or so) pages, but when liberated to a wider canvas ten times that size gets lost?From what I gathered through the characters who meander through this story without leaving any lasting impressions, the matriarch of a prominent family in an Irish village, Mrs. Connolly, dies and people gather for her funeral. There is the young wife Elie, sourced as a wife for the older farmer, Dillahan, by his sisters. Ellie is attracted to the reporter Florian Kilderry who has shown up in town to ostensibly take photographs of the funeral. Okay - the scene is set - but nothing happens except for random conversations between various town folk who come across as a chorus of voices; they all seem to know of Florian under his present or another name. I was chomping at the bit by the end of the first third of the book. With nothing happening, I decided to put this book down. Obviously Trevor was trying to write a book far too clever for my sensibilities; for example, I picked this up from the Wikipedia reference on his final novels: 'Instead of one central figure, the novels feature several protagonists of equal importance, drawn together by an institutional setting, which acts as a convergence point for their individual stories. The later novels are thematically and technically more complex. The operation of grace in the world is explored, and several narrative voices are used to view the same events from different angles. Unreliable narrators and different perspectives reflect the fragmentation and uncertainty of modern life. Trevor also explored the decaying institution of the ""Big House.""'All these elements are there in Love & Summer, but they do not for a satisfying novel make. It seemed to me that Trevor was having difficulties pushing his principal actors to get out of the wings and start making mistakes on the stage, and thereby he missed some early cues. Or, this being one of his last books, he was at a stage of literary decline where his agent should have urged him to stop rather than milk Trevor for one more book, that in my opinion, did not enhance the renowned author’s reputation.

Yet, with her Year of the Flood circus, she does just that: traverse across the disinterestedness of art ( i.e. once being the classic poet and literary writer) into commodity capitalism. Many other authors stoked indirect publicity by their withdrawal from public life, albeit they did it by becoming recluses, not celebrities: Thomas Pynchon and J.D. Salinger among others.Atwood got her first agent in 1965 for her book Red Shoes, and it was, ironically, a British agent. Publishers were hostile to agents at the time who created another gate in the chain. But agents have managed to carve important territory that publishers have retreated from: editing, business promotion, translation rights, slush pile manager for publishers; they even do jacket design and marketing copy production today. A good agent also needs to tell her client when to stop writing, when literary powers are declining. York defends agents against the charge that they are the venial handmaids of capital. The best compliment for an editor would be, “What a wonderful writer!” The editor is invisible in the work. In that sense, the editor epitomizes the disinterestedness of art. The editor is supposed to work on the structural, copy, style and proofing components of the editing process. Publishers’ editors also works on Product Development which requires interfacing with sales and marketing groups, but it sometimes also includes commissioning titles and recruiting authors. They are encouraged to look for promotional points when editing books— the inevitable seepage of the commercial into the artistic. The loyalty of the author to the editor is well known; authors often leave publishers to follow their editors. Atwood is well “edited,” for teams from various publishing companies convene in Toronto for ten days to  her new work.But I thought this was a book about Margaret Atwood, not a book about the current roles within publishing? We conclude at the end that she has transcended the disinterestedness of art to achieve the full scale celebration of it. If you consider that she has full time staff interact with interest groups such as academic readers, film industry executives, translators, agents etc, she is not your stereotypical writer starving in a garret. She also stages plays that adapt her novels (The Handmaid’s Tale, The Year of the Flood et el) that only feed into the hype of her celebrity. Her website and social media platforms can take on other heavyweight social media types in terms of response rates from followers to a single (in her case, thought provoking) tweet. I was left with the impression that every book about an author is a subtle marketing plug for that author, whether we couch it in critical, academic or satirical terms. And this book was no different.And yet, there is one nugget of wisdom that she leaves us who trail in her long shadow: in this celebrity culture, she sees authors forming small presses as the way forward, just as she and a bunch of start-up authors began in the 1960’s. This cycle seems to repeat as writers mature and move up the chain and new ones have to create their own opportunities. I am glad that I started my small press eight years ago and have gone on to publish not only some of my work, but that of other deserving writers. Now, thanks to Margaret, I can dream (note: it’s only a dream) of the wings of celebrity encircling me one day. But then do so many other writers dream the same way. The authors' dream world must be saturated with these swirling desires. This is like the Lord’s Feast: many are called, few are chosen.

DC Comics’ Gotham and Metropolis both reside in New York City. The narrator, Rene, is a budding screenplay writer, and so the story is a combination of movie scenes, monologue, dialogue (with and without quotes), first person and third person narration, all wonderfully woven and easy to comprehend, making me now question the traditional form of the novel that we learned in writing school. We pan in and out of scenes as if we are wielding a movie camera: Bombay is initially “the city whose name can’t be mentioned” until we zoom into the Taj Mahal Hotel; Nero Golden, the patriarch, a throwback to a Roman emperor and now exiled in an upscale neighbourhood of New York City’s Greenwich Village, pans into an Indian billionaire who made his money in construction, hobnobbed with Bollywood starlets and laundered money for the mob. Nero’s dysfunctional adult sons (living at home with Daddy) embody all that’s wrong in America: Petya is a ADHD affected video game designer, Apu is a doomed artist living the hedonistic lifestyle, and Dionysius is gender confused and suicidal. Enter the young Russian femme fetale, Vasilia, determined to score a son off Nero, by hook, crook or proxy, and the connection with America’s First Family is complete. I learned a lot about the movies in this book, for Rene is unable to restrain himself from bringing half a dozen movie metaphors into each scene. And The Golden House itself reminds me of The Great Gatsby crossed with The Rise & Fall of the Roman Empire. Rushdie’s insightful and inciting observations on contemporary society filter unabashedly through his characters: a) The big bucks are in fantasy and non-fiction (when it came to films and literature).b) “Post-factual” = “mass market and information age troll-generated.”c) The reality-check for the immigrant is “the day when he accepts that the idea of return is an illusion.”d) “Guilty secrets make paranoids of us all” (with apologies to Shakespeare’s Hamlet, of course).e) “Faith dies when you are praying and suddenly realize that no one is listening.”f) Another way of looking at the elites, hated by Trump supporters: “Knowledge is not power, knowledge is beauty.”g) Identyism is the legacy of the Joker, and the reclamation of America from its super-villain is now the focus, arming oneself with love and humanity for weapons.Rushdie’s penchant for irony is abundant: Nero the money launderer, the dhobi, receives a pile of dirty Indian clothes on his doorstep one day, heralding his doom; the construction industry that made Nero is also the one contributing to his downfall; Apu goes to India to exorcise his mother’s ghost, only to become one himself; Rene attains stardom with his film on the Goldens only to lose the people he values most in life. Like Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby, Rene, is both observer and participant in the Golden tragedy. The story line is more movie than novel, including the dramatic ending where the principle characters get their just deserts while others suffer random deaths at the hands of the likes of active shooters and platform pushers. I thought the obvious foreshadowing that bordered on Bollywood could have been toned down, though. The House of Golden collapses just like Emperor Nero’s did (even fiddle music is heard during the inferno, but is not confirmed!) and I wondered whether this was Rushdie’s warning to The House of Trump? One can’t help but feel sorry for Nero Golden: for all the wealth and hubris he amassed, he also paid dearly for these transient, material gains during his life. He may have been a bastard, but he was a bastard with conscience—good and evil did reside within him, and within most of the principal actors....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Sep 03, 2018","Sep 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34128285-the-golden-house

Though dated, it has some pearls of authorly wisdom.Liddell breaks out the book into sections that deal with Literary Criticism, the Novelist’s Range, the Novelist’s Values, Plot, Character and Background, and sums up the book by bringing all his teaching into critical evaluations of Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw and the works of Ivy Compton-Burnett.In the opening on Criticism he has two categories: (I) Novels Worthy of Criticism and (II) Novels Below Serious Criticism. In section (I) There are (a) Good Novels and (b) Novels that might have been good. Section II is comprised of Middlebrow and Lowbrow works. He makes no bones about whom his favourite authors are: Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Gustav Flaubert, Henry James and Compton-Burnett. Among his section (I)b and (II) fall his less desired authors such as Aldous Huxley, Thomas Hardy, E.M. Forster, Marcel Proust, D.H. Lawrence and John Galsworthy. Edgar Wallace gets a passing mention, no doubt consigned to the Section II - Lowbrow category.In the section on Range, he delineates Experience from Range. Only fragments of a writer’s experience filter into his creative space to create range. A writer should always write within her range even if it is narrow, for one is able to go deep and not get lost in going broad - e.g. Jane Austen, Emily Bronte and Compton-Burnett who did not have much experience in the world outside of their domestic and social circles but kept their fiction within this milieu. Two novelists who exceeded their range and failed according to Liddell are Maugham and Isherwood.In Values, he argues that a Novelist should be a humanist above their political and religious leanings. Humanism is defined here as making for breadth, tolerance, equilibrium and sanity. D.H. Lawrence is pointed out as a failure here for distorting plot and character to serve his anti-humanist values. Liddell argues that the values between the novelist’s “writing self” and “worldly self” may differ. He emphasises the need for detachment of the novelist: “if Rome were burning, the novelist cannot be filling buckets of water, and must resist efforts at mobilization.”In the next two sections on Plot and Character, he agrees that the two are only artificially separable and endorses Henry James’s view that “Character is Action and Action is Plot.” He debates the “perversity” of the novelist and argues the pros and cons of developing a plot based on a single episode. Plots should result from growth not manipulation. In the Character section, he argues how flimsy is the disclaimer that “any resemblance to people living or dead is entirely co-incidental” - it’s more for the benefit of the bookseller’s assistant charged with stocking shelves with fiction and non-fiction than for the reader. All characters are selectively drawn from a collection of real life personages the novelist has come into contact with. He makes a distinction between “flat” characters ( i.e. Dickens’s) who embody single or similar traits and “mixed” characters who have strengths and flaws.Background, he claims, must always be incidental to character in action. There are physical backgrounds and the more dramatic backgrounds of the mind, the latter that authors like Austen and Woolf (with her stream-of consciousness style) were able to exploit to stronger effect. The background of the mind is also a strength of the novel, for other art forms have difficulty conveying it effectively. He rails at Gallsworthy for his minute descriptions of physical detail: “We learn about everyone in The Forsyte Saga from their furniture or food.”The final section, his critical appraisal of James’s The Turn of the Screw and Compton-Burnett’s oeuvre, is deep but as I have not read these works, I couldn’t get a full appreciation of it. I have made a note to self to read these books and revisit Liddel’s appraisal of them.I have only made a cursory tour of this book which is loaded with wisdom on the evolution of the novel and is a gem, for authors in particular. A Treatise on the Novel may now be out of print and been superseded by others that have extended the study of the novel. But I found it useful, particularly Liddell’s observations and quotes, as well as the quotations by other authors that highlight their deep investment and attachment to this form, one that continues to evolve and challenge us.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2018","Aug 25, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13389840-a-treatise-on-the-novel

The real-life William Holden Thomas suffered mental illness in his twilight years, and this is alluded to in Will’s erratic behaviour, but is never clearly spelled out. I mean, why would Will spend his last days shooting birdshot at passing trains?The novel is episodic, with the obvious intent to capture the chronological order of historic events as they transpired. This leads to an “up and down” pacing that never really reaches a novelistic climax. There is a lot of detail that could have been taken out in the interest of brevity. But the author faces the classic conundrum of how much to put in and how much to take out in drawing the landscape and the characters. The excess verbiage helps in that the Appalachian landscape is captured beautifully and the principal characters are well drawn. Some scenes—the duel between Will and Featherstone, Will’s nights with Bear in the winter house, the hunting of Charley, and the nocturnal escapades of Will and Claire—stand out. But in between there is a lot of telling and placing of the historical record.I learned a lot about the customs, currencies, and food of the time, and about how people survived off the land. New words like jimson (penis), linkster (translator) and chaffering (chafing) pepper the narrative. The difference between the indigenous and the settler also come out: The Indian kills to live, the White Man kills to trade; The Indian claims the land he needs, the White Man claims the land he wants. It is unfortunate that over time the Indian adopts the White Man’s practices. I ploughed through this slow moving novel mainly because I was interested in the history and culture of nineteenth century Appalachia that I had not studied closely before. It made me appreciate why there are so many indigenous land claims today—the White Man created the conditions for the dispute. Had the immigrants, coming across the ocean in shiploads, intermarried with the locals, as they seemed to be doing before 1830, without carving out the land between “them and us”, we may have had a more harmoniously integrated America today. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2018","Aug 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33896.Thirteen_Moons

Although we never find out what the two older boys, Ted and Terry (or was it Tom and Tony? Even the younger boys’ memories are selective about the event) did to the three pre-teens, it certainly scarred the latter for life, leaving them angry with the world. Phil’s anger is compounded with guilt, for, being an expert knot-tier, he is forced by the attackers to tie the other two boys up. It takes no stretch of imagination to know what happened, but Quarrington plays with effects not the gory details. The boys grow into adulthood to become artists: Phil, a playwright turned TV screenplay writer turned novelist; and Jay a classical pianist until his anger boils over and he damages his promising career, leaving him to thump piano keys in a bar. Both brothers have troubled personal relationships, between each other, and with their spouses who all end up exes. Only Norman escapes the ravine of their souls to become a priest and have a normal family.The book converges along two story lines: the first from Phil’s early days as an artist, pre-marriage to budding actress Veronica (Ronnie), and the second from his post-breakup with Ronnie when he is writing his autobiographical novel and trying to recall and reconcile with what happened in that damned ravine, the source of all his emotional unrest. Phil admits that he is a novice at novel writing and that his prose is pedestrian (I have to agree, the humour notwithstanding), and mixes screenplay format with novel format to get his points across; he also uses a telephone call at the end of each chapter with one of the characters in the story, during which Phil is seen furiously trying to find out information about the past, especially about what happened in that ravine. The story lines, once merged, take the brothers on a hilarious road trip to find Norman in distant Thunder Bay, Ontario, the one person they believe has the answers to their dilemma. And he has: “Evil is a choice, and forgiveness, including forgiving oneself, is the answer.” Easy for a priest to say, hard for artists to practise, especially siblings.Phil admits that being a novelist was his true calling and that instead he sold his soul to TV for the “rivers of money” to be made in that industry. We are treated to insights in the life of an executive producer in the television industry. Quarrington must be laughing from the other side of the grave at the shenanigans now emerging in that industry with respect to sexual harassment, which are par for the course in this novel. He also pokes fun at this business where with the copying of a couple of plot devices from books or films one can turn a new “teevee” program into a money spinner. Ironically, the plot devices that provide Phil with his success also play out in real life for him, damning and saving him in equal measure.Of course, like in TV, all conflicts must be resolved before the show ends, and Quarrington does that well by implanting a contrived bad guy in the last chapter, and using Phil’s rope tying skills to...well...tie all the loose ends.I kept reading this easy-read because the humour and original jokes took me beyond Phil’s disjointed narrative. The repetitious arguments between the brothers, and between Phil and Ronnie, mundane though they become, also provide insight into their flawed characters. Some of the larger-than-life characters such as Hooper (Giller prize-winning author), Edward Milligan (star actor) and Rainie (Phil’s mercy fuck during his estranged days) provide added colour.The humour lightened the dark theme of rape and its lasting damage on the victim(s), and watered down the impact for me. Given that Quarrington was a humorist, he obviously chose to tell this story laced with laughter, a sure-shot way to garner readers in our genteel North American culture that has difficulty dealing with unpleasant themes (hence probably why we never see what went on in that ravine). I wonder how he would have fared had he chosen to bare the evil that took place, in all its starkness and misery?  ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Aug 06, 2018","Aug 06, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1411801.The_Ravine

A cycle of child abduction plays out through the generations, as child finder Naomi, herself a victim of kidnapping and confinement during her childhood tries to solve the disappearance of 5-year-old Madison, now missing for three years.Naomi is a driven, closed person fleeing her own nightmares as she develops her child finder reputation. Not all her children are rescued alive but her efforts help the families gain closure. In the Madison case, Naomi returns to her roots, to where she was found as a runaway 9-year-old with no memory of her past, in the snow-covered backwoods and mountains of Oregon. She was adopted by the kind widow, Mrs. Cottle, who specializes in taking in abandoned kids. The indigenous boy, Jerome, also one of Mrs. Cottle’s charges, forms an indelible bond with Naomi.Madison is a gifted child who learns to cope in captivity by assuming the persona of one of her fairy tale characters, the Snow Angel. The unusual element of this story is that the reader is exposed to the narrative voices of Naomi, Madison and the little girl’s captor, a deaf mute known only as Mr. B. It is hard to feel anger towards Mr. B despite the unspeakable things he does to Madison, for he too is a damaged person, kidnapped when he was Madison’s age and never rehabilitated to society. The story moves back and forth in time in short chapter breaks that shift point of view continuously. I found this to be the weakness of the book for the movement is slow. I felt 50 pages could have been cut out of this book without missing a beat. And yet the slow pace helped build not only the haunting landscape of the Oregon interior during winter and it’s quirky people like the Murphys, but it also built a landscape of the minds of these damaged people. “In the spectrum of hurt it is better for a child to be attached to her abuser than to face the hole of neglect,” is a fact that rings out clearly when we see how attached Snow Angel becomes to Mr. B, accepting his abuse and his imprisonment, sleeping in his bed and facing his tantrums rather than challenge him or try to escape. She even helps to civilize him by introducing him to play and to take baths. And yet one part of her retains the dream of escape into the world she came from, for she ties little scraps of yellow ribbon on trees under the sight line of Mr. B in the hope that one day the rescuers will come for her. Madison’s three years of captivity become a proxy for the missing years in Naomi’s childhood which is not covered in this book. I also thought that despite her giftedness, Madison was drawn as a much older child than a 5-8 year old.A sub-plot lands out of nowhere in the middle of the book, when Naomi takes on and solves the disappearance of another child, Baby Danforth. The two cases are unrelated and I wondered whether this had been inserted to deepen and complicate the story line that was plodding along extremely slowly up to this point. At least, it highlighted to us that Naomi is not always rewarded with the outcome she is seeking.As the Madison investigation intensifies, Naomi reaches deeper into her own past and regurgitates her lost years and the reasons for her intense detachment and remoteness from people. Jerome helps her face up to the fact that she is able to love without fear and does not have to keep running. And in her delving she uncovers that she was not the only one kidnapped back in her childhood—setting us up perfectly for the sequel to follow, when Naomi is bound go on the trail of that other missing child from twenty years ago, one she blames herself for losing in her flight for safety.This book provides a good perspective of child kidnapping from the victim’s point of view, for Naomi, Madison and Mr. B are all victims of this horrible crime, and even though we have to choose sides between them, the real criminal is the abuse itself. Victims like Naomi cannot rest until another victim is found...and another. There is no rest for the abused, the book seems to say, they have to keep running....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2018","Jul 28, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/32223884-the-child-finder

Creative writing has mushroomed from 77 programs across North America in 1977 to over 900 today. Every aspect of the craft has been analyzed and categorized, and every attempt is being made to extend the form through these programs. One gets the sense that it is impossible to become a creative writer today unless one takes one of these courses.The book is a smorgasbord of essays written by teachers of creative writing. The subjects vary from the “how to”s of the various forms (poetry, prose, scriptwriting, blogging etc.) to subtle selling pitches for various programs by the highlighting of their unique approaches to teaching the craft, to snapshots of life in the classroom, to glimpses into the lives of the teachers and students. Women in writing is an area of exploration, as is the lamentation on funding cuts to creative writing programs in Canada. I felt the chafing that is going in universities where often the creative writing program is subservient to its colonial master, the English Department.One essay deals with the challenge faced in teaching creative writing to students, especially overseas students, who have always learned by rote; in this instance, there is a need to “unlearn” past habits and arrive at “point zero” in order to begin the creative writing journey. This prompted me to ask the question: Can one ever be taught creative writing? As a former student of one of these programs, I grant that a student can learn the finer points of craft from such a course, but the writing comes from within, from an area that no creative writing program can reach.I was intrigued by Priscila Upal’s essay on adaptation—the adaptation of ancient myths to portray contemporary personal stories—for I saw a connection with my novel The Ulysses Man that I wrote several years ago, where I modelled the travels of Odysseus to the modern immigrant story. I also liked the essay on writing sex scenes. and promised myself never to use metaphor in that context again. The reference to the writer as a keeper of secrets, where the subtle is preferred over the overt, was a refreshing perspective. What I didn’t like was the academic buzz-words that infest this book: pedagogy, textual, intertextual, patriarchy, decolonization, agency; these words are overused in practically every essay. Given that this is a book about creative writing, I wished that more variety had been used in word choice.There is universal agreement that the greatest contribution literature makes to society is empathy, which leads to social cohesion. But what of the teacher? Stephanie Bolster sums up the life of the creative writing instructor when she says, “A writer in academe gives up the freedom to write—in exchange for the freedom from poverty and perhaps obscurity.” Which prompted another question in my mind: Is the creative writer who seeks the safety of academe truly a courageous soul putting himself out to the winds to collect material for his work? How does one, who plays it safe, teach the really good writer who wants to take the risk?

Henry is prematurely impotent from a heart medication and undergoes a mind altering operation to fix his ailment so that he can go on banging his dental assistant and salvage his manhood. Henry dies during the procedure and Nathan attends his funeral in New Jersey. Then it is revealed that Harry has survived the operation, experienced an epiphany, and deserted his family for Israel to take up arms with a pro-settlement renegade named Lippman. Then comes another reversal: we find out that it is Henry who is attending Nathan’s funeral, and it is the latter who had the sexual dysfunction and went through the unsuccessful operation to secure the fealty of his younger wife. My head was spinning at this point and I decided to focus on the dialogue and on Roth’s commanding narrative style to find out what the heck he was trying to convey through this novel.I’m inclined to believe that both stories, Nathan’s and Henry’s death scenarios, are fictitious and that Roth (through his alter ego, Nathan) is suggesting that we are all each others’ authors, that it is only through others that our lives get their shapes and their stories. He also uses this novel to go into voluminous discussions on what it is to be Jew in America vs. a Jew in Israel. The former is an assimilated part of the New World, wielding the power levers of finance and culture, while the latter is a colonizer determined to squash the encircling Arabs with a display of raw power. Both types of Jewry are estranged from each other; Henry is trying to be the bridge between the two but he doesn’t quite make it in this book. As Nathan summarizes in a letter to Henry (there are a lot of letters in this novel , a bit of a cop-out when Roth is stuck to explain a point): “ You’ve become a Jewish activist, a man of political commitment, driven by ideological conviction, studying the ancient tribal tongue and living sternly apart from your family, your possessions, and your practice on a rocky hillside in biblical Judea. I’ve become a bourgeois husband, a London homeowner, and at forty five, a father-to-be, married this time to a country-reared, Oxford educated English woman. You have a land, a people, a heritage, a cause, a gun, an enemy, and a mentor. I have none of these things.”The Jew vs. Gentile conflict is also explored, for Nathan finds his wife’s (his fourth wife and the first to bear him a child) family to be both overtly and assertively anti-Semitic. He provokes a quarrel with her in order to explore this prejudice further and ends up estranged again. In the process he learns that he doesn’t do “pastoral” very well, but needs to be constantly embroiled in conflict in order to thrive. I suspect that this material comes from personal experience, for Roth did live with actress Clair Bloom in England for several years, a relationship that ended in acrimony. He was also the second brother in his family, and in real life lived the inversion of the fictitious Nathan and Henry roles, a form of counterlife.The other subject that is heavily on the table is male sexuality, a subject deeply associated with Roth’s oeuvre. And this subject is bookended with the imagery of impotent men in their forties at the beginning of the book and a tumescent and healthy circumcised penis at the end of the novel. In the middle we see the lengths that men will go to restore their libido, the life force that drives them, according to Roth. Less developed themes were those of sibling rivalry, the soft genocide ( a.k.a. Jews marrying Gentiles in America) and the mouth as a sexual organ (imagine the life of a dentist if this were so!)Apart from the intellectual arguments and the frenetic humour, I was left unfulfilled by this novel. And that could very well be because there was no real conclusion. Who really died and who lived in this book is never answered. Were the disparate chapters merely Nathan’s writing experiments for future novels, for surely there were more Nathan Zukerman novels that Roth produced after this one?One thing I took away from the book was that for a writer like Roth, the fictitious world was part of his real world and that he couldn’t function in the real world without his fictitious one. Perhaps with the blending of what could have been a real story (Henry’s death, or vice versa) with a fictitious one (Nathan’s death, or vice versa) we see this counterlife illustrated. Take your pick, for it is us readers who give these characters (and their author) their interpreted life stories.READING PROGRESSStarted Reading Add a dateJuly 7, 2018 – ShelvedJuly 7, 2018 – Finished ReadingPost a comment »COMMENTS (showing 1-2 of 2)date    newest »...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2018","Jul 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11655.The_Counterlife

Greene not only wrote to escape, he escaped to places far beyond the safe reaches of his British Empire to tempt death and assuage his manic depressive impulses.Unlike his previous autobiography, A Sort of Life, this book begins with the writing of his first published novel, The Man Within, and takes us through the circumstances that led to and resulted from him writing each subsequent piece in his large and diverse oeuvre. He was a typical journeyman writer in his early days, working on an “entertainment” and a serious novel at the same time, constantly in debt to his publisher, writing 500 words a day (or 2000 when he was on Benzedrine while writing The Confidential Agent and The Power and the Glory simultaneously). He claims six weeks of Benzedrine killed his marriage, but his itinerant and solitary lifestyle and brothel-child proclivity did not leave much room for family. Later, in Indo-China while writing The Quiet American, he graduated to opium. Greene is critical of his writing: he admits to a terrible misuse of simile and metaphor, to an excess of adjectives and explanations of motives. He preferred the novel to the short story: the former allowed him to roam not knowing which plot twist or new character was around the corner. Although not considered an intellectual, his insights into human nature and the art of writing abound: “True glory is private and discreet and fully realized in solitariness,” “To an Englishman war is like passion, to a Frenchman war is like adultery,” “Love isn’t safe when pity is prowling around,” “To a novelist, his novel is his only responsibility.”Greene never saw combat, being born too young for WWI and too old for WWII, but he served in the British Secret Service (I suspect for his entire life, hence his access to various hot-spots and colourful political personages) during the 1940’s. His solitary world became a shadowy world too; among his colleagues numbered double agent Kim Philby who critiqued Greene’s novel The Human Factor while hiding out in Russia. The 1950’s saw Greene as a travelling journalist, landing in international conflagration points: Cuba, Paraguay, Mexico, the Philippines, West Africa, the Belgian Congo, Panama, Haiti, Vietnam, Israel, Kenya among others. Much like his fascination with Russian Roulette during his teen years, he exposed himself to situations where death could come randomly, but like the miracle portrayed in his classic The End of the Affair, God seems to have saved him for a higher purpose, that of revealing his learning to us in gripping novels coming out of those experiences. Not all places produced novels: the Philippines and Kenya did not; “A writer doesn’t choose his subject, it chooses him.”He pushed the envelope in his writing: J.B Priestley sued Greene for the character, Savory, in Orient Express who was apparently modeled on him; Twentieth Century Fox sued Greene for a derogatory comment made about child-star Shirley Temple in a film ; Paraguayan dictator Stroessner didn’t like him, although Greene travelled in that country and set Travels with My Aunt and The Honorary Counsel there; the Americans declared him persona non-grata for having joined the Communist party during his youth.A Burnt Out Case was to be his last novel (ironically it was the first Greene novel I read before applying immediately for permanent residence in Greeneland) for he was truly burnt out from his travels at the time. But like all consummate writers who need to write to breathe, he went onto produce more books, some even after this autobiography was written.In typical Greene fashion, he ends the book discussing the Other: a person who impersonates Graham Greene and usurps his glory. There are many Other sightings and transgressions that Greene is held responsible for. Greene even begins to believe that he is the Other and leaves us with the question: Who is the real Graham Greene?

No bones about it, 800 years of colonization, along with an uncompromising religion, produced a terrible legacy of poverty, hunger and guilt relieved only by humour and alcohol.This book covers Frank’s life journey out of America, where he was born and raised until age four, back to Ireland, and until he returns to the Land of the Free at the age of eighteen. The eldest in a family where younger siblings are destined to die unless they have strong survival instincts, Frank grows up early in the presence of an alcoholic and irresponsible father, Malachy, who could never hold down a job and who drank away his earnings. Changing his younger siblings diapers and looking after them when he was not quite out of diapers himself, Frank learns self-reliance and survival on the mean and cold streets of Dublin where consumption is the biggest killer. Everyone is eternally hungry, everyone is unwashed and dirty, everyone is yoked to a life of unending misery. That is my one criticism of this book—there is too much misery! The only escape is join the war effort; then one is able to send home money from the front, making proper meals possible again for the family. The war creates a two-tier society back home: those who receive telegrams with money and those who don’t. The other escape is America, the beacon that Frank yearns for, for after all, he is an American living in this shithole of his ancestors.Frank’s Ireland also envelops its inhabitants with guilt. Frank’s guilt is legion:a) Sleeping with the older and consumptive Theresab) Wanking in the field while the cows and sheep look on. I saw shades of Joyce here— someone always wanks in the open in a good Irish book.c) Slapping his mother in anger over her sleeping with the landlord.d) Smoking with his friends.e) Drinking at age sixteen and heading down that giant path to perfidy carved out by his father.When Malachy vanishes to England to work and send money home (he never does) the family gets evicted and is forced to live with a crippled man who lives in an attic. The new landlord offers them board in exchange for favours from Frank’s still-young mother, Angela, by night; and he expects Frank to empty his chamber pot by day. Frank detests his mother’s forced “duty.” He quits school and works at the post office delivering telegrams, and becomes a letter writer to a debt collector, counting his pennies for when he could escape this sorry place. Finally, he has to top up his savings to make his passage fare across, and he does that by robbing his employer. In this environment, I think the robbery is justified.The strong feature in this book is not the hard luck story of a dirt-poor Irish family. There are many of those. What sticks in the mind is the way in which it is narrated: with quote-free dialogue, in the quirky vernacular of the Irish, and peppered with a myriad of humorous and tragic situations that Frank and his family find themselves in. Imagine toddlers woken up in the middle of the night by a drunken father to sing old battle songs of Ireland, or a little boy climbing on a table to reach the attic and bring down a fully loaded chamber pot smelling to the high heavens of excrement and urine, or the “excitement” that a pubescent and naked Frank experiences when he is out in the fields trying to dry his clothes. Imagine traditions where a father takes his son out to the pub for his first pint on his 16th birthday, or a rite of passage where you can’t take a girl out if you don’t smoke? Although supposed to be a memoir, this book certainly is Dickensian in its treatment.When Frank finally arrives in America, his first night in his new home is enough to wipe out all the guilt, pain and sadness of Ireland. Instead of adding a spoiler and telling you what happens to Frank on that night of mind-bending pleasure, I will end with the last line of the book, “My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn’t this a great country altogether?” And in answer, we are pointed to the one-word final chapter that follows: ’Tis. Which is ironically the title of the second book in this memoir trilogy. Frank may have learned survival in Ireland, but he certainly learned his marketing in America....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jun 14, 2018","Jun 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/252577.Angela_s_Ashes

It’s a novel about friendship, and their friendship and love for each other transcend the physical limits of their bodies.Larry and Sally are orphans from the west, while Charity and Sid are from prosperous east-coast families, brought together in academia where the two men are employed as university professors.

It was also his last.Stegner takes the time to paint academics as an insecure, cliquish, class conscious bunch of intellectual snobs to whom credentials matter more than creativity, and who pursue the security of tenure relentlessly. Their speech is littered with literary allusions and they read poetry at parties. This was at a time when “literature mobilized the masses and poetry brought thousands to the barricades.”Strong women and weak men characterize this novel. Charity and her mother, Aunt Emily, dominate their husbands, Sally, with her illness, commands Larry’s attention. When Charity is stricken with cancer, it raises the specter of when Sally’s sudden “cave in” would occur due to her polio, and the deeper question in both Larry and Sid’s minds: can they survive without their wives? Charity is a master planner, not only mapping out Sid’s career and life (during her life and after her death), but parcelling out her vast family estate so that their five dispersed adult children will return to the nest after her death. From the recounting of one of her children, we wonder whether the children fled the coop in the first instance just to escape their domineering mother. However, Charity is a wonderful caregiver and feels for all those around her, in particularly, Sally, her best friend. “Overachievers have more fun without drugs and orgies than hedonists,” and Charity is the supreme overachiever. Yet her well-ordained life is not without its deep disappointments, like when Sid loses his job during the war, or when Sally contracts polio due to a forced hike that Charity drove the foursome to undertake just after Sally had delivered her one and only baby. And the men achieve their goals despite their women’s efforts to help or hinder them: Larry becomes a recognized writer and Sid finally gets his tenure just as he is reaching retirement, more out of seniority than for any text books he wrote.Stegner takes the time to provide wonderful descriptions of the land, including a sojourn in Florence where the foursome meet while Larry is writing one of his books. The genuine camaraderie these four enjoy in each other’s company is palpable throughout the book, although we have to endure lots of commonplace events; picnics, hikes, dinner parties and visits to each other, to see that emerge. There is a fair amount of overwriting and many non-events, judged by today’s speeded-up tastes. As the book nears its climax, there is a lengthy meditation on death and how it impacts survivors of the dying.Stegner’s life seems to mirror this book: men dominated by strong women, stuffy academics, writers who make it to respectability relatively quickly with a bit of luck and good timing, sojourns in various parts of America and abroad. Yes, it is a story about quiet lives, none that left a mark on the world, but on whom the world left its marks.

And therein lies the book’s weakness, for a collection of linked short stories, dramatic though each story is, does not a satisfying novel make. I had to often refer back and pick up the trail from a previous chapter. The multitude of characters, barring a few, do not have enough space and time to develop fully. Although the vital family trees are presented at the beginning of the book, it would have been helpful to have the year in which the respective stories were taking place in order to connect them with real historical events. But if the author’s intention was to present the Ghanaian and the African-American archetypes as her two principle characters, and to show us their evolution over the last two centuries in as short a possible narrative with these short stories acting merely as inflection points along their respective journeys, then she has succeeded.What emerges is a bloody picture. “There is evil in our lineage,” says grandmother Akua, the Crazy Woman, who, like her ancestor Mamme, set fire to her household, killing her daughters and scarring her son. And the evil is on both sides, among whites and blacks alike. The Fante and Asante tribes (both who are represented in the Ghanaian side of this story due to a strategic marriage somewhere along the line) are hostile to each other, raiding and procuring slaves for sale to the white man; the Asante fight wars against their colonial masters, the British; American slave owners treat their “human resources” horribly; the post-civil war period in the USA ends only with segregation and the Jim Crow laws that makes one wonder whether the days of slavery were better; the Civil Rights Act provides temporary relief only to be replaced by the War on Drugs that puts blacks at a further disadvantage. Ghana, post-independence, seems to gain a measure of self-confidence, and with the discovery of cocoa, members of the family tree on that side start to find their feet, even managing to immigrate to the USA as academics, leapfrogging their ancestors’ slave legacy.It is left to the final descendents of the original half-sisters, Marjorie (Ghanaian) and Marcus (African-American), to close the circle by meeting accidentally and falling in love. They will never know of their connected past, for family history has been obliterated through slavery, migration and the lack of written records. They both carry the phobias of ancestry: Marjorie is scared of fire (Akua is her grandmother) and Marcus is scared of water (slaves were reputedly afraid of the ocean that took them away from their homeland). Both know that they are different even though they share a common African heritage; this becomes obvious when they visit each other’s countries and realize that they are black but not black enough to belong; they speak, think, and view the world differently. They carry the mixed child’s legacy: knowing that their white parent can choose a life, but they, the children, cannot. Marjorie (who I suspect is a proxy for the author) and Marcus—both gifted with the education their ancestors never had—are tasked to overcome, to face their phobias and bury this awful legacy, and be reborn as free men and women in a supposedly enlightened world that seeks to forget its dark history. I was left wondering which branch of the family was left more spiritually advanced after two centuries of tortuous evolution. I wasn’t sure. Both branches are still marginalized. Perhaps the big leap will come with Marjorie and Marcus’s children—we can only hope....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"May 26, 2018","May 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27071490-homegoing

Mixing a historically significant character with a fictitious one is an interesting conceit, especially if the fictitious one outshines the real guy. Joey Smallwood, first premier of Newfounland post-confederation with Canada, is the real person, a kid from the sticks of St. John’s, whose father is an alcoholic and whose mother can’t stop having babies, who dreams big and seeks power, believing that one day he will be the premier of his country (yes, it was a country, a rather bankrupt one, before it became a Canadian province). Sheilagh Fielding, the fictitious character, is a doctor’s daughter from the “quality” side of the social strata; she is a journalist and Smallwood’s nemesis, a cynic oozing irony when she is not boozing on Scotch. Fielding is a metaphor for Smallwood’s Newfoundland: tortured, secretive, betrayed, impoverished, alcoholic, brash. They are in love with each other but are too intellectual and uptight to consummate their passion—they address each other by their last names even during intimate and private moments. In fact, for a politician, Smallwood’s sexual appetite is strangely...well...small. He prefers to sublimate his energy by walking or sailing around the Rock in all kinds of inclement weather, collecting union dues for his socialist cause from uneducated people who would prefer to hide from their neighbours in coves and harbours and spend their time fishing.Smallwood and Fielding have gaping character holes in addition to physical deformities. He is small, myopic, emaciated, pre-tubercular and is a lousy father and husband who never spends time with his family. She has a game leg, cannot shake off the booze, is tubercular, and is alienated from her family. A letter sent to the local newspaper that gets 15-year-old Smallwood expelled from his prestigious high school begins the life-long duel between this formidable couple and turns into a mystery that runs through the book, taking on sinister implications as new information is unearthed. Smallwood’s takes to a career in journalism and radio, and uses his media platforms to solidify his political position in the rural areas outside St. John’s. In fact, when the referendum on confederation is finally fought, it is these outlying areas that swing the vote towards a union with Canada—Smallwood’s goal all along. He is obsessed with writing Newfoundland’s history to counter the inaccurate attempts made thus far by others. And Fielding is out to do the same; but she belittles this impossible and inhospitable colony that seems to be run by charlatans and has-beens of the Colonial office.The novel covers Smallwood’s and Fielding’s lives from age 15 through to their retirement years in a combination of first person narrative (Smallwood), journal entries and unsent letters (Fielding) and short extracts from Fielding’s irony-laden, condensed version of The History of Newfoundland. I laughed during sections of this novel, particularly throughout the “true story” of prime minister Sir Richard Squires’ escape from the mob, aided by our dynamic duo. The unravelling of Fielding’s dark secret was heart wrenching, although reminiscent of most Canadian family dramas that reveal skeletons in closets brought about by lust and impropriety.Most importantly, I believe this novel is a better introduction to the history of Newfoundland than the books Smallwood and Fielding were trying to either discredit or write themselves. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"May 14, 2018","May 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/95230.The_Colony_of_Unrequited_Dreams

She meets Poe at a “conversazione,” a literary salon run by a wealthy spinster, a place where the literati converge compulsively and regularly in fair or foul weather. This literary society, for all its promise of liberalism, is an insulated and incestuous one. Married women are chattels of their husbands, morality is worn like a badge, everyone has a secret lover, bastard children are subtly absorbed into the official family, nosiness and gossip are rife, and appearances of respectability are maintained at the cost of personal feelings. Poe is the tortured poet, scathing of the shallow literati, damaged from his past as an abandoned child, burning with passions that can only come out in his writing. “The Raven” is the toast of the town during this narrative period of 1845-47. Enter Mrs. Poe, the titular character, young, beautiful, frail, sick, and dangerous. She befriends Fanny, wants to be as creative as the older woman, and encourages Fanny to spend time with her brooding husband, as it would be “good for him and stop him drinking.” Poe’s eccentric aunt, Mrs. Clemm, who is also Mrs. Poe’s mother, completes the cast of gothic characters that enters and turns Fanny’s life upside down. There is also the real-life Reverend Griswold, himself a curator and publisher, who has a hate out for Poe and an unrequited desire for Fanny, who provides comic relief to this tale brimming with suppressed desire and lurking menace. The dialogue is incisive and insightful: “Don’t fall in love with a poet. All he loves is his words,” “Like childbirth, creativity came when it came,” “The poet’s job is to ask questions, not answer them.”The book is a parade of domestic scenes: visits by the Poes to Fanny and vice versa, visits to the literary conversaziones and lectures, picnics in a Manhattan that is losing its pastoral look and beginning to resemble a flat construction site, Sunday walks along Broadway around where everyone hangs out, and encounters with famous personalities like Longfellow, Melville and Barnum who are out taking similar constitutionals along this famous street. “Incomes could be counted by the yards of glossy silk in a skirt or in the height of a gentleman’s collar.” During these societal activities, Poe and Fanny carry out their secret affair; love is expressed in a gesture, a look, a stolen kiss or embrace, and poetry. Poe publishes the struggling Fanny’s poems in his literary magazine and they write under pseudonyms, carrying out a frustrated romance on the page that sets New York alight with curiosity. Then bad things start happening around Fanny: a boating accident, a nearby fire at an illicit abortion clinic, another near miss in her own home, a street accident, and a grand finale in a church belfry that could only have come out of a Poe story. As much as the whodunit element elevates the novel above rounds of domesticity, the dénouement is amateurish—I wish it had been done better.The enigmatic Mrs. Poe haunts us. Is she really in love with her husband? Is he still in love with her, although he keeps insisting it had been a mistake to marry his cousin when she was only thirteen and that he now, ten years later, has no feelings for her? The book also leaves us in the winter of 1847, with hope, just before events over the next four years, fueled by tuberculosis, will sweep the entire cast into the lost and forgotten closet, with the exception of Edgar Allan Poe ,who, with his tortured and dark writing, will vault into immortality, a goal he pursued relentlessly throughout his short life....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 04, 2018","May 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16130398-mrs-poe

For all these reasons I picked up this book which was blurbed as a plot against America replete with assassins, terrorists and science experiments gone wrong.And I wasn’t disappointed, for the mystery novel was obvious: the US President is shot by an insider, and the White House is destroyed by a bomb. The science fiction takes over when a memory altering experiment being carried out in a nearby Washington hospital, the same one that the injured president is rushed to, is disturbed by an electromagnetic pulse emanating from the White House explosion. Those in the vicinity of the experiment start seeing other people’s memories in addition to their own. The linkages are not reciprocal but linear, and the hunt is on to find out who has access to the President’s memories, for that would be tantamount to a national security breach, particularly as the President has recently given the go ahead for an international military operation of an unprecedented scale. The part that didn’t work for me was that there were too many characters, many rendered as cartoon cut-outs in order to move the twisting and turning plot along. It was hard to keep track of who was linked to whom memory-wise, and the implications thereof. And yet this unnatural situation poses ethical questions regarding privacy, forcible confinement, campaign trail lies, and relationships, all that are boldly explored. As a result of the linked memories, new associations are formed and others are fractured, and everyone is on edge for knowing too much. And as the days pass, this addling of memories only gets worse and more complex.Sawyer, a Canadian, who seems at ease in his US scene-setting, makes his sentiments known about his country’s prime minister through the mouths of his characters. For example, the fictional US President describes the Canadian PM as “a weaselly petty man.” Conversely, the author absolves the former of his campaign trail lies by saying, “an evil politician lies all the time, a good one picks and chooses when to lie.”Much has been said about the bizarre ending of this book which vaults it out of its mystery trajectory. And yet, given that the novel is categorized as science fiction, I think this dislocation— just like the memory dislocation—is necessary to return the book to its science fiction roots and to the premise that “while an individual can do damage on an increasing scale with evolving technology, the collective desire for good can negate it.” However, with this departure, I was also left wondering why the fast-paced plot twists of the earlier mystery novel were needed when the author was trying to establish a totally different premise?I was also left with a further question, which all good science fiction is supposed to do, and that was: “why would we all want to be the same on this planet, all knowing and all understanding? How boring a place would that be, and why would we need so many of us, all of whom would be clones of each other?” Perhaps that will be the dilemma to be solved in Sawyer’s next novel, if he hasn’t addressed it already. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2018","Apr 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13022844-triggers

She is highly strung and suffers OCD due to the pressures of her husband’s job. Her remedy for nerves is extra marital sex, whenever and wherever she can find it, while hubby is away diffusing bombs at all hours of the night. She falls in with Jasper, an upper-class journalist who is engaged to Petra, a dead ringer for our narrator in looks, but a ruthlessly ambition journalist in her own right. While our narrator is engaged in hard core sex with Jasper in her living room one afternoon, the blaring TV reveals the blowing up of the nearby stadium where her husband and four-year year-old son are attending the much heralded Arsenal-Chelsea soccer match. The guilt and the loss of loved ones during her act of transgression will never leave her. Nor does it seem to leave other Londoners exposed to the explosion. Everyone starts behaving badly. Rich boys take to cocaine, rich girls go shopping, and poor girls just try to get on with it, although they start seeing their dead relatives everywhere.Our narrator, in her grieving and addled state, next takes up with a police superintendent who was her dead husband’s boss, and finds out that the explosion was a known one to the authorities, but it was allowed to happen in order to avert a much larger act of terrorism in London; preventing the soccer match explosion would have prematurely sent the perpetrators into hiding. This discovery leads to many conflicted emotions in our narrator: a sense of betrayal by her country’s politicians, a sense of revulsion towards her new lover, and a craving for revenge to release the little ghost of the four-year old boy who is now following her everywhere. Things come to a head when Petra acts in her own self-centred way, and the cocaine-riddled Jasper decides to take matters into his shaky hands.The book is full of irony: the narrator’s sexual climax coming just as the stadium explodes; the husband planning to transfer out of the bomb squad only to go out the day before to a soccer match and be killed by a bomb; the narrator falling in love with the superintendent only to find out that he has “known” all along; the narrator aspiring for Petra’s social standing as much as Petra seeks to emulate the narrator in order to win Jasper’s affections; a bomb scare leading to deaths caused by various factors other than the exploding of bombs themselves; the blatant fact that civilized London and its denizens are no more civilized than the desert-hiding Osama and his gang—it only takes a bomb and the breakdown of social order to reveal the similarities between the two civilizations. The style is epistolary and conversational: the narrator is having a conversation with Osama throughout the narrative. She doesn’t hate him for what he has done to her family, but sees a kinship with him through her loss. In fact, she would like to live with Osama. She is a representation of London: “a city built on the wreckage of itself, too ignorant to know when it is finished.” All that said, it is hard to ignore the stark madness that these acts of terrorism reduce civilized society to, and our raving lunatic of a narrator remains a good example of that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,not setnot set,"Apr 15, 2018not set","Apr 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/701738.Incendiary

But the writing is obfuscated by lots of unnecessary detail about logging, cooking and Italian family names. After the first part of the book, which leads up to what happened on the fateful last night in the logging town of Twisted River when Daniel was twelve, the story rambles on for another 50 years with intermittent pauses to take stock of how the lives of Danny, his cook father Dominic (alias Tony) and their spiritual advisor, the river driver Kechum, evolved at various locations in the USA and Canada.The writing appears aimless and clunky, flitting back and forth in time in each of the long chapters, but Irving foreshadows strongly and strews clues that he pulls together for a dramatic ending in each of those chapters. Danny says he starts his novels from the end and works his way to the front, and that could very well be how this book was written. Irving’s obsession with finding that perfect opening sentence is revealed here, and that sentence bookends the novel. The usual suspects are present: a strong step-father figure (Kechum), strong female matriarchal figures (and weak ones), the Oedipus Complex, the pivotal event that begins the odyssey, and the grand theme (it is 9/11, and Bush’s reaction to it this time). The one variation is that the absentee father scenario—another Irving hallmark—plays out in Dominic’s life instead of his son’s, for Dominic is a strong presence in Danny’s life. The Irvinesque comi-tragic situations abound: Danny mistaking a woman humping his dad for a bear, a young man perishing at the wheel in a car crash while getting a blow job from his girl-friend, a naked woman parachuting out of the sky into a pig sty, and a drunken trio do-si-do-ing on thin river ice, are but a few. There is also the bogeyman, Cop Carl—Danny and Dominic’s nemesis—who provides impetus to the peregrinations of the Baciagalupos that end up forging young Danny into a writer.Irving uses his characters to voice his political leanings about what ails America. Like Owen Meany did with Vietnam, Danny keeps score of how many are dying in the Iraq war. Danny situates himself in Canada so that he can be an outsider looking in and write about the USA from a distance. There are observations on writing and the writer’s life: “symbolism, sublety and restraint characterize Danny’s novels, and he dodges the squeamish stuff,” per Kechum.This book should have ended on that final night in Twisted River, Instead it went on, and on, and I didn’t understand why it was necessary other than to fulfil some publisher’s quota of words, because we ended up getting the same Irving novel of yore with a few variations, and not a very good novel at that. Perhaps the long digression of nearly 400 pages after that fateful night in Twisted River was to illustrate Irving’s philosophy that sometimes people and events just fall into our lives unexpectedly.I think I am going to have to keep looking for that three-peat in another of his books....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Mar 26, 2018","Mar 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6323821-last-night-in-twisted-river

Mamoon is a despicable man and so is his biographer; both are libidinous, adulterous and self-absorbed. The wives, partners and lovers of these men crave love and attention from them, which they are unable to provide because they are absorbed only in themselves and their work. As Harry plumbs into Mamoon’s life, pulling out as much salacious detail as he can, the Nobel winner in turn is getting his own back on the biographer by writing a novel about him, exposing Harry’s own peccadilloes. As for the women, Liana has a “see but not touch” sexual flirtation with Harry, while the aging Mamoon has a “see, but we are not sure whether he has touched” relationship with Harry’s pregnant partner, Alice. And Harry has a sexual relationship with the maid, Julia, while proclaiming his undying love to Alice. No one feels guilt, they just get on with it.The modus operandi of the publishing industry is laid bare: write a saucy biography of this fading literary star and rekindle interest in him; issue reprints of his many books in their many translations to catch this wave of renewed interest; sell the salacious bits unearthed during the research for the biography to the tabloids; spin off into a TV show; republish the biography in five years as a second edition with a new chapter detailing the writer’s death and start the circus rolling all over again. The story line is haphazard, the characters are one dimensional; all that matters is what spews from their mouths in terms of their insights into the “madness of writing.” Quotes are abundant:“Literature was a killing field—no decent person had picked up a pen”“Words were the bridge between chaos and reality.”“Art is seduction. Indiscretion is the essence of biography.”“Marriage domesticates sex but frees love.”“All sex must include a poisonous drop of perversion to be worth getting into bed for.”“A writer is loved by strangers and hated by his family.”“In London, you never see white people working.”“Frustration makes creativity possible.”“All religions are concerned with weaning their adherents off desire.”Why am I regurgitating these quotes? Because they are all that is merit worthy in this book. The story line spirals into a cartoon and the scenes jump around with a lack of continuity and fluidity. Character information is strewn all over the book, some at the very end, resulting in us not quite knowing these people even by the time the novel concludes.One thing is obvious: biographies can lead to fractured relationships and ill health, and there is no guarantee of the planned outcome. A lot of emotion gets released, many secrets are revealed, and new and tangled relationships are formed. As for the work itself, the publisher at one stage looks at the biographer’s manuscript and says, “This is shit. Improve a million times,” and I wondered whether this was a true quote hurled at Kureishi himself while he was wrestling with this book, a criticism that he didn’t quite take to heart, or if he did, resulted only in a half improved version. I suppose he set himself up with a tough challenge when, given the premise, this story is derived primarily from encounters between the biographer and his subject, and the supporting cast, and when all there is to work with is dialogue between the players about events that had occurred in the past. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this book was to say, “It’s a book about a writer and a touchy subject: the writers’ biography. How would you feel if people went poking into your personal life trying to find skeletons in the closet?”The last word left with me was more a question: can one separate the life of an artist from his work, and appreciate or depreciate each half separately and distinctly? This is a question for our times as many artists are falling off their pedestals today for lives improperly lived. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Mar 16, 2018","Mar 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20552507-the-last-word

When supplemented with a number of photograThis is an unusual novel, and reads more like a writer’s search for real lives destroyed by the Holocaust. When supplemented with a number of photographs, the novel transcends fiction into biography. But yet, is this a novel as the cover suggests, or a collection of real-life stories?The four character-stories that make up the novel embrace the lives of a doctor, a teacher, a butler, and a painter, all assimilated Jews in a Germany that is going Nazi, all chronicled by a younger writer (Sebald, presumably) who takes a deep interest in them. The four characters lived either on the German side of Switzerland, or in Germany, prior to the Second World War. Let me try to cover some highlights of their lives:Henry Selwyn (doctor) is living out his last days, estranged from his younger, richer, more active wife, in a hermitage located on the grounds of the large manor house owned by her. Love and matrimonial life have faded. Dr. Selwyn pines for the mentor from his youth who was lost in an avalanche in the Swiss Alps. He keeps practicing firing a gun on the grounds, one he purchased when he was an army surgeon in India. He intends to use the gun on himself one day.Paul Bereyter (teacher) is only a quarter Jewish by birth, but is subject to the same anti-Jewish laws of 1935 in the Swiss/German border area he lives in, laws that prevent him from practicing his profession. His family’s emporium is sold for a song when his father dies of “fire and fury” for being discriminated against and his mother follows a few weeks later, succumbing to depression. Cataract surgery loses him his eyesight but provides him with an internal vision he has never exercised before.Ambrose Adelwarth (butler) emigrates to America with many of his multi generational family members, where they make a living in the ghettos of New York City, grabbing any job, legal or illicit, to survive. Ambrose becomes the personal assistant to Cosmo Solomon, heir of the wealthy Solomon family. When his employers die out, Ambrose is unemployed though well provided for, and slumps into a depression that can only be treated with electro-shock therapy. In the early days of this form of therapy, it was hit and miss, and Ambrose suffers progressive paralysis from the cure. What is salvaged by the writer of this chronicle is Ambrose’s diary in which he and Cosmo take a colourful trip through Turkey to Israel and down to the Dead Sea. Max Ferber (painter) lives in Manchester, a city he chose when he fled Germany in 1939, leaving the rest of his family behind. Manchester, at the time, was the largest indoor port in the world, the Industrial Jerusalem, but it began its death spiral in 1930 and reached rock bottom in the late 1950’s. Max is drawn to dust and decay and lives in a studio full of it, painting and sketching relentlessly despite gaining fame internationally for his work. The narrator paints vivid pictures of life among assimilated Jews in Germany and surrounding Europe who were dislocated from their comfortable existence during the Nazi era and gradually reduced to lives of quiet desperation. As this novel is an exercise in capturing and freezing memory of a lost time, the author is detailed to a fault, perhaps too detailed, and in the absence of dialogue, the reading is heavy. The absence of dialogue must not be confused with the absence of voices, for the voice of the first person narrator morphs between young Sebald, the four principal characters, and key members in their lives like wives, mothers and sisters, all seamlessly woven into the narrative. There is also the motif of a man with a butterfly net who flits in an out, and represents a grim reaper in some stories and a saviour in others, depending on the frame of mind of the observer. The ending left me wanting more, for the lives being exposited, stop abruptly. Perhaps the author was trying to conjure what it must have been for the millions whose lives were snuffed out suddenly with a barrage of gas pellets surreptitiously dropped into a locked chamber they had mistaken for a communal shower....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2018","Mar 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/76507.The_Emigrants

His poor eyesight has kept him out of the war (every eligible male in that time was hunkering to get a shot at the war, it seemed), his mother had died during childbirth, and his father was a crook; his much- loved grandfather had passed away three years ago and he now lives with his ailing grandmother. He is in love with Marcia, the daughter of a wealthy doctor, and she is his ticket out to a prosperous future.During the summer of 1944, polio breaks out in the Jewish neighbourhood where Bucky is the playground director, sparking irrational fears. Many are blamed for spreading the disease: the Italians by the Jews, a mentally handicapped man due to his lack of hygiene, a hamburger restaurant for serving the first victim’s last meal, even Bucky for not shutting the playground despite his superhuman efforts at keeping the place clean and engaging the children in healthy physical activity.An invitation from Marcia to escape the city for the cleaner Poconos to spend the rest of the summer, is one Bucky is unable to resist, although his conscience pricks him to stay and fight the good fight with the afflicted ones in his hometown. When the disease arrives in the summer camp in the Poconos, hot on the heels of Bucky’s arrival, some stark questions surface.The nemesis of this book’s title is guilt, not necessarily the obvious polio that gives rise to it. Bucky is conflicted between his anger towards a cruel God, that, in his opinion, is killing these innocents, and his love for Marcia who believes in a merciful God. The polio is depicted in all its creeping stages, as not one that merely infects and damages the body, but one that also alters the mind, forever, in Bucky’s situation. Certain set scenes are played up, out of proportion to this short novel, I thought. The wake for the first victim Alan Michaels is overdone to emphasise polio’s lack of discrimination when it strikes; Donald’s swimming practices to show his perfectly functioning lungs; and the hokey Indian ceremony performed by white boys and men at the summer camp smacked as a sign of support for the protestors of cultural appropriation.Roth seems to rely on a third person narrator, not unlike himself, for most of his novels—hence Zukerman, Kepesh and others. In this book it is Arne Meshnikoff, a 11year-old boy (Roth’s age in 1944) who was also afflicted with the disease that summer, but went on to become an architect of handicapped-accessible buildings. Years later (in 1971), the older Bucky meets Arne and they compare notes on how their lives had diverged post-polio, a major inflection point for everyone who was afflicted. The wages of guilt vs. the power of optimism become clear. Bucky is no Roosevelt (or even Arne) who used his disability as leverage to achieve greatness. Instead, Bucky can only remembered positively when he made that perfect javelin throw, before polio came calling to Newark. This is a powerful novel, and a fitting curtain call for a great writer who announced his retirement (do writers ever retire, or do they die with their pens in their hand?) soon after this book was published. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Feb 17, 2018","Feb 17, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7703038-nemesis

His theatrical family helped confuse gender for him right from the get-go: his grandfather was a cross-dresser, so was his absentee father, the Shakespearean theatre productions put on by his high school often had boys playing female characters, and his first real love was transgender librarian Miss Frost. Billy also is attracted to a wrestler on his school team, Kittredge, who is in turn gender-confused; Kittredge’s mother has been sleeping with her only son for years to help cure him of his attraction to the male sex. Billy makes no bones that he is attracted to both sexes and has many transient lovers throughout the book, his ideal being the lover “with small breasts and a big cock.” The only long-term relationship he has (on and off sexually, but permanently on a platonic level) is with his childhood friend Elaine, whose bra he keeps hidden under his pillow. I wondered whether with some of the explicit but humorous situations described in this book, Irving was trying to take on Philip Roth’s Portnoy.The most dramatic part of this book is Billy and his cohort’s passage through the AIDS epidemic between 1981 and 1989. Irving describes, in excruciating detail, the AIDS related illnesses that take so many of Billy’s contemporaries away: pneumocyctis pneuomnia, vacuolar myelopathy, esophageal candidiasis, cytomegalovirus and fulminant diarrhea, to name a few. Billy (who’s been using condoms since ’68) is spared, and walks through this death passage like a ghost, full of survivor guilt, feeling even more the outsider. He sees gay caregivers succumb, the wives of bisexual men get infected and their children commit suicide, and single mothers of afflicted children inject themselves with their dying offsprings’ blood in order to share in the tragedy. What was a funny book detailing Billy’s coming of age in the ’60’s becomes a dark tale by the time we arrive in the ’80’s.The narrative style is disappointing: conversational, first person, jumping forward in time and back frequently and full of parenthetical explanations. We return to the same scene or situation many times over during the book and on each visit Irving gives us a bit more information for dramatic impact, a kind of writer’s cop-out.I wondered whether Billy’s adventures and reflections were meant to arrive at the conclusion given to him by his father: “We already are who we are, aren’t we?”. All he can do is find a greater deal of acceptance and integration as we move into the new millennium. And yet, with this book, Irving has blown our stereotypical impressions of gender wide open to embrace new permutations and combinations of what it is to be “normal.”This is not another Garp, but it certainly is an extension of Owen Meany with its amateur theatrical family setting, weak narrator, absentee father, surrogate step-father, strong maternal figures, and grand theme (AIDS instead of Vietnam)—yet another exploration of a subject that we prefer to keep in the taboo closet. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Feb 08, 2018","Feb 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12758317-in-one-person

I discovered that the opening sentence is a John Irving hallmark—he spends a lot of time searching for that perfect opening line in all his novels.Owen Meany is a working class lad whose parents own a foundry. He is a Christ-like figure whose life is pre-ordained; even the day of his death is revealed to him. His physical growth is stunted and he has undeveloped vocal cords; his speech is therefore represented in the book in upper case letters, and everything he utters is a universal truth, even though he suffers the slings, arrows, frustrations, lusts and joys of this mortal coil. He is the lifelong friend of John Wheelright, our narrator and the descendent of a Mayflower emigré. A chance hit by Owen during a baseball game kills John’s mother, Tabitha, and binds the two boys in a symbiotic relationship of leader and follower as they chart their way into adulthood, both beset by dysfunctional families. We follow their lives through the ’50’s and ’60’s, from the age of 11 until death does them apart in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War. Irwin takes us through the familiar country of his own upbringing: growing up in amateur theatre, living in academia, an absentee father (John’s), absentee mother (Owen’s) a strong substitute step-father, strong matriarchal figures in John’s mother and grandmother, pre-pubescent boys lusting after each other’s mothers, and the coming of age when America went to war in Vietnam, forcing young men to enrol, protest, or leave the country.Through the voices of Owen and John, Irving gets to comment on all that was not well with America during that time: the unravelling of Kennedy’s Camelot, the second hand treatment of women in education, the rise of the oligarchy, television’s detrimental effects on culture, the coming of the TV Evangelist type as a future President of America.Despite the religious and political overtones of this book, there is a lot of humour in it. The school play rendition of A Christmas Carol and the local parish’s Nativity Play are absolute hoots, with Owen indirectly directing the productions, casting the players, and influencing their outcomes. And yet, these amateur presentations spawn important inflection points for the narrative: Owen sees the date of his death engraved on Scrooge’s gravestone, and this “vision” changes the course of his life and of those around him. In high school he becomes the publisher of the school magazine and comes to be known as “the Voice,” commenting on society and academia, taking unpopular stands and challenging the new principal, a bad guy representing Corporate America. The scenes with the VW Beetle and the Mary Magdalene statue that get magically transported to the school hall are side-splitting, although they have disastrous consequences for our diminutive hero. The narrative jumps back and forth between the linear trajectory of the period 1953 (when the fateful baseball killed John’s mother) to 1968, and 1987 when a middle aged John—still a bachelor and a virgin, and now resident in Canada (he was one of those who left)—is recalling the events that led to the death of Owen Meany. Despite the length of this book, Irving focuses on pivotal events (such as the baseball game, Tabitha’s “fling” that resulted in John’s birth, the amateur plays, the moving of the VW and the Magdalene etc.), blowing them up in meticulous detail, and then stitching them together with broad narrative brushstrokes in-between to complete the timeline.There is a poignancy to a story when we already know that the hero is pre-destined to die a tragic death, and this book embodies that. But what was surprising and revealing was how and where Owen fulfills his destiny—a shocker, and one, that on reflection, couldn’t have been any other way, for everything in his life, including the famous basketball shot that he had practiced a million times with John, had invariably pointed towards that outcome.Very rarely does a novelist hit more than one good home run in his oeuvre. But having read The World According to Garp, and now this novel, I’m at two and counting. I’m going to read more of this author, in hot pursuit of the “three-peat.”...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2018","Jan 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4473.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany

There are actually two plots: one dating back to the ‘80’s when a young Rebus was introduced to a secret police team, Saints of the Shadow Bible, that used unconventional methods to bring criminals to justice; the other is set in the present when Rebus has returned from retirement out of boredom and rejoined the force as a DS (Detective Sergeant, a step down from his former Detective Inspector role) and is investigating a routine car accident involving some college students. DI Fox is investigating misdemeanours conducted by the Saints and hooks onto Rebus as his link into the past and into the group. Very soon, murder is introduced to both investigations. And some of the characters from both cases overlap, making one wonder whether the two puzzles are connected. Thereafter, we go through endless cups of tea, coffee, alcohol, cigarettes and the workings of the police procedural, where plodding and dull work eventually produce results, especially when Rebus begins to see “conspiracies, connections and coincidences” in random events that others bypass. It was as if Rankin sat down with his 14 sections of the book (each section is a day in the life of the investigation) and sprinkled the story strands among them, and then drew them all back in the final two sections. All the murders are solved, needless to say, earning Rebus the wrath of his boss for his continuing unconventional methods, the gratitude of Fox (lining the two up for another book together), and the admiration of his mentee, Siobhan Clarke, now in Rebus’s old job as Detective Inspector. And in the epilogue, we see that despite internal investigations into unorthodox and illegal police methods, and a new way of doing things emerging in the Scottish Police force, you really can’t teach old dogs like Rebus new tricks.I have read just one other Rebus novel, which I liked better than this one, and it may have been that I had been interested in him as a character in that first book, a deeply flawed human being with a total dedication to his job. In this book though, having now established his credentials, I was looking for more, and I didn’t find it. The prose was pedestrian, even clumsy in places and there was a lot of circular conversation, very little action. Contrivances are thrown in lavishly to advance the plot: “Do we need a crowbar somewhere? Then let’s just throw one in.” If at all I can heap praise, it is in the way the various strands of the investigation are woven together over the 14 days, in an oblique fashion, to close the case, with all the bad guys getting their comeuppance in their own deserving way....more",Notes are private!,0,9,2,not setnot set,"Jan 15, 2018not set","Jan 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17899384-saints-of-the-shadow-bible

I have to admit I laughed a lot and looked forward to being entertained each time I sat down with this giant tome, for each morsel was interesting, and I wasn’t disappointed.Archie (English) & Samad (Bengali) are two war-time buddies who marry women a whole generation younger than them. Archie’s wife Clara is Jamaican and their daughter is Irie who hates her kinky hair and wishes to straighten it at any cost. Samad’s wife Alsana is Bengali and their identical twins are Majid and Millat. Yet this particular egg split differently, for Magid is the intellectual and Millat the emotional one. And the entire premise of the novel splits along the divide between intellect and faith, and the characters align themselves in either side of this schism. To widen the crevasse, Samad, trying to keep one of his marital indiscretions secret, packs Majid off to be educated in Bangladesh and keeps Millat at home, only to see the former emerge a pukka sahib and the latter wind up a religious radical. Enter the Chalferns: Jewish, liberal, academic and open minded, a family that adopts Millat and Irie to teach them proper English values after the two teenagers are busted for marijuana possession in school. The plot thickens and deepens as Jehovah’s Witnesses, Islamic radicals, and animal activists are thrown into the mix, along with the fact that Mr. Chalfern, with the help of Majid, is into the genetic engineering of mice, a concept that the religious Samad and Millat are fundamentally opposed to. Without giving more of the plot away, I will say that the allegiances and shift and sway, as this group of motley souls look for identity and purpose in their lives. A series of secondary conflicts arise throughout the book: black vs. white, husband vs. wife, parent vs. child, immigrant vs. native-born, war-time vs. post war generation.No one is spared by Smith’s satirical omniscient narrator: Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Jehovah’s Witnesses, black and whites. The narrator also conceals vital information that is revealed later for more dramatic impact—sometimes 400 pages later, when one has forgotten the incident in this incident-packed story. I was reminded of Salman Rushdie, who has also taken an unsparing approach to laying bare the ills, prejudices and traumas of visible minorities in England. Smith has not faced the consequences that Rushdie faced, but she skirts some thin ice especially in parodying those ethnic and religious groups that take offence easier than others. Smith however, shows masterful control of the disparate story strands by bringing all the characters and the various interest groups into one place for a much anticipated finale on New Year’s Eve 1992. If I have to level one criticism at this novel, it is that the much expected “explosive ending” didn’t quiet happen.Notwithstanding this last grouse, I highly recommend this book, a truly phenomenal debut effort....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jan 05, 2018","Jan 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3711.White_Teeth

Why not present the lectures in their final form for us to digest? As they are, the individual subjects hit chords that resonate but are not presented as a cohesive whole. The dead arts professor (a proxy for Smith, I take it) is memorialized by the narrator-lover who is a botanist by trade and an amateur literateur who can only manage to read Oliver Twist throughout the course of this novel. A sort of an ego-boost for Smith, by Smith, I think. At points, the narrative gets a bit corny when the narrator starts to see the dead lover in ghostly form, smell and all (and the smell intensifies as time passes). What finally turned me off the fictional element was when the narrator (or the ghost) starts stealing things from other people. The narrator subsequently seeks help for her kleptomaniacal activity, which is likened to a form of grieving by her shrink.The content of the lectures themselves are interesting: time, form, edges, offer and reflection are dissected into their various dimensions and meanings with elegant word-play. Some points stuck with me:•	Form is clear rules and unspoken understandings.•	The mirror is a reflection between our world and another.•	The multiple dimensions of time and the multiple meanings of the word “form.”•	“On edge” and “being on edge” - the best way to illustrate each other. Edges are extremes and borders.•	Love is an exchange of altruism vs. selfishness.In the course of the lectures, we get either passing references or detailed analyses of the literary greats and their works: Dickens, Proust, Saramago, Kafka, Borges, Woolf, Ondaatje, Calvino, Atwood, (Angela) Carter and (Katherine) Mansfield to name a few. Painters like Cezanne and Dali, and movie makers like Hitchcock, with his recipe for suspense, are also on offer. Writers like Woolf, who struggled at a time when cinema was coming of age and threatening to topple books from their perch, had much to say about the new medium and its divergence from the written word— “We can see life on the screen to a deeper level when we have no part in it.” —part observation, part condemnation. Anecdotes are plentiful: e.g. Dali was trapped in a diving suit, nearly dying of suffocation, when he dressed in one to illustrate how he was going to be diving into the depths of human subconscious. And the poetry selected and explained is comprised of very powerful pieces. And like the narrator who is hooked on Dickens, the dead lover was also hooked on a now-dead Brazilian Marilyn Monroe look-alike actress, Aliki Vougiouklaki, who played every juicy female lead part in the movies in her country. Aliki gets to adorn the cover of this book. There is lot to keep the art enthusiast engaged. But I wondered why this form was chosen to present the work. Was there a need for experimentation, was there a need for validation, was there a need to extend the material in the lectures to a wider audience beyond Oxford?

I make thaI have always considered the memoir form as the pursuit of self-indulgence by a writer seeking immortality for a life insufficiently lived. I make that qualification up front. Then I sat down to read Ronald Mackay's memoir of the year he spent in Tenerife in 1961 when he was eighteen, and I quickly revised that opinion.Mackay is fleeing an unhappy family situation in Scotland. The idyllic family life he had with his siblings, mother and grandmother is destroyed when his father returns from the second world war a damaged man, prone to depression and abuse. On top of that, young Ronald fails to gain admission to university to pursue agricultural studies. The determined and adventurous young man sets off to find himself, and believes that fleeing to South America will help. He hitchhikes across Europe on a shoestring and arrives in the Canary Islands hoping to catch a boat across the Atlantic. He changes his mind when he gets to the idyllic village of Buenavista del Norte on the isolated tip of the Canary island of Tenerife and decides to stay at the fonda (rooming house) of matriarch Dona Lutgarda and her three daughters and niece, sensing perhaps that the lost home in Scotland is to be regained in this remote outpost. Our story really begins here.In detailed descriptions, Mackay goes on to finely detail the village, its environs, its people, its customs, and some of the adventures he encounters during the next 12 months. This is a feat of memory, and I am sure that the older Mackay, writing this memoir in middle age, was helped by diaries and journals he must have recorded in at the time. What keeps a sceptical memoir reader like me turning pages is that this book is full of incident, learning, and danger: the dynamiting of fish (illegal), catching octopus (and risking being drowned), sailing around the island in storm-ravaged seas, descending into an active volcano spewing sulphuric fumes, being pursued by Franco's dreaded Guardia Civil, exploring the countryside and discovering ghost towns, getting lost on a fog-covered cliff and being rescued by a child, are some of the situations our intrepid hero gets into. His presence as the only foreigner in the region, his desire to master Spanish, and his willingness to perform any task asked of him, earns him the respect of the locals, and the diminutive ""Extranjero,"" as he is called, soon casts a tall shadow over the land. His closer circle of confidants call him Orlando, as ""Ron"" has more alcoholic implications in Spanish.Among Mackay's descriptions are the craft of stone masonry, including the dynamiting of stubborn sections of basalt (he works in a labour gang, breaking stones for construction), Sunday street dances, the developing of banana plantations (he gets a job as a stock-taker for a banana merchant), teaching, fishing, and cooking on the island. He meets some interesting people: the Fascist judge, Don Eduardo, who thinks Lorca was a communist and a pervert, the handicapped schoolteacher, Don Juan-Pedro, who rides daily to teach in a rural school high up in the mountains, the demon sailor, Sebastian-the-Devil, to whom no storm is a deterrent, and El Loco who specializes in completing the most dangerous wells. I picked up some lessons: a red-tinged tuna fish has probably been dynamited out of the water, for its blood vessels have shattered in the blast - a tell-tale sign. Ronald gets into trouble too, with Donna Lutgarda, when he fails to observe traditions in this insular society - how dare he ask eligible young women to dance with him if he were not planning to marry them? However, despite her frequent chastisements aimed at transforming this spirited Scot into a Canarian, she never fails to rise early to make him his breakfast whenever he is called out on various jobs.As the year progresses, Mackay starts to make comparisons between life back in Scotland and life in Tenerife. An incident in his new home in Buenavista del Norte will often trigger a memory of a similar happening in Scotland, and through this process we are given a window into his past life and the demons he is fleeing. Finally, young Ron, much experienced from his exploits in Tenerife, has an epiphany during the El Loco incident and decides he has to go back home and face up to his reality: make peace with his family and re-apply for university admission. In a symbolic show of ""climbing the mountain,"" he scales the high peak of Teide and realizes that he can climb any mountain as long as he sets his mind to it. Along the way, he has learned that life is uncontrollable, and yet, one has to constantly engage with it; and as the Extranjero, the outsider, he also learns that he has to work harder to prove himself.More than a memoir, this book is a meditation on how to get satisfaction from studying nature and reading meaning and motive in the lives of simple peasants, a way of life that has probably disappeared through globalization and the internet. To that end, Mackay invokes Keats' ""negative capability"" theory, i.e. taking pleasure in beauty without demanding full and factual explanations. In other words, reverence holds a deeper truth than certainty. Although, I have to admit, that for the reader, through his minute and cinematic descriptions of life during this ""coming of age"" year in Tenerife, Mackay seems to turn Keats' theory on its head by delving and delivering full and factual detail to us. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2017","Dec 15, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36740248-fortunate-isle

Discreet diaries are boring.A secret diary is akin to infidelity.Only good girls keep diaries, bad girls don’t have the time. - These are some of the descriptions of diaries in this anthology of the world’s great diarists, among them: Samuel Pepys, Virginia Woolf, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Noel Coward, Joseph Goebbels, Barbara Pym and Kenneth Williams.The importance of a diary as a literary form is that it:1) Records history as and when it happened from people who actually lived through those events.2) Is direct and off the cuff, capturing emotions, thoughts, and ideas formed in the heat of the historical incident.3) Provides snapshots of time frozen years apart on the same day of the year - e.g. contrast a 4th of July celebration in 1832 vs. one in 1991.Thus we get clear pictures of the carnage of the Great London Fire by Samuel Pepys, the filth on the streets of Edinburgh in 1761 by John Wesley, the thoughts and emotions of people in England and Germany preparing for war from Barbara Pym and “Chips” Channon, and Goebbels’ meditations on how he invented the “fake news” concept back in the 1930’s. And if you broke a tooth in 1854, you lived with the gap!This anthology groups entries from a wide selection of diarists that were made on the same day of the year, running from 1st January to 31st December over the last four centuries. So, for any particular day in the year, you could get entries taking place on that same day in 1666, 1774, 1880 and 1991; the progress of history, politics, science and technology is evident as the centuries roll over. The weakness in this approach however is that no single subject is covered in depth, although the anthology hovers around many pivotal events in history: the two world wars, The Great Fire of London, the rise of Nazism in Germany, the Prince Charles-Princess Diana marriage, the evolution of movie making, and the lives of great writers. In going one day at a time in chronological order, we come back to each of these seminal events repeatedly at various points of the book. Each visit helps to re-stoke memory of the last read of that particular subject, but at the end of the book you are left with a disjointed understanding of all these great events. One tends to skim the entries made by lesser known personalities, even though those lesser known ones were selected due to their more on-the-spot, visceral descriptions. One also has to read each entry to find the good nuggets, for not all will interest a reader.Anecdotes are generously offered:1) Shepherds in Corfu preferred ewes to wives because the former didn’t talk - Lawrence Durrell 2) Kafka wrote his diary during WWI but never once mentioned the war3) Marilyn Monroe had a desperate longing to be intellectual, but didn’t have the brain to achieve it - Noel Coward  4) “Oxford people” expected their peers to read Lady Chatterley’s Lover despite its ban in England at the time5) Virginia Woolf preferred poetry to prose as she got older. She also worried about her looks and s of her books, and she didn’t like people.6) Tolstoy lacked modesty, but was shy in society - self admitted.This is not everyone’s book. But as a novelist I got value from being able to immerse myself in the last four centuries and be taken on a guided tour of them by the ghosts of people who had lived during those times, feeling their fears, joys and frustrations. So if you want to know about subjects as diverse and unrelated as how a monk lived in Grenoble in 1927, or how life was on board the Antarctica expedition of 1903 with its tainted food, then you may find something in this book....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Dec 09, 2017","Dec 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1292187.The_Assassin_s_Cloak

He is partially successful in all but the last, for he is not particularly fond of attachment and commitment.The book breaks into two parts: the first is grounded in the narrator’s early life in America and the second half covers his travels around the world during his odyssey of discovery. The first part is more grounded while the second part is fantastical where he even gets to meet and interact with his doppelganger, requiring a higher level of suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader.There is clever writing here, though not often honest writing. We get lots of craft-related loose threads that are sprinkled throughout the narrative only to be reeled in for maximum impact later on. The characters are however superficial and we do not get an understanding of their motives, and this is partially due to the fact that they fuse in and out between reality and make believe. Given the wide geographic terrain being covered, I take it that the author had travelled and immersed himself in the atmosphere before writing about the various locales. And yet, he is subject to the perfunctory observations of an outsider rather than the lived experiences of the insider, In Sri Lanka, for example, where I was born and raised, I had difficulty imagining the epauletted blazer, and I wondered whether it was the Tigers who used civilians as human shields instead of the military.While the ending ties up more loose threads, it left me less than enthused. And despite this being an imaginative novel, I felt I was required to imagine too much to make the ending acceptable. I wish the ending had gone through another draft.Yet, overall, this is a very satisfying novel. It is a plotter’s textbook, for the number of plots and subplots are legion, all weaving and bobbing in and out of each other. And it raises some interesting questions: (1) Where does a writer’s life intersect and merge with his fiction? (2) Can the effort required and the expectation anticipated from a sophomore novel drive a successful novelist over the edge? (3) Does America no longer desire the truth, but only a facsimile thereof? (4) Can two writers, fiercely envious of each other, collaborate?, and (5) Can a writer who abhors publicity turn on a dime and read out his work in the most public of places, a town square in a foreign country?I look forward to reading more of this young author’s future work and hope that his sophomore novel doesn’t take as much time and effort as poor Julian’s....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Dec 05, 2017","Dec 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18114280-the-unchangeable-spots-of-leopards

But the novel doesn’t quite live up to its premise, deteriorating A dystopian thriller that extrapolates America’s racial divide along sharper lines. But the novel doesn’t quite live up to its premise, deteriorating into a somewhat farcical ending. The setting: America never fought a civil war, Lincoln was assassinated when he was running for office, and slavery was given up voluntarily in all but four states in the South that are now called the Hard Four (HF), while the remainder in the North and elsewhere are called the Clean Hands States (CLH), with Texas remaining disputed (Texas even fought a stalemated civil war against of the rest of USA—i.e. CLF and HF combined—from 1964-1975). The larger rump of the USA, CLF, is mired in recessions and is racist despite its claim to be slave-free, while the HF is prosperous due to its low cost of labour, making no bones about being a “prejudiced establishment.” A treaty between the two sides establishes that any runaway slaves who use an organization called the Underground Airlines (the runaways are transported from HF to CLF and finally flown to Canada) to get away, must be hunted down and returned to their slave masters. There is brisk business on both sides; there are no good guys here, for the bad guys in the HF profit by facilitating the escape of slaves, while their counterparts in the CLF kidnap free blacks and ship them to the HF for money. In this dystopian climate we have Victor, an escapee from the HF, hard wired to the US Marshalls’ Office in the CLF, monitored, and forced to hunt down runaways in exchange for his freedom one day in a yet-to-be-determined future.All this is great, as the dystopian world is gradually revealed in the first part of the book, titled “North.” But when the protagonist heads into the second part titled “South,” the book really starts to head south. This is because the leisured pace of painting the setting and character development that we experienced in “North” gives way to chapter-turning twists and reversals that are bewildering in their contrivance and frequency. It was as if the editor instructed the author to “crank it up” in the interest of holding the reader, and in my case, losing him. The stakes are not what they appear to be and are being upped all the time until the very end—textbook thriller style, but one that didn’t quite work for me. All plot is contrivance, but the degree and frequency of plotting is a balancing act, for it can spell the difference between plausibility and farce. Victor is the tortured in-between, a reinforcement of the “survival of the fittest” ethos that drives America today. And it is through his first-person narrative that we get to view this dystopia. Victor also conveniently positions himself in others’ heads and guesses their motivations for our benefit. His abject guilt-ridden, self-pitying narration doesn’t allow for dramatic impact. Some other hackneyed devices that do not cut the mustard are: (a) the obvious withholding of key bits of information for use later in more dramatic fashion (b) repeating lines over and over for effect (c) endowing characters with talents we never knew they had or were capable of: i.e. Martha’s remarkable role playing abilities, Victor’s brilliant computer hacking experience and his ability to function at a high level with septic bullet wounds in his body. And the scene in AVP Transport Operations Matty Newell’s office is pure dramedy. I think the science-fiction thriller is a great vehicle to hook readers and impart universal truths in a palatable form. But if the form becomes too unreal, we lose the inherent message, and this is what happened here for me. Victor does achieve congruency of purpose in this novel, but the book left me feeling cheated after its’ great start and implied promise of a satisfying thriller....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Nov 26, 2017","Nov 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32940838-underground-airlines

Even though this memoir reads like a literary version of Sinatra’s song, “My Way,” this author accomplished and witnessed a lot during his long and colourful life without having to resort to the tabloids for fame.An orphan, raised by a single foster mother and brought up a Quaker, Michener had a stoic discipline that helped him overcome life’s challenges. He measured himself only against the stronger personalities he met on his travels, never being content with his last success, or being let down by his last failure. His travels during the WWII through safe battle zones like the South Pacific gave him a mother lode of stories about this rather uncontrolled part of the world and its chains of islands that seem to fall off Mercator’s map. A chance intervention by some powerful personalities who liked his recounting of the South Pacific, saw him win a Pulitzer Prize for his first novel. This resulted in movie and stage rights for “South Pacific” that kept him in royalties, enabling him to embark on a full time writing career. He had ample preparation, having been an academic and an editor at McMillan, before the journey began.He also stumbled on a unique formula that found favour with audiences anxious to learn about the world, albeit in more palatable terms than what came out of dry history books. Hence the Michener doorstopper books on places like Hawaii, South Africa, Poland et al, each taking approximately three years to write, where Michener immersed himself in the locale, in its history dating back to creation, and brought it alive with fictional (and sometimes, non-fictional) characters and stories. He was often criticized for subverting history to suit his plots, but he did not read s of his books. Success begat success, leading to a string of best-sellers, and soon he was giving his money away to worthy causes, because he says that he never was any good at managing money.He was a political animal, born into a Republican community but drifting over to the Democratic cause over time. He ran for Congress unsuccessfully and thereafter served on many political committees at the Federal and State level, and even accompanied President Nixon to China. Throughout the chapters—arranged by subject and not by date, and therefore causing some repetition in places—we see Michener’s philosophy emerge:•	He didn’t believe in “trickle-down economics” and preferred to pay taxes.•	He wasn’t a fan of the National Guard. He believed that rich and poor alike should be conscripted.•	He was a strong supporter of middle class values.•	He disagreed with the unfair distribution of wealth in favour of the 1% of popular writers (of which he was one), but justified it only if these staggering earnings were plowed back into the promotion of literature in general (which he did).•	He believed that an orphan of colour would not have had the same chances he had, because he was cocooned and supported by a loving foster mother, a connected extended family, and mentors in school and college who encouraged his development. Orphans of colour often do not have these support networks, he observes.He alludes to the fact that he did not have a literary style (pointed out by many of his critics) and that he was merely a story teller, that his characters were cardboard cut-outs, and that he had little skill or intent in understanding their psychology. He was a loner in the literary establishment.The section I found most revealing was his dissection of the publishing process of the last century from the inside, as an editor and a best-selling author. He provides statistics and economics that help us understand the business model of traditional twentieth century publishing which has now changed dramatically with technology. I marvelled at the team assembled around him to produce each of his books: secretary, expert reader, editor(s), lawyers, and proof-reader—and he still found errors in his work. Today those roles are all rolled into one: the author—and well, there are always those odd errors still around.And yes, I guess he has earned the right to sing the song “My Way” for there were times when he “bit off more than he could chew’: surviving three plane crashes, a heart attack, gout, and the transplanting of various body parts, and having his books initially banned in the countries he had written about.Despite his moralistic style of declaiming how he had “done it,” I found this book to be revelatory of a time gone by in publishing....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2017","Nov 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42966.The_World_Is_My_Home

I came to this novel, a former school text in Canada, rather late in life, but I am glad I did, for it paints a picture of this country’s evolution from the late 19th to the mid 20th century from a woman’s perspective, and reveals the frightening aspects of growing old and insignificant.Hagar Shipley is an unforgettable character; feisty, cruel, unrelenting and deathly honest. She loves her wastrel younger son but not her dull older one who looks after her well into his sixties. She deserts her husband, Bram, a not-too-successful farmer 14 years her senior, and only comes back to visit when he is dying. She in turn has had fate deal wicked blows to her: losing her mother at birth, her siblings during childhood; her storekeeper father leaves his estate to the town and not to his only surviving daughter, Hagar. Her biggest loss is that of her younger son, John, a tragedy that “transformed her into stone.” The stone angel is found in the Shipley family graveyard, and is a metaphor for Hagar’s transformation through grief and loss into this unbreakable, unreachable person.The novel alternates between Hagar in her ninetieth year, seeking to escape from being consigned to a nursing home by her older son Marvin and his wife Doris who are running out of energy to care for her, and her random memories of her past. The story lines converge briefly when she is contemplating escape, in the present story, from the house she shares with Marvin and Doris, and in the former story, from Bram. The deterioration of her health and her mind is brilliantly drawn for her narrative starts to have gaps and becomes increasingly unreliable as the novel progresses, until she is finally consigned to a hospital after contracting pneumonia from running away unprotected. Her hospital stay is also well drawn and one gets a vivid picture of hospital wards in the 1950’s— thank God there has been more technological progress today! And it is in hospital that Hagar, the stone angel, makes her way back, by accepting some truths about herself, making amends for her recalcitrance, giving people credit for what they have done, and reaching beyond herself to help others.I can understand why this was a seminal novel in the 1960’s in Canada. The writing is frank and does not pull any punches, even though the prose is poetic where warranted. The book throws the spotlight on a woman’s world, when much of the literature of the day was of the masculine perspective. The subject of aging and the challenges that it presents is thrust into our faces, and with our aging population, this book retains its currency today. What is sad however, is that although we have progressed technologically in the last half century since this novel was written, a woman in Hagar’s position may not be further ahead today as she was then—we still haven’t cracked the code on preserving the dignity of older people as they lose physical and mental capacity, although we have a host of pharmaceutical drugs to keep their hearts beating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Nov 11, 2017","Nov 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1102322.The_Stone_Angel

This novel (is it a novel?) What are the limits of postmodernism, and what comes afterwards, are questions that many pundits grapple with these days. This novel (is it a novel?) pushes the edges of postmodernism by bending time backwards and forwards, splitting characters and re-uniting them, inverting roles, placing us in the hands of an unreliable narrator(s), and leaving us with vivid images, but no further ahead in our understanding of the fictional universe being described.On the surface, a 19th century lighthouse keeper finds a collection of letters left behind by his predecessor, a somnambulant dreamer, and begins to read through them on a long, cold night between umpteen cups of tea. The dream-filled life of the somnambulist’s recounting is contrasted with the dull, predictable movements of the lighthouse keeper inside the lighthouse, in alternating stretches of italicised first person and normal third person text, in a unique, fragmented paragraphing style that eliminates indents. Edgar Alan Poe’s raven links the stories together, appearing in all of them, but in different roles, and alternating between a black raven who symbolizes a messenger from the dead and a white raven symbolizing a messenger from the living. That there is a pining for a lost one is suggested in this raven metaphor. In some dreams we have connections to other dreams, but for the most part they remain self-contained. The dreams get longer and weirder and the somnambulist ends each one by waking up in a strange corner of the lighthouse, usually unclothed, and admitting that he doesn’t understand what he has just dreamt although he can recall it in vivid detail. The lighthouse keeper makes some progress in figuring out connections between the different dreams, but he also comes up short in their interpretation and comprehension. There are questions raised in the dreams by the somnambulist that lead to further questions by others in each dream, leaving us in a vortex of unreality. Themes like “Everything is not what it seems,” and “You are ceasing to exist” abound.As a reader, I found the dreams to be wonderful set pieces of paradox, featuring many real-life personages like Poe, Scott of the Antarctic, David Bowie and Joseph Conrad, but I couldn’t make head or tail of the dreams either. I could have spent hours puzzling over them and could have arrived at different conclusions each time, and that was time I, or any other reader I presume, would not be willing to spend on a book in this time-strapped age. The final letter leads to some explanation of the two main characters, but it is left to the reader to interpret the dreams. Are they manifestations of mental collapse, grief, loneliness, or all three? Is it a metaphor for our world gone crazy? Is the author enjoying leading us on a wild goose chase of the mind? Or is it just the stuff of ...well... dreams?One gets into a formulaic rhythm of following each dream sequence, alternating with a scene back in the lighthouse where the lighthouse keeper is plodding through his boring tea drinking ritual while puzzling out what he has just read. I found the lighthouse keeper scenes the hardest to get through after I had read the first couple, for they were repetitious—I had established the point about his dull life (maybe it was his form of therapy, but it wasn't mine) early enough in the book and wanted to move on. When I read the synopsis of the author’s upcoming book “When All the Days Have Gone” and discovered that it is about a gravedigger who receives a bunch of letters belonging to a predecessor, I wondered whether this was a formula novel, albeit a new formula in which to explore the mysteries of the mind and the futility of our world. If post-modernism is to portray that “chaos is insurmountable; the artist is impotent, and the only recourse against ‘ruin’ is to play within the chaos,” (Wikipedia)—then The Somnambulist’s Dreams excels in that area.However, as I am not a particular fan of the hopelessness and senselessness of post-modernism, and would rather see some hope at the end of the chaos, and as I wish to involve readers (without driving them mad) in coming up with potential scenarios that create that hope (call me a post-post modernist), I wished that we had been given some help in untangling those dreams and re-interpreting them in a shape that would have provided for light at the end of the tunnel, and like the lighthouse metaphor, brought our ships into harbour safely....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2017","Nov 02, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32025689-the-somnambulist-s-dreams

The contributors’ credentials are impressive, all of them published several times over, many with multiple collections of short stories to their credit in addition to novels, screenplays and plays, and about a third belonging to the “by-invitation-only” literary club, Aosdána.Several themes play out, and religion’s affect on families is brought out well in the stories: “The Road to the Shore,” where the sheltered lives of nuns and their submission to authority figures like Mother Superior when dealing with unexpected circumstances in the outside world is well drawn; so is the impact on a mother of giving up a child to the Holy Orders in “An Attack of Hunger”; or the more insidious impact when one’s son, a priest, is being accused of pedophilia in “A Priest in the Family.” The taboos that religion locks the country in is brilliantly delivered in “Mothers Were All the Same.” And talking of mothers, why does the mother in “Train Tracks” regularly peel her 12 year son’s foreskin, because “it will be good for him when he’s bigger” (did she mean ‘older’?), while discussing the saving power of scapulars with him?The revolutionary struggle against British colonial masters comes out in “Naming the Names,” where love has to be subjugated to the cause; when night gangs of curfew breakers clash among themselves for turf in “Curfew,”; when a farmer would rather kill his horse rescued from drowning by British soldiers than accept their charity in “Everything in this Country Must.”Urban/regional tensions surface in “Music at Annahuillion” where a piano is desired, but its value cannot be derived in a rural farmhouse people by three eccentric siblings; in “Midwife to the Fairies” where a urban midwife delivers a baby to a rural family with tragic results; in “Lilacs” where a smelly dung heap can become the new gold. Family dysfunction is riddled throughout the collection, the best ones being, “Memory and Desire” where memories are strong and desire subtle, “The Supremacy of Grief” where people would rather focus on life than grieve over death no matter how much death is thrown in their face, and in “Men & Women” where years of humiliation and domination pushes a woman to literally take the steering wheel and leave her bullying husband stranded.The writing styles veer towards narration over dialogue, and the dialogue, where it exists, has many accents. POV shifts happen suddenly; obviously these Irish writers haven’t been over-exposed to the writing mills in North America with their rigid rules for craft. The stories emerge as you dive into them and do not necessarily flow in a way that makes it easy for the reader to enter them; I had to re-read certain sections to comprehend what had just gone on. I noticed a subtle difference between the Northern Irish writers and their southern cousins; the former couldn’t disassociate from the “troubles” and had many more characters people their stories.This is a slow read. Each story should be read and savoured. Each story will please, in its own way.

Elliot’s essay, “Notes Toward a Definition of Culture,” and draws a line between high culture—the preserve of an educated few in which serious answers are offered to the complexities of life—and democratized mass culture where the answers are playful ones intended to entertain, not enlighten.He deals at length with the rise of fundamentalism in religion among both Christians and Moslems. His take is that although many Christian principles are embodied in Democracy, secularism is essential for democracy to flourish. Tie religion with the state and you get regimes found today in Saudi Arabia and Iran, he postulates.He pines for sex to be restored to an art form. He posits that physical love should be cloaked in taboos, rules, ceremony and rituals, so that it’s transgressive nature may be enjoyed to the fullest.He rails against the invasion of privacy, especially into the lives of politicians, by a sensationalist media that results in attracting fewer bright people into politics. He advocates for confidentiality in governance, and states that “transparency at all costs” (i.e. Wikileaks) is a hindrance.There are many other ideas in this book, some of which I cannot agree with but which I admire Llosa for exposing bravely. Here are a few more that struck me:a) Price = Value today. Thus, works of art that have high aesthetic value but low commercial value get shut out by market forces.b) Images are taking primacy over ideas ( e.g. Facebook, Instagram).c) Cooking and fashion have also become part of magazine culture that was once the preserve of literature and art.d) Literary criticism is sliding towards slick marketing.e) Once literature and the arts were voices of conscience, now they are an escape, like marijuana.f) The online library (i.e. Google) is making us dumber.g) The entertainment culture has reduced us to a “civilization of the spectacle.”In the final chapter he draws the difference between the written word and the audio visual, positing that the former can go deeper into causes and help bring about change, while the latter makes us only passive observers. I said earlier that I didn’t agree with everything Llosa said, and this last chapter was one them. In order to change one has to reach the audience, and for better or worse, the adage “a picture is worth more than a thousand words” is truer today than when the phrase was coined.

Steinbeck followed a Mon-Fri routine and only broke it to write a short story on one weekend. The daily diary entry was a warm-up to the day’s writing, and we get a sense of his mood on that particular day. Here was a writer immersed, excited and engaged with his work, a multi-generational fictional history based on his family who lived in the Salinas Valley, California. On some days he procrastinated, on other days he was depressed, at other times he was joyous and blowing his own horn that this was the greatest book he had ever written and that everything before had been merely practice—I would disagree with that.During the writing of East of Eden, he moves with his family from New York to Nantucket, Massachusetts for a summer vacation, working all the while, as his third wife, Elaine, organizes the family logistics, giving him the time and freedom to work uninterrupted. Covici comes by weekly to retrieve the master’s pencil-written pages to have them typed, and when the Steinbecks are in Nantucket, the handwritten pages are mailed to the publisher’s offices. Steinbeck is the quintessential craftsman, and when he is not crafting his blockbuster of a novel, he is making furniture around the house and redesigning his kitchen. And Steinbeck sharpens his pencils daily and runs through dozens of them before the book is finished.Steinbeck comes across as a needy, manic-depressive, constantly in need of validation, given to sudden bouts of binge drinking and worrying about his equally troubled son, Tom. His health could also have been compromised due to wounds suffered when he was a correspondent during WWII. He is constantly selling the merits of the book as if he is worried that it will be rejected or severely edited. Midway through the novel his health starts to suffer, with sleepless nights, eye trouble, nervous fits, depression and an overwhelming desire to play hooky at the first opportunity. On the social side, however, he is well connected to the literati and artists of the day who drop in on him regularly. Given that this diary is published in its entirety, there is a great deal of repetition and we feel that we are standing in one place, while the novel grows at a fast clip.At the end of the book, Steinbeck includes a long dedication/prologue/epilogue/epitaph that is by far the most lively. In it, he features a conversation between the publisher, editor, proof-reader, reader and writer, and we see the different viewpoints held by these stakeholders that make a book priceless in its attempt to synthesize such diverse expectations.Although this book may be considered self-absorbed and dull by the average reader, to a writer of fiction, this is a great primer on the thinking, motivation, and actions of a journeyman writer who through his “all or nothing” efforts, and a bit of luck, won the Nobel Prize for Literature, much to his own surprise and that of the prevailing literary establishment.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 09, 2017","Oct 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28910.Journal_of_a_Novel

On Mothering Sunday in 1924, when the servants get the day off to visit their mothers, the three families head out on a picnic, where Paul and his betrothed are to make an appearance. Yet Paul has other ideas and plans to spend a wicked afternoon with Jane (who has no mother to visit) at his family home, in his bed for the first time, while the house is otherwise empty. A great set up. But then the book bogs down for the next 80 pages as we go through, in excruciating detail, this fateful afternoon between the lovers, where the differences of class and gender are laid bare. To him, it’s a last fling, an “up yours” to his upper class family and his looming arranged marriage. To her, it’s a goodbye to a lover and her exposure to the insides of the master class, a romp in its beds, and a chance to cheekily walk through the house naked, inspecting every item of furniture, clothing and bric-a-brac that confers the upper class with its status.The second half of the book moves at lightning speed, covering the next 60-plus years of Jane’s life, during which she has become a famous writer, one who has broken the “class ceiling” by educating herself, infiltrating the literati, and achieving a position she had never envisaged as a humble maid. This section should have been longer—for how she achieved this brilliant feat would have been of great interest to us who also attempt to “climb the mountain”—but the events described in it appear to be the consequences of what happened in the first 80 pages, and the author seems to be in a hurry to get this part over with, now that he has taken too much of our time in the first half. The seminal event that leads to Jane’s transformation to becoming a writer, in her mind, is what took place on that Mothering Sunday in 1924, when she physically crossed over the class divide and realized that such a transition was possible, even though its outcome was tragic.The narrative voice is Jane’s, but like an author ordering her characters about, she takes the liberty of getting into the heads of everyone else, imputing their thoughts and motivations. Some interesting insights fall out:a) Maids stumble on “come upons” (a.k.a. nightly seminal emissions) of their masters while making beds each morning, making for interesting chatter amongst them below stairs. b) The gentry are allowed to show their feelings by breaking down in front of servants when confronted by tragedy, while the servants are expected to remain stoic and “put on the tea” for their distressed masters.c) Writers are like secret agents and wear many masks.d) “Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde” told more truth than “Treasure Island” or “Kidnapped.”Jane claims, in her later years, that her orphan status, her lowly position as a maid, and being the secret lover of a gentleman gave her the perfect view as the observer and the outsider, preconditions to becoming a good writer. I have to agree with that, although I wish Graham Swift had hurried through the first 80 pages and brought us to the juicier nuggets quicker. This imbalance between the two halves was my single dissatisfaction in an otherwise insightful and very well written book.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Oct 2017,"Oct 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26014651-mothering-sunday

In the first part—the best part for me—we explore the writing life. The central question here is whether it is the observed and experienced life that informs our writing or are we guided by some supernatural muse? The author seems to believe that both points of view hold depending on the work being created, and on the particular writer.The second part, which forms the bulk of the book, is comprised of essays and s of books and authors that Oates has either been commissioned to write about or ones that have caught her particular fancy. There is no particular theme here, the authors under her microscope come from both sides of the Atlantic (I didn’t see any from Latin America or Asia): Simenon, Updike, Lessing, Coetzee, Barnes, Drabble, Didion, Atwood and Amis, and some lesser known ones like Patrick McGrath, Janette Winterson, Lucia Berlin and Jerome Charyn (at least, lesser known to me, but now placed on my to-be-read list, thanks to this book). The genres range from crime to gothic, to memoir, to suburban, to satire, to indigenous, to the old western. The insight and commentary Oates brings to these works and to their creators is commendable. Towards the end of this part of the book we drift from the literary greats to three pieces about boxing; the subjects are Mike Tyson, Micky Ward, and Muhammad Ali. These boxing pieces are written as if by a sports reporter rather than a professor of literature, and I marvelled at Oates’ grasp of the sport. I learned a few things too: Simenon characterized himself as a psychopath; in England writers tend to work in publishing houses while in America they work in college creative writing programs; Joan Didion’s protagonists in her novels are all, well...Joan Didion; champion boxers make millions for others and often end up in debt. The final part, another departure from the first two, details a guided tour of San Quentin Prison, including a “walk around the block” of overcrowded Cell Block C, a flit past Death Row, and a visit to the execution room to peer into the murky bell chamber where the condemned are either gassed, electrocuted or lethally injected depending on what disposal method has been sanctioned at the time. You get to sit in the front row seats which are reserved for the families of the victims so that they can put closure to their loss. We learn that new inmates must join one of the inside gangs for their own safety, and that COs (Corrections Officers) help fuel the drug business inside and smuggle in the “tools” for the inmates to practice their trade. “Do not look,” “Stay away from the bars” and other commands issued by the tour guide create a sense of fear and a dividing line between those on the outside and the incarcerated. It is as if when a convicted person enters San Quentin he loses all humanity and becomes another species, never to return to the old life again. A very scary piece to end this book, but given Oates’ penchant for the gothic, it has her stamp all over it. I got the sense in reading this collection that Oates is now at a point in her career where she does not need to care for structure and coherence. The depths of her insights are sufficient to hold our interest, hence this rambling book where every chapter is a new gem, to be read with great interest. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 21, 2017","Sep 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29100317-soul-at-the-white-heat

On this journey, he competes in the Olympic Games as a wrestler, discovers that he is the bastard son of the Roman Emperor, smokes pot, marries and raises a family in Thailand, loses his family to pestilence, and returns home with a bagful of experiences (and with quotes from notable leaders and gurus that he later uses in his ministry), ready to carry out his Father’s mission.Jesus thus comes across as an experienced world traveller, more human than god, and not as the unemployed adult son who lived with his parents at home. His travels shape his beliefs, for he forms his by engaging, investigating and rejecting others like Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, and beliefs such as re-incarnation that is common to many of the older religions. “Vegetarianism is hollow without milk.” He learns about angels and demons, he communes with animals and is guided by them, and he posits that the “way in” to a person is through their eyes. He rejects gambling in China, which is a form of entertainment sanctioned by the emperor. He learns from Quetzalcoatl in Mexico that good and evil lives within him. Biblical events that take place elsewhere or in other epochs are brought into his lifetime: the Song of Solomon, the tablets of the Ten Commandments, his twin children are named Adam & Eve, and he foretells the coming of the Prophet Muhammad to the rulers in Jeddah as he traverses that zone. There is a lot more here...Once his ministry commences at age 30, back in his homeland, the Gospel story is more or less followed, leading up to the Crucifixion. However, Fipke takes his own liberal interpretation of dogma: the apostles resemble Justin Trudeau’s cabinet—12 men and 12 women, the miracles are not really miracles but man-made sleights of hand, and the Tower of Babel is a desired end, not the beginning of our fragmentation. Even Lazarus is a close friend and cohort, not the stranger Jesus raises from the dead. Then there is another departure, for the resurrected Christ does not ascend to heaven after 40 days but flees to North America to start another “promised land.” The battles between good and evil, as foretold in the Book of Revelation, then play out until the State of Israel is formed in 1948. I wondered why this battle between the good guys and the bad guys didn’t continue, given the state of our present world which is far from settled.To me the most valuable part of the book is the travels of Jesus between the age 12-30, the untold story, that the author, with his vivid imagination and superior articulation, interprets and presents to us. And in so doing, we are entertained, educated, and provided with glimpses into the unique cultures of those places that existed during Jesus’ time, cultures that are now approaching homogeneity in a globalized world. My beef with this book is that the author has chosen to tell it in poetry. And in a form of poetry lacking in punctuation (other than for a stray comma, that seems to have stuck from an earlier draft). I believe that here, Fipke is emulating a Homeric style, however, had there been even basic punctuation—i.e. commas and periods—I may have eased into the flow of the narrative better. I referred back to my Icelandic sagas, and they are full of punctuation, so is the Bible. The author even punctuates in voice when he reads excerpts from this book in well-produced videos on the book’s website. But for the novice reader unfamiliar with the content—i.e. me—the lack of punctuation led to a rather clumsy read. Having said that, I understand that there is no other way for so many events to be crammed into a 246-page book without resorting to poetry, where plot developments can be acceptably delivered in a line rather than a chapter. However, being a novelist myself and dedicated to its craft, I found the lack of pacing and foreshadowing, and the absence of the build-up to a climax in many of the dramatic events described in this book to be frustrating. Finally, I tried to reflect on the message being communicated here. And given the sheer volume of events taking place, the message, if there is one, was lost to me. Or there may be several messages. Is this another version of the Bible (both Old and New Testament) boiled into a more technicoloured and humanized portrayal of God? Is this an attempt to show Christianity as superior to other world religions? Is this a message of hope, that good will ultimately conquer evil, despite many losses in-between? Is the Bible story being used as canvas for the author to paint his imaginative poetry upon? Perhaps it is a combination of all of the above.My questions notwithstanding, this book certainly is an engaging read, despite my difficulties with tuning into the flow and keeping up with all that takes place within it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 05, 2017","Sep 05, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/31849226-the-way-in

Veraguth is absorbed in his work and ignores his family, and is the cause of its dysfunction. The younger son, Pierre, is a symbol of the parents’ dying marriage; both mother and father are reluctant to let go of him into the other’s custody, yet they are unable to give him the love he needs. Veraguth is also seeking escape, and a journey to Asia beckons where he hopes to find new ideas for his work and put some distance between himself and his unhappy family. When he makes the decision to go, it sends the family into its death spiral.Hesse, who later experimented with painting himself, conjures the world of the consumate painter very well: the stifling smell of paint, the desire to portray the world in all its freshness and purity, the demand for others to be passionate and alive around him while being free to be absorbed and undisturbed in his work. Like the detail in a painting, the language is precise and detailed around place and action. Hesse pops in and out of his characters’ heads at will and covers a lot of ground in a few short paragraphs. And yet, the dying marriage and its symbol, young Pierre, are drawn out while each of the characters analyse the process of death and regeneration that they are heading towards. There is the air of the confessional, as if Hesse is using this book to analyse and atone for the errors and omissions on his part in his own failed first marriage.The grass is not necessarily greener on the other side, they say, although it’s taste may add to your bag of experiences. Hesse too took a journey to the east that led to books like Siddhartha and Journey to the East, but it was less than an ideal visit, for it is described that “the physical experience was to depress him....any spiritual or religious inspiration he was seeking was to elude him.” (Wikipedia) But we are spared Veraguth’s journey to Asia. We are left with him resolving to learn from the mistakes of his present life, making sure not to repeat them in the next one.

Hana is harbouring a grudge against her financier father, David, whom she insists is dead. Her mother is suffering from dementia back home and is under the care of her sister and brother. In New York, she is being followed by a mysterious street dweller, Jacqueline, whom she seems drawn to. Jacqueline is a stubbornly independent, non-communicative type with a passion for classical music.Hana comes across as impulsive but a bit of a cold fish, flitting with her relationships: one hour with boyfriend Michael whom she has been away from for a month is all she can spare, given her main focus being her music. She also breaks the heart of her only close friend in New York, Kenji, and destroys his career with her self-centredness. And yet, Hana’s attraction towards Jacqueline is unusual; it’s as if she wants to care for the destitute woman inasmuch as she is unable to care for her own mother. Hana’s attachment to Jacqueline and her gathering estrangement from Mrs. Flynn also exposes the 1% vs. the rest of the world that is amply showcased in New York City.The Second Movement pushes the tempo into high drama as Jacqueline reveals her true motive, the secret of David comes out, and baring her fangs, the street dweller puts Hana’s career at risk. But the Third and last Movement lapses into tepid waters, and it looks like the main action is over and the author is trying to tie all the loose ends and finish the book. We are still left with some loose ends, just as in life, and that is good.Some observations stayed with me:a) Classical musicians are glorified cover bands for they merely reproduce the work of others, they don’t create anything.b) There are 40,000 people sleeping in New York shelters every night, half of them children.c) The transition between rich and poor in the USA is very easy - just lose your job and your medical coverage.The author has researched the concert pianist milieu well, and portrayals of the well-to-do vs. the impoverished are very well done. The action flows like a good tune, and yet, the prose is pedestrian and doesn’t have the richness of a Chopin piece, Hana’s favourite composer....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2017","Aug 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31508701-the-performance

While the life of a writer or poet is often of great interest to fellow scribes, some writers' lives are best left unexplored for those lives were relatively uneventful and are better presented in the fiction or poetry those writers produced. I recall reading similar books on the lives of Henry James, Flannery O'Connor and Marcel Proust (after he retreated into his cork-lined room) and they were flat-lined episodes that diminished these ""greats"" in my eyes rather than elevate them. These writers lived better in their imaginations than in the real world.And so it is too with Emily Dickinson, the darling of American poetry who lived in a period when women's lives were narrowly circumscribed. Dickinson narrowed that circle even further by living a reclusive life during her time, dominated by her powerful father, and leaving a treasure trove of poetry to be published posthumously. Charyn makes a valiant attempt to portray the period, and imbue Dickinson with rebellious, sexual and impulsive thoughts and actions, and breath life into her narrowed life, but it does not go far enough to engage.

And this book is a great primer on the Easter Rebellion and the Irish War of Independence, exposing oppressor and oppressed alike as cold blooded killers.Henry Smart is an assassin, just like his one-legged father before him. Henry I kills for money while Henry II (or Third, because there were many dead babies in this indiscriminately fertile Irish family, all bearing the same first name) kills for the cause of Irish nationalism, a cause that betrays him because its leaders are ultimately swayed by commercial temptations to end up common mobsters. Henry’s survival battle is extreme; he is a street kid learning survival from a young age: cattle rustling, rat catching, pick pocketing, cattle maiming—anything that makes a buck and feeds his perennial hunger. The people in his life die on him, especially his sickly brother Victor whom he tries to protect. He does everything while underage: joining the Easter Rebellion at 14, becoming an assassin at 15, and getting married at 17 to his school teacher who is 13 years older than him. By contrast his grandmother is a bookworm and knows everything that is going in the underground but prefers to bury her nose in a book and remain uninvolved—she acts as observer and commentator on the tragedy evolving in an Ireland seeking liberation.The first person narrative of Henry is sparse, indirect, exaggerated and dramatic: “I fell in love 15 times a minute.” The descriptions are unorthodox: a manhole cover is “the rusting slats of the shore.” We know we are in the sewers under Dublin by the scents, sights and sounds, but never an actual mention is made of the where we are.The battle scenes of the Easter Rebellion are vividly described and parallel famous “last stands” like the Three Hundred Spartans, Little Big Horn, and the Alamo. So is the divining qualities that Henrys I & II possess towards water, a talents that helps them escape through the myriad water channels coursing under the city of Dublin. Also vividly described are the cold-blooded killings by the IRA. “I told him to say his prayers, and then shot him in the head, And gave him an extra bullet for luck.”Many of the tactics used by other terrorist organizations today may have had their origins in the IRA: spread fear, operate in small cells so that capture does not lead to mass-scale arrests, make the enemy retaliate and sow hatred among the local populace. “If our opponent is to be made to comply with our will, we must place him in a situation which is more oppressive to him than the sacrifice which we demand.”The only problem I found with this book is that it pushes the boundaries of plausibility and could best be understood as a work of magic realism. Henry kills people at random and dodges hundred of bullets while his pregnant wife robs banks and blows up the enemy; his father fends off dozens of unsavoury people rushing into the brothel that employs him by striking them with his wooden leg, a leg that becomes Henry II’s legacy and which he wields with even greater might and effect than his father.

I couldn’t get a fix on this guy anCornelius Christian, the protagonist in this novel, is young, handsome, widowed, highly sexed, amoral and erratic. I couldn’t get a fix on this guy and concluded in the end that I didn’t like him very much. Narrated in combination first and third person prose, with lengthy monologues and bizarre dialogue, this is a satire on the shallowness of life in America. It is also a difficult read due to its style.Cornelius arrives back home to New York after a sojourn in Ireland. His wife who is accompanying him on the voyage, dies at sea. Indebted to the funeral home in New York for the expenses for burying her, he accepts a job as an assistant to the mortician, the generous Mr. Vine. Cornelius immediately meets the nymphomaniac and millionaire widow Fanny Sourpuss who has just had her husband interred by Vine. On the way home from the funeral, the widow and Cornelius end up in bed, having glorious sex to alleviate their grief and loneliness. And thus begins a sexual romp for Cornelius across the bedrooms of the city where every woman who eyes him, quickly falls for his “model and actor’s” looks and invites him in. He even has sex among the dead bodies in the funeral home with the virginal Miss Musk. The envelopment by death appears to give rise to the lust for living - “To smell sweat instead the heavy, gloating reek of death.” Fanny Sourpuss turns out to be a possessive lover and offers to marry him, willing to shower her millions on him, but Cornelius refuses her repeatedly as he wants to preserve his independence and also because he has a self-destructive streak. He gets another job writing ad copy, but that job soon ends as this former pugilist gets into strings of bar fights and a romp with the boss’s wife. He finally takes his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte, to dinner, but that ends up in the most embarrassing meal ever.In Cornelius’s travels across New York the author paints the city as being riddled with random crime, perverts, racists and women wanting to get laid. He mocks industry, and in particular, the funeral industry, the hospitality industry, and the advertizing industry, portraying bizarre scenes taking place within them. The judicial system is next under the satire-o-scope, replete with the its bug infested courtrooms, slimy lawyers, cheeky witnesses and demagogic judges. Someone advises Cornelius that “It’s good to be smart in this town where everyone is selling or stealing.” The disgruntled ad agency boss Mr. How says, “You tell your kids that they are growing up in a holocaust of dirty deals.” Cornelius is amoral, cheating on his boss by having sex with the man’s wife while Mr. How is immobilized upstairs. He repeatedly cheats on Fanny until she leaves in disgust, he deserts the forlorn Charlotte on their infamous dinner date where the waiters get more airtime than the two of them.We are never given access to what his life was in Ireland but it seems to be a magnet to pull him back from the sterility of New York, and we know that he must inevitably go back from whence he came at the beginning of the novel. We learn that he was orphaned in New York as a child and has bad memories of it, and this return trip to the Big Apple has done nothing to erase the past. The sexual adventures only help to accentuate his loneliness. He yearns for marriage and stability, and yet rejects it from those like Fanny and Charlotte who could have provided for him after his wife passes away. While there were many humorous set pieces, I found the satirical depth to be shallow. Yes, there are some issues, particularly relating to the American Dream, that the author puts on the table, but they are dealt with as cursorily as Cornelius’s dalliances with the opposite sex. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2017","Jul 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/127017.A_Fairy_Tale_of_New_York

The students in his class are allowed free reign with their subject matter; therefore bestiality, necrophilia and sex with professors are topics being creatively explored and insensitively critiqued in the classroom. Enter Angela, a punk dresser, former sex-chat worker and disturbed student who has a flair for writing and is determined to be published by a big house in New York, by hook or by crook, and her professor looks like a great conduit to fame. Swenson falls ass over tea kettle for her through her writing, which seems to be imitating life, his life, and the inevitable fall of the weak man and the rise of the unscrupulous woman is written on the cards. I was amazed and found it a bit implausible that a mature, jaded professor like Swenson could fall so hard.What makes this story tragic is that Swenson is a good man, albeit a weak and inept one; he loves his wife, he desperately wants his daughter to love him, and he is kind and goes out of his way for his students. As a writer aspiring for the freedom to roam and explore, he is stifled by the need to earn a living and in having to do that within the narrow confines of a college that is scared of any impropriety that could land it in a lawsuit and imperil its funding sources. Perhaps the college’s insularity is what contributes to Swenson’s irrationality.What interested me was the glimpse offered into this stifling world of academia which by its very political correctness is at odds with the creative process. Perhaps creative writing programs should not be run in universities and colleges, although this has now become a viable form of subsidy for writers. The classroom discussions on the various stories written by the students is a peep into a wildly creative writing group where insults and tears are par for the course. Swenson has to play two roles: a public one where he is the balanced and considerate teacher, and an internal one where he is a vitriolic critic of the hypocrisy he has to live with. This internal monologue overplays itself through the novel and becomes a bit tedious. Swenson sometimes subsides into defensiveness. It would have been just sufficient to show and not tell. When the inevitable inquisition begins, past grudges held against the defendant by colleagues, relatives and students, and all lies and fabrications designed by those in power positions are brought to bear. And as the bells ring out in the college, the author likens it to “the Women’s Alliance announcing their triumph over another male oppressor, one small path towards a glorious future.” The bells also spell Swenson’s liberation from oppression, the writer free at last to pursue his dream, wherever it may lead.

Answer: Very Carefully. And yet no writer should be spared the observations that hopefully make for better work in the future. So, with that in mind, and mindful that I may also be the object of hate mail, let me try to do justice to this novel.A four-generational Métis family lives in and around the Break, a strip of barren land that separates the badly off from the better off somewhere in Manitoba. Most of the narrative voices are of the women—dead and alive—in this family, from Kookom Flora to great-granddaughter Emily. Stella (third generation), alone at home with her infant children witnesses a gang rape going on outside her window and is helpless to break it up or render assistance to the victim. She remains indoors, paralysed by fear and guilt, and calls the police instead. So begins the story and an investigation into the crime, resulting in a peeling back of the secrets in this family where rape has been accepted as a part of life in each of the generations, where the men are usually bad and stray from their women, and where the few good men are repelled by their women who have gone frigid by the damage done to them.The author paints a realistic picture of life in this community, and paints too much of it, in my view. We get detailed accounts of domestic activities: feeding and caring for children, caring for the sick and the elderly, visits between the sisters to each others’ homes. The pace is dreadfully slow although the mood is very strong. Everyone is in pain, everyone feels guilty, and some are very angry. Occasionally something dramatic happens to liven up the pace before we slump back into the rounds of domestic activity narrated by members of the female cast. I was trying to find out who the protagonist was and that was not clear to me—the entire Métis family is, I believe, and the Break is just the backdrop. Generational Rape is the villain, for the perpetrators are faceless and nameless, and usually men, until in the predictable denouement, we see this villain cross genders.There is no redemption for anyone in this novel, only an acceptance and a moving on, and hopefully, a shaping of character. The power of this novel is in its contemporary theme, coming at a time when questions on the unsolved rapes and murders of Indigenous women is at fever pitch at the federal government level. It therefore has the elements of a “grand theme” that renders it essential reading, like Uncle Tom’s Cabin did many years ago in the United States. I just wished it could have reached out of its insular domesticity and the reveling in pain to shed light on the inefficiency of white man’s law and order (ironically it is a Metis police officer who prevails until he gets his “man”), on the apathy of politicians to embrace this issue, on reactions of the well-to-do population on the other side of the Break, and on the motivations of those faceless men—then we would have been truly pushing the boundaries of this grand theme.There is also a sense of hopelessness and a feeling that there is no escape from this reality. When Stella thinks it’s the Break that is the problem and says, “Girls don’t get attacked in good neighbourhoods,” Kookom replies, “Girls get attacked everywhere.”One can only hope that books like this elevates the nation's consciousness to this issue and that better solutions and genuine healing are forthcoming....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2017","Jun 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29220494-the-break

Instead there were several sub themes, shadings, if you will: postcard stories capturing moments that reveal a lot; same-sex relationships that appear frequently; stories about small town life in Alberta; stories about people who have lost direction and jumped ship, losing everything; older man-younger woman situations that do not blossom; older woman-younger man situations that fizzle. There is only one indigenous story that seems to be drawn from Blackfoot legend. Reading the author’s bio on the back cover I found it hard to relate the stories to her background and place of residence, and yet the collection rings with strong plausibility and human insight, suggesting a diverse life lived, and a fertile imagination.The stories are well crafted, concise and incisive. An oft used device is to jump ahead of the dramatic event and retrace the path to its occurrence and aftermath. I wished some dramatic scenes had more dialogue rather than been simply narrated in order to move us quickly through; two scenes in particular: Moller and Julie in “Optical Illusion,” and Sam and his abusive father in “Calamity Sam.” “Happy Enough,” a contradiction of the collection’s title, was my favourite story; a high achieving but paranoid and nosy lawyer moves into a small town with his journalist wife, and gets involved in all aspects of its affairs, only to discover that there have been others before him who have trod similar paths with not such positive results. The animal cruelty in “Terrarium” and “Rabbit” took me aback in the way it was stealthily built up and suddenly sprung on us. “Day One” was a cleverly crafted story of multiple voices intersecting on the day of a hit and run accident, revealing their interconnectedness. The fusing of two time sequences to portray the consequences of a decision in “Momentum” was brilliantly done. And the violent actions and morbid imaginations of the abused and marginalized were brought out dramatically in “Overgrowth” and “Refraction.” However, I thought that the time travel in “Bed & Breakfast’ was a bit much, as was the dying Patrick in “Pacific Standard” siring a baby. I was brought around by the chillingly realistic story “Bottle Rockets,” where the dysfunction caused by drugs, alcohol, spousal abuse, and confused sexuality, prevalent in many of the other stories, is compacted into the family and clients of the protagonist known only as Ms. Reid, a therapist in an addiction centre, leading her to the edge of the precipice, and leaving us to figure out whether she will succumb to those devils herself.There is a lot of humanity packed into this small book, and when I finished it I realized the significance of the title. The author had succeeded in losing me inside the dark alleyways of human experience. I hadn’t been shown a way out, nor should I expect one, for life is not cut and dried.

Why? These miniaturists are painting human and animal images to illustrate a book commissioned by the Sultan, at a time when imagery is frowned on by the Ottomans and is considered to be usurping the power of God. Only the Frankish painters of Europe have perfected the art of perspective, imagery and portraiture, which every wealthy person, including the Sultan, sees as his path to immortality. The secondary plot involves the long-suffering love story of Black and Shekure; he a writer commissioned to write the Sultan’s book, she the wife of a soldier gone missing in battle and who thus is not free to re-marry or divorce.The novel is narrated by a myriad of voices: the miniaturists, the victims, the paintings, Black, Shekure, secondary characters, and the murderer. And this is the book’s weakness, for after awhile many of these first-person narratives blend into a single voice. But the breadth of the multiple voices provide a panoramic sweep of 16th century life in Istanbul: its customs, history, politics, religious and social divisions, and the various tools and environments of the artist’s trade. One narrator, a coin, traces its path through the hands and orifices of the many who have handled it in the last little while, and you could end up being squeamish of dealing in cash and coin henceforth! We also get a tour through the art collection stored in the Royal Treasury and it comes replete with legends and stories associated with the subjects depicted—rich lore similar to another Thousand and One Nights epic. Even the miniaturists associate their philosophy of life with legend and they recount their pet stories in interesting detail. Not all of these side stories are relevant to the central plot, but I sensed that the Nobel-Prize aspiring author Pamuk (he won the award a few years after this book was published) was seeking to infuse his novel with grand themes that build a hefty oeuvre deemed worthy of the Nobel. The painter’s philosophy is explained: Style and Signature is the drive for individuality and differentiation, and Blindness is the ultimate goal of the miniaturist whose eyes succumb after years of work on fine detail, like painting on grains of rice. Some seek blindness voluntarily in order to paint from memory which is supposed to be better than painting from observation. God is supposedly revealed through Blindness.The style of writing is classical and dense, and, while creating the right atmosphere, can impede the stagecraft during action scenes; it also lends to repetition as we hover over the same issues while different narrators offer their individual perspectives on them. The characters of Black and Shekure are unusual as lovers and stilted in their performance; Black comes across as a martyr while Shekure is a scheming, insecure woman.

Was it to promote the BI met the author at a local book club meeting and decided to read her book.At first I wondered why she wrote a book like this. Was it to promote the Book Clubs in Prisons that her friend and colleague, Carol Finlay, had pioneered in Canada, was it a life-long love of books, or was it to exorcise a traumatic mugging incident in which she had been the victim? I concluded it was all three, but upon reading the book, I discovered a fourth: providing us a glimpse into the Federal Correctional System, into the life “inside” and its denizens who live with no guarantee that their incarceration will restore and prepare them for life on the outside.The narrative is structured around a series of book club meetings the author attends at the medium security prison in Collins Bay and at the minimum security facility in Beaver Creek over two years. At first, attracting hardened male criminals to read books and discuss them in a group environment is difficult, and maintaining regular attendance is hard, but eventually a core of engaged regulars emerge. Some prisoners find it difficult to read books of literary fiction because they regurgitate painful memories: “The book is prey, you have to go after it.” The books being discussed are the classics and other best-selling works of literature, chosen by Carol and the author, and are supposed to be free of the four cardinal “no-no’s: porn, weapons-making, hate and abuse. And yet when I looked up some of the titles of the books, I scratched my head. Alias Grace? Perhaps Margaret Atwood, by virtue of her stature, gets a free pass!Attendance at a book club meeting in a prison is subject to many variables not encountered in the outside world: lockdowns, fights, strikes, flooded cells, conflicting parole hearings, family visits—they all get in the way. This is a direct contrast to the pampered surroundings of the author’s own book club in her middle-class suburb where the challenge seems more about which wine, cake and goodies to serve.The author is constantly battling her fear, that springs from her past assault, to push boundaries and meet with the prisoners in one-to-one sessions, or in closed rooms without guards nearby, and even on the outside after the prisoners have earned their release. I wondered whether this drive to confront “the other” was her way of seeking healing for her own trauma. She is motivated by her father’s words, “If you expect the best of people, they will rise to the occasion.” The most interesting parts of the book to me were the discussions of the various literary works, and the opinions of the inmates, which often run counter to middle-class sensibilities. “People on the outside assume innocence, people on the inside assume guilt.” Therefore, Greg Mortensen of Three Cups of Tea fame was exposed as a charlatan by prison book club members long before the later exposé, 3000 Cups of Deceit, came out confirming that. For men of low to average education, I was impressed by their depth of perception and their observations of human character. Their diction makes them sound like university scholars, and I wondered whether that was the author wanting to get past jargon, patois and accents to expose their thinking in clear language, or were they actually that eloquent? I was left questioning whether these levels of insight, eloquence and compassion came to the men after their experience in prison or whether had they always been that way? And if it was the latter, was it just a matter of chance and circumstance that had sent them down the wrong track? As a collective, the prisoners share one or more of these common histories: family neglect, abuse, lack of education, marginalization, a proclivity to take short-cuts, lack of love, instability of domestic life, bad company, drugs and alcoholism.The prison book club experiment has been a success for Carol Finlay and the author, for now the concept has spread to prisons across Canada and into women’s prisons as well. As a writer, I was heartened to realize that what we churn out daily with no hope of return has helped in a small way to enlighten the lives of these dark souls, providing them hope for a better world on the outside, even though it may not always turn out that way....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"May 29, 2017","May 29, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24876660-the-prison-book-club

Our hero John, like Baldwin, is an unwanted adopted son of a failed but charismatic evangelical minister. John’s hate for his step-father drives him to contemplate killing the man. And yet the power of love, especially that discovered in another young church deacon, helps diffuse the murderous impulse and enables John (Baldwin) to climb out of his valley of despair and ascend the mountain to tell his story.The long middle part of the novel is broken into three prayer sections in which each of John’s paternal aunt, step-father, and mother are praying intensely during a night vigil service and recounting the events in their lives that have led them to this pass. The two bookend sections feature John wrestling with his domestic situation, his rage towards his step-father, and his quest for salvation. In between musing and prayer, snippets of back story are dropped into the narrative to help us understand each of the characters and their inter-relationships. This is an unusual way to construct a novel, but it works, and I realize that it could not have been more effective any other way. To support this construct, the writing is lyrical and resembles a Gospel song. Baldwin was a civil rights crusader, coming of age in the 50’s and 60’s when that movement was at its height of conflict with the white establishment. His portrayal of his people is unexpurgated: the black man is always at the losing end of a white dominated society. White men go on killing sprees when they want to let off steam, and it is usually black men who are their targets. The police use blacks liberally as scapegoats to solve crimes. Black women often end up sick or dead before their time; they are impregnated by black men and deserted. Black men commit suicide when the struggle to achieve basic human rights proves overwhelming. Religion is the opium of the black masses who have nothing to look forward to but a life of drudgery on earth; the “saints” (the black hierarchy in John’s church) actually come out of their vigil talking about the buzz they got during the service and how they felt God in their presence. And therein also lies the novel’s weakness, for too much hinges on the spiritual experience. We are forced into John’s mind and feelings throughout his gut-wrenching thrashing on the floor of the church as he receives the epiphany that love trumps hate, a mini Dante’s Divine Comedy tour. How convincing is this for the non-believer or the not-so-heavy believer looking for literary answers?John’s church is not altogether saintly either. The women cook and serve while the elders (men) eat and drink, the married minister is tempted by the charms of a younger woman and succumbs, Aunt Florence cannot forgive her younger brother, minister Gabriel, for the downward path her life has taken ever since he was born. The minister beats his children viciously in order to discipline them, favours one son over the other, denies another son born out of wedlock, and breaks his promise to care for his adopted son. And yet they all pray with zeal and look forward to their liberation from white oppression, similar to how the biblical Israelites once did under the Egyptian yoke.For a first novel written when the author was in his twenties, this work is masterful in its boldness, lyricism and intensity. But then Baldwin had a lot of personal baggage, rich material to work from. And in reading the angst ridden passages of John’s journey from darkness into light, one wonders whether this book was Baldwin’s therapy and his personal path to escape from the dreariness of his lot and climb the mountain of literary greatness so he could tell his stories “over the hill and everywhere.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"May 25, 2017","May 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17143.Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain

Exceptionally bright, puny, effeminate, ugly, gifted with the power of oratory, Baldwin escaped the ghetto of Harlem, his step-father’s church, and the responsibilities of the eldest breadwinner son by heading to Greenwich Village in New York City and then onto France (and later in life he added Istanbul to his list of semi-permanent homes). He didn’t suffer the rejection of the novice author for too long and was successful in his twenties with his masterpiece, Go Tell it on the Mountain, a semi-autobiographical account of his life at the age of 14. This work and the status it conferred opened him to the expatriate community in France and to a multitude of contacts in the literary, theatre, fine art and cinema fields around the world. These contacts included Marlon Brando, Maya Angelou, Henry Miller, Eartha Kitt, Burt Lancaster, Beauford Delaney, the list goes on. Despite this level of acknowledgement, Baldwin always lived on the outside and was full of rage against the injustices done to his people; he considered himself a witness, advocating the rights of the black man in his home country. He had many broken relationships and always craved the love and stability of a happy marriage and a family, something he never achieved. Also dreamed up but never obtained was a strong father figure, and all the surrogates who came and went in his life never measured up. Some periods of his life were drowned in depression and he made several, albeit half-hearted, attempts at suicide. A key member of the civil rights movement, he constantly travelled back and forth to America, espousing love as the way to solve America’s race problems. He posited that the white man was no more free than his black brother. “The white man will be free only when he let’s go of oppression. The black man bears the sexual paranoia of white people.” He supported Malcom X and Martin Luther King but wasn’t enamoured with more radical groups like the Black Panthers. He fought against ideology, just as he fought against his church, claiming it was just another form of entrapment.As his books, novels, essays and short stories, began to make him a major voice in the literary firmament of the time, he branched off into theatre and film, but never quite hit the level of success he enjoyed with his writing in these two other art forms. Part of the problem was that he intruded in his theatre and film productions, interfering in the casting (which often resulted in his friends and relatives being included in the productions), and fighting with directors and producers over creative control. He had a large entourage of hangers-on who were regularly in attendance at his various homes where debates, drinking, smoking, and fighting would go on late into the night - grist for his literary mill. “Conflict in life is inevitable. There is no love without conflict.”On the relationship side, despite having many male and female lovers, the love of his life was Lucien Happersberger, himself a bisexual, who unlike Baldwin, had a bias towards women over men. Lucien betrayed Baldwin many times and Baldwin kept forgiving him until the damage was extreme and irreparable. Later in life, an enlightened but hungry Baldwin took on a string of young male lovers in an attempt to replace Lucien. In addition to spending extravagantly on Lucien, and on his many family members, Baldwin had no handle on his finances and was constantly running short of money, often being rescued by influential friends who gave him funds or a place to hole up and write until the money would start to flow again.  The author of this biography, David Leeming, worked as a secretary for Baldwin, on and off through the years. Much of this biography is culled from Baldwin’s journals and letters, and therefore certain sections of the book read like a chronological run down of events without getting deep into the motivations and feelings of the characters involved, because Leeming himself was absent. Leeming however had the good fortune of being with Baldwin during the last days of his life while domiciled in France, and that portrayal is poignant. It is ironic that such an accomplished writer, and such a brave and generous soul who was never starved for an audience, had to end his days feeling like the loneliest man on the planet....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 17, 2017","May 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/161906.James_Baldwin

She marries Leonard, and Mitchell takes himself off on a voyage of discovery to India. Leonard turns out to be manic-depressive and leads Madeleine to grow up to the realities of love and marriage pretty quickly. The marriage implodes, Mitchell returns to console Madeleine only to end up in a re-union of self-discovery that leaves them both re-writing the plot of the classic Austen novel to a more realistic and contemporary ending. So much for plot. Now let’s talk character, that was far more interesting...In Madeleine and her two lovers we find the quintessential boomers who have the world as their oyster yet choose to be self-absorbed. They are well drawn, down to the minutia of their lives. Eugenides, given his career as an academic, draws upon the cloister of academia as the setting to immerse and ground these characters, from their undergraduate days, to the long graduation scene, to post-graduate fellowship work, to gap year peregrinations of self-discovery, and to premature testing of the waters of the real world with early marriages. Academic subjects like Religion, Literature, Philosophy and Semiotics feature importantly in the discussions of these characters and drive their behaviour. And yet the deeper that the concept of love is deconstructed by the academics, the deeper the feeling of love grows in Madeleine. The well-worn Jane Austen theme of the conflict between individual desire and duty to society plays out in each of the characters: in Madeleine through her desire to pursue post-graduate studies in literature vs. caring for the manic Leonard, in Mitchell through his desire for Madeleine vs. his religious duty to do good in the seamiest corners of the world, in Leonard and his pursuit to lessen his medications so that he can stay sharp and perform his work and therefore pay his way with Madeleine. In the end, individual desires and weaknesses trump societal expectations, each in their own way.The most gripping parts of the book are the exploration of depression and Leonard’s battle with the condition. His manic periods are juxtaposed effectively with his depressed ones, and a Jekyll and Hyde personality emerges, keeping everyone on their toes. Mental illness is the real enemy of this otherwise well-provided for generation. We also get a mini-tour of the world as Mitchell treks across Europe and all over India, while Madeleine and Leonard shuttle between Cape Cod, New Jersey and New York, and honeymoon in France. The writing falls into a pattern: each chapter leaps somewhere into the future and then retraces it’s path, with a lot of narrative, back to where that chapter began, and moves forward from there. The point of view alternates between the three main characters. Sometimes the same scene plays out from each of the three different points of view, and although creating shading to those scenes, bogs the plot down in a lack of movement. I wondered why the final chapter was needed as it seemed to be just wrapping up loose ends in a rather journalistic fashion until on the last page we understand why. It seems to me that the author is trying to say to us that the marriage plot is alive and well, despite birth control, divorce and feminism; only the technology has changed between Austen’s time and the present....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 09, 2017","May 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot

His protagonists in these short novels are artists who have lost their creative abilities and are coping with a host of health issues, staring death in the face yet looking desperately for a spark somewhere that would return them to their old form. And the spark usually is sex.In this novel, Simon Axler is a famous stage and screen actor who is unable to act any more. His last performance ended in disaster, with total nervous and physical collapse on the stage in front of his beloved audience. After a spell at a psychiatric hospital his wife leaves him, and he is left alone to deal with his demons. The only friend he has is a fellow thirty-something patient who wants him to murder her second husband for sexually abusing her 8-year old daughter. Axler declines the invitation. He also declines the invitation of his agent to return to the stage with a plum part that he would be most suited for. Just as in Roth’s other novels on death and dying, help comes in the form of the “younger woman,” in this case, a 40-year old lesbian, Pegeen, daughter of fellow actor friends, whom Axler last saw as a baby suckling at her mother’s breast. Pegeen, in the words of her latest jilted female lover, is “desirable, audacious, utterly ruthless, utterly cold-hearted, incomparably selfish, and completely amoral” - a great recipe to spark the libido of our hero who is suffering from actor’s block. Pegeen’s parents are incensed at this unusual union and try to get her to change her mind, while Pegeen is determined to try out her new sexual orientation, and Axler goes overboard to shower gifts on his younger lover and make her conversion to the “proper side”—his side—complete. He even introduces her to kinky sex that includes a threesome with a twenty-something woman, to ensure that Pegeen is not deprived of her past proclivities. The sex in this book is the strongest in all three novels and stands out like an erect penis, defying the looming darkness heading Axler’s way. And when it comes to writing about sex, especially of the kinky and raunchy kind, Roth seems not to have lost his edge.Of course, a 65 year-old and a 40 year-old trying to make a baby (yes, Axler is even prepared to go that far) is fraught with peril, not only of a biological nature. When Pegeen abruptly leaves him to return to her regular sexual orientation (we are not sure whether it is to be with their threesome partner, although the jealous Axler believes so), Axler is left to decide whether he has the courage to act, like his fellow psychiatric patient did as soon as she got out of hospital. He finally acts, and, in keeping with his thespian background, makes an exit from the stage that would have made Konstantin in Chekov’s play The Seagull proud of him. The famous actor is finally is cured of his actor’s block but at a heavy price. I found the writing of this novel, just like the other ones in this particular series, to be inwardly focused and meandering. The dialogue of one person runs for pages as if they are making a speech, or as if the aging Roth, wanting to get all the information on the table before his afternoon nap, has delegated one character to spill it all. And yet the creeping sense of doom builds well, so that we know, just like with Everyman and Ghost, there is no escape from the bogeyman for Axler.I can understand why Roth announced his retirement after these novels. After one deals with the subject of death several times over, and concludes that in all instances it leads to the inevitable annihilation of the affirmed atheist, of which Roth is one, what is there left to explore?...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 03, 2017","May 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6428536-the-humbling

Our Everyman is an average guy, an advertising man and a creative artist who has had a long and successful career, is retired, has married and divorced three times and then who succumbs to a progressive series of illnesses that will finally put him under. Everyman’s story, in other words, is nothing spectacular - it’s our story - and that’s what makes it relevant. But Roth takes you deep into this Everyman’s mind and conscience. This Everyman envies his elder, more successful, and gifted brother who has never had an ailment and is still married to the same woman, he feels guilty for breaking up families by starting others, he misses the father he idolizes as much as his sons despise him, he misses the life force that has been his driver and nemesis: sex.The writing is literary but accessible and runs in a stream of recollections hovering mainly around Everyman’s stints in hospital throughout his life, from a hernia operation as a child to an appendectomy as an adult, to several heart operations in middle age. Other scenes are set-piece conversations that reveal much: Everyman chatting up a 24-year-old jogger as he lusts over her sweaty body is both sad and pathetic and begs the question : “Is he an old lecher or a soul trying to regain his life spark?” As his health worsens, he boldly pursues conversations with dying friends and grave diggers, people closer to the action that he is bound to participate in next.Towards the end of his days, he leaves New York City for a retirement community and is surrounded by similarly afflicted souls suffering the vicissitudes of aging. Everyone is bemoaning the loss of control: his ex-wife Phoebe the lack of hand movement following a stroke, an old colleague the nausea that comes with cancer treatments, and Everyman himself the loss of being able to swim in the ocean due to his weakening heart. “The pain makes you so alone,” says his art student Millicent, herself suffering from crippling back pain. “We have a pathetic need to be comforted.”There is a strong autobiographical element in this book as there are in most Roth books - the authentic writer bearing all, unafraid of public censure, uncaring for the living who may see shadows of themselves in the characters or situations described. Roth himself was a second child, he had troubled marriages, and he had a successful literary career before retiring (although he keeps popping books from out of retirement on a regular basis!).Death is an unpleasant and morbid topic and yet one that every major writer attempts to address in their work at least once, and I have noticed that in the slew of short novels that Roth has released in the 21st century, this theme plays out a lot, culminating in Everyman. What was disappointing however was that in the end I never understood what purpose Everyman had served humanity other than to procreate a few unhappy children, and leave a lot of women unhappy. Roth being an atheist, I guess, doesn’t believe in a divine purpose and is probably suggesting that, “We are born alone, and we die alone, and between those bookends we meet a few interesting people who shape our character. There is nothing more.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2017","Apr 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50695.Everyman

The stories in the first volume, Eyes of Blue Dog, are the hardest to read as they are interior monologues and reminiscences with very little action or movement, the protagonists often pre-occupied with death. The characters feel and sense their world viscerally, and the titles bear little resemblance to the content of the pieces, and yet, given that the author was in his twenties when these stories were written, it foreshadows the literary maturity that was to develop later. We see some dialogue and movement appear in the later stories in this volume. There is a tendency to repeat lines like “The curlews pecked out our eyes” or “A horse kicked me in the head” to emphasise the direness of the characters’ situations. And when the Negro who sang in the park comes to take our protagonist away to “sing in the choir” we realize that the latter is dying; when the torrential rains run for days, floods the town and addles the mind, we are “shown” this by the townspeople seeing and smelling bodies from the graveyard floating in the streets - great imagery!The second volume, Big Mama’s Funeral, is set in Macondo, Garcia Marquez’s fictional hometown and the one he immortalized in his novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. The corrupt mayor, the rich industrialist, the thief and other characters like the Buendia family flit in and out of the stories playing different roles. The writer’s irony begins to appear in these stories: the widow of the rich man who believes her dead spouse was noble when he was a mass murderer, the artist who gets beaten up for exposing the rich man’s corrupt soul, the blind grandmother who “sees” everything in her granddaughter’s life. The author even has his take on the Wandering Jew story, a metaphor used throughout literature. The final story, from which this volume gets its title, is a grand metaphor to the death of the old way of life and the birth of the new one, the rule of the landed gentry giving way to democracy. It is also a story in which Garcia Marquez’s fiction, in this collection, transcends the micro view to take on the macro one.The third volume, The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Erendira and Her Heartless Grandmother, seems pre-occupied with taking the author’s vision down to the level of children. Two of the tales are subtitled “A Tale for Children,” and speak of strange people and ships that appear from out of the sea to teach us lessons. Yet, other pre-occupations, not necessarily juvenile in content, emerge: the dying and corrupt senator who sacrifices his reputation to feast on the body of a young girl, a theme that Garcia Marquez fully developed in his final novel, Memories of My Melancholy Whores; the balance of good and evil, both needing each other to survive. The final story from which the volume gets it’s name, is the longest in the entire collection, and its title says it all: poor Erendira the 14 year-old virgin is exploited to the fullest by her wicked grandmother and is indentured to the old whore for life. Despite the exaggerated situations that are typical of magic realism, some interesting truths emerge: smugglers do not interfere with the Church - wrong enemy to take on!; those who are abused and manipulated will abuse and manipulate; when one is focused on escape, one often leaves loved ones behind. The imagery is also magical: the wind is always howling outside Erendira’s tent as she travels the desert country selling her body, the wind of her misfortune, we think; the grandmother’s blood is green, with envy of her granddaughter’s youth and promise, we wonder: glass changes colour when the love-struck Ulises (Erendira’s lover) touches it, testament to seeing things with rose-tinted glasses, perhaps?

The incongruous title of the book also indicated that this was not a whodunit but a whydunit.In rather pedestrian prose the author seems focused on stagecraft: where was everyone at the time of the murder, and on the minutia in events taking place around a canal lock. This fixation is partially explained by the fact that Simenon was fond of boats, and spent six months in 1928 (around the time this book was written) navigating the rivers and canals of France, and thus had a commanding knowledge into such activities.The plot is uneven. The murderer is introduced midway into the novel, which consequently veers the action in a new direction. Some characters like the English boater, Sir Walter Lampson, are well drawn, while others, including the murderer, the lock-keeper and the victim are not. It appears that Simenon began with trying to recapture his former life on the canals, then threw in a murder to spice things up and injected his detective Maigret into the story for company, and then, like the proverbial boat on uncharted waters, followed these threads to see how things would pan out, introducing the murderer, new characters, and new situations as he sailed along the plot’s choppy waters. A great deal is spent on analysing the psychology of the murderer and on what led to the crime—Simenon hallmarks.Simenon wrote seventy-five novels and twenty-eight short stories on his character Maigret alone, not counting the many other books he wrote under two dozen pseudonyms. He wrote up to 80 pages a day. With such a prodigious output one has to excuse the pedestrian prose—here was a journeyman writer who had become an industry unto himself and had caught the zeitgeist for crime fiction, a classical James Patterson. Why worry about beautiful prose, let’s just worry about the what, the how and the why, and churn them out as fast as hands can write and brains can conjure plot, seems to have been his operating principle. My one regret, after hearing so much about Maigret, was that I didn’t get to form a lasting impression of him unlike that other famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, or his English counterpart, Sherlock Holmes. There was none of the eccentricity that made those other detectives larger than life; Maigret came across as a dull and dutiful cop doing his unpleasant job of solving murders....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2017","Apr 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18114332-the-carter-of-la-providence

I was looking for local lore, I picked up this book in the National Museum in George Town, Grand Cayman, during a recent visit to the Cayman Islands. I was looking for local lore, and I wasn’t disappointed. J.A. Roy Bodden is a cultural historian and has written respected works of non-fiction on his islands’ political and social climate. This book is his second attempt to capture that climate in story form.When visiting the Caymans, the outsider is impressed with the prosperity, calm, beautiful climate and gentle people that populate this Caribbean heaven. Yet Bodden unearths a world teeming with anger and disappointment, one of superstition and discrimination, one of greed and loss. Corruption is on the rise, education is on the wane. The legacy of slavery, whether of the old kind that came from colonialism or the new variety born of tax haven status, vibrates through the pages. There is a divide between the locals and the expatriates. Racism, graded by skin tone—and there are several shades from white to mulatto to black—is the yardstick for measuring one’s place in the social hierarchy; so that when a coloured girl marries a white American, it is an event in the island, with many supporters and detractors. There is a gulf between the rich and the poor, although, I didn’t see much evidence of this, unless it was between the obvious “One Percent” and everyone else. The locals have subsided into a passive sense of entitlement, says Bodden. Obviously all is not well in heaven, as it appears.And not all of these ills come out in the stories either, much of it comes in the form of author intrusion, which works well in non-fiction but which has gone out of fashion in fiction. And this was one of my bones of contention with this collection that otherwise provides an incisive snapshot into Caymanian life that the casual visitor will not see (I even learned that Caymanians fart loud to show contempt and piss on the ground to demarcate turf).The fiction writer’s craft was missing; there was a great deal of repetition, slow plot movement, lack of tension, no twists, replays of scenes that were unnecessary, and author commentary whether inside the story or as explanatory epilogues. My second beef was with the editor: punctuation was a mess. After awhile, I decided to ignore the missing or improperly placed quotes, the unnecessary ellipses, the typos, and I just read for the story and for the local patois that is rendered extremely well. If the author wants to be taken seriously—and he needs to be, for his message is a wake-up call—then he needs to get these craft-related items attended to in a second edition.Of the stories themselves, I liked “The Passing of Theophilus Brown” the best for its evocative depiction of the link that still exists between Africa and the Caribbean, in life and in death, in the descendents of the slaves plucked from the mother Continent and forcibly confined to a Middle Passage, and to an enforced future in an uncertain land. The final story from which the book gets its title however, sums up the Caymanian’s reality today: the defiance of the griots (the elders) not to sacrifice the old ways has been weakened in the face of looming old age, the coming of the expatriate, and the almighty Yankee Dollah’, leading to the ills that now plague this tourist’s and financier’s Caribbean heaven. A recommended read to complement a visit to the islands, if you can ignore the editorial nits like the sand flies on the beach....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2017","Apr 01, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34748525-a-gathering-of-old-men

After many local rejections, the final international publisher of the book within this book also hints to taking it on because “getting sued is good for business” - I hope the real book didn’t end up in any lawsuits! The focus on cricket, the anecdotal incidents throughout the history of the game, the how tos of the craft, the descriptions of the tools of the trade, and the speculations on what really happened behind the scenes of pivotal matches tend to overshadow the story line; we wonder whether the target audience comprises of only cricket-crazy Sri Lankans (of which I am admittedly one). But then, what of the larger literary, non-colonial readership who doesn’t understand this strange game; has it been given as many bones, as I have, to chew on?Alcoholic, self-destructive journalist W.G. Karunasena is on a mission to find out what happened to spin bowler Pradeep Mathew, who in his mind is the “greatest cricketer to walk the earth.” Mathew can bowl fast or spin, bowl right arm or left arm, and deliver several variations on his pitch, including the Chinaman and the double bounce ball - unheard of in any cricketer. Like his chronicler, and despite his talent, he is an undisciplined player who runs into conflict with coaches, managers, and the murky Sri Lankan Cricket Board (SLBCC) authorities who shield many secrets. Mathew’s behaviour finally causes the SLBCC to ban him from the sport and erase his spectacular record of bowling in the few matches he played for his country. W.G. with his unreliable chronicling of events, his picaresque behaviour, and his technicoloured language is the real hero of this piece; Mathew, when we finally encounter him, is a rather boring immigrant in the West, who has been tamed by time and circumstance, with his myth reading larger than his reality. Through W.G.’s pursuit of Mathew, the author takes the opportunity to observe, expose and condemn all that is wrong with Sri Lanka, from its discrimination of minority Tamils, to the shallowness of Colombo society, to match-fixing by the authorities, to the local mobsters and politicians who infiltrate the game as Sri Lanka rises in the ranks of the global cricketing hierarchy and arrives at the pinnacle by winning the World Cup in 1996. Some of these observations are not earth-shattering and are typical of Sri Lankan society, and have no bearing on the story: e.g. paying bribes to get a student into a Catholic school. Some of the one-liners that the author relies on so heavily to keep us engaged in this long narrative would be best understood only by a Sri Lankan audience: “...ode to Surangani and her fish.” Some condemnations are blatant: “Unlike our sub-continental brothers, we do not throw bottles or light fires. We save our barbarism for the north and the east.”There were times when I wondered whether the author had squeezed out every statistic, anecdote and joke he had encountered in his life in Sri Lanka and thrown them into this book. The jerky story line that jumps back and forth in time, and which is interrupted constantly by side descriptions of certain aspects of cricket, or by historical incidents that occurred in the sport, just as we are getting to a juicy part in the narrative, is a bit irritating and impedes the flow of the novel. And the end, as described by W.G’s literary agent Enid (Blyton?), flagged. However, the narration and the dialogue are typically Sri Lankan - caustic, flamboyant and funny - and I laughed a lot.As I finished the book, I came back to my original question: “Novel, Cricket for Dummies, or a History of Cricket scrapbook?” I guess the reason this book has won so many awards in Asia, must mean that it is still considered a novel, albeit a new inflection point in its evolution. The author’s courage to go where no one has hitherto dared in this art form, like his heroes W.G. and Mathew did in their respective pursuits, is to be commended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 29, 2017","Mar 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8198781-chinaman

I thought it could have been subtitled “How to win the Nobel Prize when you come from the sticks.”Garcia Marquez (Gabo) lived in interesting times: through the rise and fall of Communism, through the rise and fall of the Violencia in his country, through the rise and fall of the drug cartels that don’t quite fall but seem to re-incarnate elsewhere in Latin America. He emerged during the Latin American Boom in literature along with Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cortaza and others, and rode that wave. His native Colombia was ruled by oligopolies that either supported the Conservatives or the Liberals, the only two political parties with clout in the country while the rest of Latin America was going socialist or communist. There was a geographic and cultural separation between the elites who lived in Colombia’s Andean capital, Bogota, and those who lived in the hot Caribbean Costa, Gabo’s playing ground, and he flipped back and forth between these two extremes many times.His childhood and youth is the most interesting part of the book, for it illuminates what created this writer. He was the neglected oldest child, of a family of 11 children (15, if you count the illegitimate ones) raised by grandparents, in a place where families often had breeds of legitimate and illegitimate children living under the same roof. His father was a compulsive rake who was always struggling to get by and who re-invented himself in many jobs, finally using the title of “Dr.” Although his father wanted him to become a lawyer, Gabo was drawn to writing from a young age. He went through the typical writer’s grounding: a brutally rejected first novel; a journalistic career which initially paid a pittance before vaulting him into launching his own literary and political journals; living in different Latin countries from Spain, France, Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and in both regions of Colombia. When the novel that he risked everything for (food, shelter, belongings, even family), One Hundred Years of Solitude, hit the jackpot, his life changed from starving writer to literary star. The biography also takes a different trajectory from this point and focuses on Gabo’s growing influence, helped by his literary success, as a political middleman, often seen at the side of kings and presidents around the world. A traditionally shy man, he used his fame for effect, both to elevate his status as a writer and to further the causes he believed in. He particularly fought on the side of leftist dictators like Castro and was opposed to right-wing types like Pinochet. There is no doubt that his political connections earned him the Nobel, but then we have always questioned the symbolism that the Nobel represents: is it recognition in a field of endeavour, or is it a political statement pinned to a recipient who can give that message maximum mileage?The book therefore teaches us two things: the evolution of Latin America from the 1920s to the turn of the 21st century, and the evolution of Gabo as a writer during that same period. Author Gerald Martin is careful to keep the focus mainly on Garcia Marquez the writer rather than on Garcia Marquez the politician, although one persona feeds the other and vice versa. As a writer we see Gabo’s focus being to draw material for his fiction from his life experiences, although his delivery is termed magic realism. Thus Macondo is his home town of Aracataca, the Patriarch is a fusion of Fidel Castro and himself, the Colonel is Gabo’s grandfather, the lovers in Love in the Time of Cholera are his parents, and so on. He also has a flirtation with cinema by writing and producing many forgettable movies that earn him a decent living but convinces him that script writing is a shallow art form over which he has no control. Thus after this foray, and many others that include politics and political journalism, he always returns to his literary writing where he is happiest.Many people die in this book, of natural causes and by assassination. Gabo’s own writings -“Freedom of the press is only freedom of the bourgeoisie”- against capitalism, American imperialism, and Colombian cartels, and his passionate defence of friend Fidel Castro make him a target, and when he returns to live in Colombia he is provided with a government bodyguard that rotates roughly 60 personnel during his sojourn there. He is even floored by a punch from former friend Mario Vargas Llosa in a public place. For a man who wrote continuously about death, who walked in its shadow during the times of the Violencia and PabloEscobar, and who beat cancer twice, Garcia Marquez always lived in the fear of death.His post-Nobel life, after the whirlwind of adulation and homage, continues with winning books like Autumn of the Patriarch, Chronicle of a Death Foretold and Life in the Time of Cholera, but literary greats are also fallible, and he succumbs to the family curse: the onset of dementia. The edge goes out in subsequent work, and in his last, Memories of my Melancholy Whores, it starts to become visible - a pity because Melancholy Whores is his most personal, the story of a 90-year old man trying to regain the innocence of youth that was robbed off him by an older woman at the time; his answer: consort with a teenage girl. It was as if the aging Gabo was trying to recapture his innocence which was lost when his wily father had initiated him to sex in a whorehouse at the hands of an older prostitute.The last chapter, in which Gabo reaches for immortality, is a bit much, and reads like his own magic realism. On the one hand it is a tribute to the literary hero who has bought the rich and powerful in the world to heel, on the other it sounds like sycophantic worship of a man elevated to Godhood, a fallible man who simply loved to write stories and hobnob with politicians to further his career.A great book for aspiring writers to understand where the consummate artist can sometimes end up. It may not happen again in our lifetime, but it is refreshing to know that it did happen, and perhaps, with the right conditions and circumstances, could happen again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Mar 23, 2017","Mar 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5741575-gabriel-garc-a-m-rquez

What started off as a predictable dystopian novel for the information age ended up posing the existential question “Can we ever turn back this clock?”Eggers introduces us to the Circle, a company that has fused Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest of the social media and search sites into a behemoth of innovation and societal change, and takes us on a guided tour of its labyrinthine world through the eyes of new recruit Mae Holland whose only prior work experience has been in a dull, old-world utility company. As Mae is introduced to her workspace and to the lavish and creative surroundings of the best and brightest minds in the world, she is in awe and becomes a total “company person” in no time, rising to the ranks of its “1%.”The Circle’s value proposition is its single ID and password called TruYou, through which an individual records everything from purchases, social media chatter, medical records, banking information, you name it, in the Cloud, accessible to everyone. The mantra is “Total Transparency,” and slogans like “Secrets are Lies,” Sharing is Caring,” “Privacy is Theft,” abound. Supporting this philosophy is a slew of inventions coming out of the Circle’s innovation labs: the SeeChange camera that sees and records everything; dating sites that even store medical histories and skeletons in the closet; ChildTracker that keep track of your child’s every movement when outside the home; PastPerfect that tracks genealogical history right down to past misdemeanors and crimes committed by members of the family tree. The trajectory of this transparency is clear: extending it into government services like voting and tax collection and achieving world domination for the Circle, all in the benign desire for freedom. The workplace at the Circle is 24/7 for the committed like Mae. Initially employed in Customer Service (make that, Customer Experience), she has to work towards achieving a perfect score of 100 in every customer interaction and has to survey and re-survey her clients to death until she can improve her deficiencies and raise her score to the desired level. She has to engage in social media chat both within and outside the company, she has to attend functions and events after hours, to the point that she takes up permanent residence in the company’s lavish apartments provided for employees working late. Being a “chosen one,” she opts for full transparency and wears a SeeChange camera at all hours to record everything she sees and does (except when she goes to the toilet, but even then only the audio is turned off and the video is discreetly turned away from her person for only three minutes!) In return for this commitment, she is well compensated by the Circle, and her ailing parents, who are struggling with private medical insurance bills, are provided full coverage at no cost, provided they too slap on cameras around their home.There are some questions of implausibility: the Circle has achieved this level of transparency and control of the planet in six short years; and one wonders how a person can answer so many customer queries, social media zings, and join so many extra-curricular activities in a 24-hour day without going over the edge.The human being is not wired for full transparency we discover, and soon cracks appear, revealing a quiet desperation in those around Mae: her parents, her best friend at the Circle, Annie, and former boyfriend Mercer; some of these cracks lead to disaster, and even the founders of the Circle begin to have misgivings and differences of opinion. But through it all Mae carries on, becoming increasingly a product of the new system, rationalizing the fallout, condemning those who have fallen behind and not bought into this new world vision.Eggers is a brilliant novelist and with this book he has hit the trouble spot in our social-media and selfie crazed world. What made me sit up in the end and take notice was that he did not bring in the proverbial white knight to break up this dystopia and return us to our normal word. Instead, he leaves us deeply entrenched in the closing Circle from which escape seems impossible, unless...unless...(but that’s just me left screaming in hope)....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,Mar 2017,"Mar 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18302455-the-circle

Although The Cider House Rules is the main subThis book resembled a cosy fireside chat with John Irving on the conversion of novels into screenplays. Although The Cider House Rules is the main subject under consideration, there are detours into his other novels that ended up as films, notably The World According to Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire, and the one that, try as he might, never made it to the cinema, his first novel, Setting Free the Bears.I wondered why the eminent novelist had considered writing this memoir of his dabbling in the movie business. When I realized that this book was written on the eve of the release of the film version of The Cider House Rules, I wondered whether the author was trying to absolve himself of any responsibility for the finished product. Why? Because movies do not reflect their book versions. They are slices of the novel, where scenes and characters come and go or are replaced depending on the director, the studio and audience tastes. The Cider House Rules had four directors during its journey to being filmed, and the screenplay, written by Irving, changed radically with each one. This is to be expected, for when compressing a story, some characters and scenes will be compromised or eliminated, and others created anew to compensate for the gaps in the story. Voice-over (narration in the novel) is a frowned upon device in the movies and is used sparingly.And yet it must have been a labour of angst for Irving to whom this book is close. He comes from a privileged medical family, and the book’s central character, Dr. Larch (played by Michael Caine in the movie), is modelled on the author’s grandfather. One thing that became clear to me when reading this “how to make a screenplay” book, was how contrived movie scripts are. Effect, marketability, timing, and resolved endings are more important than moral and political issues that the author makes central themes in his novel version. So while Irving the author would like to make abortion and it’s representative, Dr. Larch, the focus, the movie deems a romance between the orphan, Homer Wells, and the temptress, Candy, more important.A good read if one is interested in screenplays, and also for novelists who do not ever want their novels converted into movies....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Feb 18, 2017","Feb 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7071.My_Movie_Business

The naval stories are full of seaman talk with lavish sprinklings of “blue words.” Seaman Muller and his co-sufferers come across as renegades who abhor authority and are therefore in vulnerable positions in the regimented world of the Navy. The Gulf stories read more like essays on his own transient life there as an expatriate journalist, hired to report on altered facts that do not expose skeletons in the political closet. Back home in what has now become Sri Lanka, his observations range from the state of the public transport service, to touts in the tourist industry, to dealing with the government bureaucracy, to the teaching of English by those who can hardly speak it themselves— nightmare scenarios rendered farcical and palatable under Muller’s treatment. He is not afraid to tread into areas normally considered taboo, whether they are about the hypocritical lives of wealthy Arabs, the sacrosanct Buddhist religion in Sri Lanka, or the British Monarchy in the mother country that we once paid homage to.The colonial writer in Muller is evident in some of the antiquated words and phrases that spout from him: cut the mustard, nip and tuck, regaling, elbow grease, gilded the brass—watch items for the modern writer, but ones that give you a cosy feeling and identify strongly with the milieu and period the author is covering. The narration is colloquial—some sentences begin with the verb, similar to the spoken English in the country. Some stories begin with a general statement on the situation in the land with regard to re-incarnation, sex slavery or reptiles, and then dive into Muller’s own experience with them. His flair for capturing the patois English spoken in Sri Lanka is exemplary.My only regret was that some of these stories have been repeated from other collections and novels by the author, all of which I have read, and I wondered whether the publisher was trying to fill a given quota of pages or whether Muller’s vast reservoir of hilarious incidents was running dry.To the first time reader of Carl Muller, this is a great primer on the author who has been mainly responsible for depicting, in a humorous and unflattering manner, the lives of the Ceylon Burghers with his Jam Tree trilogy, and who has captured and frozen a way of life that has all but disappeared in contemporary Sri Lanka.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2017","Feb 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1139375.A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Cemetery

And yet the murder had to be the pivotal event around which all the other themes hung, and so I concluded that this book could have been halved in size and resulted in a much more impactful novel.Based on the Steven Truscott case in Canada, the author weaves the events surrounding the real-life murder of a 12 year old girl in 1959 into her fictional story set in 1963 in a similar armed forces base near London, Ontario. Much of the novel focuses on life in the 1960’s in the military, and this is where the memoir aspect comes in, for the author too was raised on a military base around that period. The minutia of daily life replete with barbecues, picnics, schoolyard banter and family dinners are covered in excruciating and often repetitious detail. During this time men worked and women stayed home to raise families. The fundamental issue concerning everyone is the Bomb and its threat of nuclear war. Two story lines weave in and out of each other: the adult story of Jack McCarthy, newly posted to Canadian Air Force Base Centralia, and the child story of his daughter Madeleine who has to face the predators lurking in the adult world. Jack is a decorated airman who never saw combat in WWII and who is chafing under the fact that he was cashiered out due to an accident on the eve of going to the battle front. Madeleine is trying hard to understand adults like her teacher Mr. March who gets her to do “exercises’ after school, exercises that include fondling and strangling certain intimate body parts. Other subplots and characters are woven in: a defector from the Soviet Union who was part of the V2 rocket program during WWII and who provides an opportunity for Jack to do something meaningful for his country; a refugee from the same program and his family of adopted Metis kids now living on the base; and the lives of the inhabitants of the PMQs (Permanent Married Quarters), not always harmonious despite the all-expenses-paid lifestyles they have.When the murder of the 12 year-old Claire, Madeleine’s classmate, takes place in the vicinity of the base, the lives of this close-knit group are thrown into chaos with the fallout taking many generations to heal. Fifteen-year-old Ricky Froelich, son of the refugee, is arrested and charged with the murder; his father mysteriously vanishes; Madeleine becomes a key witness and is forced to confront what telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is all about; and Jack is faced with a concealing a secret to support the greater good. Justice is miscarried in the interest of expediency. Years later Madeleine and Jack are still dealing with trying to reconcile the murder- she through therapy and he through multiple heart attacks. In the end, with a brilliant plot twist we discover whodunit.Several points are made in the novel:a) In life, often the guilty escape while the innocent are punishedb) Childhood is a scary timec) Children can commit evil if conditioned by adultsd) The price of suppression is the breakdown of healthe) Sexual abuse destroys and distorts lives foreverf) Canada may have been the destination of the Underground Railway for runaway US slaves in the 19th century but it was also the starting point of another Underground Railway for eastern bloc defectors going the other way.Given the political and social backdrop that this story plays out against, the authorial voice intrudes constantly making comments, observations and explanations that could have been excised to let the events speak for themselves. There is a also a great deal of repetition of quotidian events that does nothing to advance the story and maintain narrative thrust, and this is annoying.

Perhaps Nabakov, in atoning for unleasing Humbert on us, gave us Pnin as a panacea. However, although Pnin is benign, his predicament—of being unable to speak the English vernacular in an institution of higher learning—puts him at the mercy of the political winds that creep through the hallways of academia taking victims in their wake.Nabokov gives us deep studies of Pnin and his contemporaries; each has a history and a list of quirky incidents in their lives that shaped character. Some of these characters' stories have no bearing on the main story, and yet they help paint a picture of Pnin’s world, both in Europe and in America, and of the people he had to interact with: wives, romantic rivals, students, landlords, academic peers and department heads.There is also an unknown narrator who starts to peep his head out increasingly and emerges into full disclosure by the last chapter, which makes you want to return to the beginning and re-read the novel with this new information in hand. Although I didn’t do that, I twigged that Nabokov was contrasting his life with Pnin’s, the latter may have been a friend or contemporary. Nabokov was fluent in English, Russian and French, and was able to read and write in them easily from a young age. This enabled him to have a successful career in academia and in the literary field in English. Pnin’s only strength is Russian, and he has to be housed within the German department at his US university because there are insufficient students to warrant a separate Russian department. His accent marginalizes him. And small cogs get displaced when larger ones change direction. We feel sorry for Pnin, a gentle soul, who lives an ordered existence and who is taken advantage of by a scheming wife who goes on to marry several men and profit from those unions, and by colleagues who wish to further their careers at his expense. He is kind to animals, to marooned children, to guests. But he is disposable to others.Nabokov’s sentences are complex and elegant. Descriptions, especially of the interiors of houses, are extremely detailed. After awhile you want to relax into the writing and let the plot go where it may.I wondered why Nabokov wrote this novel. While Pnin is full of interesting character studies and is an indictment on the predatory and over-valued world of academia, I sensed that Nabokov was also trying to expiate his actions with a real-life colleague he had once bested at love and career, not always in the most honorable ways. When Timofey Pnin says to his department head, “I have known him for thirty years, but I will never work under him,” we know something bad went down in their past.A light read and an insightful glimpse into the arcane and cloistered world of academia.

Firstly, she is not a particularly sympathetic or warm person. She has an irrational hate for her stay-at-home mother who only wanted the best for her daughter, she is a promiscuous bi-sexual who will sleep with anyone, including her husband’s driver while waiting for the said husband to join her after a family party, she has no particular maternal feelings towards her three mixed-race sons, or her husband, she cares for her chimpanzees more than for her human family, and she is blindly fearless, venturing into danger zones and crossing borders illegally without much thought for her safety, buoyed by the whiteness of her skin and the suspicion that the American authorities who want to imprison her back home will keep her alive in Africa.The story flows back and forth in time and location between America and Africa in five sections (there are no chapters) and we have to settle on the telling voice of Hanna who is the first-person narrator of the entire tale. We are introduced to her as she reflects on her prior life, while running a farm in the Adirondacks, a place of hard work and peaceful surroundings. She takes us on a tour of her life in the ‘70’s when she was a member of the Weather Underground, making bombs for the movement; she escapes arrest in America and makes it across to Africa, arriving in Liberia via Ghana. The history of the founding of Liberia, America’s cold-war colony in Africa, is covered in interesting detail. In Liberia, she marries a government official, Woodrow, and has three children by him. She finds purpose in caring for a band of chimpanzees that has been used by an American pharmacy for medical testing; Hanna persuades her husband to set up a sanctuary for the abused chimps and transforms the animals’ lives. Meanwhile, Liberia is heading towards civil war, with tribal chieftains jockeying for power. Fact mixes with fiction here for we are introduced to real-life warlords like Charles Taylor, Samuel Doe and Prince Johnson who become central characters in Hannah’s life and in her story. Woodrow and Hannah back the wrong horse and pay a terrible price, and Hannah’s dream of seeing the socialist utopia, once denied to her in the US, vanishes in Liberia as well, along with her family and her chimpanzees. It is through this loss that Hanna discovers her dormant maternal instinct and her love for family. What is gripping and unsettling is the level of violence that quickly descends on a country that was originally conceived as the returning homeland for free slaves from the US. However, as is to be expected, the freed slaves quickly became the ruling class, the 1%, encroaching on the lands of the natives, creating resentment and discord. “Liberia was created to solve a race problem in the US not a slave problem,” observes Hanna. She goes on to posit that, “Everything changes, except the principles of exploitation and use,” for the US, in an attempt to maintain control, pits one warlord against the other and supports the best one to serve them in his attempt to get rid of the others. The mysterious CIA agent Sam Clement shows up in Hanna’s life several times and, while protecting her, seems to be manipulating her for his own ends. Hanna’s drive into the interior to visit her husband’s tribal family for the first time is like a journey into the heart of darkness; these shades of Greene and Conrad provide layering and narrative thrust to the novel, despite it occasionally resembling the ramblings of an aging woman in search of a country.The challenges of a mixed racial and cultural marriage and its effects on the children are well drawn. Hannah never really has a visceral bond with her children, or with her husband, other than for a social and political one. And when those fragile bonds collapse everything and everyone is lost, and what is lost can never be regained.The irony is that as Hanna concludes her odyssey on Sep 10th 2001, she reflects that her narrative will pale in comparison to the much darker one that is about to unfold between America and its international satellites....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jan 17, 2017","Jan 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26920.The_Darling

I was able to compile one-liners to describe a distinguishing feature of every writer mentioned. It will make for good cocktail circuit conversation, I think. But not all authors have been chosen, just in case you were wondering, only those with interesting lives and whose work contributed to the novel’s evolutionary trajectory, and those whom Schmidt determined, using some divine logic, to be merit-worthy of inclusion in his book.Beginning with Sir John Mandeville in 1356 in England (strangely, the Greeks, the Japanese and the Icelanders who came before and who could make similar claims to being the originators of the novel are excluded), and running up to Martin Amis in the present day, Schmidt covers approximately 375 authors. He covers literary fiction and genre fiction, English, American and Colonial (i.e. Canadian, Australian and African) literature, and emphasises those key inflection points when the novel changed course, when each new experiment with its form and content gained traction. Hence we start with didactic and intrusive authors and move to the romantic and sentimental ones, and then on to realism and naturalism, and to the post-modern, and the present that still awaits its own classification. In well-compartmentalised chapters, this book allows you to find a particular author very easily and quickly span the 2-3 pages (maximum) of his or her distinguishing points that make them worthy of inclusion. Schmidt’s bias also plays out here as some authors are given less than the customary three pages, and I was keen to learn more about these short-changed ones, some of whom had far more interesting lives than the featured ones. There is also a Timeline index at the back of the book that helps you find when a particular work (and its author) was published.I sense, based on the credits, that Schmidt had some help from his students in the many universities he taught at on both sides of the Atlantic to gather this vast amount of material, for this can’t be the work of one person; the emphasis on each writer’s life and work being featured varies-interesting though most of the emphases are-and that speaks to multiple writers being involved in the creation of this book. Conversely, if it is a life’s work of a single person, then all I can say is that this author has spent a very fruitful life reading and summing up the great works of literature, and we owe him a great debt.Being a writer and reading this book is refreshing, for it unearths the frustrations, joys, and stories behind the great literary works and their creators. It exposes authors who inherited golden spoons and those who swallowed bitter pills before their work was recognized, it talks about their warts and renders them human. It talks to the political and social shifts that gave recognition to certain works without any influence or exertion by their authors; it reassures those who toil in the dark, it warns those who seek fame.I am not going to elaborate on the various authors highlighted in this mammoth book that runs over 1100 pages; it’s a smorgasbord to be savoured in small portions over several years. I don’t normally re-read a book after it’s done, but I see myself returning to this tome over and over again to find encouragement, insight and understanding of this elusive beast called the Novel that we have all tried to tame many times over but which always eludes us, morphing into another form just as we think we’ve figured it out.It’s a great reference book for anyone interested in the Novel, in literature, and in their creators....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2016","Dec 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18770233-the-novel

England is at war, and Holmes is now a bee-keeper having retired from his profession as a consulting detective. There is a murder at the vicarage (sounds like Agatha Christie was borrowed upon too) and the police decide to consult the aging detective. But Holmes is not interested in the case as much as he in the mute Jewish boy and his parrot who live at the vicarage. For once, in his dotage, the old man seems to be developing a heart. The parrot has memorized some secret numbers that everyone, including the British and German Intelligence forces, wants to get a hold of.The plot that hints to Hitler’s Final Solution (or Holmes’s, for we can’t see him doing this for much longer) is never quite revealed, for as much as codes can be broken, they can also be changed, rendering the parrot’s information obsolete. The parrot’s rendition of the “train song” is a stronger clue to the plot’s connection with the Holocaust than all the numbers stored in the talkative creature’s head. But the plot is not as important as the author’s treatment of this Holmes story. Told from a multiple of viewpoints, including the parrot’s, we get a literary rendition of the classic detective story. The movie technique of cutting to the scene, also helps with pacing in many places. And yet, the fabled “observation and detection” technique that Conan-Doyle painted so brilliantly through Dr. Watson’s chronicles is a bit patchy, for Holmes sometimes draws conclusions that are not explained; he also takes a few blind punts to elicit reactions, and is proven wrong. Although parading as a novel, this is a novella, not akin to the shorter works such as The Sign of Four and The Hound of the Baskervilles that Conan-Doyle produced to great effect. And yet it differs vastly from another “Final” story, Conan-Doyle’s “The Final Problem” that pitted Holmes vs. Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls and that created much reader angst in England at the time. In The Final Solution, we are comforted by the fact that the great detective will not be falling into watery abysses but will quietly fade away in a rural part of England, perhaps with only a mute boy and his parrot for company....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2016","Dec 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16696.The_Final_Solution

The former is an actor who happened to be writer, the latter a writer whose inspiration came from his passion for acting. The former is Simon Callow, the latter is Charles Dickens.What we have is a view into the life of Dickens where he is seen as the quintessential actor, able to play many parts, drawing his characters by acting them out, and later dramatizing the characters from his novels to make a fortune as an itinerant reader, whose reading schedule finally wore him down to the point of death.Despite his father’s incarceration in debtor’s prison and Dickens being forced to leave school and work in a boot-blacking factory for two years at the age of 10, for the most part Charles Dickens had a comfortable middle class life. He also enjoyed early success with his work (I did not see any reference to a rejection slip from a publisher) and after that his life was on an upward trajectory. Except for the modest success of The Old Curiosity Shop, all his novels were best sellers. But always, even with successful people, there is the tragic flaw, and Dickens’ titanic flaw was his manic personality that drove him to extremes in everything he did: fathering 10 children, multi-tasking with amateur theatre, walking miles a day and night to observe life in the nooks and crannies of London from which he extracted his caricature-like characters and larger than life stories, writing, editing, running a magazine, managing a home for homeless young women, and finally undertaking a punishing reading schedule on both sides of the Atlantic. His mania also gave rise to a controlling personality. Wives, mistresses, children, publishers, employees, even friends, all bowed to his will, and when they didn’t, he excoriated them, often in public. His public denouncement of his wife Catherine, who bore him all his children and suffered his manic personality through his formative years, earned him the wrath of the literary establishment, although it didn’t lose him any fans. Ellen Ternan, his mistress, lived a shadow life in order to keep the company of her lover. Neither wife nor mistress showed up at his funeral.And yet Dickens championed the law of copyright on both sides of the Atlantic where it did not exist, he pleaded the plight of orphans and the working poor, railed against government, psychoanalysed friends who had ailments that couldn’t be cured through existing medicine; on his visits abroad, he made it a point to visit orphanages, morgues, prisons and hospitals to observe and to uplift where possible, he pioneered the concept of “writer as entertainer” in the three-hour readings he gave which were constantly sold-out. He espoused a liberal monarchy and believed that free speech in America was a sham, he supported his derelict father and always earned to pay for his large family, constantly bailing them out of financial minefields. Tragedy was his constant companion: his wife’s sister Mary, who had a spiritual connection with him, died young and cast an eternal cloud over the writer, his youngest daughter died suddenly, other children died young, many of his literary and theatre friends passed away during his lifetime.In his later years he integrated the literary with the theatrical to run the Readings, where he played the roles of the characters he created: Micawber, Sykes, Fagin, Scrooge - he had a great list to pick from. If literature was his wife, then theatre was his mistress. And yet his flaw here was to run on adrenaline, for success in his performances was “mind over matter,” while professional actors work on “mind in matter.” The Readings ruined his health: his legs gave way, his voice gave way and he aged far ahead of the 58 years he was at the time of his death.The author tends to glorify Dickens and raise him to mythic status, and that is the flaw in this book for it moves beyond the objective into the subjective and sentimental, much like the novels of the great author. And yet, when we look upon his life, it appears to be one totally consumed by his art at the expense of friends and familyOne can’t help but wonder whether Charles Dickens would have been successful in the 21st century, where the serialized novel is extinct, magazines struggle to hold their own, the blog tour has replaced author readings, and brevity is favoured over the voluminous.

The Pho is also a central character in this book and a metaphor that art can be created from the heart and from nature and is not dependent on technology. Hung makes it from virtually nothing , by delving deep into the land and water to find scraps that can be combined to create a broth that melts the hardest of hearts. Boiled snails, salted water, crayfish, sliced bamboo shoots, birds eggs, artichokes, are among the many ingredients harvested from the swamp he has been consigned live in by order of the harsh rulers intent on trampling all forms of artistic expression that shames the regime.Hung ran a restaurant in the 1950’s when Vietnam got its independence from France and there was optimism for a flourishing of independent thought. Many dissident artists (poets, writers and painters) looked forward to a renaissance of their work which had to be hitherto distributed through underground networks. Instead, Ho Chi Minh, the great liberator, became even more restrictive and drove artists into prisons and reform schools where they underwent torture, disfigurement and re-education in order to be rendered passive and toe the party line. Dao, the poet whom Hung venerated, opposed this totalitarianism with the question: “what is art if it’s creation is dictated?” Restaurateurs like Hung and the wily Vo, who provided hospitality to these dissidents have to make choices: spirit away these incendiary works of art until a more enlightened time appears, or inform on the dissidents. Hung’s choice lands him in the swamp.Maggie is an American-raised Vietnamese returned to the motherland to find traces of her painter father who perished in the re-education camps. Binh and his son Tu are the descendents of poet Dao. Binh and Tao help the aging Hung, who is now restaurant-less and relegated to pushing a cart to serve his delicious pho at different parts of the teeming city of Hanoi, preferably in places where the police will not arrest him for illegal commercial activity. Binh, Tao and Maggie plot to restore Hung to his former greatness and to restore the paintings of her father to where they should be in the pantheon of Vietnamese art, restrictive governments notwithstanding. I found the plot to move rather slowly, like Hung weaving his cart through the city. The foreign Vietnamese (Maggie)and the local (Binh Tu) integrate only after some jostling, and the plan to restore Hung to his pedestal is rather pat, and all the pieces fall into place without much dramatic conflict. The conflict, if at all, lies in unravelling the past that is clouded in the uncertain memory of Hung. And yet the writer gives us a visceral feel for the new Vietnam with its passion for imported goods, its legacy of communist suppression, its scarcity of intellectual power, its reliance on poetic expression and on poetry couched in metaphor to escape the political censors, and the topography of Hanoi.There is also the tender, unrequited love story between Hung and Lan, the girl who lives next door whom Hung has loved yet has not spoken to in years due to a transgression on her part that involved art and money. The motive for her act comes as a shock to Hung in his later years, and one wonders whether this lack of communication was also symptomatic of the age of secrecy brought about by the Communists. Conversely, the seething love affair between Maggie and Tu does not quite take off, perhaps an indication of the gulf that still exists between the Americans and the Vietnamese? Cultural uniqueness abounds in the new Vietnam: the neck is the most desirable part of a Vietnamese woman’s anatomy, crossing the road can be hazardous to your health (Hung is knocked down twice, near fatally), expectation levels for material possessions are low, tours for foreigners usually hover around sites made infamous by the war with America. There are shyster art dealers and nouveau-riche painters who are making a killing on art treasures that depict the pre-communist era and that are fetching disproportionate sums of money in the west. And yet the meanness of the streets in this country with a tortured past is neutralized by the poetic nature of the country’s society; even drunks can be quite benign when encountered while alone at night.I found the story to be too well packaged and neat in terms of the happy ending. That the writer is a foreigner writing with a western sensibility, not understanding the harshness of the Vietnamese life is evident. This book could have been darker than it is made out to be, and therefore lacks the punch that could have elevated it to a whole new level. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Dec 04, 2016","Dec 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6738493-the-beauty-of-humanity-movement

They up-sell local tours to visitors, mainly to gain brownie points with their bosses and not necessarily always for the benefit of their customers. All are vying for the new role of supervisor, as their Ottawa-based company looks to localize its management structure. The only problem is that Ameera has a fatal flaw, one frowned upon in the corporate world: she is a bisexual swinger with a rabid appetite for Thursday night orgies with her customers, without any attachments, for her sexual partners have to leave on their Friday departure flights.Her origins are interesting; she has never met her Indian father who sired her after a one-night stand on the eve of the Air India bombing. I figured the tragic air disaster had to play somewhere in the narrative as it has become a staple in recent Indo-Canadian literature, just like the Holocaust is to the Jews. This traumatic genesis has left Ameera as a rather shallow young woman preoccupied with sensory and material pursuits. The ghost story comes into play when we switch to her father Azeez’s viewpoint; the latter is now a spirit, albeit a benign one, trying to make up for his abrupt departure from this world. Above all, Azeez is determined to guide his errant daughter, from the “other side.” Therefore, there are two main story lines in the novel, narrated alternatively by Ameera and Aziz: Ameera is aspiring for promotion and fighting anonymous rumours about her sexual peccadilloes that are leaking all the way back to HQ in Ottawa, while Azeez is trying to make his unearthly presence felt (by “breathing” into humans, until they ‘feel” something) to his relatives both in India and Canada and steer them along the moral high ground, one that he himself strayed from just the day before his “accident.” While Ameera’s story is full of earthly foibles and preoccupations, Azeez’s story is a tender one of a loss never to be regained. He only has difficulty “breathing” into Ameera, for she is usually drunk after her shift, and “Alcohol is the ghost’s Kryptonite,” according to our gentle ghost.The author captures the atmosphere and activities of a tour-resort extremely well. But herein lies the challenge with this setting in a fiction novel, for it is indeed a barren place populated with petty jealousies, unbridled sensual appetites, sun, sand, and bored and overfed people going through a routine that gets repeated weekly with different sets of players on every new plane that arrives. The action at the resort becomes repetitious and inconsequential. The point brought out strongly and realistically is the difference in meritocracy that exists between local and expatriate staff - the latter being always favoured. I wondered whether the repeated mention of the charter aircraft operating into Huatulco being DC8s, in the year 2015 (which would have made the youngest of these noisy fuel guzzlers at least 44 years old), was deliberate on the part of the author in trying to symbolize a disaster waiting to happen.What I find puzzling is that when the inevitable yoghurt hits the fan on the supervisory appointment, it is the whistle blower who is punished, while the lying transgressor is restored, and corporate HQ is portrayed as a pitiable pimp peddling the supervisory job from Peter to Paul, almost begging one of them to take it. Again, I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to show the new morality that exists in Corporate North America today. I mourn for the days when job appointments were orchestrated with the utmost confidentiality, with proper protocols in place to announce management appointments, a time when HQ bosses descended like hawks upon field offices to get to the bottom of matters that were getting out of hand instead of relying on contradictory third-party reports that shifted like the surf on a sun-swept beach. I am glad however that Azeez, who is the novel’s real hero to me, prevails in the end, and fulfills his fatherly role by showing Ameera the better way, whatever its rewards may be down the road, but a path that is a departure from her sterile life of sun, sex, booze and greed, and towards one of principled purpose. The novel is therefore a cautionary tale for the Gen Y people and a good snapshot of the illusiveness of unbridled appetites. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2016","Nov 25, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/25047101-all-inclusive

When I met the author at a writer’s meeting recently, she kept insisting that she was a historical fiction author, determined to chronicle life in the 19th century in her native South Eastern Ontario, and that she was NOT a detective series author as she had been pigeonholed. Therein lies the danger, for when an author introduces the “puzzle” (i.e. the mystery element) into her desired story in order to engage readers, the tail very soon starts to wag the dog. I had to admit that I was less enamoured with the whodunit part while being thoroughly absorbed in the historical fiction. I was totally captivated with the depiction of life in Northumberland County before the creation of Canada, and the author is excruciatingly detailed on this portrayal. Some observations that got my attention:1) The Globe Hotel stood where the old Park Theatre stands today, the latter heading towards extinction like its predecessor that was burnt down in 1864.2) The Cobourg-Peterborough railway lasted only three days.3) Jane Austen was popular then as she is now.4) Small journeys like Cobourg to Cold Springs, or Cobourg to Baltimore, or Cobourg to Gores Landing where arduous ones on horseback or via carriage. The preparations that needed to be made for such journeys with respect to clothing, food and were equally onerous.5) Young girls usually had only three dresses in their wardrobe: a well-worn one for rough outdoor work, a day dress, and a Sunday dress. Dresses were passed down from older to younger siblings by turning up hemlines or tucking in waistlines, several times.6) The main form of transportation between the towns and cities in Ontario was by steamers that plied the Great Lakes.7) Grand Juries existed in Ontario.8) Debating evangelists was a great form of entertainment and a means of recruiting converts.9) Land was given out in Southern Ontario to military personnel coming out of England to help stave off another American invasion. Except that the land title system was not administered well, and it is this mismanagement that provides the foundation for the novel’s crime plot.Thaddeus is an unprepossessing detective. A widower, and a bit slow in the acuity department (he is 59, bone-weary of riding the preaching circuit, and is looking forward to retirement), he has the misfortune of falling in love with a married woman, Ellen, who is facing a charge of murder while her shady husband is in hiding. Thaddeus is helped by his sprightly granddaughter, Martha, and an ambitious rookie lawyer from Toronto, Ashby, and they set out to save the hapless Ellen while being resident in a close-minded community where his “improper” conduct as a man of the cloth consorting with a married woman places his reputation and job in jeopardy. Of course, all ends well in the end, as most detective novels do, and we are even entertained by a courtroom drama that quickly supplements and surpasses the detective element.I was disappointed in the pacing, for the build-up in the first half of the novel was slow. The cover blurb describes the author as a professional storyteller, and that comes through clearly with the omniscient narrator who jumps in and out of everyone’s head indiscriminately in order to tell us everything: to explain the motives behind people’s actions, to describe the history of the area through Thaddeus’ thoughts, to state the obvious outcomes of certain developments, to warn us of the ill-fated railway’s demise through Thaddeus’s contemptuous view on it - all unnecessary in my view. There was also a struggle with stagecraft during action scenes, like in the one when the sinkhole opens up on Ellen’s property, and in the scene between Thaddeus, his assistant Small, and the two burglars. I had difficulty visualizing those scenes as they were described.I wish we could have just seen the story play out more in character actions and dialogue. But therein lies the challenge of presenting history—albeit, not a well-known history—along with a crime story: scene and character painting will need a certain amount of telling.Shortcomings notwithstanding, the novel ends well and Thaddeus is set up well for his next adventure, while the dreams of the Cobourg merchant class wash into Rice Lake with ironic inevitability....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 17, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/27393013-wishful-seeing

All of Thomas Woolfe’s novels seem to be drawn from real life. They are largely plot-less, character focussed and disjointed, and stitched together by painstaking editing that included the writing of whole sections by the editor to hold the disparate parts together.In this seven-part tome, each part labeled a book—carved out a larger body of unpublished work left at the time of the author’s early death that resulted in two posthumous novels and a collection of shorter pieces—Wolfe covers the fallout from the publication of his first novel and the success he achieved with his second, with travels through the chasm of the seven intervening years when he toiled in the dark through the Great Depression, fighting his own demons and the ones he had unleashed in public. In Book 1, his fictional alter ego, George Webber, returns home to Libya Hill in the deep south for his aunt’s funeral and visits a community caught up in a bubble economy of real estate speculation; success and happiness are standard expectations of the time. George likens the Company President addressing his sales organization to Napoleon or General Grant speaking to their troops. Companies, George observes, create needs, they do not satisfy them, and salesmanship is the enemy of truth.Book 2 is one big party in a wealthy house, the lady of which is George’s lover, ten years his senior. George paints a disparaging picture of the rich: they pick on their servants’ dishonesty while ignoring their own. He concludes that privilege and truth are strange bedfellows and that he needs a break from his lover in order to salvage his art. A fire in the building levels the playing field between the have and have-nots and gives George his out.Book 3 sees the Crash of 1929 realize his fears expressed in Book 1. His first novel is also published, an exposé of his small town, and brings out a storm of hate aimed at him, partly inflicted by the bursting of the property bubble, partly inflicted by him. The literati in New York lap up his book and he falls into the company of rich men and women who want to be seen in his company. But success is an illusion, he realizes, when his millionaire sponsor dumps him for coming second in a literary prize contest.Book 4 is his down and out life in Brooklyn where he paints a cross section of interesting characters, from debutantes to the downtrodden. This section is full of essays on the city, on the state of man, on the distinction between creators and academics: “creators absorb and extract the truth and convert it to art, while intellectuals absorb nothing.” There is also an extended character sketch of his trusted editor Fox - not sure how it fits into the novel, but editors were important to Webber (and to Wolfe), to help shape his amorphous barrage of content into coherent structures for the benefit of readers.Book 5 takes us to England where George with the help of his landlady, Mrs. Purvis, absorbs the social life of that nation. He concludes that the 10% of Big People have all the wealth in the land, leaving the balance 90% of Little People with nothing, and that the man who moves to the countryside from the city is a failed intellectual. Through his misadventure with the famous visiting American writer McHarg, he realizes that the fame he is chasing is a pyrrhic victory.Book 6 is set in Germany and is comprised mainly of a long train journey in a compartment with a cross section of that country’s society, including a fearful Jew. The evils of the Nazis, and the fact that Nazism could also take root in America, where the “dog-eat-dog” culture of commerce acts as a catalyst, is brought sharply home to George. It is ironic, for at this time his second book has been published and has finally brought him the fame he has desired. He leaves Germany realizing that just as in his home town, he can’t go home again.Book 7 is a confessional letter to his editor Fox in which he retraces his life into childhood and to some of the wrong turns he took. I am not sure how this section fits into the novel, for it is more a postscript. And yet given the fact that Webber (and Woolfe) had such symbiotic and tumultuous relationships with his editors, I guess his editor felt it worthy of inclusion. In conclusion, I felt that even though Woolfe makes some penetrating observations on humanity, writes beautiful prose, and draws some fine characters, this book could have been edited further. For example, the detailed descriptions of Fox and the Jack family ( Book 2) could have been shaved considerably. And yet, though I skipped several of the overwritten passages, I continued to read, for the novel possesses narrative thrust and provokes intellectual curiosity.

Alexei is hopelessly in love with the General’s niece Polina, a bi-polar woman (at least, she acts that way) who treats him with scorn. The General is in love with Mademoiselle Blanche who is only interested in his money and who is secretly funding him via a French Count who is also part of the entourage. A disinterested Englishman, who is rumoured to be rich, completes the vicious circle of players heading towards financial and moral doom. The wild card is dealt when the dying Grandmother suddenly arrives in France, picks up gambling and starts to flitter away her fortune, much to the dismay of her expectant family. So much for plot, which develops to an interesting point, offering many possible tragi-comic endings, but Dostoyevsky takes the high road and lets the plot spin off at a tangent and flounder (Alexei even takes off on a whim with the older woman, Mademoiselle Blanche, after Polina spurns him), and focuses instead on the political, moral and psychological issues that arise from gambling.Among the author’s many observations are: a) Gentlemen play for sport, the hoi-poloi play for gain.b) Money is beneath the aristocracy, but is needed to maintain their lifestyle. Aristocrats also prefer not to work for money but to inherit it.c) The Gambler’s philosophy is to not work but live for the day while the German’s philosophy is hard work for incremental gain that only bears fruit over many generations.d) The after-effect of gambling is depression.e) Racial profiling: the Frenchman is an artful crook, the Russian a trusting fool and the English are uncouth and unfriendly.f) Gambling’s compulsiveness comes from wanting to win back what has been lost, a self-defeating strategy.The characters veer between extremes:a) Grandmother goes from being at death’s door to a raging maniac at the roulette wheel.b) Alexei goes from a pining, penniless lover to a successful gambler and then to a kept man of a woman who squanders his moneyc) The General goes from head of the household to a cuckold d) Polina goes from virginal purity to a nervous wrecke) Madamoiselle Blanch descends from a well composed lady to a money grabbing whore.The dialogue is caustic and funny, the situations, particularly when Grandmother comes along, are hilarious and frenetic, and the end gives us food for thought.There are no winners in this gambling contest; only Alexei is left standing, dreaming that tomorrow he would score and all his troubles would be over. He knows that even if he wins, the win will be illusory, for he will throw it all away on yet another game of pitch and toss in the hope of making more.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Oct 31, 2016","Oct 31, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12857.The_Gambler

All this is embodied in the protagonist, Sir Edward Feathers, or Old Filth as he is known for his failure to make it professionally in London, although he rises to become a judge in Hong Kong with the help of a fellow Raj Orphan whom he befriended on a sea voyage years ago. “Failed In London Try Hongkong” = Filth - check out the acronym!The story line veers between Filth’s childhood (circa 1920’s), youth and early adulthood during WWII, and his octogenarian years when he is living as a retired judge and widower in England. The older Filth is remembering his early life and is plagued by the guilt of a tragic incident that took place in his first foster home in Wales when he was 8 years old. He wonders if his misdeed has led to his life of isolation. But it involves more than that: it is the horror of WWI (described as “a set piece of butchery”) and what it did to his distant father, it is the yoke of Empire and the burden of duty it places upon its officials sent to the far reaches of the realm to maintain law, order and good government, it is the rootlessness of children who are plucked out of an idyllic tropical existence and dumped in a cold, loveless motherland and told, “This is your home. This is England.” Filth is also childless, adding to his loneliness, for Empire orphans do not want to have children due to their own empty childhoods.Despite the bleak subject matter, the narrative is injected with wry humour and pithy observations. The writing is crisp; a word or a phrase says a lot, and the author covers great narrative distances in a few sentences. And perhaps that is also the book’s shortcoming, for it tries to cover too much ground in about 250 pages, while making accommodation for digressions that have very little bearing on the protagonist: e.g. Clair and Oliver’s drive to Cambridge University, a discussion on suitcases, and so on.I also found a few historical inaccuracies. I don’t believe there were Japanese flags flying all over Colombo on the eve of that island being bombed by Japan. Nor do I believe that the harbour was clogged with evacuees from Singapore; it was more likely congested with traffic due to the re-positioning of the British Naval Fleet from Singapore to Ceylon. The author also takes licence with British history and has a young Filth protecting Queen Mary during the war in England. The queen is more of a mother to him than any of his relatives or foster parents. The humour makes all this palatable.I took away a few powerful messages from this book: “Memory and Desire - without them life is pointless.” The aging Filth is losing both and is looking towards a scary existence. British reticence and stoicism are on display, revealed in the following exchange between the Ingolbys, Filth’s surrogate parents in England, on the eve of the outbreak of WWII:“Thinking of buying a cow.”“A cow, dear?”“There will be no powdered milk, no butter. It’ll be rationed. Forces first.”""Less is more,"" they say, and this book attempts that, in places. Most of all, it confirms that those who are abandoned emotionally will also abandon, and will be emotionally cheated upon.

Comprised of very short pieces, some no This collection is an acquired taste, for it takes time to get into, and once engaged, starts to grow on you. Comprised of very short pieces, some no more than a couple of pages, they are sketches of existential struggles overlaid with metaphoric external events: a storm, the spring thaw, a birthday party, rain, and almost always, snow.The “artist as protagonist” features prominently; art intrudes upon life and vice versa, as do light, colour, and scenery—the essentials of the painter’s craft. Subtlety of expression is another character. Isolated lives brought about by climate, the creation of art, and the mania of introspection dominate the collection. One gets the impression that Jansson, being a visual artist in addition to a writer, was trying to fuse the two art forms of painting and writing, while revealing to us the life, challenges and moods of the consumate artist.In the title story, Aunt Gerda’s situation dawns on us without the word “dementia” ever being mentioned. Similarly, the woman in “Proposal for a Preface” suffers from insomnia, but all we see are her actions while in the throes of her condition.I liked “The Silent Room,” where a son explores the room of his hospitalized father and finds, to his surprise, the traces of a suppressed artist. “Black and White” is supposed to be a homage to Edward Gorey, an artist who never married and was much investigated and probed for his “sexlessness”; yet the protagonist in this story is married and is very much in love with his wife. The connection to Gorey probably lies in the art of suggestion, of leaving much unsaid and letting the reader figure out the rest of the story, as Jansson does so deftly with many of the pieces. For instance, what picture of the animal would the Japanese artist draw in the story “Wolf,” the real one or the imagined one?“Rain” reminded me of death and the washing away of sins. “Blasting” implies that when man tries to do what is reserved for God, he moves into dangerous territory. “Lucio’s Friends” is more a character painting, like a portrait, rather than a short story, while “Blasting,” “The Wolf,” and “Squirrel” all have events creating a story line. The “Grey Duchesse” moves into the realm between the earthly and the spiritual, and the choices we make about which side to play on. “The Other” also plays with the supernatural and has subtle suggestions that finally reveal who is really narrating the story.Which brings us around to the last and the longest story in the collection: “Squirrel.” A lonely woman on a deserted island is rattled out of her ordered existence when a squirrel washes up ashore on a piece of driftwood. The story reminded me of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, for obsession leads to a blend of competition and accommodation, creating a curious bond between human and animal. The ending of the story has a brilliant twist, unlike Hemingway’s tome that sailed towards its inevitable conclusion.I was pleased to receive this collection from a visiting Finnish student of Swedish heritage, similar in background to Tove Jansson, and from the author’s hometown. Jansson is better known to English readers as the creator of the Moomin series of children’s literature. Yet her prowess in literary fiction, and in particular, the short story, is well showcased in this collection.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Oct 16, 2016","Oct 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17558590-the-listener

Most authors ride this road to maturity. Of course, Kafka’s benefactor Max Brod put this all down to surrealism and genius and the rest of the world bought it - how does one argue with that?This typical quest tale is incomplete, and I wish the last chapter had been deleted, for it fits nowhere with the rest of the novel, although it was supposed to be Kafka’s favourite chapter - it may have worked well as a stand-alone short story. Anyway, last chapter notwithstanding, the story is essentially about a 15-year-old boy, Karl Rossmann, who has been packed off to America in the early 20th century (the date is not clear, probably before the start of WWI), due to a family scandal at home in Prague. He meets with a string of bizarre misadventures as he pursues the American Dream (more a nightmare), and gets drawn deeper into enslavement.The author’s formula for surrealism seems to hinge on doing the following:1) Paint a landscape that has no bearing on reality; the fact that Kafka had never visited America but only read a handful of books on the place helped him invent a setting that has no bearing on the real one.2) Keep making the protagonist’s situation worse, then alleviate it only to make it more worse, release again and make it even more worse, and so on.3) Make people’s behaviour shift one hundred and eighty degrees in a flash: Clara’s wrestling match, Uncle Jacob’s letter, Brunelda’s moods, the Head Waiter’s and the Head Porter’s actions, are some examples. This creates uncertainty and dread. Even the saintly Manageress’ iron-clad trust in Karl is a bit hard to stomach in an employer-employee relationship.4) Keep the protagonist naive, trusting and vulnerable while being encircled by menacing forces.5) Suddenly wipe out everything and start again, as the last unrelated chapter implies, where everything that had happened before is now inconsequential and therefore could be likened to a dream.6) Keep vital pieces of information out: I never found out what happened to Karl’s trunk, nor whether his bankroll had been stolen by his friends.A few of Kafka’s themes that he developed in his later work emerge here:1) Trial and judgement which he explored well in his novel The Trial; Karl is constantly having to account for his actions, innocuous and honest as they may be.2) Karl’s struggle with authority figures, like uncles, bosses and overbearing friends, similar to Kafka’s own struggles.The preface to this novel, written by Klaus Mann, suggests that Kafka wanted to write a Dickensian story and a novel about America. And that he wanted to write a humorous novel. I’ll give Kafka a low passing grade on all three counts. I found a rather formal novel written about an imagined place that bore no resemblance to reality, with the only humour being in the ridiculousness of the situations Karl found himself in, or willingly submitted himself to for the sake of his principles. Ironically, the last unrelated chapter brought some redemption, for in it we see the beginning of the American Dream - “there is work for everybody, and qualifications are not as essential as track record.”But of course, as if pre-empting dismissive readers like me in his time, Max Brod classified this work and the rest of Kafka’s efforts as surrealism and gave us the buzzword “Kafkaesque,” where reality gets suspended and “anything goes,” and the author’s whole collection of incomplete works was elevated to a new branch of high literature. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 06, 2016","Oct 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22911.Amerika

Zola is truly the master of the crowd scene and many of the chapters in this book involve a crowd of people (albeit the same people); be it a behind-the-scenes visit to a theatre during a performance, a party at an aristocratic residence, a party at a prostitute’s residence, a horse race, a wake. The omniscient narrator sets the scene and helps us with the thoughts and motivations of the cast, which would have been difficult to convey through any other POV representation.Much has been said about the misogyny of the males in this novel and about the over-painted carnality of Nana, but they are merely the symptoms of the malaise and the forces leading to the fall of the Empire. The aristocrats, the idle rich, amuse themselves with parties, theatre and horseracing, while indulging in flagrant affairs with each others’ partners. After awhile it is hard to keep track of who is sleeping with whom, and what will be the new arrangement of couplings when the next chapter begins. Nana, a prostitute with a huge sexual appetite for men and women alike, descends upon this scene and “wreaks the revenge of the lower classes on the upper classes.” In the process she drives rich men into bankruptcy and suicide; fortunes are gutted and inheritances squandered while she strides the land like a dragon consuming everything in her path. She wasn’t always like this; the early chapters portray a struggling actress who has come out of a dysfunctional and poor family. She is impulsive and illiterate but with a kind heart towards fallen men and women, a maternal bent towards her abandoned child, and unable to keep a rein on money. Early success in the theatre, where her body drives men crazy, leads to a increasingly promiscuous life with many a willing, rich but weak man ready to fund her lavish lifestyle. In the end, her nymphomania, self-absorbtion, and material greed get out of control and consume her, just at the Second Empire is launching into a hubristic war against Prussia, an event that leads to its downfall.There are great visual pieces in this novel: Nana flouting her body on stage while the sexual charge she emanates is portrayed only by the sweating gentlemen and the swearing ladies in the audience; Count Muffat, her hapless lover, reading damning evidence against Nana, while she is admiring her naked body in the mirror before him; the women at her wake talking politics without a glance at her body, while her male lovers are too scared to enter the house of death; the final page of the book where the scars of a profligate life are laid bare, a metaphor for the decaying empire that created it.I had difficulty initially with the Zola’s naturalistic style where each scene had to be captured in the most excruciating detail; but it also led to a deeper visualization of the streets of Paris—a city that doubled in size during the Second Empire—the squalor of the poor, the grunge of theatre back stages, the stark lives of thespians and prostitutes, and the suppressed desires of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy. For instance, in describing the scent of women, Zola gets down to the smell of powder and toilet vinegar, to rice powder and musk. He was trying to paint an entire society through the lens of the prostitute in this novel, just as in his other novels in the Rougon-Macquart series he captured the Second Empire through different lenses, and for this purpose his style succeeds.Most empires ultimately implode on their excesses and this empire was no different. It is interesting that Zola chose to embody that excess in the person of Nana, the queen bee who beds many drones and destroys them in the process. Only, this queen did not live to lay her eggs and create new colonies, instead she destroyed the old one and perished with it....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Sep 26, 2016","Sep 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/371456.Nana

It’s a novel that chronicles Igbo tribal life in the 1920’s, fracturing under its own human frailties and prejudices, and stoked into decline by the British colonial incursion.Unlike in Things Fall Apart, there is no glossary of local words and customs, and yet there is a lot of local flavour here: poetry, quotes, customs and festivals described in elaborate detail. I felt as if Achebe was trying to write the African novel in English, unfettered by western conventions of novel-craft. Many characters, especially from protagonist Ezeulu’s large family and tribe, are introduced all at once, Igbo words pepper the African side of the narrative, and the dialogue is heavy with analogy: “When a house falls, do you ask if the ceiling falls with it?” or “The fly that has no one to advise it follows the corpse to the grave,” or “The inquisitive monkey gets a bullet in the face.” Many pages are given away to depict quotidian life in a household or village. And yet, when Achebe swings over to the Englishman’s POV, the style changes to a more formal British one; I was reminded of Graham Greene’s lost colonials upholding the far reaches of Empire with liberal doses of alcohol, idealism and guilt.Ezeulu is the Chief Priest of Umuaru, an agglomeration of six distinct tribes that formed an uneasy union to fend off other marauding tribes. He is tasked with calling the dates for important festivals like the planting and the harvesting of yams. He rules his family—comprised of multiple wives and many children—like a dictator, and yet feels that, due to his contrarian views, he is losing his grip on the larger tribe. He is a pacifist while the tribe is prone to fighting. He believes in learning about the British and their ways by educating one of his sons in a Christian school, a move that does not sit well with the rest of the tribe. And yet he is proven right as events unfold, and the tribe holds a grudging respect for him.The British meanwhile are upsetting the governance structure of the traditional African tribe by appointing local Paramount Chiefs who will be tow their line. Due to his independent thinking and pro-British stance, Ezuelu is summoned by local British head, Captain Winterbotham, to be appointed Paramount Chief of Umuaru. Resisting British incursion into what is deemed as local domain, Ezeulu refuses, and this sets off a chain of unfortunate events for both men. Achebe does not favour either side in this novel. The British appear misguided in their understanding of the African, interpreting events from their narrowed lens; the native appears to possess an elemental cruelty that the European has difficulty understanding. The African Igbo appear as warlike, ruled by strange customs and traditions (try eating Kola nuts smeared in each other’s blood to signify bonding), susceptible to alcoholism, and open to corruption. Where the opening of a new road between the fighting Umuaru and Okperi is considered progress to the British, the Igbo walking that road feel like “a grain of maize in an empty goatskin bag.” Ezeulu’s fate, not unlike the Okonkwos in the first two novels of this trilogy, is destined not only to fall under the weight of the British occupation but to see that fall exacerbated by the ignorance and prejudices of his own people. I can understand why Achebe was considered the conscience of his continent, and to avoid the fate of the Ezeulus and the Okonkwos, why he had to live out his last days in America....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,not set,"Sep 17, 2016","Sep 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37774.Arrow_of_God

Achebe takes us through a detailed set of incidents that tears at Obi’s convictions, stripping away his acquired cultural trappings and reducing him to just another citizen in this nation where bribery is a way of life, as portrayed by the author.The question left in my mind: was bribery hard-wired into this society from the time of creation (the current 419 scams don’t help dispel that feeling) or was it brought about by the inequality that was deliberately fostered, first by tribal chieftains and later by colonial masters, where an expanding divide between the rulers and the ruled was allowed to develop for generations? Obi, as a bright kid from his village, is selected for greater things and falls into the “ruler” camp. His village sponsors his education abroad. As a returning British-educated son of the land, in whom Nigeria places its hope for governance after independence, he is immediately given a civil service job earning him ten times more than his peers, plus a car, a driver, a house, a cook and the other trappings of upper middle class life. But a liberal education only blurs prejudice which springs from tradition, superstition, race, caste, religion and sex. Obi is soon in love with British-educated Clara, who is osu, that is, of dubious ancestry; he is also having casual flings with other white women. And his bills are beginning to mount: he needs to pay back his village for their sponsorship, his car needs maintenance, he needs money for insurance, he has to look after his retired parents and pay for his younger sibling’s education. And above all, he is harassed by parents, friends and associates for planning to marry a woman whose ancestor transgressed to earn his progeny the eternal scorn of society. Like his father and grandfather before him, who bucked society and dared to be different, Obi defends his life choices, only to be ground down to become the person he despises. While grandfather Okonkwo was destroyed on the eve of the coming of the British, Obi is destroyed by his own people just as the British are about to depart.Achebe’s breaks the rules of novel craft and focuses instead on bringing out character and societal flaws, and therefore I found the style quirky in places and influenced, no doubt, by the oral tradition of his Igbo tribe. Obi comes across as impulsive and Clara can be jealous and cold. Achebe thinks it is more important to show a driver using his elbows to steer the car while lighting his cigarette than clearly and proportionately demarcating time and scene shifts in the novel. The local patois is hard to follow but lends authenticity to the dialogue. Poetry and song intrude into the narrative. Achebe’s political observations, which seem to be the prime motivation behind this trilogy, are quite astute:a) The locals want the British out—soon.b) The locals love to have a British subject serving under them, and they like the trappings of British life.c) Western culture, medicine and education are only skin deep in Nigeria. When pushed to the wall, the Nigerian reverts to his traditional self—true even of Obi and his family.Having read two books in the trilogy now and about to embark on the third, I find Achebe’s view of his country to be dim. There doesn’t appear to be much hope here. Testament to the fact that he too was nearly killed (an assassination attempt was not ruled out) and lived the rest of his life in America. The “father of African literature,” as he was called, was consigned to end his days amidst the western society that Obi returned from and self-destructed in Nigeria.

The s in generaI received this book at the Iceland Writers Retreat and as I didn’t know the author, I looked up the s on Goodreads first. The s in general were not very complementary to the author, and I hesitated to read this book initially. But as I am still on an “Icelandic high” from my recent trip and due to my fascination with the land and its history, I dived into it. I’m glad I did.Two comments made on Goodreads that I want to debunk are: (1) Nothing happens in this book, and (2) the ending was inconclusive.First off, a lot of happens in this book. Each chapter covers a great narrative distance, with incident, action, and character evolution. By the end of chapter three, all the events mentioned in the dust jacket have taken place: Ragna has been impregnated by the maverick English sailor she nursed from the shipwreck, her impending marriage to Thorkell is anulled and she is consigned to being a fallen woman, he has become a priest, her bastard child has grown to the age of 10, she has recovered from her shaming to be hired as the housekeeper for the new English Bishop, and Fr. Thorkell is eyeing her again, this time to become his mistress - whoa! Nothing happens? Ragna is a weak and fearful woman, molded by tradition, undecided by love. She will lay herself at the feet of Thorkell despite his shabby treatment of her, for fear of losing him, as she believes that in her state as an aging, fallen woman she is not likely to experience love from anyone else in her life again. Thorkell is fearless, misogynistic, amoral and yet a strong supporter of the local Icelanders over the English and Danish-Norwegian rulers who exploit the island at will. He uses the Church for his gain. The Catholic Church, in turn, is another exploiter of the people through tithes and taxes on the land it owns, and it navigates a stealthy allegiance with the secular political masters of Iceland. Internally, the clergy play wily political games with each other, jostling for advantage, with their loyalties split between the foreign colonial powers and the independence-hungry nationalists.The author’s grasp of history is clear from the thrust of the narrative and the detailing of 15th century life that paints a vivid picture of Medieval Iceland, replete with customs, smells, food, political manoeuvring and battle scenes. And the moonscape-like land is portrayed in all its magic and mystique. She employs clever devices, such as overheard conversations by servants, to provide unusual plot movement. I found the dialogue a bit unrealistic and I wondered if this was a result of the translation. The characters seemed to speak in modern idiom at times, and expressions like “living daylights”, “alive and kicking”, “taken a dive” and “pissed itself,” jarred, rudely shunting me out of 15th century Iceland into modern day North America.And as for the inconclusive ending: ill-fated lovers who do not end up spending their lives happily ever after is also an ending. Shakespeare did it, why not others? What was conclusive to me was the set of events that led the weak Ragna to finally develop the strength to see Thorkell for who he truly was and to rid herself of being his doormat, heading off to make a future for herself and her son in another country. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Sep 2016,"Sep 01, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13447584-on-the-cold-coasts

It was as if the author was being paid by the word. The opening line sums up the entire novel, and I concluded that Ford was trying to write a mood piece instead of a novel, for as long as you stay with Dell and his screwed up but loving family, you cannot help but sympathize with them.The first two parts of this three-part novel is based on departures following crimes committed, first from Great Falls, Montana and later from Fort Royal, Saskatchewan. The short last part is the reconciliation, where twins Dell and Berner realize how far apart their lives have diverged due to random events that occurred beyond their control. The story opens with the fifteen-year-old siblings saddled with a pair of ill-matched parents who were forced into marriage by an unwanted pregnancy. Father Bev is a mercurial, manic optimist, cashiered from the Air Force and spinning all sorts of get-rich-quick schemes, while Mother Neeva is Jewish, artistic and out of place in Middle America. Bev’s optimism to better their prospects in Great Falls leads to a botched bank robbery in which Neeva reluctantly collaborates if that would only become her ticket out of the marriage. The couple are jailed, and the kids disperse, Berner into alcoholism in San Francisco and Dell to remote Saskatchewan, where he falls under the spell of another father-like figure, Arthur, and is involved in another crime. The unreliable narrator device (Dell) is used in this novel to try and rationalize and explain everyone’s actions before and after they are committed, but after awhile this psychoanalyzing becomes tedious and slows down the action. The story becomes a very “told” one, with lots of clues being offered about what crime is going to take place, followed by a lot of waiting around for it to happen, followed by a lot of detailed character behaviour in the aftermath of it happening. When Arthur is described as dangerous, deceptive, ruthless, chaotic et al, all in one sentence, you get the picture that the narrator (or the author) intends to “tell not show.” That said, the impact of these serious crimes on the emerging man-child is well drawn as Dell reacts deeply to overheard conversations of adults planning their imminent misdeeds.The metaphor of Canada, even though it comes into play only in the second part, is about crossing thresholds when seminal events occur and not being able to return to the old. And yet there is a sameness between Canada and the US that Dell recognizes—in the land, the language and the people— but he is unable to return to the US as he is separated by events and milestones that have left him indelibly marked. Berner says that he has given up too much by leaving and yet it is he who survives and grows while she spirals down into illness.The starkness of the land, both in Montana and Saskatchewan, is depicted well, and one gets a feeling that these remote places will never emerge into the 21st century; they will live and die in their 1960’s time warp.You need to have a lot of patience to stay with this novel and I’m glad I stayed, for as I said, Dell and the people around him grow on you, if you allow that to happen. Pulitzer prize material? No. Despite this non-traditional approach to portraying a tragic family story, I have to say that I would vote for another book....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Aug 23, 2016","Aug 23, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12872236-canada

It seems to be a convenient device for You can’t help but like Frank Bascombe, Ford’s answer to Updike’s Rabbit Angstrom and Roth’s Nathan Zuckerman. It seems to be a convenient device for a career author to roll out his alter-ego every decade or so for a visit to our screwed up world, so that he can cast his cynical and judgemental view upon it from behind the safety of his fictional self.And yet, Frank is likeable in his wordy, prejudiced and flawed way. In this book of four linked stories, he is 68 years old, retired from his career in real-estate, and creaking at the seams. He suffers from vertigo and is “fartational” (prone to unexpected and embarrassing bursts of farting). He is also suffering from immense guilt for surviving Hurricane Sandy without property damage, for seeing his ex-wife slowly succumb to Parkinson’s, and for meeting an old colleague who is ending his days in a hospice. In fact, Hurricane Sandy is the central theme of this book, acting as a metaphor for God’s wrath brought down upon an upwardly mobile and materialistic Middle America obsessed with beach-front properties and cosmetic surgery. Everyone is affected, so much that Franks present wife, Sally, is providing grief-counselling to hurricane victims.In the first story, Frank visits a former client, Arnie, to whom he sold his former beach-front house, now wrecked in Sandy’s wake. Arnie calls Frank to pay him a visit, not to get his advice on what to do with the wreck but to have Frank share in his pain and ego battering. In guilt, Frank submits and takes all of Arnie’s snide edging without retaliation. The same guilt accompanies him when visits his ailing ex-wife, Ann, in the third story at her state-of-the-art retirement home where the motto is “Old Is Where You Want To Be”; Ann believes the hurricane exacerbated her onset of Parkinson’s while Frank is trying to deconstruct his first marriage that produced children but ended in failure. Despite all the trappings of retired wealth, Ann is unable to escape the spectre of her advancing disease. Unlike Arnie wanting Frank to visit his former wrecked home, Ms. Pines in the second story, wants to visit Frank’s present home that has been saved from the storm, to remind herself of growing up as a black woman (the term Negro is used by the first-person narrator, Frank, and I wondered whether this is to reveal his innate racism) in a white neighbourhood in the ‘60’s. In the final story, Frank visits the dying Eddie, a former friend and a brilliant inventor who is preaching the message that “you can’t take it with you when you go,” and who in his dying breath gives Frank clues to the failure of his marriage to Ann.As a narrator, Frank has to dissect and philosophize every observation and incident, which creates an unnecessary drag to the book, even though his observations are wise, insightful and cutting. Some quotes stick with me: “Love is a series of small acts,” “ Writing a novel - the last outpost for the doomed optimist” and “Most memoirists don’t have much to say, although they work hard at turning that fact into a vocation.” And yet there is too much of this book going on in Frank’s (or Ford’s) head and chronological details are repeated in each story that are unnecessary unless one is reading each story with long breaks in-between. This was my first Frank Bascombe book, and I liked him.

Now, I have read his book of philosophical sketches, Pleasures and Days, but I figured that I must dive into at least one of the volumes of his mega-work In Search of Lost Time to shake off the dreaded moniker of “unread”, and so this was my attempt, with Book Two of his seven-volume masterpiece. The introduction by James Grieve flashes all sorts of warnings to a reader who comes from a background of appreciating basic novel craft: show don’t tell, consistent POV, consistent voice, consistent tense, tight plotting, tight dialogue, larger than life characters etc. etc. And Proust breaks all these norms. Perhaps this is a masterpiece because it dares to be different and, in its day, broke existing conventions to create a new inflection point in the evolution of novel: the personal story, to which modern day adherents like Burroughs, Miller and Knausgaard have returned to discover surprising fame and notoriety. Perhaps our desire to eavesdrop on real lives, as we are drawn to through social media and selfie culture, has led to a renaissance in the autobiographical novel.And yet, is this a novel or a collection of sharply recollected memories, opinions and gossip about early 20th century French society? Is Proust’s claim to fame his ability to stick his weakening body inside a cork room and remember his life in excruciating detail as a dilettante of the Paris salons where he observed the shallow and inconsequential lives of his strata of society? The only movement in this book is in his head and around the areas frequented by his family: Paris and the seaside town of Balbec. He probes deep into remembered conversations, visits to the theatre, dinners with visiting dignitaries, walks with friends at the seaside, and puppy love with a girlfriend - hardly the stuff of great conflict that give birth to great novels. And yet, this is a masterpiece, and who are we mere mortals to refute that? The fact that Proust had to fund the publication of Volume 1 of this collection shows that even in his day he must have had trouble convincing publishers of its literary value.Needless to say, I left this book around page 75, unable to continue further without straining. I will continue to remain “unread,” rather than take on the onerous task of reading this masterpiece.

The aristocratic men David and Nicholas are self-indulgent, narcissistic bullies, while their women are weak, alcoholic and drug dependent. The knight is Victor, a philosopher, who along with his American journalist lover Anne are the most grounded, and are placed as contrasts to the wasted and sad aristocrats and their ladies. In between this mix is five-year old Patrick, in whose honour this series is written, but who never rises in the book above being raped by his father David - a scene of terrifying quality especially when presented from a confused 5-year olds’ perspective .The omniscient narrator cuts across all the characters at will and ignores the conventions of the novel by shifting points of view continuously, leaning on the narrative side, making this a very “told” story.David is by far the most well drawn. He has failed at everything due to ill health as a child, leading to a weakened condition and insomnia as an adult; he has flunked out of Balliol, music, medical school and the army. Yet he terrifies his wife, the alcoholic Eleanor, by getting her to go down on her knees and eat the fallen figs from the ground without using her hands, and by pulling up young Patrick by his ears. And yet Nicholas worships David for his connections, and Victor too relies on him for introductions to the “club.” That St. Aubyn is taking his revenge on this class of high society for his own damaged childhood is clear. You feel revulsion for the adults and sympathy for the child. David and Nicholas’s quotes sum each other up: “Those who are cruel to the ones closest to them possess a vitality that makes others dull by comparison,” “ Nothing that happens to you as a child really matters,” and the classic class distinction, “Shooting men and animals is the occupation of a gentleman, tending their wounds is the business of middle-class quacks.” And their women refrain from contradicting them because it is deemed “boring” to interfere while aristocrats exercise their unkindness. And it is this unkindness that forces Victor and Anne to leave and have sex instead of being stuck with such boors at dinner. Eleanor and Nicholas’s girlfriend Bridget cannot leave even if they want to, the power of despots is too powerful a magnet for these weak women. Alas, Patrick has no escape with such wasted parents.That this book ends after the pivotal dinner scene led me to believe that all five parts would make for a more satisfying novel; perhaps if they had been edited for verbosity and combined into a single tome, the Patrick Melrose saga might have more impact. That said, I think I will read more of Patrick Melrose, but after a long break from this one - the subject matter is quite pathetic to digest. I’m sure the Queen would not be pleased with the behaviour of certain members of her royal court. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13514899-never-mind

This path leads to a fatal attraction to a blind preacher, Asa, and his bastard, highly sexed daughter, Sabbath, and a tag-along youngster named Enoch who has a passion for peeping at sun tanning women.The author’s obsession with religion is conveyed by it’s frightening hold on the characters, for it governs their every action and reaction. These characters are driven: Hazel by his unbelief, Sabbath by her need to possess, and Enoch by his blood, the Wise Blood of the title. Their motivations are less clear, except for Sabbath’s, for she has her sights set on having Hazel, any which way he will be had, including asking him whether his church has a place for bastards, because the regular church does not. And this motivational ambiguity poses interesting puzzles for the reader. Why is Hazel obsessed with Asa who is a charlatan himself? What does the shrunken man in the museum signify? Why is Enoch obsessed with the Gorilla impersonator, enough to become one himself? Why do characters like the policeman who throws Hazel’s car off a cliff, and Hazel himself who atones with a splashing of quicklime, have to behave in such extreme fashion? What is the role that Wise Blood plays in this novel? That the writer was still honing her craft comes out in several ways: too much time is spent on the smallest detail, some scenes are disproportionately longer than required, there is very little movement in the narrative, and key characters like Mrs. Flood appear only in the last chapter. The author’s understanding of human and sexual relations also seem to be lacking and therefore the characters appear caricaturist in their behaviour.I would call this novel a gothic religious novel for O’Connor paints a gloomy, guilt-infested picture of humanity where sin and retribution are inevitable, and where salvation only comes through death....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2016","Jul 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48467.Wise_Blood

I realizI had to use a guide on how to read this novel in order to figure it out, and even then, I abandoned it after 300 pages, for I’d had my fill. I realized, that if I had to labour through every line, skip pages when I was getting nowhere, go back frequently to pick up lost cues, underline passages where the plot re-emerges after multiple digressions within digressions, try and figure out who was speaking, where we were location-wise, and navigate a myriad of other mutations of craft, I needed a break. If this is one of the greatest post-modern novels written, as the blurbs say, then I am retreating into historical fiction. But then, as this novel was written about WWII in 1973, the author was writing post-modernist historical fiction - there IS no escape, just like the V2 attacks covered in this novel! In a nutshell, an American named Slothrop is working at a secret Allied research facility tasked with neutralizing the German V2 rocket bombs, and is mapping his sexual conquests all over England. The points on his map eerily coincide with where the bombs are falling. As the V2 rocket, by design, explodes before there is any sound, scientists, statisticians and clairvoyants are convinced that Slothop holds the key to the puzzle. In the process we are introduced to about 400 characters on both sides of the English Channel, to scenes that weave in and out of each other, some that connect later in the book and other that do not, to conspiracy theories, copious amounts of sex including scenes of urophilia and coprophilia, ribald poetry and songs that mean nothing, love that struggles amidst the rubble, introductions to rocket bomb technology and Pavlovian theory, psychometry, spiritism, lots of masturbation including invisible ink that can only be read after it has been coated with sperm...need I go on? There is something to be said about verbal and intellectual versatility, which this book is full of, but to throw everything and the kitchen sink that existed at the time, to portray a whole society spooked by the bomb and behaving irrationally, into a novel that runs 750 pages, is a bit over-ambitious. What’s the point? My reading guide suggested that the novel’s main theme is megalomaniacal paranoia, and that comes through very clearly in the unhinged behaviour of many of the characters, particularly Slothrop. Not knowing whether your number is going to be called up with the next exploding rocket can lead to some let’s-live-life-to-the-most-extreme-now behaviour, on both sides, for the Germans are not exempt: often rockets misfire and kill their owners, and that’s why the German rocket bay commander is having sexual orgies with men and women alike. My guide further explained that the title Gravity’s Rainbow was supposed to portray the arc of a V2 rocket from launch to explosion, and in a literary parallel it was supposed to portray the arc of this novel. I didn’t find a novelistic arc, instead I found scattershot events, just like the random points on Slothrop’s map. Perhaps that is what the author intended, to be random and to addle our minds, just as the V2 did back in 1944.Pynchon is obviously an acquired taste, which I have still to acquire....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 12, 2016","Jul 12, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/415.Gravity_s_Rainbow

These are mysAs the opening line suggests, this is a story about women, four generations of them, and their migratory journey from Ireland to Canada. These are mystical women, in touch with the spiritual world, whose men appear in mirages, out of the water or while converting their sorrows into dance. Water is another key player in the novel, whether it be the sea surrounding Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland or the lakes of Ontario, for water circumscribes worlds, separating them from others that are “away.” The concept of “away” is the hardest to wrap our heads around in this novel for it connotes a multiplicity of meanings: possessed, foreign, non-believer, immigrant, emigrant, revolutionary, the other side, the other person. The line of women in this book are “away” while their men are practical, grounded, hard working, hard done-by by the ruling elites, betrayed or deserted by their women.The plot pivots around two key events in history: the potato famine in Ireland circa 1845-46 and the assassination of D’Arcy McGee in 1868. The fourth-generation woman, Esther, herself now an octogenarian, is recalling the family story from the confines of the family home in Colborne, Ontario; a story of grinding poverty in Ireland leading to forced migration to Canada, to a hard scrabble existence on the Canadian Shield, to the bounty of gold discovery, to the building of wealth, and to its decay due to the march of nature and progress. After a shaky start, where we don’t quite know what is happening, we connect with great-grandmother Mary on Rathlin Island, the first person in the line of women who is “away,” and who sees her dream man, a dying sailor, emerge from the sea, the result of a shipwreck that is never called out but referred to as “a sea of floating cabbages and bottles of whiskey.” The potato famine drives her, her schoolmaster husband Brian, and their young family to Canada. But Mary abandons the family to go to another lake in the interior and spend out the rest of her life there, for she believes this is what her spirit guide, the dead sailor, had predicted for her. Daughter Eileen is another “away” person, spending her time in a tree and talking to birds who are her guides. Her brother Liam is the practical one who pulls the family out of the Canadian Shield and builds his fortune in farming down by Lake Ontario, thanks to guilt money paid by his father’s former British landlord in Ireland; Liam even transports the Seaman’s Inn (the first white building he sees upon arriving in Canada that he feels destined to live in) from Port Hope to Colborne by floating it down the lake to make it the family residence. Eileen then meets her dream man, Aidan, who dances into her life and whisks her away into a plot to kill Darcy McGee. At this point the novel hinges on whether the narrow nationalism of the impoverished Irish or the liberal federalism of a nascent Canada will win out, and with its conclusion the author stakes her position, making this book a Canada Reads contender. Some of the characters are wonderfully drawn—Mary and Eileen in particular, Brian, Liam and Aidan, the eccentric British landlords the Sedgwick brothers—while others are hard to get a fix on: Esther, for instance. The plot is a bit contrived: inserting Eileen and Aidan into D’Arcy McGee’s murder could have been done better, I thought, and the inclusion of Esther’s mother (the third in the line of four women) who has no part in the story other then the mention of her name (which I have forgotten) is one only to fill in the time gap. Autobiographical references to family-owned hotels either swallowed by sand or struck by lightning are not elaborated on—they became the stuff of later Urquhart novels. That this is an early novel by the author is obvious in the dialogue and the melodramatic foreshadowing. And yet, the writing is lyrical and a pleasure to read, the descriptions original: “the smell of celibacy was like mildewed oilskin, milk going sour by the sink.” The wealth of Canadian and Irish lore in this story interested me, especially as I am a resident of Northumberland County in which Port Hope and Colborne are located. I looked up the gold rush in Madoc, the flood in Griffintown (brilliantly described), and I found reference to a Seaman’s Inn in Port Hope that had been subsequently named Canada House in the mid-nineteenth century and run by a retired sea captain. And I walked out in my garden, sniffing, glad there weren’t as many skunks anymore- I’ll thank progress for that!I have read stronger novels written by Urquhart, her later ones, but I can appreciate how this book propelled her out of the ranks of the many and into the hallowed circle of the chosen few....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2016","Jul 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/383690.Away

The stories are therefore inconclusive snapshots of situations taking place across a spectrum of South African society over the recent past. In “Spoils,” the typical goings-on in a hedonistic private game reserve are revealed; the relationship that the black guide shares with the lion is not understood by the white guests - i.e. “share, don’t kill.” In “What Were You Dreaming,” we are introduced to the fact that young black girls (and boys) have their front teeth extracted so that they can “service” their male clients better. In “Keeping Fit,” a white jogger strays across the road into a black township and enters a barbaric world that has always existed on his doorstep. The stories “Father Leaves Home” and “Once Upon a Time” are autobiographical; the former told in fragmentary memory, the latter is like a children’s bed-time story, horrific though it is.I have always preferred Gordimer’s short stories to her novels. Her acuity, brevity, and cold-blooded delivery are evident in the short story. Having visited post-Apartheid South Africa, these stories had particular resonance to me.

Forster, a creature of empire who was also the victim of its restrictive class, racial and morality norms. Forster’s homosexuality was known among his inner circle but never to his wider audience of readers until his posthumous novel Maurice was released. Therefore, all his sexual activity (or most often, inactivity) had to be kept under cloak and dagger. During this period, there were three men in his life: Hugh Owen Meredith (Hom) in England, Masood in India, and Mohammed in Egypt. Hom is a fellow Kingsman from Cambridge who engages in minor sexual activity with Forster (kissing, cuddling and rolling on the carpet) before moving onto the respectability of marriage, family and social standing, leaving his “dark chapter” behind. Masood is a brash intellectual whom Forster tutored in England and meets again in India, a lover who becomes a lawyer and who also pursues marriage to further his career. Mohammed is a poor tram conductor in Alexandria and, by far, the only one to truly reciprocate Forster’s feelings (though not always his actions), but he too must inevitably succumb to marriage, leaving Forster forlorn.Forster, in 1912, was coming off the success of his acclaimed fourth novel Howard’s End, a book that laid bare the ills of the sterile British class system and signalled the setting of the sun on the Empire, despite Winston Churchill’s claim to the contrary. Howard’s End had been praised by critics but disliked by his domineering mother, Lily, for exposing the vanity of the British middle class; the novel gave Forster the opportunity to quit his day job and take up the life of a full-time writer and make the journey to India, a pilgrimage that every honest British Empire-man was expected to take during his lifetime. He reconnects with Masood in India, but sees the man slipping away from him. Forster is tortured by the heat, and the lust that it ignites in him, a lust that has no outlet except in his imagination. His excursion to the Barabar Caves gives him the impetus for the novel A Passage to India, but he abandons writing it for he does not know how to conclude the outcome of the cave scene—he is missing the “big event.” During this visit, he experiences the two solitudes of culture that exist between the British in India and the locals: reserve vs. demonstrativeness, brevity vs. expansionism, punctuality vs. tardiness, logic vs. superstition, thinking vs. feeling, class vs. caste. The first Indian segment in the novel reads like a travelogue with huge chunks of narrative and with pauses only for Forster to observe the stark differences between this exotic land and his native England. There is no love lost between the rulers and the ruled, and his fellow countrymen in India do not see the value of books, for they place more importance on guns and sports. Forster returns from India, confused and inconclusive in his love life and in his writing.India however gives him the impetus to write Maurice, a no-holds barred exposé on the lives of “solitaries” and “minorites” and their supposedly deviant sexuality that was still deemed illegal—Oscar Wilde had been sent to prison for his flagrancy within living memory. Maurice would remain a secret and unpublished until Forster passed away. WWII intervenes, Forster enlists to do his bit and is sent to Egypt. In Alexandria, the celebrated author, who had so far only had sex in his imagination, is crudely introduced to the physical act by an injured soldier, at the ripe old age of 37. After this deflowering, Forster lets fly and wants to catch up for lost time. He befriends Mohammed, an impoverished tram conductor. Mohammed understands Forster’s physical needs but cannot go all the way with him, just like the latter’s previous lovers. Mohammed is also a consumptive and destined for a short life. Forster cares for Mohammed during his illness, gets him a better-paying job, and leaves Egypt at the end of the war, still unfulfilled and adrift. All that comes out of his Egyptian episode is a non-fiction book titled Alexandria: a History and a Guide that was published years later by his friend Leonard Woolf via Hogarth Press. Back in London, Forster is convinced that he must return to India to finish his Indian novel that has now languished for several years. He finds it hard to open forgotten chapters, revisit old ground, but Woolf insists that he persevere until he finds his inspiration again. Forster returns to India and gets a job as a private secretary to a maharajah in a dysfunctional state kept alive by the Raj (“Nawabs and Maharajahs are bred by the inter-marriage of your empire and our silliness,” says Masood). By this time Masood and he have drifted apart, and Foster’s lust is now at fever-pitch. The Maharajah comes to the rescue and procures him a male concubine and the privacy for Forster to indulge in his hitherto imagined and thwarted desires. The episode with the concubine awakens Forster to the knowledge that physical carnality with an obliging servant is not what he desires; he needs the sexual and emotional love of a Hom, a Masood or a Mohammed, something he has only experienced in small, infrequent doses. This conflict also provides him with the ending of what should really happen, or seem to happen, inside the Barabar Caves between the British woman, Adela Questad, and the Indian, Doctor Aziz.For all the fanfare that greeted A Passage to India, the novel was riddled with inaccuracies that would be unforgivable today: the court case would not have been heard in a provincial court, the six-spot beetle was non-poisonous, dog-carts and lieutenant governors were anachronistic, and so on. But the inconclusive ending is a metaphor for India when viewed through the foreigner’s eyes: India is a mystery, similar to what happened back in that infamous cave.Repressed sex permeates the novel and Forster comes across as a tortured soul born at the wrong time in history for his sexuality, but at the right time for lifting the veil on the ailing British Empire. And in writing Arctic Summer, the title of Forster’s own unfinished novel, Damon Galgut has put closure to the life of the great writer who had the modesty to say that he was “not really a writer” despite the immense success he enjoyed throughout his literary career. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 14, 2016","Jun 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18807424-arctic-summer

No one knows who wrote this particular saga, but it is often credited to a 13th century scholar, Snorri Sturlusson, who was murdered by the King of Norway for failing to bring the Icelandic fiefdoms under Norwegian rule. And I wasn’t disappointed in my pick, for this story is better than the wildest spaghetti western. Egil is a brave, homicidal maniac; he drinks alcohol at the age of three, kills a kid who beat him at sport at age seven, is moody and vengeful, dangerous and unpredictable, is a poet who laments the death of his son with heartrending verse, and who calls is as it is even in the face of the king. An antique anti-hero!Norway, from which Egil’s ancestors descended, was a loose agglomeration of fiefdoms until King Harald forcibly brought them all under his control. The king in this land of the Vikings is the chief gangster, for he rules by “might is right” fiat. Circling him are bands of independent farmers and sycophantic followers who succumb to his tithes and taxes. The king travels the land, attending feasts hosted by his loyal subjects, keeping his eyes and ears peeled for those who are getting too big for their britches, dolling out favours to his cronies and exacting penalties from those who don’t play ball. And those who fall foul of the king are forced to flee to distant, unexplored lands like Greenland and Iceland, and even to the eastern shores of Canada (called Vineland at the time). Egil’s family never hits it off with Harald, who confiscates their lands. The family moves to Iceland, an uninhabited island recently settled by Norwegians and their Celtic slaves, where Egil is born. Young Egil, seeking adventure, becomes a Viking marauder and has a profitable life of raiding and robbing along the English and Norwegian coasts, earning the loyalty of the English king but further enraging the Norwegian one. What follows is a series of adventures and misadventures of Egil as he builds and stores his wealth in Iceland and has many skirmishes with Harald and successor, Eirik, in his bid to regain the forsaken family lands in Norway.The Viking code of honour is simple:a) Plundering and raiding is the order of business, even extending to the land, for Iceland is soon denuded of its sparse vegetation by the Vikings for the stoking of their fires and the making of their longboats.b) Honour is important, so is vengeancec) Women have no say in their lives. Brides are traded by fathers to prospective grooms for a price. Widows end up back in marriage to their dead husbands’ brothers.d) Inheritances follow the masculine side of the family line, unless no male heirs are left.e) A host farmer can never have more armed men than the king at a feast given in the latter’s honourf) Blood money is often provided as compensation to someone killed in a duel or a battleg) Intermediaries (we call them lobbyists today) are entrusted to present one’s case to the king whose mood is often unpredictable. The narrative style of the saga is Biblical and feelings are shown by behaviour, sometimes calculating, sometimes illogical. Paragraphs end hilariously : “Nothing else of note happened that night.” or “Eyvind was a great warrior.” Vikings used the patronymic naming convention and circled around a limited number of names, therefore it is hard to keep track of names such as Grim or Bjorn or Thorolf, for they recur in each generation of the same family. The mix of prose and poetry is another interesting feature, the latter is used often to reveal character, provide back story or set the scene. Reading the many exploits of Egil, including his final foray to aid his son, I could see the evolution of the wild western novel in this saga.And like a Wild West saga which wraps up all the loose ends, punishes the bad guys, and rewards the good guys, our homicidal hero, Egil, decides to bequeath his ill gotten gains to society in a most unusual manner, not unlike his father Skallagrim before him. You gotta like this guy, flawed though he is. I wonder whether the saga was trying to depict, in the bi-polar nature of Egil, the extremes of the land and times of the Vikings: a land of fire and ice, and a people in whom “survival of the fittest” was the driving creed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 03, 2016","Jun 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/331089.Egil_s_Saga

ThisI didn’t realize that a 500plus-page tome written within the confines of a farm in an unforgiving land could hold my attention, but this one did. This novel vies for the Icelandic equivalent of One Hundred Years of Solitude.Bjartur of Summerhouses gains his freedom after 18 years of servitude to buy a farm that bears the curse of Kollumkilli: no one is supposed to prosper here. But Bjartur is an independent man, an Icelandic John Wayne. He is a bit extremist: he values sheep and dogs more than women and cows. He lives in a shabby croft house where his two wives perish along with endless stillborn children. He refuses charity from anyone, runs his household like a dictator and turns his back on anyone who crosses him, even his surviving children. “Housekeepers do as they please, housewives do as they are told,” is his assessment of women, which wouldn’t endear him to the modern-day reader. The novel weaves around this quest for independence by the Icelandic farmer (Bjartur and his ilk) as he is faced with the vagaries of history, climate and human folly.The villain of the piece is the land itself - walk out in a snow-storm at your peril - rendered in poetic prose by an author who has a deep understanding of his country. Laxness understands the seasons and their impact on the land, he understands farmers and their daily pre-occupations of grass, worms and trade; their stimulants: tobacco and lots and lots of coffee. Frequently, children are born out of wedlock, but the families shrug the unfortunate incident off and continue with life. Funerals are times to have a party and meet far flung friends. Superstition rules daily life. And people are always wet, whether inside or outside their dwellings. The country is portrayed at a time when the merchant class that exploited farmers is giving way to co-operatives owned by the latter. But one form of exploitation gives way to another. WWI is a boom to the Icelandic farmer who sees his price for wool escalate; the war’s end is therefore the now-leveraged farmer’s nemesis, for heavily in debt after the purchases of new houses, cars and other luxuries, he sees the price for wool plummet, and with that, his fortunes. “The essence of being a poor peasant is the inability to avail oneself of the gifts that politicians offer or promise and to be left at the mercy of ideals that only make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” True of early 20th century Iceland, true today, and true universally throughout history.When education is introduces to the illiterate farm children, new vistas open up and the small croft house becomes a place to escape from. “The lands out there,” spoken of formerly in mythology, become real. A paltry $200 would induce a farm boy to give up everything he holds dear at home and head off to the new land of many bigger farms: America. The novel is also the story of the stormy and tangled relationship between Bjartur and his adopted daughter, Asta Sollilja, both stubborn, enduring, and thereby destined to hide behind their pride. Their relationship borders on the incestuous in the little croft house where privacy is non-existent, compounded by Bjartur’s awareness that she is not his real daughter but the product of his first wife and her former lover who went on to become a very powerful man in the new political milieu. The narrative style is omniscient with the author often intruding to comment. At other times the narrative is hijacked by a character for awhile and then interrupted by others’ comments that are injected in parentheses. Certain key characters, like the roguish teacher sent to teach the children in the croft house, second son Gvendor’s rich girlfriend, and the Banker politician, don’t even have names. This is a dense book with a unique style, but enjoyable if one is into reading for the pleasure of language; the humour is covert, the tragedy overt.I realized that the farmers, the independent people, were no more independent at the end of the book than at the beginning when they lived in servitude under the merchants. There was always someone who sat above them calling the shots: parish bailiff, political leader, co-operative organization, Kollumkilli, WWI, nature. Even Bjartur, at the height of his independence, was at the mercy of his flock of sheep, the health of his wives, the well-being of his children and the fortunes of the people he traded with. Independence is an idea, not a state of being.

I found his appraisals of other writers to be a bit one-sided; of course, no one can write as good as Rushdie, they seemed to say. But I found some interesting titbits to add to my authors’ trivia collection: Garcia Maquez had 15000 copies of his book Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor burned in Valparaiso; Raymond Carver beat alcohol only to succumb to cigarettes; Proust and Kafka did not travel widely, yet had the breadth and depth of imagination to roam the gamut of human experience like world-weary travellers; Gunther Grass was the artist of uncertainty, having to migrate from Nazism to post-war Germany; Naipaul was superficial in his analysis of the resurgence of Islam in his book Among the Believers. Among the political observations, I saw a strident call for the recognition and abolishing of racism in Britain that seemed to be at a high during that decade: “the Empire has been brought back to England where the pukka sahibs can continue to lord it over the locals (immigrants, this time around); the cult of individualism in the USA has generated more Oswalds than Lincolns; politics works on linear time while religion works on messianic time (i.e. past, present and future are integrated and circular) and therefore the two need to be separate; Pakistan is a failed state built on an insufficiently imagined idea.”As for the novel and literature: the novel must be an idiosyncratic view of the world, not a representational one (I think readers need to be educated on this one too!); the novel has no rules, it must be transgressive and subversive; the market economy reduces books to products; literature is the least likely to be externally controlled (unlike cinema) because it is created in private by a single person; the colonial writer has infused the English language with a multitude of thoughts, rhythms, words and phrases, enriching what was previously tightly circumscribed. And writers’ conferences are the same no matter the calibre of writers assembled, where everyone drinks a lot, talks a lot, roams about the new locale with a critical eye, and “fertilizes” other writers - whatever that means!The final section is Rushdie’s defence of The Satanic Verses. He goes onto explain the book and the meaning behind his imagery and symbols, asserting that it is a book of dissent not of abuse and insult. And yet, magic realism being what it is, imagery can be confusing and open to misinterpretation, and a writer having to explain his creation is self-defeating. When dealing with subjects such as religion, fanatics do not have the depth to plumb the “why” of the writer, they only see the “what” that is on the page, and Rushdie paid dearly with the fatwa declared upon him for this serious miscalculation. Reading this book I was reminded of blogging that came into being long afterwards. If Rushdie was unknowingly experimenting with a form of blogging in the 80’s, then this book is testament to that effort....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2016","Apr 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/537762.Imaginary_Homelands

Through a series of short chapters (some only as long as a paragraph), we discover the following: - Martin is a mentally disturbed pervert who feels up women, flashes and masturbates on the public transportation system.- His mother dominates his life, but she chooses to live away from him in Ireland while he works as a security guard in London.- He sublets an upstairs room in his apartment to a musician called Baldy Conscience who appears to actually live inside Martin’s head.- He likes to hold his bladder until it cramps.

I tried to figure out why. The humour is consistent and incisive, and it helps curb the horror of Martin’s actions - punching a woman’s pubic bone? Gimme a break! The many voices telling this story (Martin’s, his imagined characters', his mother's, those of people on the subway system) mirror the voices in his head and makes the reader end up as confused as this poor bloke. The vignettes of days in the life of Martin, while revealing information bytes on his condition, become episodic and repetitive. Maybe the novel's experimental nature, it’s inconclusiveness, and its “up your arse” humour qualified it for the Giller. Perhaps...The strong message in this novel (is it a novel?) is about the inadequacy of the British health system to care for the mentally ill - “you can’t keep them in and you can’t keep them out.” Perhaps it’s true of the Canadian health system too. And when faced with being late for a train vs. helping a sick person in need, commuters choose to catch their train and swear at everything that’s making them late - an indictment of our speeded up, materialistic society. Like all experimental novels, the ending left me where I had started: confused. I was also dissatisfied, for we had built up to what could have been an interesting finale at Euston Station. If the author’s intention was merely to bring us into Martin’s world and leave us lost inside it, she has succeeded brilliantly.

And this tale of entrapment, obsession and betrayal is indeed a tortuous“Bad Girl meets Good Boy” usually ends with disastrous consequences for both. And this tale of entrapment, obsession and betrayal is indeed a tortuous one for both parties.Ricardo is the good boy from the affluent Miraflores neigbourhood of Lima who meets Lily, the “Chilean girl”, who has just arrived in Peru. He is fifteen and she thirteen. He is immediately smitten by her fragile but aloof beauty. He dreams about living his life in Paris, while she wants to be an airline stewardess or travel agent and travel the world. When her true identity is discovered, Lily abruptly vanishes from Miraflores. She then surfaces at different periods of Ricardo’s life, always in a different place, Paris, London, Tokyo, and Madrid, married to a different man each time, always moving up the social and economic ladder, and in each encounter she loves and leaves Ricardo, making him desire her all the more, but impoverishing his life with every departure. Bad Girl continues her rise until she herself becomes the slave of the perverted lover Fukuda who damages her soul and body through his various sexual deviances. The tail end of the book shows us the ascendance of the Good Boy to take care of the Bad Girl who is on her downward spiral. Despite Ricardo’s relationship with the younger artist Marcella, who is the diametrical opposite of Lily and only has his interests at heart, it is Lily who turns his crank and is his obsession despite all the punishment she inflicts upon him. Ricardo and Lily are indeed soul-mates.The book is carved into long chapters, each set in a different locale, each beginning and ending with a Ricardo-Lily encounter that in turn ends. There is also separate and distinct character (s) who appears in each chapter around whom Ricardo and Lily weave their dance: we have Fat Paul the revolutionary in Paris, Juan Baretto the artist in London, Arquimedes the water diviner in Peru and Marcella the set designer in Madrid, among others, who give shape to Ricardo’s rather dull character. Throughout the 40 + year span of the novel, we get snippets of the political situation in Peru - always going downhill despite whichever regime takes over the reins, giving credence to Lily’s desire to flee the country by any means. The relationship between Ricardo and Lily is based on sex, for they do not appear to do much more when they are together. She openly ridicules him, lives off him, robs him, marries him, runs away from him, leaving him chasing after her like a lap dog after each disastrous encounter. It is only when the Bad Girl is in her decline stage that she develops the humanity to acknowledge her soul mate and to provide for him, redeeming herself with him and with the reader.Vargas Llosa who is notorious for his experimental prose has written a fairly straight narrative here, making it easier reading, and I was able to stay in the story. And yet Ricardo and Lily are not very nice characters and display the worst in humanity: selfishness, greed, cruelty, servility, obsession, self-destruction. Lily’s response to her erratic behaviour is that, “By doing these things, I live more intensely.” True, for she flames out with more stories to tell than Ricardo who only has a dull old age in Paris—a place he cannot call home despite having acquired French citizenship—to look forward to. And yet, the couple’s redemption a shallow victory when one considers what the two of them could have achieved had they been working as a team from the beginning. Perhaps this is a cautionary tale that suggests when we pick our life mates, there is no foretelling whether we are picking them for the better or for the worse. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 31, 2016","Mar 31, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/615208.The_Bad_Girl

That’s how I thought of summarizing this book set in Sweden and South Africa.I have been repeatedly urged to read Mankell by many crime novel aficionados due to his pre-occupation with global themes and issues that go beyond the crime genre. After watching the very satisfying Wallander tele-drama series, where the focus was purely on the insomniac policeman who defies protocol, and after a recent visit to South Africa, I finally picked up this novel, but was left wanting.First of all, Wallander is reduced to a bit-player in a global plot to murder Nelson Mandela; secondly, there are two different novels here, one taking place in Sweden and the other in South Africa, both lacking in substance and seemingly bound together to provide more robustness to the novel as a whole, but still falling short; thirdly, the clunky writing style, with many POVs, all of them quite similar and none producing any character delineation other than through “telling” on the part of the author; and fourth, the multiplicity of plot and character inconsistencies and contrivances that suggest the author was working to accomplish a daily output of words, with only a broad outline in hand, and was grabbing at devices and chunks of exposition at random to get through his quota on schedule. And the metaphor of the white lioness simply does not work. Die-hard Wallander and Mankell fans may disagree with me, but there were many times when I thought of laying this novel down, but I kept going, for I was curious to see how things would pan out. On the credit side, in the Swedish story, Wallander, as the very human cop doing a terrible job— bothered by his aging and his relationships with his father, daughter and an absentee girlfriend, suffering from his neuroses, melting down when he kills someone, playing Lone Ranger—makes for an engaging character. I wondered why the Swedish police force would tolerate such behaviour? On the South African side, the evil Apartheid system is laid bare at the pivotal point when regime and system change is about to occur, creating conditions for ruthless retaliation. But the author’s popping into the heads of real-life people like Botha, de Klerk and Mandela comes as a bit of a stretch. And the stitching of the two narratives, although mirroring Mankell’s dual life lived in Africa and Sweden, does not make them hang well together either.I’m told that The White Lioness has been televised in Season 4 of the series, which I haven’t watched yet, and with Kenneth Branagh once again playing our drowsy cop.

In the earlier novel there was no mistaking Canada and Montreal as the setting but this novel is set a during a carnival period in an anonymous city that has a mountain within it. Montreal again? The protagonist, Fly, (a relative of cockroach?) is a taxi driver who roams the city picking up and dropping off undesirables, lost souls, and clowns.The novel is episodic although some elements tie together in the end. Fly is an intellectual, orphaned and raised in a circus in Europe before immigrating to North America. He lives alone in an apartment overflowing with books, and masturbates frequently to visions of the most elaborate fantasy lands and situations, described in the most lyrical prose. He is interested in a Muslim woman, Zainab, who lives in his building but she is a lesbian, unknown to him. He cares for people, despite their squalor, and is a kind of a messiah to the lonely. His mentor is Otto, a radical hippie, who is out to avenge himself on the “1%.”Fly’s taxi rides paint a picture of society in the most technicolored yet unflattering prose. A description of the regular destination of the city’s taxi drivers, the Club Balayou, runs like this: “the women dancing on the tables are middle-aged, nicely round and voluptuous, from the country, and the men who are scooping up the nectar that falls from above are African jackals, desert Arabs, stomping gypsies and seasoned Latinos.” Philosophic thoughts are also casually tossed off as in, “Muslims and Communists are not the enemy - food consumption is.” In addition, we meet sadomasochistic writers, transgendered singers, drug smugglers, damaged teenagers, perverts and serial killers. And the endless carnival of the city is a metaphor for the masks that everyone wears, the false veneer that hides our desperation.As in the previous novel, this book too ends as a crime thriller when a series of murders take place: taxi drivers are being bumped off at random, and corporate leaders are also being popped off with no rational connection. Not all the murders are solved but we are shown the grievous danger we open ourselves to when the marginalized are pushed beyond their limits, and when they strike back.As for Fly, he is left to grieve, bury the dead, and carry on. Fortunately, our masturbatory hero has the power of imagination that he can escape into, something that lesser mortals are not blessed with and who end up succumbing to the neuroses that these marginalized conditions create. Perhaps a subtle hint to the fact that people of the imagination, aka writers, are able to withstand the squalor of life and convert it to art. Kafka reborn, I thought ,as recollections of Metamorphosis and The Trial surged through me.

To provide his daughter her bearings he makes miniatures of the city they live in. He also interests her in Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, a metaphor for the principal characters trapped in their surreal world of war with death looming through a window. When the Germans overrun Paris, Marie-Laure and her father escape to live with great-uncle Etienne in the sea-side town of Saint Malo, one of the last bastions in France that was to be liberated by the allies many years later. Her father makes her another miniature, of Saint Malo, but inside this one is hidden an art treasure with a tragic past that people are willing to kill for. Uncle Etienne is a war-damaged recluse who hides out in his house, like Capt Nemo in his submarine, and broadcasts music and philosophy that is appreciated far and wide. Werner is the German orphan, one of those who as a child had listened to the faraway broadcasts of Uncle Etienne and loved them, who has an aptitude for radio telephony, and who is recruited by the Wermacht to intercept insurgent radio broadcasts so that enemy positions can be eliminated. It is a foregone conclusion that Werner and Marie-Laure will meet on opposite sides of a radio wave, the old fashioned version of our Internet.The novel is split into two story lines: one leading from 1934 when our protagonists are children and culminating just before Saint Malo is bombed by the allies; the second commencing from the bombing and moving forward with an interlude in 1974 and an epilogue in the 21st century. Both story lines alternate with short chapters narrated in the POVs of Marie-Laure and Werner, with an odd interjectory chapter or two by a wily German Sergeant-Major Von Rumpel who is on the hunt for what is hidden inside the miniature city model. Marie-Laure’s chapters are brilliantly captured with sounds, smells, activities and touch being the means for her to describe her world, while Werner is able to see and show us the moral decay of the Reich about him where the best and the brightest are being raised to devour the weak.My one negative experience with this beautifully written novel is that it is too long, at over 500 pages. Sometimes we were plodding in the same place for too long. The story lines also blur when one gets to pivotal year, 1944, and we don’t know what elements are in play in each segment. However, the minutiae of life lived during this period is painstakingly captured and I can imagine that much research and imagination must have gone into it. As for the hidden art treasure, one really doesn’t know what happens to it, for the fog of war descends to cloud the memories of our story tellers. Perhaps, it’s left deceptively out there for a sequel?A great novel if you want to experience the last days of WWII from the inside and appreciate the things we take for granted today: food, hygiene, love, movement, entertainment. all of which were rationed drastically in those dark days ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2016","Feb 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see

In Candide we go on a whirlwind tour from France to Portugal to Peru to Venice to England, and I may have forgotten a few places in between. The action is packed into every sentence (Voltaire was known as a man of action), so there is no way you can skip a page, for if you do you may miss out on how Candide’s benefactor is drowned, his mentor hanged, his sweetheart’s family murdered, Candide himself flogged a hundred times (twice), and the world destroyed in an earthquake, leaving our hero to travel the world to find his El Dorado. And don’t worry, these are not spoilers, for everyone who leaves the story, believed to be dead, returns to recount their experiences about how they did not die!The premise is that “everything happens for a reason” as espoused by Candide’s mentor Pangloss. Optimism is the operative word. Therefore nothing is bad even though it may seem that way. And yet, with all the disasters that Candide experiences, he is constantly left questioning his now-dead mentor’s philosophy. And there are bright moments too, for when Candide does find his land of gold, Peru, where the locals do not value their precious metal but use it only for ornamentation, he becomes fabulously wealthy. But he then finds that unscrupulous people are out to steal his wealth. Optimism?I found the peculiarities of novel-craft of the 1750’s to be intriguing: past tense and present tense interweave, the story is episodic, every chapter begins with a lengthy title that summarizes what is going to happen in it, and ends with a hook to the next chapter. Voltaire fictionalizes the people he wants to cast his barbs at, for his own safety. And he took pot shots at some high profile people. Therefore, the French are the Abarians (a Scythian tribe) and Frederick the Great of Prussia is the King of the Bulgarians; but while he admits that “English writers are the most liberated for they have no Church to constrain them,” he openly writes about the killing of an Admiral by the British for losing a battle. The violence and brutality of the age is painted in short, toss-away sentences: women rent into four parts by pirates after having their orifices poked for smuggled diamonds, the “caponizing” of men to render them eunuchs, slaves sold from owner to owner before they completely lose their identity. And yet people cling to life no matter how miserable they are. Optimism?Along the peregrinations of Candide and his band of “now you see me, now you don’t” followers, Voltaire discusses philosophy, politics and literature through his characters: “Man is born to live in the convulsions of anxiety or the lethargy of boredom.” His remedy, and the moral of the novel: “Hard work is the final solution - it prevents all of the above.” Critics accused Voltaire of being a socialist for his views. But when Candide and his followers finally end up cultivating their garden and living in a socialized harmony, I breathed a sigh of relief for having come to the end of this exhausting tour with Voltaire. Finding one’s little haven away from the madness of the world seems the best solution, even today. And for a deeper understanding of this work, I wished there had been a study guide connecting the fantastical incidents described in this book to the events in history that Voltaire was obviously referencing with his satirical pen (or would it have been a quill?).And it will be quite some time before I pick up another of his books for I still have to get over this one! ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Feb 13, 2016","Feb 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19380.Candide

A bright student, he graduated from medical school but never practised, as he gave himself to writing. Success was hard-earned for many of his early novels, stories and plays were rejected until Lady Frederick launched him into the theatre limelight where he was to bask in, earn most of his fortune, and write over 30 plays during an equal amount of years. The novels and stories were to follow, culled from his life and from his travels in the South Pacific, the Orient, South America and the Caribbean.Maugham recognized his bi-sexuality from his teen years—he was more homo than hetero— but given the “illegality” of the former at the time, he had to live a duplicitous life. Unlike his more restricted peer, E.M. Forster, Maugham indulged his sexuality, often skirting the edges of danger to his reputation. It was fashionable then for men to marry women for respectability and then indulge their sexuality with men and boys. And Maugham being from the professional class, these transgressions were deemed socially acceptable behaviour, especially within the arts world, though legally they were not.He served in both world wars even though he was too old for active duty even in WWI. In the first war he was a spy couriering information between field operatives and HQ; in the second conflagration, and a world-famous author and playwright by then, he was used as an “influencer” to get America to join the war. Despite his mounting fame, wealth and lavish lifestyle on the Riviera, in London and Hollywood, Maugham’s private life was barren and tense, for the people he was nearest to let him down. His marriage to Syrie, a union he entered into because he had to do “the right thing” by her, was loveless and ended in acrimony, leading to a bitter divorce and alimony for nearly 30 years. Syrie, a London socialite, went onto develop her own design career by leveraging Maugham’s fame. His long relationship with Gerald Hexton, a drunken playboy, ended in many embarrassing situations before Hexton succumbed to alcoholic excess in his early fifties. Other personal assistants like Alan Searle and Robin Maugham (his nephew), who were both homosexual, ended up costing Maugham money and his reputation. And his only daughter, Liza, ended up launching a lawsuit against him over her inheritance.He was a reserved man—some say caused by his stammer—who observed more than talked, who had rigid habits (he wrote daily from 9 a.m. to 12noon, which was also his greatest refuge from people), he disliked the Hollywood and the theatre societies although he had to associate and profit from them, he was reluctant to proposition his many male sexual conquests and had Hexton do his dirty work. He was also a lucky man, for success begat success. His short story “Rain,” for instance, earned him over a million dollars in royalties when it was converted into a play, three movies, a musical and a ballet.And yet the literary establishment shunned him, as he was deemed a popular writer, catering to low-brow tastes, “the best of the second-rate” as he was known. And Maugham too exploited the zeitgeist, focussing his plays on relationships between husbands and wives, and his stories and novels on characters and situations that had been relayed to him by others, or observed by him first-hand during his travels. You never told Maugham the story of your life, for you would soon appear in one of his books. And he gets full marks for being prolific: he could churn out a three-act play in four weeks.As age and memory loss advanced, his minders Alan and Robin forced him to write an autobiography that proved his undoing. Looking Back would have been better dubbed “Look Back in Anger” for Maugham broke the English Gentleman’s code by venting his anger on his ex-wife and on all those who had hurt him. His fans deserted him and members of his club failed to acknowledge him when he put in an appearance. Alan Searle profited from the royalties. Maugham died at the age of 91, demented, angry and violent—a sad end to a gifted man. This biography is a gripping read, for the narrative flows swiftly. This is a book about a literary life and not about the literary process of a famous writer. Many literary personalities of the last century make cameo appearances, among them: Noel Coward, Graham Greene, Nelson Doubleday, the Woolfs, Hugh Walpole, Edith Wharton, Henry James, D.H.

That politics is money is unquestioned in this novel. That politics is business is also boldly stated. And with the events in this tale taking place in the early 1960’s when, for those of us who were raised in a more idealistic time and were led to believe in statesmanship and leadership (Kennedy, Gandhi, Churchill et al), and in altruistic nation-building in a post-WWII era, this book comes as a bit of a shake-up and a wake-up call.The novel is based on true events. The real-life protagonists, Dayanand Bandodkar, a miner, and Jack de Sequeira, a merchant, formed two political parties, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak (MG) and United Goans (UG) respectively, in the aftermath of the liberation of Goa in December 1961 from Portuguese dictator Salazar by the Indian military. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised Goa that it was free to shape its destiny within India. The MG party contested the elections for ruling the new territory on two pledges: to merge Goa with neighbouring Maharashtra, as most Goans spoke the Marathi language native to the larger state, and to return Goan lands back to the tillers. The UG, on the other hand, stood for a separate state for Goa within India, with Konkani as the official language, and with land remaining in the hands of the existing landholders, many of whom were UG and MG candidates vying to be elected. The MG ultimately won the election, but were unsuccessful in merging Goa with Maharashtra as an opinion poll (more a referendum) held within the tiny territory overwhelmingly called for a separate status.Within this frame of history, Antao spins his tale. Bandodkar is named Fondekar and de Sequeira is named Gaspar. Both men launch their political parties and campaigns with the complete understanding that only money will buy success. They are blatant in their offerings of “help” to likely supporters, and are equally bullish in obtaining “deposits” by businesspeople who are eyeing lucrative development contracts in Goa when the right political parties come to power. Their two assistants, Euseb (Gaspar’s) and Vishnu (Fondekar’s), are wily characters. Euseb wears dark glasses even at night, and when he takes them off it’s an occasion. Vishnu is particularly adept at sussing out potential supporters for his boss’s cause. The play of idealistic master and street-smart servant reminds me of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and here we have them in double-form, lending verisimilitude to this picaresque tale. The third party in this battle is India’s ruling party, Congress, led by a rather ineffectual and indecisive local leader, Shankar, who cannot make a decision unless it’s sanctioned by HQ in Delhi. Instead of votes, all Shankar is able to collect is money from those same scouting businesspeople who are hedging their bets with every political party in the race. When the result is declared, with the MG obtaining 14 seats to the UG’s 12 and the other two seats going to independent candidates, the bribing game notches up into higher gear to secure a majority, or to prevent one. The MG prevails, and Fondekar is proclaimed Chief Minister with Gaspar as the Leader of the Opposition. But the new regime lands in hot water no sooner it introduces the land reform bill, for many landholders are among the ruling party, and “exceptions” have to be made in case members defect and break up the MG’s slim majority. What follows is a travesty of the legislative process as all sorts of back-room dealings go on, with Vishnu and Euseb in full flight to help their masters. Meanwhile, UG members walk out of the legislature until the flawed bill is withdrawn. The MG caves in and re-introduces a watered-down and more equitable-looking piece of legislation, but makes its “exceptions” in the implementation of the new bill.Land reform ends in failure, for the tillers who now have acquired this new-found wealth cannot be bothered to work anymore and become landlords themselves and rent their land to a fresh crop of tillers, of which India seems to have an endless supply. Moral of this bill: money corrupts, irrespective of political stripe or social class.At the end of the novel, which is by no means the end of the ongoing saga of Goan politics, the two rivals stand in a 1-1 tie, for the opinion poll—also fuelled with lots of money to swing voters and further infused with patriotism for Goa remaining Goan—ends in a win for Gaspar. The authorial narrator finally casts judgement on the two politicians and on the continuing legacy of politics in Goa, one destined to be fuelled by money, graft and nepotism.I have read all of Antao’s novels and stories, many written about Goa, but unlike the others which have more flesh-and-blood types, the characters in this novel exude only money and politics, hence the title, I suppose. We do not get any glimpse into the factors that made them who they are or what drives them in such a devious fashion. It is almost taken for granted as a fact of life: if you want to get into Indian politics, leave your conscience at home, bring a fat cheque book (better make that cash) to oil the wheels of influence and a huge money-box to collect your deposits. After all, “Politics is Business,” says Euseb, and “Politics is the last refuge of the scoundrel,” adds Fondekar. While this book may not earn the author any fans from among the Indian political establishment, we suspect that he is writing from personal experience, for there is a reporter named Tony in the novel who is constantly in the face of all the political leaders, whose resume could well have been that of a younger Ben Antao’s.This novel adds to the growing body of Goan literature in English to which the author has contributed. The style is colonial, Shakespearean in places, reflective of Antao’s education and his passion for the Bard (he has even published sonnets that rival William’s), the dialogue is infused with humour, the manners of the protagonists are businesslike (opening statements of a meeting run like “So, what can I do for you?” or “Arrey, how much money do you want?”), and scenes of Goa are vividly drawn, with the Mandovi River constantly weaving in and out of the narrative, reminding us that life is a river and that these human political games are but trivialities that will wash away one day. And yet, Fondekar and Gaspar go at it like there is no tomorrow, perhaps fueled by that other Shakespearean line, “There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, lead on to fortune; omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries.”This is an insightful novel, tempered with humour to make it palatable, for those wanting an inside look into Indian politics, told by someone who once had a grandstand view, and who is not afraid to “call a spade a spade.” The question left to us who live in this world is a frightening one. If tiny and beautiful Goa, that chafed under a colonial yoke for centuries and fought for its freedom over many decades, ended up a political cesspool, then what hope is there for Arab Springs and other political movements of today that are agitating for freedom and self-rule from their dictators?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2016","Jan 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26185655-money-and-politics

Perhaps the author needed the freedom of fiction to roam and to delve into the lives of the principal characters, and to take a literary view a rather clinical subject - PTSD, or formerly called shell shock.Rivers is the psychiatrist who practices a kinder approach to restoring shell-shocked soldiers of WWI to health, so that they could return to the front and get further shell-shocked or killed. He is suffering from the transference from his patients; he stammers, has an irregular heartbeat and other symptoms of war neurosis. His patients are worse: Burns vomits, Willard believes he is paralysed despite a diagnosis to the contrary, Prior has asthma and amnesia, Anderson has nightmares, Jenkins crawls through the fields of England looking for body parts of his mangled colleagues, Fothersgill speaks like a Theosophist, and Sassoon sees ghosts and fosters rebellion in the ranks by writing his infamous Declaration: an anti-war document, indicting old men for sending young men to war for personal gain. The story centres in the Craiglockhart War Hospital where Rivers visits each of his charges in turn and tries to unlock their blocks. The novel is therefore heavy on dialogue and lacks movement, except when an inmate leave the facility to visit a friend, play golf, or merely escape from the loony bin for awhile, for no one is compelled to stay but none can return to the theatre of war or be discharged unless the Board of senior military officers says so.These are also men without women in their lives, except for Prior who befriends a working class woman working in a munitions factory. Male comradeship and love is enhanced by shared experiences in trenches, and yet homosexuality is strictly punished. Sex for men at this time seems a privilege, an occasional feast that only Prior seeks, while the others are more wrapped up in their neuroses.The conversations between patients, psychiatrists, military, and between peers within each of these groups unearth some interesting observations about these times:a) Treading on dead bodies in trenches releases gas.b) Fear leads to indifference and then leads back to fear.c) Gentlemanly behaviour is tied to guilt. Gentlemen don’t dessert their comrades - they go back to the killing fields after recovering from their wounds.d) Electrocution was an effective but painful cure for shell shock during WWI.e) The war threw rich and working class men together for the first time opening the door, for post-secondary education to be available for all when peace returned.f) Mutism springs from wanting to speak and being held back due to the disastrous consequences that could result. Only soldiers suffered mutism. Officers didn’t suffer from mutism, they stammered instead.g) Men broke down due to the passivity of the trenches. h) Regeneration comes with great pain.The horrors of war are brought out indirectly, the deaths described are horrific (no one dies of a simple gunshot), and it is hard to come away without feeling empty from the waste generated by the Great War and its successor twenty years later. Two generations ended up being cheated of what we take from granted today, and they didn’t even know it. Rivers ultimately wins the battles for his patient’s minds but is left with the bittersweet taste of a life wasted, one that in a future era may have achieved greater things for humanity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2016","Jan 12, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5872.Regeneration

The book reminded me strongly of Graham Galgut’s novel is a powerful portrait of a post-Apartheid South Africa stumbling towards an uncertain future. The book reminded me strongly of Graham Greene’s novel, “The Quiet American,” where idealism perishes under the pressure of harsh reality.Lawrence is the idealistic, white, young, “good doctor” who has come to a remote medical outpost situated in a former Bantustan, a facility short on supplies, medical personnel and patients. He believes in duty above all else, in telling the truth, fixing the old, and innovation. His opposite, and the narrator, is Frank, another white but jaded doctor, hiding from reality, wanting the old world to stay as it is while his own is falling apart. While Lawrence recognized his calling from an early age, Frank drifted into his and comes from a family fiercely defending its hard work and acquired wealth in a land where they have now conceded political power to their former servants. Their boss is Dr. Ngema who says she “supports change and innovation” but does nothing to improve conditions, and is holding out for a promotion that never comes. The black staff are portrayed as inefficient and dishonest but proud of their shortcomings. The only time the blacks and whites come together is at a drunken party where alcohol loosens inhibitions; the following morning they have retreated to their corners again. The hospital is a microcosm of the new country with each player representing its constituent parts.Into this mix arrives a former Brigadier who was planted in the homeland by the Apartheid leadership, then deposed by the post-Apartheid regime. The Brigadier is fermenting revolt within the country with the aid of political interests outside South Africa, and some of the black hospital workers are in cahoots with him. Also arriving is Lawrence’s girlfriend, a volunteer worker, Zanelle. Lawrence’s disinterest in Zanelle is obvious from the arms-length relationship he has with her before and after her arrival. He leaves Frank to show her around, Frank who is freely sleeping with every woman who crosses his path, black, white or hispanic, probably to take revenge on his estranged wife who cheated on him and destroyed his marriage.Despite this being a post-Apartheid period, we get strong visuals of the segregation that still exists: Lawrence has to share a room with Frank, and not with Tehogo who is black; the black maid has to pick up fallen petals on the floor on the command of Frank’s father, and Frank has to conceal his affair with the black village woman, Maria.The uneasy peace of the hospital is shattered when Tehogo is discovered stealing hospital property (probably with the nod of Dr. Ngema) and Lawrence is determined to expose him. Lawrence also proposes taking the hospital to the people in the way of a mobile clinic and this represents further change and innovation. Frank finds himself despising the Good Doctor for changing his world. But change is inevitable, and everything and everyone is in its wake by the time the novel concludes.The moral of the story: not everyone has bought into the new South African dream, blacks and whites alike. The result is an inconclusive and fluid situation. And yet, after many years, Dr. Nagema does get her promotion, and by extension, Frank, his. Perhaps Galgut is trying to suggest that good changes are slow to come, and they come through a series of interim missteps, but if we keep the faith, they will come. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2015","Dec 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/111464.The_Good_Doctor

But then I paused and let the record stand by following one of Coetzee’s maxims: let the book stand on its own merit, the writer does not have to explain it or his motivation for writing it.This is a rather large but a very engrossing biography that I read from end to end, and annotated at length, of a colonial writer who came to writing by accident (he wanted to be a mathematician), shunned publicity although it followed him relentlessly, and won every award in the global literary hierarchy. Coetzee is revealed as a recluse, rather cold and distant, whose personal life is marred by tragedy: his son killed mysteriously, his daughter reduced to a vegetated state due to multiple illnesses, his first wife dead prematurely of cancer, his father an alcoholic. Growing up during Apartheid, he tried to flee his country twice, once to England and once to the US, but ended back in the mother country to write his best books that culminated in the Nobel Prize, before finally, making it to Australia in his early 60’s where all he could produce were books in which he was the principle character, books that did not have the dramatic heft of his South African period and were thinly veiled philosophical musings parading as novels.Unlike other more militant South African writers of the period such as Nadine Godimer, Coetzee walked a fine line when exposing the underbelly of Apartheid, using allegory and parable to hint at what was wrong with his homeland. His work was experimental, often autobiographical, and he was criticized for dabbling in such fictional musings like Foe (a rehash of the Robinson Crusoe tale) that had no obvious bearing on his country’s ills at the time. It was only when Waiting for the Barbarians was published that the parallels between his fictive universe and South Africa came out. And when Disgrace was published in 2001, he pulled out all the stops and levelled his critical lens on the new South Africa, post-Apartheid, that was still dealing with a myriad of issues from the transition of power. Disgrace earned him the Nobel but also created the conditions to push him out of South Africa to find a new home, a less hostile one, more accommodating, although more sterile in subject matter, and he found it in Adelaide, Australia.For all his reclusiveness, Coetzee was nurtured in academia where his literary efforts were recognized and promoted. He worked as a professor of literature at the University of Cape Town for 30 years and was a guest lecturer at the University of Chicago for several years following his retirement from active academia. He purposely pushed his work overseas, wanting always to be recognized as an international writer, not just a South African one, and he managed his career scrupulously, conserving his energy to devote it where his efforts had maximum impact, often declining lectures, appearances and interviews that would drain him. He was not afraid to object on principle, to comment on the compositions of each book’s cover and to argue contracts with publishers and agents, and even with the government. His early work was constantly embargoed by the South African censors when it was published overseas and shipped home. But as his fame increased and his asset value as a bankable international South African brand flourished, the censors backed off.In his Australian phase, novels like Elizabeth Costello (a female alter ego of the writer), Slow Man, Diary of a Bad Year and Summertime, all feature protagonists who resemble Coetzee, some even bearing his name. The books are heavily didactic with the author’s views on the world being openly broadcast within thin plot lines that continue to faintly identify themselves as novels. Having read them all, I was less than enamoured with these later works, as have the critics, feeling that the power left Coetzee after he left that crucible of literary material, his native South Africa.There are lots more that can be said about this biography, but suffice to say that it is a good primer on the evolution of a serious writer, dubbed as the greatest living one today. It’s also ironic that the Afrikaans biographer JC Kannemeyer died before the book was published, while Coetzee who has portrayed himself dead in some of his books, like Summertime, still rides on to write new allegorical tales like The Childhood of Jesus, which, upon reading this biography, strikes me as another thinly-veiled post-Apartheid tale. The only question in my mind is, has Coetzee now elevated himself to the status of Jesus?...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2015","Dec 15, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16170185-j-m-coetzee

The city is divided into sectEveryone is spying on everyone else in this post WWII espionage novel set in Berlin during its infamous airlift in 1949. The city is divided into sectors (British, French, Soviet and US) and resides in the Soviet Zone of the country. The currency of value is intelligence, as the city tries to drag itself out of the rubble that still litters its streets.The novel therefore is a great primer on the immediate post-war climate in Germany: the legacy of the Nazis, the returning exiles trying to regain lost ground, often at the expense of sacrificing their principles, the jostling foreign powers who play cat and mouse with their agents just for a bit of information that will advance their position in the nascent Cold War, the fear borne by the survivors when re-visiting places that hold bad memories for them, and all the while, the drone of planes bringing in supplies to keep this city alive so that the Allies can stare the Soviets down.The protagonist, Alex, is a returning German Jewish writer, who had been imprisoned by the Nazis and had bought his way to freedom through influential Gentiles to escape to the USA. But America is no refuge as he is accused of being a Communist by the McCarthyists. He separates from his wife and son and can only be cleared of suspicion in the USA if he first goes back to Berlin to spy for the CIA. What he finally uncovers is that everyone else is also spying for at least two masters in his old home town. The single double-agent model made popular in classic John Le Carré and Len Deighton novels is upended by a multiplicity of double agents running around just to keep the reader guessing. This scenario is a great chess board to play point counter point, but it is in the telling that the novel fails to live up to its promise. Alex comes across as a know-it-all, ruthless, spymaster who pre-empts all the moves and even tells his runners what they should do, turning the tables on them as fluidly as James Bond. The dialogue is hard to navigate, and here I think the author was trying to emulate the spoken German language literally translated into English, only to leave it fragmented and clumsy. Some plot points are blatantly contrived: when Alex is about to be identified by a key witness to a shooting, a woman from the past suddenly appears at the security office to distract everybody; it reminds me of Raymond Chandler’s advise on writing: “When in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun.”On the other hand, some characters and situations are well drawn: Irene, Alex’s insecure lover, throwing herself at any man for protection after being raped by the invading Russians when Berlin fell; the callous treatment of women as mistresses by the ruling Russians in Berlin, who often call them whores to their faces in public; the tenuous relationship between the German security agent Marcus and his mother - she being taken to the camps by the Russians for “correctional treatment” and he being taken at a young age for indoctrination into Communism.  Bertolt Brecht, one of the returning emigres, a real life character, plays a significant role in the novel, and the staging of his play “Mother Courage” in Berlin is a pivotal event. He is the one person above the fray and agnostic to the competing spy organizations, and he likens East Germany to a church: defend the Communist faith, root out Capitalist sin and carry out purges like the Inquisition. When asked why he chose to return, he replies promptly: “The Socialists promote culture more than the Capitalists.”I think the author set out to paint a realistic picture of Berlin, but the circumlocutory dialogue let him down....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2015","Dec 03, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21943244-leaving-berlin

And watch out for the lower classes copulating against walls in public view, masters who impregnated their servants at will, lecherous old men at every street corner; a young woman guarded her purse and her virtue when she walked about the city. Upper class men went to the theatre to “get in the mood” for their wives or lovers, and women dressed as men in order to gain unfettered access to entertainment.Against this backdrop, we encounter the sensuous Elizabeth who desires men despite her Puritan family. Bound to a life of service, she escapes to London to work for a relative and meets young Shakespeare, himself a struggling playwright and actor who is working away from his family. They fall in love, Elizabeth gets pregnant, and the moment Will finds out, he cries foul, reveals that he is already married, and dumps her. Elizabeth returns to the provinces to have her baby, Aerlene, and succumbs to cancer and a broken heart. Fifteen years later, Aerlene picks up the trail and heads down to London to track down her now famous father. Elizabeth and Aerlene’s stories and their encounters in London follow parallel paths. Aerlene however has the not-so-good fortune of meeting a not-so-honest boyfriend, Scarfe, who works in a bookshop and leads her to Shakespeare. Scarfe by far is the most interesting character in the book, although his appearance is brief: an alcoholic, brooding, lying, thieving, swaggering survivor, with good intentions towards Aerlene. Scarf’s blind and crippled father is testament to the reward a writer in that day received after toiling for years in Scriveners Hall straining his eyes and wrist to churn out endless handwritten script.The impending encounter between Aerlene and her famous father is the device the author uses to pull the reader along an otherwise gentle story with not too many deep conflicts. And when it happens, the author is obliged to respect the Bard’s immense literary reputation and portray him as a good man, accepting of his youthful misdeeds but not admitting to any wrongdoing. The meeting left me resolved as far as the story went, but underwhelmed in terms of impact.I found the real villain of the piece to be Elizabethan England: taking a breather between wars, open to pestilence, with foul weather, a rigid class structure, no birth control, and no antibiotics.Wright has done an excellent job in capturing this period in all its facets and in exercising his imagination to render a real life literary giant as a normal, if not a self-absorbed man, warts and all! ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 24, 2015","Nov 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8584832-mr-shakespeare-s-bastard

She is determined to build a new life outside of the madness of war. Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu are embodied in Ada’s nephew Leopold and his follower the Armenian Aram who suddenly turn up at Ada’s homestead on their world travels. Ada’s seventeen-year-old daughter Edith falls in love with both, is impregnated by one, and follows them along with her infant son Jim, to London first and then to Armenia just as WWII breaks out. Although the novel is essentially Edith’s story, we see a teenage Jim getting bitten with the curse upon his return to Australia and heading off to join his aging uncle Leopold on the next stage of the Gilgamesh-like chronicle that haunts this family.The book skirts the edges of contrivance and plausibility, with some extraneous plot detail thrown in. How likely is a 17 year-old to survive with an infant on a cargo ship populated by pedophiles among its crew? How opportune for the textile merchant Hegop to board the Orient Express, just as Edith is running out of options, and offer her a way out, and similarly, how convenient for Leopold to be at the border to receive her when she is again heading into an unknown future. And what was all the espionage about, hinted at but not playing any role (just like Mr. Five Percent) in the story? And the unreliability of the mail service, a device that couldn’t be used today with e-mail and texting, is used extensively to get letters lost and have others arrive many months later, pre-empting actions that lead to dramatic situations.The writing is spare and much time and many events are covered in an economy of words; this keeps you reading even though the book has a slow start. And yet there are some strong character portrayals: Hegop’s wife, Nevart the crippled singer who expresses the jealousy of the marginalized towards the ones enjoying good health; Jim’s emerging alienation in the land of his birth due to the colour of his skin; Edith’s diminished status as a fallen woman; Leopold’s destiny to always travel alone. There are strong portrayals of the land too: the barrenness of Western Australia, the relative dullness of England and the foreign-ness of Armenia. The only character left undeveloped is Aram who never utters a word in the narrative - perhaps this is deliberate, to account for his lack of English. Even Jim, who is raised mainly in Armenia until he is 8 years old, develops his speaking voice in the narrative only after his return to Australia.

The denizens of this unhappy time and place are broken down into those who fall prey to the Depression and those who ride it and escape. Ken Tilling, a proxy for the author himself, is one who lives by his own rules, rebelling against bosses, grabbing odd jobs, stealing, riding the rails all over North America to find work, a man no better or worse off from when we are introduced to him to when we leave him, but a survivor nonetheless. His love, Myrla, is the one with higher aspirations, who has them dashed by older men she pursues for money, and who ends up a prostitute. There is the bookish Theodor, who becomes a fascist (Hitler was popular at the time) and escapes his ghetto by joining powerful capitalist friends, and marrying rich. And there is Ken’s mother Mabel who sinks into alcoholism, McIsaac the defiant thief, and Billy Addington trapped in a chocolate factory, all who succumb to the grind of the collapsing economy; the Depression creeps in like a fog, and very soon there is no light at the end of any tunnel. Winners and Losers, Cabbagetown produces them all.The prejudices of this society are comical. Cabbagetowners considered foreigners dirty, when in fact they were the dirt-poor English, Scottish and Irish who lived on welfare and were considered the dirtiest of all! And despite being jobless for months on end, they have the temerity to smoke and gamble on their welfare money, and cheat by not reporting income when they get the odd casual, temporary job. Anti-Semitism was rife in the Toronto of the 1930’s because the Jews (the earliest “foreigners”) controlled many business enterprises by this time. Words like “sheeney” and “kike” are bandied around along with other vernacular words such as “scissorbills,” “mossbacks,” “hunkies,” and “dogans.”With the absence of the Don Valley Parkway that now severs Cabbagetown from Broadview, the large park and pedestrian bridge across the Don River that bound these two neighbourhoods become the hangouts for the jobless, the lovers, and the voyeurs with dogs (called Spotters). There is even a scene in the now defunct Don Jail on the top of the hill, but it was so perfunctory, that I wondered whether the author had ever been inside.I was enjoying this brooding, slow paced but intense human drama until Ken decides that he needs to up and leave to fight in the Spanish Civil War, partly to escape the misery of Cabbagetown and partly to fight against Capitalism and all its ills that had brought such misery to his community. The Communist Party sponsors disenfranchised recruits like him from all over the world and sends them to Spain to enlist with the left-leaning Republicans against Franco’s fascist Nationalists. I guess this digression was needed to record the author’s own escape to Spain to fight in this war, but it left me conflicted for we know how that war ended: Franco won and ruled Spain for another 36 years, so Ken, for all his bravado, ended up on the wrong side of history and no better off than Mabel and his buddies McIsaac and Billy. He probably just died with his boots on - but we never find out, for this section is a rushed addition to the novel, an open-ended afterthought. This conclusion, that a war of rebellion is the only solution to the Depression (well, WWII certainly proved that) and that political causes such as Communism sponsor recruits to sacrifice their lives, is eerily reminiscent today as ISIS recruits candidates from all over the world to go to the Middle East to fight for its cause. In the last 100 years we don’t seem to have grown much! Somehow I wished Garner had stayed true to the Cabbagetowners prejudice and not strayed to foreign parts in this novel, and instead found whatever redemption there was to be had at home....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 15, 2015","Oct 15, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1026156.Cabbagetown

And yet there are signs of disillusionment creeping in, a response to this endless socializing; covert acts of rebellion take place, like escaping with a fellow fashionista girl-friend en-route to a show, in the middle of traffic, to head off to a grungy bar and hang out with a couple of dead-beats. There is one true love of her life, it appears, Buddy, a childhood friend and neighbour, who is locked away in a TB sanatorium, but who wants to marry her when he is released. Buddy seems to embody the part of life that is out of reach for her, for deep down she also suffers a lack of self-esteem. Other than for Buddy, and a string of casual boyfriends, Esther lives a lonely life after losing her father to diabetes at the age of nine, and she is living with her hard-working mother who has been thrown back into the workforce of the ‘50’s in order to keep the home fires burning.Esther is ambivalent about life: she doesn’t want to be married, she doesn’t want to have children after witnessing a childbirth, and she doesn’t want to live in the city or the country. She feels that she is living inside a bell jar, similar to one encasing the dead baby she sees in a laboratory. When the depression and suicidal tendencies start, they come on suddenly, and we are shown the WHAT and the HOW, but never the WHY. Is it the rejection from the writing course that triggers the downward spiral? Is it the thought of going to college after the high-life in New York City ends, is it because she is still a virgin, or is it something more chemical that manifests itself in the brain of young people at a certain age? It leaves the reader guessing. We see her visiting graveyards, prisons and nunneries, enquiring how to get “inside” these places. We see Esther trying desperately and ineptly attempting suicide: she tries to hang herself and cannot find a beam in her house to string the rope, she tries to drown herself but doesn’t sink, she tries to slit her wrists but only ends up in cutting her thigh. One wonders whether another side of her is fighting for survival and foiling these attempts at self-destruction. She finally overdoses on sleeping pills and hides in a concealed niche in her mother’s basement, but is discovered before the lights go out completely. What then follows is an episodic series of mental home scenes: time shifts flipping forward and back, shock therapy (sometimes poorly administered), interviews with psychiatrists, and the discovery that her former rival (for Buddy), Joan, is also an inmate. And the fight for Buddy (or life) continues inside the asylum too, which seems to help in Esther’s healing. The book concludes on a pregnant note with no resolution to Esther’s mental condition, except perhaps for the hint of a possibility of a permanent release from the asylum for her to pursue her academic studies. And as we know, this book took on a higher degree of gravitas when years later, the author herself, having perfected her art of self-destruction through many failed attempts, finally succeeded, by sticking her head into the gas oven in her kitchen. One can’t but help but feel deflated upon reading this well crafted and incisive novel, because the voice of the author is so alive, humorous and wise. And yet, the inevitability of her impending doom screams from the pages....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Oct 06, 2015","Oct 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6514.The_Bell_Jar

Being Catholic, divorce is an ugly word, and severely frowned upon by his parents. Yet Michael has fallen for a much younger Canadian woman and is about to decamp with her for London. On the eve of him telling his wife that he is leaving her, their home is invaded by the IRA. Michael is ordered to drive a bomb in his car back to his hotel the following morning. His choice is clear: kill many people at the hotel, including some prominent Protestant agitators, and save Moira from being killed by their captors, or vice versa.The plot moves through the quotidian activities of going to work, returning home, moving about the claustrophobic city of Belfast with its myriad military checkpoints and “watchers”, and all the while this activity is infused by a sense of menace, that something will go wrong, something will end. Dialogue is also very conversational, mirroring normal life, and yet we know that nothing in this place is normal.By placing his characters in this crucible of doom, Moore explores key themes: the moral choices made under stress, the artist who gives up his vocation to earn a paycheque, the pervasiveness of religion in Irish society, falling in love only for superficial beauty, needy love that skirts physical danger, and the lies of silence. The “lies” are what this community has been living with, for the IRA and its Protestant counterpart, the UDA, have lost credibility with the local populace and are seen as thugs and bullies, no longer advocating on their behalf. And yet, no one is prepared to take on the IRA for fear of being harmed.The events with the bombing force Michael, and Moira, into making another moral choice: to confront the lies and strike back, each in their own way, each to the other’s detriment. And the last half of the book moves towards the outcome of that decision.I was left wondering that if cell phones were ubiquitous then as they are today, much of the plot of this novel would have had to be re-worked, and even the outcome may have been different. And whether in Michael Dillon’s day those who looked terrorism in the eye had much of a chance for global media attention as the Malala Yousafzai’s of today have? Moore’s conclusion also points to why he gave up on his native country, adopted Canadian citizenship, and lived abroad for the rest of his life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Sep 24, 2015","Sep 24, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/277847.Lies_of_Silence

And yet while the butler was the right choice, I’m not sure the clone is.The book is termed science fiction but that element is only hinted at, and is finally revealed around page 81. Prior to that we have a children’s story of growing up at a private boarding school, Hailsham, with all the frivolities, jealousies and antics of a cloistered school life - a rather boring tale. But these children have no parents, are not sřupposed to bear children as adults, are encouraged to leave a legacy of art, are hinted at about only having adult careers as “carers” and “donors,” and ultimately “completing” their lives after three or four donations. Their teachers are a cold-hearted bunch, nursing some secret that occasionally bursts out, suggesting that all is not well here.As the teenagers graduate from Hailsham to a freer facility called the Cottages, they are able to take unsupervised visits to the outer world and observe real people, those who will benefit from the teens’ donations. They are then signed up to be carers to other donors and finally become donors themselves. As they mature, their bodily appetites flourish, like with normal humans, and sex becomes just another compulsive activity with no emotion attached to it. Those who fall in love are rumored to be able to obtain a “deferral” from their donations for a short period, for that emotion, coupled with the art they have produced as children, prove that clones have souls. The novel therefore focuses around three characters, Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, and the feelings they develop for each other, proving the theory of the soul. But how can you halt progress when much of humankind’s illnesses have been cured through cloning?This is all very well, a premise that has been tackled several times in several different stories: the monster becoming human but being destroyed by greater society - from Beauty & the Beast, to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, to King Kong et al - each in their different way. But it is in the telling of the story that the writer either scores or fails. And I feel that Ishiguro, though capturing the voice of narrator Kathy very well, also boxed himself into living with her limitations. There is a lot of unnecessary kids-speak to wade through, the obvious foreshadowing at the end of every chapter to get us to turn the next page is blatant and nauseating, and the lack of human warmth that permeates the novel leaves you flat. Some reason to all this emptiness is captured at the end when old Miss Emily, former headmistress of Hailsham, reveals all, but I found myself straining to get to that point. I continued reading because I had faith in the author to get us home, and he does, in a painfully slow way. This book left me pondering the following question: if it was not for Ishiguro’s reputation, would the manuscript have made it past the slush pile to the editor’s desk? Given that publishers now want their premise clear by Page 5, would they have had the patience to hang in until Page 81 if it was someone of lesser stature? To his credit, Ishiguro has the courage to set his own pace and reveal things when he is ready to, and he does not appear to be pressured by the anxiety of a profit-seeking publishing executive. Oh, to have that level of freedom today! It wouldn’t be unlike Kathy and Tommy dreaming of a “deferral.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2015","Sep 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go

While this narrative device is inventive and probes deep into the patient’s character, it takes until page 83 to set up the premise and prove it.

He spends his “invisible time” invading the homes of ordinary citizens and spying on their activities. Like a writer who has intimate knowledge of his characters, he observes his “subjects” at their most vulnerable moments, especially when they are alone, to form and replay his judgements on society to his shrink. And the scary thing is that all of his subjects seem to be living empty lives themselves: the jogger, Valerie, who binge-exercises and binge-eats to keep her external and internal lives in balance; the philosophic band of musicians that discuss heavy subjects, eat mushrooms and drink schooners of beer; the young man, Bruce, who takes days to compose an e-mail to a girlfriend, watches endless You Tube videos, reads s on Goodreads, posts comments on political blogs and ‘likes’ on Facebook, watches entire series on Netflix, posts s on Amazon, and masturbates routinely and unemotionally—“like taking out the trash,” comments Y___.Occasionally Y___ runs into a problem, or into one of his subjects, like the time when one guy being “observed” goes crazy and starts shooting up his apartment, yelling, “Come on out, I know you’re there!” Therefore Y___ is extra vigilant even when crossing the road in traffic, even at a cross walk!Things get more complicated when Y___ steps out of his incognito role and tries to help his subjects—people die! This further fuels his isolation from his fellow man, even when he has the most intimate grandstand view into their lives. The therapy sessions take a turn for the worse when a romantic attraction develops between therapist and patient. We are also told at this point that Victoria is having some marital troubles with her much older and highly opinionated black husband, John. Therapist and patient begin to meet outside the consulting room, emotions are let loose, and the sparks fly, with some unpleasant consequences for everyone.Y___’s invisible peregrinations raise some interesting questions:a) Are we all Valeries and Bruces in one way or another?b) Do we have an innate curiosity to spy on our fellow beings? c) If granted the power of invisibility, would we take advantage of it? d) Are Social Media and the Selfie already benign manifestations of this Peeping-Tom curiosity?e) Does the gap that exists between who we are and who we want to be the cause of human dissatisfaction and the resulting “life unlived?”f) Does this statement hold true: “Society works best when everyone plays within their allotted box.

The curator of the manuscript, one Anthony Meredith, is able to add footnotes to explain historical details that have occurred between then and now (circa 2600AD) without taking away from the pace of the main story line. Anthony also gives us glimpses of his world of BOM where there are no more strikes, no quarrels, no cream or butter (what do they eat?), no pedlars, no thievery, no poor housing, no bankruptcies, no corporate lawyers, and no insurance - a veritable utopia after years of struggle by the proletariat.Despite the enormous wealth that Jack London garnered in his short life as a writer, he was an avowed socialist, and this novel, written towards the end of his life, is his manifesto, and it reads like one, for the book is full of speeches (Ernest is a stand-in for Jack) and the narrative creates a horrifying picture of a dystopia without telling a story as a novel should. Political ideologies are bandied about blatantly. The premise is simply that the Oligarchy is slowly gaining ascendance in the early 1900’s (isn’t that true of today as well?) at the expense of the free market, and is amassing surpluses while the proletariat is getting poorer. By using its vast financial resources, the Oligarchy divides and conquers by funding professionals, trade unions, the military, and other organizations that are vital to its growth, at the expense of the downtrodden masses. The philosophy of the Oligarchy is “Combination is better than Competition.” The Socialists, who are pitted against the Oligarchy, espouse “Meeting Combination with Greater Combination.” The mounting confrontation between the Oligarchy and the Socialists finally breaks out into open warfare that lasts 300 years, but we are spared the whole episode. We just get a taste of the Revolution’s start in 1913 and its first few years when the Socialists are on the defensive, and the narrative ends in mid sentence (another good device to show the authenticity of Avis’s manuscript) as if its writer had to suddenly drop everything and run into hiding. There are some flaws in London’s plot. I fail to see how the Oligarchy could wipe out the middle class at home and abroad and survive if there is no one left to buy it’s “surpluses.” “Greed” is another un-factored element in the Socialist cause; just as it led to the downfall of various socialist regimes in the 1990’s and fueled countless boom-bust cycles in the capitalist stock market, greed is also likely penetrate BOM at some point and lead to its eventual downfall.The characters come across as wooden and we don’t really get a sense of how they feel even though we know how they think. And the adulation that Avis showers upon her husband is a bit nauseating at times - did London seek such reverence? And yet the final scene, the battle for Chicago is well painted from Avis’s viewpoint, where chaos reigns and it is hard to say who is winning or losing, all that is evident is the destruction of war that leaves its cruel mark all over the landscape. It is left to Anthony Meredith, 700 years later, to shed light on what really happened during that seminal event and how it served as the genesis for a 300-year struggle of many such uprisings before the evil Oligarchy was finally brought to heel.A different kind of London book, not one capturing his experiences in the wild, but one showcasing his beliefs about the world and its future.

The irony was that Service made so much money from his writing that he could outpace his struggling compatriots by leagues, and yet he could not garner anything above the title of a clever “rhymester” from his peers.From rugged beginnings in a religious Scottish family (with three spinster aunts to smother him), Service arrives via steerage class in Canada to begin his life as a young man. He winds up in the Yukon in the aftermath of the Klondike gold rush, works for a bank, and starts to save his money so that he can retire when he makes his first $5,000. In his spare time, during the long winter months, he coins poetry but doesn’t think much of it. Yet all his poems have stories behind them, drawing from the legends of the region: “The Shooting of Dan McGrew” and “The Cremation of Sam McGee” being the most famous. He sends off the first batch of rhymes, after much coercing from colleagues, and finds instant fame. Soon he is making more money from his poetry than from his bank job and he decides to resign and dedicate himself to writing.His life takes on a charmed existence from that point. He travels rivers, climbs mountains, gets lost in the wilderness, nearly dies of the cold, but never misses a beat of optimism. He travels to Paris as a journalist on the eve of WWI, marries, and immediately enlists as an ambulance driver to make his contribution to the war effort, and sees more action than the more glorified Hemingway ever did. Post- war he continues his work as a journalist and entertains the European literati in the hope of joining their club but is left on the outside; one eminent man of letters takes one of Services’ books and, without reading it, comments that he likes the binding! Service suffers a heart ailment but lives for another 30 years, writing more verse, a book on how to stay healthy, and novels. He owns houses in Paris and Brittany and sees that modest goal of $5000 in savings exceeded many time over without a dip in fortunes. The dip comes however, after WWII, when we get a glimpse of Service returning to France from the USA where he has escaped to sit out the war (and where he has written screenplays for Hollywood while kicking his heels there!) to find his properties sacked by the Nazis, partly for loot and partly “to punish that crazy journalist who wrote bad things about the Reich.”Although Service’s writing extended beyond his Yukon stage, it is those early pieces, written during his formative stage in this rugged part of Canada, that defined him for posterity as a writer. There is the essence of a man who assumes positive intent in his fellow beings oozing from the writing, endearing him to readers of any age and background. I can understand why the south road from Whitehorse airport down into the city retained its name Robert Service Way while the north road, named Jack London Way, was renamed Two Mile Road after much civilian protest. Service captured the spirit of the Yukon and gave it its romantic post-Klondike flavour, so much so that the territory’s tourist product is built around ballads such as “The Shooting of Dan McGrew” and “The Cremation of Sam McGee.” London, on the other hand, though a more immediate participant in the Klondike Stampede, lost the goodwill of the people and the land he captured in his books such as Call of the Wild and White Fang by being racially and politically pointed in his writing.There are many books in the Service oeuvre, but this book serves as a great compendium of the man, his work, and the land he immortalized. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2015","Aug 18, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13222383-robert-w-service

They are mainly British and American, with the odd Frenchman thrown in. Let’s see, there is Peter chasing a mysterious woman named Sabine with whom he had a three-day affair; Brooke, a philanthropist, who funded the novelistic efforts of her love interest, Kenneth, who in turn has squandered his time and money; Harley and musician Jason, a quarreling young couple; Adam, a New Age philosopher and his gay partner Yves; impotent Stan and Karen, an older couple looking to re-ignite their love life without Viagra; Sabine (yes, she actually appears) and her new squeeze, Jerome, who are looking for threesomes or even foursomes in the sack; and flower child Crystal, the woman that Peter is supposed to ultimately meet through his wayward peregrinations and through the mysterious workings of the universe. The book suffers because the fundamental elements of novel craft are ignored, reminding me that even the most brilliant writer (and there is no doubt that St. Aubyn is brilliant) needs to follow some conventions lest he leave his reader floundering and missing the best points that he is trying to make. There are too any characters, rendering many of them into caricatures, too many points of view, too much telling, too much philosophizing, and the story line is severely short changed. On the other hand there are brilliant descriptions of Los Angeles, of trips in the desert on psychedelic drugs, and of Tantric sex. There are lengthy discourses on Rumi and philosophy, but we get the impression that the novel is being blatantly used as a platform by the author to get his philosophical arguments across in not so subtle ways. Brilliant lines get tossed off, such as, “TV is the sewer pipe of society,” and “ Avoid the void,” making one not want to toss this maddeningly erratic book into the bin. After many digressions into side events that have no bearing on the central story line, and much drifting through everyone’s head and philosophy, the action centres on each couple getting into the “act”, each in their own way. The detritus of modern society interferes in their tantric couplings, namely the fantasizing by the men while they are in the sex act, thanks to porn, infidelity and other stimulants that men hang onto in order to get it off. And for the more liberated women like Sabine, the hunt for more than one man to please her in bed becomes a challenge in this commune, as everyone is thoroughly enjoying themselves with their chosen mate. But in the end, persistence pays off, and the New Age retreat is rocked with a series of orgasms, confirming that all is still well in the world.I’d just read the last chapter if you want to get to the gist of what is going on, everything else is optional, like clothes at a nudist camp....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 11, 2015","Aug 11, 2015",,Product Bundle,view (with text),/book/show/20518877-on-the-edge

Yet, he is a widower and has to rely in his widowed sister-in-law, Raissa, and her brood, who have come to live with him, to raise Ada. Raisaa has upwardly mobile plans, especially for her older daughter Lilla, and is an uncaring caretaker of Ada. Harry Sinner is the rich Jewish relative living on top of the hill whom Ada falls in love with when she flees to his home during the height of a pogrom in the lower town. And yet she is loved by her cousin Ben, Raissa’s son, a survivor who will bend the rules to earn a buck. The rich and poor members of the Sinner family reach out to each other and the richer ones try to help as best as they can, but societal restrictions of class get in the way. To complicate things, Harry marries a Gentile Frenchwoman, Laurence, but deserts her for Ada, while Ben is taken into the confidence by the wealthy elder Sinners as he is more of a mover and shaker than the genteel Harry. The fickle waters of international banking come into play, Ben makes a gamble that he loses, and Ada is forced to make a choice that involves loss and gain in equal measure. A rather convoluted plot!Although beginning in the Ukraine—from where the Sinners, both rich and poor, move to France to better their prospects—the story turns into a bold exploration of the Jewish hierarchy in France and its assimilation (or not) into mainstream society in that country. The Sinners are intense people: Ben obsesses over making it rich and gaining the approval of the elder Sinners, Raissa worries over Lilla’s future only to see her daughter end up as the mistress of a married man, old Israel Sinner rushes all over the place trying to broker the elusive deal that will feed his extended family, and Ada perseveres in trying and catch Harry’s attention by hook or by crook. The omniscient narrator and the leisurely pace of the narrative dates it. Long gaps in time are covered in a sentence while at other times the author dedicates an entire chapter to a single scene. The scene of the pogrom, related through the eyes of child, is well drawn, although Ada’s long suffering love for Harry and the actions she takes to attract his attention are melodramatic. The ending is rather pat and loses its connection with the mad reality of the times, especially when it comes to the fate of the Jews in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Had Nemirovsky known how inconclusively and tragically her own story was to end just a few years later, I wonder whether she would have resorted to writing such tightly crafted novels about Jewish life?...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Aug 02, 2015","Aug 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6361448-the-dogs-and-the-wolves

Chance, the theme that Auster often returns to in his novels, plays a big role in this book too. Chance robs narrator David Zimmer of his family in a plane crash; chance makes him watch an old silent movie clip of a forgotten actor from the thirties, Hector Mann, who made 12 movies in one year and vanished into the ether, like Zimmer’s family, influencing Zimmer to write a book on the movies of Mann; a chance bank robbery links Hector to his future wife Frieda and leads to a new film-making career they build together; chance brings a new love, Alma, into Zimmer’s life, freeing him from the isolation and booze that he had surrounded himself with since the air tragedy; chance also robs him of his new-found freedom.Irony is another strong theme: Frieda is intent in destroying Henry’s films after he dies, yet her estate goes to the preservation of films; Xanax helps Zimmer handle air travel, but is not as kind to Alma; Hector returns to film-making in his new life but can never show them to anyone; Hector goes from a life of abstinence with Nora, to a full-on sex show with Sylvia.Then there are the parallels: Zimmer is writing a biography of Chateaubriand with no hope of seeing it published, Alma is writing a biography of Hector with no hope of seeing it published; Hector goes into exile after his Hollywood silent movie career, Zimmer goes into exile after the death of his family; Brigitte slips a life-altering letter under Hector’s door, Hector places a similar one under Nora’s door.With chance, irony and parallels we understand why this is a called the Book of Illusions. Will what we see now be reversed on the next page? Will the impression we build of our characters change in the next chapter?

The politician appointed to chair the selection committee, Malcolm, is “pre-advised” as to which books need to make the long list by the head of the prize granting organization. The rest of the committee is made up of a secretary who is dreaming of her own writing career, an actor who is mostly off-stage, a journalist who favours underdogs, and a lone literary voice who believes that “literature must have depth, beauty, structural integrity and an ability to revive tired imaginations.” This idealism is lost on Malcolm of course, who, in keeping with his political conditioning, is looking for “compromise among all members” as his goal, irrespective of the outcome.Among the candidates in the running for the prize: Katherine, a nymphomaniacal ingénue who is sleeping with her editor Allan, and with two other writers at the same time: Didier the paradoxical theorist and Sam the angst-ridden insomniac; Sonny, the maharajah from India who believes his self-published book is a winner; and the aforementioned Sam, who is also probably the best of the literary lot. Oh, and lest we forget there, is also an Indian Cookbook, written by Sonny’s aunty that gets submitted by accident and is included in the long list due to the journalist committee member’s desire to favour the underdog! St. Aubyn is a briliant wordsmith and delivers this story in beautifully constructed prose, weaving his plot skillfully as we pop in an out of the heads of the entire cast. Ego’s rise and fall: Katherine breaks up with Sam as his book goes ahead of hers into the short list; Allan gets fired for screwing up Katherine’s submission; and Sonny cooks up a diabolical plan to assassinate the committee for spurning his book. Literary truisms abound: “Art based on impact, rather than process, structure, or insight is doomed to the jackhammer of monotony of having to shock again and again.” “Money has value because it can be exchanged for something else. Art only has value because it can’t.” and “What’s worse than an unexploded bomb in your basement? An exploding one!”The finale, of course, is the predictable awards ceremony at which we find the committee still in deadlock at the eleventh hour, split between the purists and the politicians, between the deserving and the undeserving. And of course, what happens if you end up with two favourites and cannot decide between them? Well, you'll have to read the book to find out. As for literary merit, it doesn't count for much with this award.I’m not sure St. Aubyn would have made a lot of friends in the literary establishment with this novel, but it’s a topical book for our times, especially when winning prizes seems the only way to vault into the literary big leagues today.

Narrated via his alter ego character, Henry Chinaski, Ham on Rye is a series of short, episodic chapters that chronicles Henry’s (Bukowkski’s) life from the ages of about 11 to 16, ending when America first loses its innocence following the bombing of Pearl Harbour. I can understand how painful and yet purgative this trip down memory lane must have been for the author as he lays bare his life deprived of love and acceptance. Henry hates his parents, understandably: his father is the most jealous, sadistic, manic, angry and vindictive man, ever, while his mother is as meek as a dormouse. He imagines a world in which he is a champion baseball or football star, while his real world is punctuated by regular beatings with the strop by his father, often for manufactured transgressions. Henry discovers the power of fiction when he writes an essay on an imagined meeting with President Hoover, a piece that is singled out to be read in class, and that incurs the wrath and jealousy of his classmates. He falls under the spell of the work of D.H. Lawrence that he discovers in the library, and finally takes journalism in college because he knows nothing else that he would be good for. When we leave Henry at the end of the book, he doesn’t think much of his writing, except that he knows he has to still find his unique style and voice.And the sins of the father visit upon him, mightily. Henry evolves into a magnet for unfortunate events. He becomes a bully as he matures into puberty. He discovers that his tolerance for alcohol is high as he enters adolescence, and binge drinking to blot out the real world becomes his reality. His heroes are John Dillinger and Ma Barker. He gravitates towards Nazism because his enemies are white Gentiles and he was born in Germany. And he revels in being the underdog, for it gives him identity, and meaning for all that is happening to him. He consequently rejects stable middle class life and prefers to live on the margins in cheap rooming houses. “You manned your station and waited on some asshole,” is his dismissal of corporate life.And yet, despite the braggadocio, the tragedies of his life are: he remains a virgin while his peers are popping their cherries, he is unable to attract a girl due to his disfigured features, he is unable to hold down a job, and he can only look through the window at his high school prom as he is too poor, too ugly, and too marginalized to join the “normal” people inside. We know that in his later years, Bukowski, who had sufficient anti-social conditioning to turn into a mass-murderer, transcended his early life to convert it into poetry. Unfortunately this book does not advance into that transcendent period but leaves us with a defeated and lost youth in the aftermath of Pearl Harbour, who cannot even win at his regular boxing game in a penny arcade, being beaten by a kid half his age who is using a mechanized boxer with a broken arm. The one criticism of this book is that it never looks towards hope. Henry has an indomitable spirit, no doubt, but it is a spirit fuelled with anger and held together with a high threshold for physical pain. Perhaps we have to read the later books of this author, when after all the misery and debauchery, Bukowski had the time to reflect upon his life and its meaning, and bring out its poetry and its message, a message that is, I’m sure, universally enduring....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 05, 2015","Jul 05, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye

Offered a job in a hospital in Delhi, she traverses the country by boat and road, giving us the historical and geographical armchair tour, and uncovering the simmering conflict between the ruling British and India’s former rulers, the Nawabs and Maharajahs, who are being slowly edged into retirement by their interfering colonial masters. She is also the magnet for lonely men like Colonel Humphrey, who looks for every opportunity to seduce the pregnant widow and shows his contempt for her whenever she rebukes him. To add to Margaret’s woes, her nemesis, Captain (now reduced to Lieutenant) Albert Miller, who was responsible for her husband’s death in the Crimea, has also transferred to India and is out to settle past scores. Margaret sympathizes with the locals, ignores the class distinctions practiced by both sides, and is outspoken about British duplicity, putting herself in harm’s way; she can only rely on a sepoy, Sharif Khan, and his immediate friends and family, to protect her.The pace of this novel is slow, like a leisurely ride on the Ganges. Margaret, who narrates most of the novel, is a virtuous and cultured lady, who is precise about every detail in her recounting; I would even call her a nit-picker. We see the broader conflict brewing in India through her lens and through the domestic activities that she is engaged in. In the name of propriety, she has to submit to situations that open her to danger and scandal, like going on an innocuous horse ride with Colonel Humphrey who is having difficulty keeping his hands on the reins, like delivering a perilously positioned baby of a Moslem woman, and like treating the Queen of Delhi with belladonna - poisonous if taken in large doses. She is also faced with the constant moral choice of either becoming the mistress of her amorous pursuer and having the material comforts of life taken care of, or standing by her principles and remaining poor and separated from her other children in Canada.Given the author’s interest in history, we are taken on detours to discover the legends behind the “Black Hole of Calcutta,” “The Kohinoor Diamond,” and “The Fishing Fleet.” We also encounter breakthroughs in medical science that occurred at the time: Margaret experimenting with perineum episiotomies to deliver babies, and the removal of the appendix. Although we sympathize with the Indians for losing control of their country, we wonder why those Nawabs and Maharajahs didn’t get off their asses and clean their palaces, relying instead on funding from the British to hire more servants to do their menial jobs? Doesn’t God help those who help themselves, as Margaret epitomizes? While I enjoyed the history, I was not enamoured by the way in which the lesson was delivered: always in obvious “question and answer” dialogue; perhaps the use of a variety of devices such as exposition, epistolary, and oral storytelling may have helped. This book, like its predecessor, is a good fictional rendition of history from an original angle, that of a progressive woman of her time, battling not only the events of history but also the restrictions on her gender. In particular, this novel covers the events leading to the first Indian Revolution of 1857, a milestone in history that is somewhat overshadowed by the events of 1947 that ultimately led to self-government. But the seeds were sown back then, during Dr. Margaret’s time, and I am grateful to the author for sharing this genesis with us....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 26, 2015","Jun 26, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25506779-doctor-margaret-in-delhi

A stellar scholar and athlete in college, he inherits the family glove business, takes his family out of the “Jewish quarter,” and builds the monster home and farm in the country with a beauty-queen wife and a daughter; he is an overall nice guy who always said the right things and acts appropriately and with restraint, with no taint of scandal to tarnish him. Swede is a direct contrast to his father, Lou, the rough and tumble, in-your-face merchant who started the family business in the ghetto and who will never emerge from the social and mental corner he has boxed himself into. Swede’s nemesis however, is his daughter, Meredith, fat, ungainly and unaccomplished, who makes her mark in the world by going against all the values of her father; she becomes an anti-capitalist rebel who sinks into anarchy by blowing up buildings and killing people. If Swede is the American Pastoral, Meredith is the American Beserk. The story is revealed by Roth’s alter-ego, writer Nathan Zuckerman, who is ostensibly a former classmate of Swede’s younger and brasher bother, Jerry. Zuckerman idolized Swede while growing up, and is flattered and intrigued when he is invited by the older Swede to write a memoir on the “troubles” that destroyed the family. They only have one meeting (in which nothing much is revealed in typical Swede reticence) before Swede passes away, and what follows is a story written by Zuckerman who takes creative license for his sources and his content. An interesting device used by Roth to chronicle a family history and delve as deep as he wishes to in anyone’s head without being locked into a specific form.The book is anchored by two very long scenes. The opening school re-union scene is where everyone catches up on how lives have diverged and changed for better or worse since the glory days of high school. What is evident in this scene is that, while everyone has gone on to lead imperfect and unfulfilled lives, Swede is the exception. The second long scene is at the end of the book, the dinner party at the Levov family home where we get glimpses into lives of quiet desperation lived by these symbols of upper middle-class respectability - something has a gotta give, and it does! In between these bookends is the agonizing descent of Swede from all-American glamour boy into a paranoid, nervous wreck as a result of being betrayed by the fruit of his loins. This fruit, his daughter Meredith, is an extremist in more ways than one. She moves from one fad to another with maniacal focus, and is equally devoted to blowing up Americans to protest the Vietnam War or to becoming a Jain who will not even eat vegetables because that destroys life. And Swede’s plaintive question is: “After all that we did for her, why this?” In between these internal musings and Swede’s hunt for his daughter through the underworld, we get detailed descriptions of glove making, Newark neighbourhoods and American trivia from the last half of the 20th century. Roth seems determined to plant this story firmly within the fabric of American life in that period. In the process, the novel exposes how polarized America is between old money and new money, between Jew and Gentile, and between Republican and Democrat.As for the answer to Swede’s question, we get a hint at the end of the dinner party, when the message “you can take a horse to water, but you cannot make him (or her) drink” rings out loud and clear. And that “you can plan for the future, but don’t ever bank on it materializing as planned,” and as Newton said, “to every action there will be an equal and opposite reaction.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jun 04, 2015","Jun 04, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11650.American_Pastoral

The themes are familiar: memories of youth, aging lust, infidelity, late second marriages, guilt over the collapse of the first long marriage that begat children, death and insignificance. Updike seemed to be eternally atoning for the breakup of his first marriage as he neared the end of his days, as evinced in this posthumously published collection.Except for the 9/11 piece “Varieties of Religious Experience,” which is narrated from the points of view of the victim, the perpetrator, and the bystander left with the legacy, none of the stories are powerful enough to engage. A footnote on the 9/11 piece: Updike did a more thorough examination of this theme in his novel Terrorist, which I enjoyed. The stories set in Spain and India, and outside the familiar US-East Coast milieu, fail to excite as they are focused on the internal quest of the narrator and are not integrated with the exotic locales. The opening story set in Morocco and written back in 1969, makes such an effort at integration, but ends up reading more like a travelogue. The normally fluid writing of Updike seems to have developed a different rhythm, and I had to re-read some of the longer sentences to fall back into the flow.It appeared to me on concluding this book, that this collection of stories had been assembled to reflect the last days of the great author, what he was pre-occupied with at the time, what he regretted not having accomplished, and what he had witnessed during his career. It’s a pity that the normally punchy prose had given way to a languid musing, with a reluctance to excite the senses lest that be too much for the fragile health of the aging author. It was as if the tired “Rabbit” Angstrom had finally returned home to his hutch, to rest, after bopping vigorously around the neighborhood for a very long time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 28, 2015","May 28, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5668391-my-father-s-tears-and-other-stories

Theroux couldn’t have come up with a more difficult subject. In his words, Naipaul is the “one of the strangest and most difficult men I have met. He was contradictory, he challenged everything, he demanded attention, he could be petty, he uttered heresies about Africa (a land Theroux had a strong connection with), he made his innocent wife cry, he had impossible standards, he was self-important, he hated children, music and dogs. He was also brilliant and passionate in his convictions.” And yet there is a warmth between these two men, Naipaul the mentor and Theroux the willing acolyte and their lessons on writing that span continents in shared conversations, letters, and essays are invaluable even today, for these two men were totally dedicated to their craft, suffering the vicissitudes of the career writer who has no other outlet for self-actualization. Money was always a lack and a need for they alternated between selling critically acclaimed but financially lean books, dabbling in journalism, and taking teaching assignments to keep the bills paid while roaming the world, often alone, in search of material for their pen.Some of the master Naipaul’s lessons to his student Theroux are worth noting:a) Don’t get rich on writing before the age of 40. b) Tell the truth.c) Create original turns of phrase and words.d) The Man (writer) must never precede the work (yet Naipaul was pleased with the literary honours, including the Nobel that came after this book was written, heaped upon him).e) Story is not important, narrative is better.

Ironically, this same woman had crossed their paths when she was a child and when the two writers had been debating the merits of having children using her as an example. Theroux and the new wife do not hit it off from the inception and that spills into damaging his relationship with Naipaul.The final meeting between the two prompts the writing of this book when Theroux realizes the wisdom in Naipaul’s words, “To all relations, there is a time to call them off.” And looking after the master scuttle up the road to Hyde Park, Theroux discovers that his giant literary friend is indeed a small man with no shadow. “Take it on the chin and move on,” are the final words from the great author that keep ringing in his ears, and with that, Theroux heads home to settle down and write this book as his form of preservation and purgation of a relationship that greatly informed his career as a writer.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 19, 2015","May 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92523.Sir_Vidia_s_Shadow

Mahfouz articulates a strong message that vengeance is the Lord’s and those who embark on that trail are destined to an inevitable and early grave. And yet there is a countervailing defeatist message: bad guys who exercise guile and restraint win in the end, and you can’t change a corrupt system on your own.Said Mahran, is a modern day Robin Hood, programmed by his journalist mentor and his social condition to rob the rich and feed the poor. When the political winds in Egypt change, he is betrayed by his mentor and sent to jail. His mentor joins the nouveau riche, embracing all they fought against. Said’s wife marries his best friend and his daughter disowns him. His only allies are a shady cafe owner who provides him with a gun, and a faithful prostitute who provides him shelter. The stage is set for the Revenge of Said. And yet our anti-hero proves to be an inept burglar and an even clumsier assassin, always botching the jobs he sets out to do. He seeks the advice of his Sufi master who advises Said to “wash and read,” but Said is too corroded with hatred to heed the wise man’s advice. In the fast-paced plot, the thief who hunts the dogs is in turn hunted like a dog down to his inevitable end.The novella is remarkably short in depth, for if you take out the pre-occupation with, and the destructive nature of revenge, there is little else to ponder other than the weakness of human nature, both in the thief and among the dogs. Cairo serves as a good backdrop with its labyrinthine darkness and shifting political sands. And there is nothing to redeem Said. In his hatred he is also self-righteous: “I am the hope and dreams, the redemption of cowards” - hard to feel anything for this deluded guy other than pity! I was left wondering why Mahfouz wrote this novel. Was he moralizing in a literary way, or was he making a strong statement to those who take Said’s path: “Don’t tread here, it’s a straight drop down this mountain into hell with no outcrops of rock to hang onto.”...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"May 13, 2015","May 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96562._

Forster limits his study to about a dozen novels and their authors: The Brothers Karamazov, Moby Dick, Ulysses, Wuthering Heights, Madame Bovary, Moll Flanders, Emma, Tristram Shandy, The White Peacock, War and Peace, Bleak House and the Ambassadors. He breaks his areas of study into Story, Plot, People, Fantasy, Prophesy, Pattern and Rhythm. Here are some key points I picked up in each of the areas or in their related sub sections:Story: is event and time sequence driven, and does not get into motivations of why things are happening, always begging only the question of “what comes next.”Plot: extends story into the motivations behind the actions. Plot demands memory and intelligence. Inquisitive people have bad memory and are stupid at bottom.People: discussion on “round” and “flat” characters dominates. Flat characters can be described in a sentence and are best used for comedy while round characters are more complex (like real people). Dickens used flat characters mostly but got his point across through them rather effectively. Jane Austen was the master of round characters. The focus on the sensitivity of characters to each other is larger in the novel than in real life, as is the focus on love and death.POV: can be of several types. Bleak House and War & Peace uses all forms of POV from Omniscient to Third Person. Forster doesn’t mind shifting POV - as long as it works!Fantasy vs. Prophesy: both involve mythology, but fantasy invokes the creatures of the “lower air” ( i.e. fauns, druids, fairies etc.) while prophesy is grounded in the human. Prophetic fiction demands humility and the absence of a sense of humor. Pattern: the hourglass pattern, where the principal characters invert roles between beginning and end is the dominant pattern discussed.Rhythm: Proust is the master of rhythm, everything else in his masterpiece falls apartForster makes other observations: “To take the reader into your confidence means intellectual and emotional lowering” - this is a direct reference to the intrusive narrator who comments on the state of affairs from time to time, a style that has since gone out of fashion today. “The artist aims for the truth, and succeeds if he raises emotions.” “A novel must end with at least one living character.”The Appendix section at the end of this book is well worth reading for it contains the frank thoughts and opinions of Forster on the same books that he read in preparation for the lectures. He isn’t kind to all the novels or to their authors in this section though, which makes it all the more compelling to read!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 05, 2015","May 05, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/263341.Aspects_of_the_Novel

And Portnoy seems to be Roth’s boldest character. I now see where the Seinfeld series got its inspiration from; George Costanza is a balder shoo-in for Roth’s masturbating monster.Alex Portnoy is a good Jewish boy who is smothered and guilted by his parents, and who has developed the only method of self-expression: pulling at his willy in the most unusual places and with the most intimate pieces of women’s apparel draped around him. He is a gifted student who goes on to build a solid career in the civil service, dedicated to raising human potential and serving the underprivileged. And yet his secret life of sexual obsession is threatening to derail him – hence the shrink at the age of 33.Once he outgrows his fascination with his pecker, and as he enters college and falls outside the clutches of his cloying parents, his obsession turns to Gentile girls, shikses, who he can’t seem to get enough of. Jewish girls do not turn him on, and the one time he is with one, in Israel (who else can you sleep with in Israel except with a Jewish woman, he observes), he loses his erection. I can understand why this book was termed offensive at the time it came out – no one who comes within Portnoy’s sights is spared, and with the most colourful, sarcastic, desperate and inciting prose to boot. There were times I laughed my head off, and other times when I cringed at Alex’s acts of debasement. His observations on life could be summed up as follows:1)	Jewish parents only instil fear and guilt in their children.2)	Gentiles have a stranglehold on the economy and the social establishment, and Jews will always be on the fringe.3)	Gentile women are desirable but sexually inhibited. (His girlfriend “The Monkey” is the exception” but he feels inadequate with her and ditches her in Europe during his travels).4)	The Jew outside Israel is a self-deprecating capitalist, while the one inside the Promised Land is proud, optimistic and communist. The former went to the gas chambers because he did not protest.The writing brims with vitality, and yet the repetition of the rant wears thin after awhile and we wonder, whose side is this guy on? This is a great book for young men emerging into a hostile world and protesting about everything they see in it, and blaming their parents for the mess they are in. But for the older reader, this book is just a sentimental read, generating a few laughs, and ending with a nod and an admonishment: “Just you wait, Mr. Portnoy – you will eventually have to join the human race, flawed though it may be.” And as for Roth himself, judging from his later novels with characters such as Zuckerman and Kepesh, he did throw in Portnoy’s towel and join the human race with caveat that he could still takes discreet shots at it, albeit with not so much lewdness and misplaced sexual energy....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2015","Apr 26, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43945.Portnoy_s_Complaint

Goodbye ColumbuRoths’s earlier books are fresh, humorous and vibrant compared to his recent work that is self-obsessed with aging, potency and dying. Goodbye Columbus is just such a vibrant collection that portrays, with humour, the angst of the Jews in New Jersey, transplanted from the recent Holocaust, and trying to find their place in the New World, hindered by a Socialist past, yet striving to become part of the Capitalist ideal. In the title story—a poor-boy-meets-rich-girl (who was once poor but can’t remember it) novella, a coming of age story and a bidding goodbye to the protected world of university days—the innocence of growing up in the ‘50’s comes out. A young couple driving in the Lincoln Tunnel on a secret mission are doing nothing more serious than having a diaphragm fitted, unknown to their parents; whereas contemporary literature would insinuate a more diabolical purpose involving drugs, bombs or homicide. The Jewish family structure is placed under the microscope when the brother of the rich girl is forced to marry and join the family home renovation business in order to earn a living, just because he has knocked up his girlfriend. When the extended family assembles for the wedding party, the dysfunction of an upwardly mobile family is laid bare. Uncle Leo Patimkin is by far the most interesting character, a travelling salesman, who has been left behind in the social climbing and has a lot to say about it, especially after a few bottles of champagne.In the following five shorter pieces, themes of guilt, separatism, survival, assimilation and neuroticism—typical challenges facing the newcomer—play out. In the “Conversion of the Jews,” a young Jew exploits his Rabbi and mother’s guilt over being responsible for his impending suicide by getting them to accept that divine births are possible if they believe in an omnipotent God. In “Defender of the Faith,” a Jewish army recruit cloyingly inveigles special privileges from his (also Jewish) sergeant and uses strategic lies to gain advantage. In “Epstein,” we see the classic immigrant who built himself up from scratch, now in middle age, trying to boost his sex life with a bit on the side and falling outside the norms established for his people, with disastrous consequences. “You Can Tell a Man by the Song He Sings” pits the incumbent ex-con American schoolboy against a brainy Jewish kid, where the moral of the story is that those who have been “in the can” know how to wreak their revenge and yet stay out of trouble compared to those naive ones who play by the rule book. The final story, “Eli the Fanatic,” is the most powerful, for it deals with the issue of assimilation and posits the question that it is the responsibility of both the incumbent and the outsider to make inclusion work. Eli’s plunge into neurosis and nervous breakdown signals to us that in 1950’s America this assimilation was still a long way off.For a book released in the 1950’s this collection must have been a rather candid piece of literature, and I’m sure as much as Roth caught America’s attention with it, he must have lost some fans among the Jewish diaspora. The mourning of one’s woes in public, at the expense of patient listeners, the fact that Jewish men at 23 were expected to live at home with their parents, that pre-marital sex even with a diaphragm was considered grounds for family upheaval, and that even the military had to accommodate for Kosher food, must have been uncomfortable skeletons to be aired for upwardly mobile Jews trying to make it in the New World and become part of the mainstream. And yet, these practices may be considered quite normal today, given that: we have public social media to reveal our most intimate gripes, unemployed young people are returning to parental homes in droves, sexual abstinence is making a comeback, and the military is bending over backwards to accommodate diversity in its ranks.  I found the typical stylistic flaws of the writer in the early stages of his career; some scenes and situations are difficult to visualize and the narrative is unwieldy in places. Roth’s later work is more polished, but he seems to have acquired that polish at the expense of sacrificing that “in your face” humour that oozes out of Goodbye Columbus, making it an excellent read....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2015","Apr 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29744.Goodbye_Columbus

There are plenty of off-beat characters in the small town of Fox's Creek, where allegiances and enmities run deep and through generations. Young Billy and Anna are the star-crossed lovers, parted when Billy volunteers with three other local boys to head off to war. On the eve of his departure, a murder-rape takes place scarring the lovers and placing doubt in the minds of the town folk. Billy's and his buddies' war escapade follow on the heels of this incident and is told in a rapid epistolatory format, culminating in the inevitable tragedy that most Canadian families had to endure at this time. This revelation by me may sound spoiler-like, but not to have ended the novel where Pope did would have rendered it a fairy tale.I enjoyed the cast of characters from Black Alex, to Slow Bob, to Simple Jack, to Chicken Jimmy, whose names alone reveal their quirkiness. The murder and rape scenes are well drawn to conceal the identities of the perpetrators, and the journalistic reporting that peppers the novel is humorous for it betrays the subjectivity and prejudice that were acceptable at the time - we have come a long ways in objective reporting it appears despite all the bashing the press gets these days. The letters, that comprise the bulk of the last part of the book, illustrate the varying levels of education in the population at the time.I did not enjoy the intrusive and controlling omniscient narrator who had to ensure that every character was in their place in every scene, and who made it a point to keep us abreast of each character’s thoughts. A limited third person view of some of the key cast members would have worked better to my liking. That said, as this is a historian writing a novel, and because he is trying to capture a whole town and its inhabitants and their interactions - no mean feat - I let go of my irritation on the basis that crowd-herding and tight stage management were par for the course in this tome. If he was trying to emulate an early 20th century writing style to blend with his story, then Pope has succeeded.Pope's novel left me pondering several facts of a forgotten life: insular communities are only the tips of icebergs under which seething passions form the lurking menace below the water level; the world was a smaller place a hundred years ago, such that the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace was the biggest event hitherto witnessed by our four volunteer soldiers; men went into depression when they were rejected for military service on health or age grounds, despite their 'luckier' colleagues ending up dead in rat infested trenches; when communities sent their young to war, their lives back home hung suspended on the outcome; joining the armed forces suddenly made impoverished farmers rich; war is a game devised by old men to be waged by young men, and both lose in the end.

And as he died while correcting the proofs of the manuscript and while still making changes, it is an incomplete work of art, and perhaps more intriguing than had he completed it during his life and lived to see the end of Communism. This novel is a juxtaposition of two stories: Moscow in the 1930’s under Soviet rule, and Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem faced with triggering the execution of Jesus. After awhile we realize that both milieus are eerily alike, abounding with treachery, bureaucracy, spies, atheism, cultural stasis and the absence of goodwill. No wonder Bulgakov realized that he had no hope in hell of getting his novel through the censors. In the Moscow story we are introduced to the Master, a Bulgakov stand-in, a writer who is blocked after writing his single piece of work, an interpretation of the story of Pontius Pilate, which he cannot get published anywhere. He has therefore abandoned his manuscript and is suffering deep regret from this act. He is in love with Margarita, a married woman, who is determined to save her lover from the depression and madness that he is sinking into (Bulgakov also suffered from nervous breakdowns while writing this novel but continued to write until his death). The bad guys in the Moscow story are the protected and privileged, state-sanctioned arts sectors (theatrical and literary - two sectors that Bulgakov was active in) just as the Romans and Pharisees were in the time of Pilate. And the saviour in the Moscow story is not the Christ figure but a delightfully funny Satan (aka Woland) and his motley band of assistants which includes a naked woman and a talking cat. Upon his arrival in Moscow, Woland sets on the bad guys, and a series of bizarre events start taking place: beheadings, black-magic, vanishing and re-appearing counterfeit clothes and money, broomstick rides above the city, buildings erupting in flames; villainy is indeed afoot, exposing the greed and corruption of Soviet society. Of course, all ends well in this fantasy: the lovers ride off into the sunset, the bad guys are punished, and Bulgakov is able to resolve his abominable situation by killing off his real-life opponents in the arts world, on paper at least, and he even ends up in teaching a toady poet to seek the truth and write about the things that matter.The book draws heavily from classical literature and we see shades and situations from the Gospels, Dante, Gogol, and Faust. While the first half of the book is grounded in earthly events, the second half of the book takes off into fantasy. The one drawback in reading this novel: because there are so many points of view and threads into the story, and as each chapter ends with a different POV, it takes going back and forth to find where each thread left off before picking it up again in a subsequent chapter. This is partially offset by the crisp English translation which is remarkably good for a Russian original.There are many unforgettable messages in this novel, but the one that sticks with me is the claim that the truth cannot be hidden or destroyed, that “manuscripts do not burn” despite everyone’s, including the author’s, attempts to destroy them, as we see with the Master’s tome, as we have seen with Bulgakov’s post-humous masterpiece.

Patrick is a farm boy and an immigrant to the city; Nicholas is an immigrant from Macedonia, Carol is a poor girl hanging out with an enigmatic millionaire, and Alice yearns for Patrick to take notice of her - all of them in strange territory, looking for acceptance.Two large construction projects that gave Toronto it's character anchor this novel: the Bloor Viaduct and the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, and yet the country is named Upper America, making me wonder whether ""Canada"" was not a good sell in publishing circles at the time of this book's publication in the '80's. Many immigrant workers gave their lives to build these two engineering landmarks and the author gives us some unforgettable images: a nun falling off the half constructed bridge and being saved, immigrant workers organizing theatre performances on the worksite to alleviate the tedium of their lives, an intruder using the intake from the lake to gain access to the water treatment plant.There is also a lot of interesting detail, revealed in poetic prose, on dynamiting logjams, on how immigrants learn English, the Bertillon System, tunneling underwater, dye work. I would not take the trouble to read up on these subjects, but in Ondaatje's mellifluous prose they are digestible. Even the sex act is transformed into poetry rather than pornography: check out the scene where the spoils of fellatio are shared by the lovers until diminishing returns accrue in their mouths.I found the characters somewhat unconvincing: Patrick and Caravaggio come across as poetic academics and not of their hard scrabble farm and immigrant milieus, and the women are rather flaky in their romantic loyalties despite their sturdy working class backgrounds. The author resorts to the technique (probably innovative at the time, but rather overused today) of revealing an important fact, or an inflection point, further down the story path and then following up by flashing back to how we arrived at that point, and upon reaching it, flashing forward again to the next inflection point to back track, and so on.Union busting, worker exploitation and closing of the ranks around the economically privileged ""one percent"" were alive and well in the early 20th century, and with their resurgence today, make this book topical. And the workers strike back, with arson and violence, not unlike our jaded youth of today who run away to foreign climes to gain infamy through terrorism.As for the story itself, it meanders, often into unconnected areas, before coming to somewhat of a resolution in the end, and not all loose threads are tied. But then Ondaatje has his spin on the novel when he says that the first sentence of every novel should be: ""Trust me, this will take time, but there is order here, very faint, very human. Meander if you want to get to town."" Ondaatje even has a take on his own life as an artist when millionaire Ambrose says to Patrick, ""You don't want power.

Lonov and Amy Bellette. I wasn’t disappointed.The 23-year old literary wunderkind who has published only four short stories at this point in his career is desperately seeking a father-figure to replace his biological father who has severely sanctioned him for writing bad things about the Jewish people. Zuckerman finds his patriarchal endorsement in Lonov, a reclusive writer who has been shunned by the literati in New York but whose life embodies the sacred and lonely vocation of the writer, similar to Henry James's or Salinger's. Lonov has not only read Zuckerman’s work, but is deeply moved by it.Invited to spend the weekend at Lonovs' farmhouse, Zuckerman finds an impeccably dressed, portly, middle-aged man who writes a sentence, then turns it around, then takes a break before repeating the cycle with the next sentence – all in all, about three to four sentences a day. Then Lonov throws it all out the next day and begins again. He once re-wrote a short story 27 times. He takes walks in between writing and has not much else of a life. He writes from imagination, not from experience.Into the mix, we have Amy Bellette, a 26-year old refugee from Europe, living with the Lonov’s, who is supposedly none other than Ann Frank herself, who has miraculously escaped the concentration camps but is unable to reveal her identity as it may destroy the mystique of her famous diary that is now rising to literary greatness around the world. Roth therefore posits an interesting question: is the artist more famous dead than alive? Or is Amy cloaking herself in this literary aura simply to attract the aging Lonov as her lover? Wrapping up the cast is Hope, Lonov’s long-suffering wife, whose income and family position have afforded the eminent writer his lifestyle. Hope suffers from a lack of self-worth and feels that she can never match up to her spouse’s greatness; yet she is the jealous housewife when it comes to Amy, willing to pluck out an eyeball or two. An interesting cocktail of emotions to drop our Zuckerman into, especially when he lusts over Amy and worships Lonov – imagine his consternation when he overhears Amy and the great man up to more earthy matters above his head between creaky floorboards in the old farmhouse!Although the stage is set for a myriad of possibilities, Zuckerman and Lonov hog most the time in this short novel discussing literary matters. Henry James is quoted often, the most important being, “Doubt is the writer’s passion, passion is his task, the rest is the madness of art.” My favourite, however, is “Literary history is in part the history of novelists infuriating fellow countrymen, family and friends” – a path Zuckerman (and Roth) have taken. The lot of the Jews facing persecution for just being Jewish is highlighted in the fate of the Frank family who had assimilated into Holland and identified themselves as being Dutch, but who were betrayed by their countrymen and sent to the camps.Despite the literary and philosophical skirmishing, Roth does not forget that this is a novel and gives us an interesting ending, which restores the balance. I am now on the path to reading more Zuckerman novels, particularly because the voice of the narrator has a restrained humour, unlike more frenetic narrators such as Portnoy (Portnoy’s Complaint) and Eli the Fanatic (Goodbye Columbus), and the sentence structure is complex yet fluid and a pleasure to read....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2015","Mar 18, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50696.The_Ghost_Writer

She is a Communist, once attracted to the Cause when it was intellectual and fashionable, but now on the verge of leaving the Party due to the excesses of Stalin. The notebooks give us background on the core story, and are a departure from the traditional novel form where everything has to be fictionalized (one of Anna’s issues, according to her therapist). The notebooks give Anna the opportunity to discard “show, don’t tell” and conduct a clinical analysis of the issues of the day: vaginal vs. clitoral orgasm, frigidity, Communism, nuclear-phobia, the fragmentation of art in the west, men, extra-marital sex, and the emancipation of women. Thus, this composite novel is high on content but amorphous in structure. Lessing, though her characters, revisits her early life in Rhodesia and “shows” us (for a change) the colour-bar issue in that country. When the tyrannical and jealous Mrs. Boothby dismisses her servant of 15 years on a whim, and when the hedonistic whites go pigeon hunting and shoot the poor birds at random, far in excess of what was asked of them, we see the hubris and rot of colonialism.Her discourses on communism reveal a deep sense of betrayal. Even though Britain had the most liberal form of Communism compared to Russia’s where it had been Stalin-ized, and the US’s where it had been McCarthy-ized, the British Labour movement, with its left-of-centre stance, is stealing many of the CP’s members, and Anna is forced to leave the Party over its failure to live up to her ideals. Lessing did the same in real life.The book’s long paragraphs with chunks of dialogue embedded in them make for difficult reading although they may be typical of how notebooks are written. Some sections follow a narrative flow while others lapse into streams of consciousness, and the Lessing-like characters who flit in and out (Anna, Ella etc al), and the close parallels in their stories, make it difficult to keep tabs on what has happened to whom whenever we pick up the thread of a particular notebook from where it last left off.All that to say, this must have been a bold book when it came out in the middle of the last century, written by a woman who made bold choices regarding career and family. My only beef after working through this rather engaging but formless tome is that Anna is left no better off than when she started. Despite the title of “Free Women” and the suggestion of emancipation, Lessing’s women are no freer in the end; they are still at the mercy of their men, being attracted to them like flies to honey, being defined by them, and being abused and abandoned by them. Perhaps that is what Lessing intended for her portrayal of the women of the ‘50’s. She must have been indeed pleased with women’s progress on the emancipation road by the time her century ended....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 07, 2015","Mar 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24100.The_Golden_Notebook

Isabel is white, privileged, bored and lonely, for she lives with an uncle in Rio while her father is a busy bureaucrat in the new government city built in the middle of nowhere – Brasilia. Like the legendary lovers who fall in love after ingesting a love portion, Tristao and Isabel fall instantly in love after a chance meeting on Copacabana Beach, immediately have the most descriptive but sloppy sex, and are consigned for the rest of their lives to be trying to reach each other.The lovers move inland, escaping Isabel’s father’s goons who are trying to separate them: from Rio to Sao Paolo to Brasilia to crossing the Mato Grosso and into the Amazon. Sex is their unifying balm in a sea of troubles and they have lots of it, not with just each other but with others as well. Despite the many children that Isabel bears (and loses), none are from Tristao, perhaps the author’s way of insinuating that this type of racial relationship does not bear fruit in Brazil. Their outward journey is filled with tragedy and loss, for it is hard to be a black man with a white woman and not invite danger; it is not part of the socially acceptable fabric at the time. At the turning point of their voyage, a shaman converts Tristao to a white man and Isabel turns black and their journey back over the same route is an easier re-entry filled with increasing opportunity and wealth, for it is infinitely normal for a white man to have a black woman in Brazil – Updike’s assessment of the country.The issues facing this newly industrializing country—for centuries under imperial rule and now under “the generals” who are loyal to America—come out in off-the-cuff comments by the characters: “People are killed in Brazil for telling the truth,” “Brazil has been populated by mismatched couples”; even Isabel comments, “It is not my father who hunts us, it is the system.” The narrative and dialogue is highly stylized, perhaps an “out” for the author who then does not have to resort to dialect for each of the characters who come from different regions and from different social tracks of this vast country. But the plot moves fast and this novel is an engaging read. Updike stays true to the legendary chronicle of the lovers by throwing in tragedy as the lot of Tritao and Isabel upon their return to Rio; but he adds a twist to the old story, shaping his ending to reflect the contemporary reality of Brazil, where the barbarians in the favelas surrounding the city get even with their rich white countrymen for squeezing them into the margins and sucking up all the country’s wealth. Poor Tristao, who has skirted both sides of the fence by this time, is unable to recognize that grim reality, unchanged in 22 years since he took a walk on Copacabana Beach and met his destiny in Isabel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2015","Feb 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11664.Brazil

Once safe in his hideout, cut off from TV, the Internet and other distractions, he is afflicted with prostate cancer which renders him impotent and incontinent. Returning to New York after a 11-year absence for experimental treatment that may restore bladder control, he is revisited with the joy of living again, especially when thrown into the company of a thirty year old writer and ardent fan, Jamie, and her husband, Billy, who want to do a house swap with him. What follows is a pathetic narrative of a man on the downward slope desperately trying to re-ascend an impossible mountain.In New York, he also encounters Amy Bellete (a supposedly fictitious version of Ann Frank who survived the holocaust despite diaries to the contrary) who was the former lover of E.I. Lonoff (a fictitious fusion of Bernard Malamud and Henry Roth), the writer Zuckerman revered in his youth. Amy reflects his own failing body, for she is undergoing treatment for a brain tumour; she awakens Zukerman to the fact that he too is losing his memory, and with that, the only purpose left to him in life: his writing. The villain of the piece is the ambitious literary hound Kliman, the lover of Jamie and a reflection of the once bold Zuckerman, who is out to write a biographical exposé on Lonoff’s “dark secret.” Zuckerman, out of loyalty to Lonoff and a bruised ego due Jamie’s infidelity, is determined to thwart Kliman. The scene is set for a literary showdown. And yet the book veers off into multiple directions after that brilliant set up and never gets to a satisfactory climax. We are treated to lengthy reflections by Zuckerman on the lives of Lonoff, George Plimpton and other literary greats, and to a take on Chekov’s story “He and She” in which Zuckerman conducts an intimate dialogue with Jamie, one he can never carry on in real life. Zuckerman (Roth) also gets to air his political preference for the Democrats and takes pot shots at George Bush on the eve of Dubya’s second term win. The biographer is cast as the villain by the writer who seeks to preserve his privacy, for “A biography is a patent on a life. The biographer holds the patent.” This book is probably best read after reading The Ghostwriter in which a younger Zuckerman first comes into contact with Lonoff and Bellete and forms his life-long connection with them. There are references to that first meeting in Exit Ghost.Roth seems to be trying to come to terms with his own mortality via the life of Zuckerman, and, in this book, boldly faces the embarrassments of memory loss, bladder loss and potency loss, aging factors that make men, especially celebrity figures like him, fall from great heights, leaving them the one exit left. Zuckerman takes his, but Roth spins it in such a way as to leave his fictional twin ready to return for yet another novel (or three) on the angst of the aging male animal....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2015","Feb 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/703163.Exit_Ghost

Despite being raised by his mother, he is drawn to his father’s faith and is schooled by the shadowy imam Sheikh Rashid to follow the Straight Path of restraint and prayer instead of the Yellow Brick Road of Consumerism. His life’s trajectory seems to be heading towards committing the ultimate act of terrorism against his country and this is where Updike is scary, for he posits that those on this path are destined to harm us without having any triggering events to precipitate that behaviour.Ahmad’s foil is his aging Jewish career counsellor, Levy, who feels that at 62 his life purpose is over. Levy hates his job of trying to steer kids in low income neighbourhoods with zero career prospects, thanks to the stranglehold on America by large corporations and the “one percent.” Levy is drawn to Ahmad, trying to head him off from the extreme course he is on, and winds up having an affair with the boy’s earthy and free spirited mother. The creeping plot then takes on a Graham Greene-esque turn when Ahmad is introduced to the “job” he has to undertake as part of the path he has chosen; of course unexpected twists take place to make this obvious outcome a bit more interesting and thought-provoking.Along the way, Updike makes observations on our current Western society: “Affordable houses are dwindling in size, like pieces of paper repeatedly folded,” “America is paved solid with fat and tar.” Westerners push sex because it means liquor and flowers for dating, weddings, houses, baby goods, education etc., - i.e. Consumption! Christian fundamentalist preachers are equally rabble rousing as radicalized imams. Hispanics and blacks dominate the security forces that are multiplying due to the terrorism threat, giving birth to a new power order. Open society is defenceless against the forces of terror, for to close the gates would be to deny its very openness. By far his most searing observation is to note that George Washington’s ragtag band of guerillas fighting the British during the War of Independence was no different from the Iraqi and Vietnamese guerillas fighting the American invasions.And yet, despite the rich amount of social commentary, this is a very interior book, for we are constantly inside the heads of Ahmad and Levy; there are excessive descriptions of streetscapes and a long lesson on Islam with quoted passages from its holy books which I thought unnecessary for the purpose of the novel. For those who enjoy complex sentences, this is a good primer.At the end of the day, Updike forces us to face the fundamental question: will an American born and bred kid, despite his brainwashing to the contrary, press the button that will harm his country? As a patriotic American, we suspect the direction in which the author will lean, despite some of the shocking real-life evidence we have seen to the contrary since the book’s publication in 2006. And that is an answer well worth waiting to find out, as Ahmad and Levy edge their truck through slow-moving traffic towards the Lincoln Tunnel... ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 05, 2015","Feb 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11657.Terrorist

And Oz wrote this novel in a female protagonist’s voice when he was 26, and as he got older (and wiser) swore that he would never attempt that again. And yet Hanna Gonen took on a life of her own for him as he wrote this novel in a cramped toilet after work over several months while his wife and child slept adjacent in the one bedroom flat they lived in at the time.Hanna meets Michael while both are in university in Jerusalem in 1950, she studying literature and he studying geology. She is the imaginative one, living in her fantasies of adventure in foreign lands with her twin Arab friends while Michael is the boring realist relying on logic. Opposites attract and they marry, and Hanna gives up her studies to play housewife and support Michael in his career. Michael’s career is important to everyone in his family as he is the sole surviving progeny of his father and his father’s three sisters, and much money and effort has been invested in Michael’s education – Hanna must respect and honor this commitment. They have a son almost immediately upon getting married and Hanna is relegated to housework, child-minding, and husband-supporting, while nursing thoughts of a more dramatic life in her imagination, even straying towards having sexual thoughts towards a 17 year old neighbour whom she is helping with his literature studies. To add to her woes their son also turns out like Michael, lacking in empathy and ruled by black and white logic.Nothing much happens in this novel except for typical scenes of domestic life in an insular community, and many chapters begin with “the dreary sameness of the days....” Michael is conscripted into the army to fight in the 1956 war against the Arab states arraigned against the fledgling state of Israel, and this event produces some tension within the family unit. We are not introduced to any war scenes except to hear the news of what’s going on via third and fourth-hand stories from the battlefront that reach Hanna. It is her reactions to the conflict and the threat it poses to her family that we experience.When Hanna becomes pregnant for the second time after a 10-year gap, she begins to harbour feelings of jealousy towards her husband who is moving forward in his career and teaching younger women in private, while her own body goes out of shape and another painful pregnancy is all that lies before her. Hanna retreats into her private world of fantasy, inventing characters in her mind to wreak revenge on those who have consigned her to this state, and we suspect that her Michael is not being spared either. This is a pre second wave-feminist novel, and its timing must have been perfect at the time, for the issues of woman and family, and woman and career play out strongly under the otherwise slow-paced account of a young family going about its daily life in an emerging nation state. The redeeming quality of imagination and art to transcend an unhappy reality, a gift bestowed upon the artist and not on the realist, is brought into focus. In the end, Hanna is the real hero, unlike her unimaginative husband, and is able to add colour to her dull life, while Michael has to seek validation by piling on academic honours, all of which are destined to be invalidated with each successive wave of scientific discovery....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2015","Jan 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/65261.My_Michael

There are many observations, too numerous to list, but let me at least try to hit on the points that struck me – they may strike you too, enough to want to read this book, even out of mere curiosity:1)	The reader is influenced by which major league sports team is featured in a book – in the case of our author, the NY Yankees are out and the Mets are in as the latter is a downtrodden, downscale and Democratic team.2)	Books written by journalists are suspect for they tend to be front-loaded (i.e. the story is in the first few chapters – like the headlines), the rest is fluff.3)	Deplores the principle used by libraries in culling books – if they haven’t been checked out for a few years, out they go, despite some being classics written by the greats such as Godimer, Lessing or Grass.4)	Dislikes reading guides for book clubs that are usually found at the end of a book, because a book is an argument between a writer and a reader that the latter can never hope to win; and book clubs seek unanimity while good books “invite discord, mayhem, knife fights and blood feuds.”5)	Likes the author who is always writing the same book with every new release.6)	Loves bricks and mortar bookstores. Dislikes e-books.7)	Agrees that bad books have a place in our lives for they keep our brains active. And crummy books will begat more crummy books.8)	Agrees that covers sell books.9)	Prefers John Updike as an art critic and not a writer.10)	Calls book critics servile muttonheads, and blurbs are written by “liars and sycophants to advance the careers of bozos and sluts.” The pet word used in the modern  (copied by those aforementioned sycophants lest they do not get paid) is “astonishing,” a word sanctioned by the National Academy of the Arts. Great words invented by him to label the sycophants are fawnatisti and blurburistas.11)	 The French idolize writers like the Americans idolize switch hitters, and yet you don’t need fancy locales to write – writers are writing in their heads not in Paris or London.12)	Edgar Allan Poe seems to have a lot of museums attached to his name despite having a relatively small oeuvre, and dying young, destitute and drunk.13)	 Mark Twain’s house is dark and depressing for such a humorous writer.14)	 Despite all the mayhem associated with the new Scandinavian crime genre, Stockholm is a rather boring city, not a scary place.15)	A reading life is an adventure without maps where you meet unexpected soul-mates along the way.16)	The reason the average American reads no more than 4 books a year is due to the emotional trauma experienced at the age of 14 while trying to hack through Wuthering Heights.17)	Realizes that outgrowing one’s famous writers is also a reality – he has since bid goodbye to John Cheever, Henry Miller and Henning Mankel.18)	Famous quotes for the next generations: “If you want to leave your kids well fixed up for life – leave them with books” – a friend. Conversely, Jane Smiley’s quote – ”I have given my children the two cruelest gifts: the experience of perfect family happiness, and the certain knowledge that it will not last,”– has an ominous ring.19)	Reading may make you smarter than other people but it will not make you better. And if you don’t get into the hang of reading when you are young you will never get the hang of it.20)	 Reading is like Christianity – it offers an uplifting alternative to living life on this planet.Queenan read books to escape an abusive and alcoholic father who was a 9th grade dropout; he wanted to be superior to his father.

The reality part starts by Ellis recounting his evolution as a writer: his early success at 21 while still in college with his debut novel Less than Zero, the celebrity life in the Brat Pack of the literary elite in New York fuelled by powerful drugs and lots of sex with males and females alike, the controversial publication of his third novel, American Psycho, that took him to new heights of fame and controversy but also to the lower depths of the drug culture and to the blunting of his creative genius. Reality then gives way to a fictitious memoir in which Ellis is in a battle to save his family from a serial killer who is out to get him and his family. Lunar Park is thus focused the rebirth of the literary brainiac, Ellis, and is a blend of fact and fiction, dwelling on the unabashed revelations of self destruction wrought by one to whom much was given.In this novel, Ellis is married to a celebrity movie star wife (the fiction), with two kids (one his own and the other his wife’s from another man). He is trying desperately to be the good dad that his own father was not. And yet his bid to stay clean of drugs unravels and strange happenings start occurring around his family: a man who resembles Patrick Bateman of American Psycho starts re-appearing, the car his dead father drove keeps popping up in the most unexpected places, teenagers from the area are disappearing, and a serial killer is killing people off in a copy-cat style to what was written in the first draft of American Psycho, a version known only to Ellis. It’s like the publisher said, “Bring it on, man – let’s have a real cross-genre novel here – let’s have a dysfunctional family story with a shot of horror, a touch of the supernatural, a boat load of drugs, a hint of murder, and let’s give the reader an experience akin to bopping in and out of a hallucinatory drug trip.” Plot notwithstanding, and the plot harkens to a Stephen King novel, the larger commentary of the book is on the neuroses of the rich and famous, where kids are in therapy by the age of six, where they are fed uppers and downers ad nauseam, and the mark of their generation is a perennial tremor in the hands. The adults are no better, guzzling drugs by the bucket load. Ellis cranks up the pace from a rather languorous start with a lot of back story (on himself) to a thriller laced with short sentences, dreams punctuated with reality, horror mixed with humour, until we are confronted with the real bad guys, all of whom live in Ellis’ head and in his past.I found the weaving of fact and fiction into the novel interesting and was left with the question of how much of oneself does a novelist have to inject into his work before he himself becomes a parody? The other question I had was how much drugs and alcohol did Ellis actually imbibe in order to be still coherent enough to write this well-plotted story? Or did he, being a celebrity writer, have an army of script doctors and nurses around to help him?

Mr. Hosokawa has no such intentions and is only present because Roxanne Coss, a famed opera soprano, is performing in his honour; he has being arranging his business meetings around the world to coincide with her concerts as she is the ultimate in music to him. After the rebels occupy the house, the standoff begins with only the able-bodied male guests and Ms. Coss being held back by the revolutionaries; the others are set free in exchange for various demands that mostly go unfulfilled by an uncompromising government led by President Masuda (ironically, Peru also had a president of Japanese origin at the time: Alberto Fujimori). Communication between this motley cast of characters left behind in the villa, that speak a multiplicity of languages, falls upon Gen, Hosakawa’s translator.As monotonous days flow into weeks and months, the roles of captor and captive begin to blur, new relationships form while others deteriorate, and discipline becomes lax. Hosokawa falls in love with Roxanne; Gen falls in love with one of the revolutionaries, Carmen, as he teaches her Spanish and English inside a pantry cupboard; the generals among the rebels fall to the charms of TV and chess, the soldiers take up soccer in the yard, the Frenchman Thibault cooks for the residents and the Vice President becomes housekeeper. However, it is Roxanne who dominates everyone when she starts practicing her scales every morning; the role of captor and captive invert, for she captivates everyone, including the generals. And when the revolutionary Cesar imitates (and surpasses) Roxanne with his a capella renditions of the operas she is practising, we know that art has subdued violence, and is a more potent force for change. Even the continuous chants of the police outside the gates, shouting, “Surrender,” “Hopeless,” and “Will Not Negotiate” only serve as background music to the developments inside the villa. The omniscient narrator is effective in working like a conductor with his orchestra, bringing up certain instruments when needed before moving onto others. In fact, the entire story proceeds this way, as we move within the claustrophobic setting of a suburban villa and bop in and out of the heads of the main players assembled within its walls. There are often dead spells, when there is little movement, interspersed with occasional crescendos, before we are thrown into the maelstrom of the tragic finale. Only the emaciated bearing of negotiator Mesner foreshadows how everything will end, while the hostages and captors continue to enjoy a harmonious, albeit restricted life. My one beef about this existence is the absence of greed, petty jealousies and political posturing that usually accompany those who live with slim pickings; everyone gets on so swimmingly that I wondered whether this was naivety on the part of the author or deliberately introduced to establish that we can get along with each other despite our differences.What is obvious is that revolution will not breed if people have education, basic comforts and the ability to realize their ambitions, as we see with Carmen learning languages, Cesar learning music, Ismael learning chess, the generals hogging the TV, the Russian Fyoderov and the rebel soldiers having the opportunity to exercise in the yard, and everyone having a great house to live in and a plentiful supply of food for free. Yet, people having a lot of time on their hands and facing the prospect of death reflect on the things they did not do in their lives: Hosokawa regrets not having learned languages, especially English, so that he could tell Roxanne he loves her without relying on a translator; Mendoza wishes he’d made love to more women; Roxanne wishes she had learned how to enjoy life.The postscript of this story comes as a bit of surprise for the tragedy spawns a new and unexpected relationship. It is as if the new lovers are marrying in order to keep alive the memory of those they really loved and lost in the storming of the villa by government troops. It reminded me of the conductor ending his beautiful song, his bel canto, on a suspended note to remind as that art, like life, can be incomplete. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 21, 2014","Dec 21, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

Jack Delaney, an ex-con working for his brother-in-law in a funeral parlour, meets Lucy the ex-nun who dreams of having a showdown on the street with the Contra leaders and stealing their ill gotten gains to build a leper hospital in Nicaragua. Their associates in the heist are Rick, a Robin Hood type cop who once landed in jail for his borderline actions, and Cully, a bank-robber who is just out after 27 years and is desperate to get laid in case he winds up in the can again after another botched “job” and has to endure a libido diet for a further 27 years. Arraigned against them are the bad guys: Dagoberto (Bertie), the Contra chief who is in the USA to fundraise for his cause and has the blessing of President Reagan and the US establishment, and his two Latino henchmen. Leonard throws in the CIA and IRA to add flavour, and convolutes the plot in unpredictable directions. He also creates an unforgettable character in Franklin de Dios, Bertie’s half-Indian terminator, who is very composed whenever he encounters his opponents, whether it’s just after he has killed someone or when facing death himself, and greets them with a polite “How you doing?”Social prejudices and political issues are exposed amidst the humour and mayhem: “Leprosy comes from coloured people,” and “In rich countries, the rich get robbed, in poor countries, the poor get robbed.” The characters have depth unlike in traditional crime entertainment novels: Lucy explores her reasons for joining and leaving the nunnery, and Jake attains St. Francis of Assisi like status with his desire not to kill the enemies but to bring them into the fold even at the risk to his own life. And the comedic situations are hilarious: two burglars surprise each other by entering the same room at the same time on the same mission, Cully makes love to a deaf woman and is arrested for stealing her hearing aid, and Rick calls the bluff of an ex-nun with a shoulder gun and learns a painful lesson. And yet the narrative is uneven and jerky, and back story is filled in with voluminous paragraphs of dialogue which starts to sound formulaic after awhile. That is why I would refrain from conferring the title of America’s greatest novelist on Leonard, although he is a very entertaining and engaging one and someone who has definitely shaped the crime noir genre with his vast oeuvre....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 16, 2014","Dec 16, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/288992.Bandits

Unlike the novel, which takes a longer time to make its mark, this verse version gets right to the point – the central event – an adulterous affair between a family man and a lesbian, and the tragic fallout. But this is also where Dante leaves and Shakespeare takes over, bringing key themes from his sonnets into the cantos: the brevity of life, the transience of beauty and the trappings of desire; and, like in all of the Bard’s tragedies, littering the stage with bodies at curtain call. The emotions expressed and explored in Love Triangle rage back and forth across all affected parties, and the form allows for this jumping around, and also accommodates the melodramatic ending with its lyrical verse, something the novel needs a lot more play and objectivity to unravel. The verse version cuts out a lot of non-essential characters and scenes from the novel, and is a gripping read. On the debit side, the search for words that rhyme can sometimes provide levity where it is uncalled for, and, I feel, the form boxes the novelist in.In the second part, the Sonnets, Antao outdoes Shakespeare by writing 160 of them to the Bard’s 154. In these sonnets, Shakespeare departs and Dante takes over, and Antao roams not the other-worlds but our present one: from Goa to Italy, to France to North America; he explores famous personalities like the Pope, Mother Teresa and the Impressionist Painters to not-so-famous ones like personal friends and mentors, and he reserves a section to honour his Italian mother-in-law by titling her the Princess of Pachino. This second part of the book could have been assembled better for it follows no particular order, and scenes from Toronto suddenly appear next to ones in Goa, and then we jump to Las Vegas and on to Winnipeg and back to the Pyrenees, a Dante on steroids, indeed! I would have liked to have seen distinct sections on People (all those mentioned above and more), Places (separated between North American and European locales) and Home (Goa). For it is in the Goan sections that Antao comes into his own. Given that these sonnets, each comprising 14 lines of rhyming verse, cannot go further than to record an observation, an impression, a background, or a feeling about the subject, in the Goan pieces Antao does more and reveals the character and psyche of Goa. He outlines how Goans (and writers!) drink, why they migrate, why they gamble; he portrays funeral ceremonies and wedding ceremonies, snake charmers and toddy tappers, the markets of Margao, the rains where grasshoppers among folks rush to the mill to get the paddy dehusked, fishing in Nuem, the sumptuous food, and the language of his homeland – a rich cultural portrait of a once Portuguese colony now being encircled and subsumed by Mother India.Antao has lived a rich life, much of which he has chronicled in his past work, be they novels, short stories, memoirs and travelogues. Now he has sat back to take that body of work and add music to it and convert his art to a higher form, the one closest to the gods, they say: poetry.

All the birds and turtles have left Samaritan Bay as a result of this environmental calamity. And yet he has to wait until the tide rises higher to succeed in his mission. In the meantime, he comes across a motley band of survivors who give him a reason to reconsider his decision: Crisp the archaic-tongued philosopher who knows the history of the place, Mara who is painting the images of dead people in order to recapture what existed before the fateful event, Soldier the dog who follows Gabriel faithfully, Sonny the boy who is building a tower on the beach to bring the sea creatures back, and the mysterious sea people who keep coming out of the waves and disappearing.On the other side of the country, Gabriel’s boss, Dorian, the CEO of Domidion, the company responsible for the defoliant, peregrinates through his empty life, heading off other environmental disasters caused by the company, shopping extravagantly to justify his wealth, roaming the streets at night to discover himself, looking for the perfect condominium investment, and trying to find out why his wife is intent on divorcing him.Between these circular perambulations, King gets to make comments on the ills facing our industrialized society: “agricultural research pursued for profit leads to environmental disaster,” “there are too many rich and poor” (i.e. the hollowing out of the middle class), “capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,” “we need more guns, not less,”“a lie oft repeated becomes a truth,” and “democracy offers its enemies a means of destroying it.”But natural evolution trumps human-induced disaster and the turtles start returning to the island, along with all those who had fled. Even the defoliant carrying vessel makes a re-appearance on Samaritan Bay before breaking adrift and heading back from whence it had come. The mystery of the sea people is solved, and Gabriel discovers that sleeping with a woman is not that bad an experience, while his boss finds out that sleeping alone is the best course open to him.I found the characters enjoyable, even Dorian is charming in his way, and I did not mind spending time with them in this rather slow-paced novel that moves through all the principal characters’ POV in circular fashion. Just as I finished reading, I read in the newspaper that the author had won the Governor General’s Award for Fiction for this novel, and I thought that this was astute upon the part of the judges to highlight a book that brings most of our current political pre-occupations to the forefront and addresses them in a non-didactic fashion: the harsh treatment of native populations, the pollution of the environment, corporate greed, and the silencing of the scientific community.

This community is bitterly divided but integrated for some Protestants have crossed the line and married into the Catholics, creating a love-hate relationship between the two solitudes. Then a whale disgorges a man, aptly named Judah (for Judas and Jonah), who is found to be alive, and things change. Judah stinks of fish and is blamed for the failure of the last few fishing seasons in the community; he is taken out to be thrown back into the sea when he starts catching boatloads of cod and suddenly becomes a bit of a messiah who can turn the metaphorical water into wine. What follows is a tale of incredible happenings full of eccentric characters in this insular society that hovers on the edge of starvation and bankruptcy: renegade Catholic Father Phelan who makes love to Mrs. Gallery while her “ghost” husband watches; Judah married off to a young Catholic girl in his cell so that his life will be spared; Protestant Absalom having sex with Catholic Mary Tryphena on the kitchen table while the latter is visiting to deliver his wife’s baby; Kerrivan’s Tree, where the sick are brought for healing, although the tree bears no fruit; Patrick, son of Mary Tryphena, salvaging books from a shipwreck so that he can educate himself and rise above his station; the situations and vignettes go on unendingly, perhaps prompting the title of the book.Told in two parts, two generations apart, the problem this novel runs into is that there are so many characters and so many incidents. Even though the author provides us a family tree to help connect the players, and the first part of the book benefits from this frame, the second part gets lost for the characters just overwhelm you (in the second part you are dealing not only with a fresh set of faces but the older survivors from Part 1). I think the author was setting out to give us a snapshot of Newfoundland before it joined Confederation, and he succeeds in painting an impoverished, insular, superstitious and medieval society that looked to England for everything, including jobs for its more promising progeny and spouses for eligible children; a society in which life was never certain and where death arrived due to a lost fishing season, or during a drunken confrontation between Catholic and Protestant, or in shipwreck while crossing the Atlantic, or while seal hunting; a society of hardy souls that could be weakened but never destroyed. The exploitation by the Protestant rich leads to the rise of the trade union movement among the fishermen, and for a period during the turn of the century there is competition between the two. However, human nature being what it is, power corrupts and the movement implodes when it throws its support behind the Conscription Act at the dawn of WW1.I read this book for the rich insight into the history of Newfoundland that it provided me. The incidents galore looked like a catalogue of real events that the author had compiled over the course of the Rock’s history and fictionalized to protect the innocent. Given the vast cast however, it was difficult to get a deeper insight into the characters. I wondered whether there were two books here; each part developed a bit deeper could have provided for that. And when we “return to the whale” at the culmination of the book, I wondered whether the author was burying this society and saying that the Newfoundland of today is a totally different to the one contained inside these pages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2014","Nov 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6276276-galore

I read other s in this forum before writing this one and the platitudes for this book are glowing. And yet we need to ask the tough questions, despite people’s origins and sensibilities, if we are to mine gems from amidst the oceans of literary flotsam out today. What follows is therefore one reader’s opinion, mine, and many may not agree with me.First off, I was underwhelmed by the pace of this novel, slow moving and circular, lacking in narrative thrust until about page 150 when the bear is shot; and you’ll have to wait much longer until the protagonists finally make love with their respective partners. I wondered why the story of Annie, the fashion model, was woven into the one of Will, the bush pilot. Will’s story is good in itself and is the one that interests me the most for it has echoes of Three Day Road, the book that first enamoured me to Boyden. Was Annie introduced to draw female readers, and was she taken to New York to include that larger southern market? A girl from the bush who traps animals for a living suddenly hitting the high spots of the fashion world in the Big Apple seems a bit far- fetched to me. Will’s and Annie’s could not be two more disparate story lines trying hard to meet, just like the two of them struggling to communicate with each other in the hospital.The coma-ridden uncle, Will, and the niece returned from her adventures abroad, Annie, are only able to talk to each other through the voices inside their heads, an interesting device; and there are many such examples of unarticulated voices: Gordon (the mute protector) of Annie, Suzanne (the missing sister) of Annie, and Soleil (the fashionista godmother) of Annie.The use of the vernacular to emulate the voices of Will and Annie, who narrate their alternating chapters in first person, masks the elegance of language I know Boyden is capable of. Once, I found the word “them” used seven times in three consecutive short paragraphs!On the credit side, I found the sections of Will fighting his addiction, flying and crashing his plane several times, enduring the hurts of unkind humans, showing kindness to wild animals, suffering the guilt for losing his family, and living off the land in hostile weather to be revealing and inspirational. The mute Gordon also emerges as a strong character, a kind of Chief Broom from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. As a tale for showing that the back-to-the-land life in the bush, despite its hardships, works better than the artificial high-life of big cities, this novel hits the mark. The New York (and Montreal) scenes are also amateurishly delivered to drive the point home; Soleil’s “pussy posse” comes across as a bunch of cardboard cut-outs. But then so does the brain-dead and inept Marius, who tries several times to bump off Will and Co.Will Bird remains the one redeeming force in the novel that kept me reading until the end, and I hope he returns, alone, for a repeat engagement in a future novel.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Nov 2014,"Nov 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3479967-through-black-spruce

As I progressed through the novel I got the impression that there was more than a mad (she is schizophrenic) wife here, that all these flawed characters were quite mad in their own ways, physically, emotionally, sexually and legally. Yehoshua experiments with a variety of styles to deliver the voices: sentences without punctuation, sentences with some punctuation, one-sided dialogue, poetic monologues, dialogue-only chapters, and “straight” narrative just when you think you are going off the edge yourself. The varying degrees of freneticism, the sweating of the small stuff, the obsessions and the guilt are sharply drawn, and the nine different angles gives this story depth beyond what one expects.There is also a strong indictment of the one who not only deserts his spouse but also leaves the Promised Land. Yehuda, abandons his mentally ill wife and grown-up family in Israel and takes up with a much younger woman in America and is about to have a child with her, and his behaviour raises conflicted feelings among his adult children, grandchildren and children-in-law. Asi, the intellectual and sterile son, hates his father (probably for Dad’s fertility) while his wife Dina is attracted to the old man, Tsvi the other son is out to swindle Daddy, and Ya’el, the faithful daughter, is killing her father because she does not offer an opinion, while the jester in the family, Kedmi, the lawyer husband of Ya’el, is trying to profit from the divorce. Only Naomi, the mad wife, withholds judgement and longs to be forgiven for letting the other voice in her head take over and wield the knife on that pivotal day that split the family apart. Yehuda himself is a self-pitying drama king, who is willing to bare his chest and reveal his wound to any stranger. And as we all know, there is no real return for those who flee the coup, even though reparations are made, and Yehuda’s battle to jettison his “baggage” and retain a hold on his homeland leads to his unravelling.The land of Israel also reveals itself to us as the family moves between Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, each city distinct in its topography and climate, coming across as an undefined land, a melting pot of many cultures, fears, and ideas, glued only by the Jewish tradition and the threat of attack from the outside world. This is a strong character story and a good model to demonstrate writing style and versatility.

I decided that he had done the latter, although at times I was sorely tempted to dismiss this book as belonging to the first two muddled pathways.Simon (Joseph) is a surrogate dad constantly denying being a real father, Ines (Mary) is a novice mother (also a virgin perhaps, given Novilla’s dislike for sexual matters) who spoils her child, and David (Jesus) has his own vision of the world and shrugs off all man-made order (numbers, letters and other laws of the universe), demands followership, and is a petulant child with the most annoying questions and logic. And the crazy Daga plays the tempting Devil with a twist. But that is where the parallel ends. The setting, Novilla, is a cross between a socialist state with a few pockets of capitalism and an emotional desert, where everyone is polite and benevolent but devoid of desire – certainly not Roman Judea. Everyone’s past is supposed to have been swept clean before they arrived at Novilla. Technology is abhorred and manual labour is prized. Into this half-world, the author drops his philosophical questions, which seem to be the driving motives for writing this novel:1)	Desire or “We all want more than we are worth” vs. Benevolence or “There is always money in the moneybox”2)	The primacy of the personal vs. the universal – which takes precedence?3)	We each view the world differently – Don Quixote’s world view vs. Sancho Panza’s4)	Intuition vs. Common Sense5)	Gaps vs. Cracks6)	Working to live (labourer) vs. living to create something beyond one’s self (artist)And like the citizens at the ancient Roman Forum, the workers of Novilla spend much time discussing these questions in lines of dialogue that read like long speeches. I’m sure the Biblical narrative would not have tolerated Coetzee’s portrayal of beauty being only skin deep when the author has Simon go wading through Ines’s blocked toilet, up to his elbows in shit, to unplug a carelessly flushed sanitary pad. Point made! The “rats in the storehouse” scene is another powerful metaphor for the universal truth: “where there is food, there will be vermin.” And yet the parallels to the life of Jesus come up sharply towards the end when Simon, David, and Ines are forced to leave their new homeland and flee to lands further, and David orders people they meet along the way to drop everything and follow him. Those who are settled in life (Diego, the innkeeper, and the doctor) do not, while those who are seeking answers, like his adoptive parents, and the hitchhiker Juan, do.  I think Coetzee is at a point in his career where he does not have to tie every conflict with a neat ribbon at the end, and if we don’t get everything – well, so be it. Readers are left free to find their own pathways. And so like the workers of Novilla, or the citizens of Ancient Rome, we are left to debate the merits of this book long after we finish reading it, and try to figure out which of those three routes I mentioned at the outset the author has really taken....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2014","Oct 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15799416-the-childhood-of-jesus

The king is always busy and business meetings fall off the agenda, and so our hero waits and loses more sleep, and meets various expats and locals who, like him, are also waiting, looking for purpose in their lives.During his wait, and with the aid of bootleg siddiqi to loosen the clogs of memory, Alan re-lives his past, especially his career as a manufacturer in the US, who went looking for the lowest cost provider and ended up gutting his company and his industry when his outsourced vendors learned everything from him and got into the same game at a lower price - a stark indictment of globalization and its impact on the West. Expat life is also under the microscope. People will do anything to be touched in a country where most body parts have to remain covered, and where the free mingling of the sexes is disallowed. People will even stab themselves to feel pain in this sterile environment, or go dune buggy racing. Twenty-something workers have lost all need for social intercourse for all they do is play video games and sleep when they aren’t working. The extremes of wealth and poverty in the Kingdom are exposed when we are invited to the fifth floor of a new condo building that has every modern convenience (including brand name alcohol) and where its inhabitants possess fancy yachts, while a just few floors below 25 Asian migrant workers are fighting over a discarded cell phone. While the issues raised are of interest, the delivery disappointed me. I do not like the way in which the dialogue is presented, prefaced by dashes – in places, the author forgets whether he is writing narrative or dialogue. And the timing...I recall my writing instructor warning me never to introduce a primary character in the latter part of the book, and yet Dr. Zahra, Alan’s love interest, emerges only in the last 30 pages. And the ending, well much has been written about the flat ending to warrant not dwelling on it.I’d like to think that as he wrote this book, Eggers was saying to himself, “Let me break the rules of the novel; after all, I’ve broken the rules of publishing so far and come out ahead.” This time unfortunately, he does not. Like the well-heeled Saudis and the redundant Americans within these pages, I was left looking for purpose, and found none.

Niagara Falls in the ‘60’s may A tale whose theme is resurgent in this age where industrial pollution and climate change are high on everyone’s mind. Niagara Falls in the ‘60’s may have been the Love Capital of America but it was also the home of Love Canal, the most polluted industrial site that erupted and exposed the evil underbelly of crony capitalism.And yet this novel begins (and ends) as a love story: a young headstrong woman, Ariah Erskine, and her pastor husband who is hiding the secret of his sexuality go to the Falls on their honeymoon like most middle class Americans. Being forced to reveal his secret on their wedding night, the young husband takes his life at the Falls the following morning, thus establishing this modern Wonder of the World as an integral part of the Erskine-Burnaby family, forging character and destroying it. The love story continues with Ariah’s second marriage to Dirk Burnaby, an idealistic lawyer from a local patrician family who takes on the corruption of his friends and gambling buddies when he discovers the level of pollution and the shocking number of deaths being attributed to Love Canal on the outskirts of the Falls. But love is always hard-fought and short-lived in this book, and it is for the progeny of Ariah and Dirk as well, for duty and class often clash, resulting in loss.The novel has a deliberate narrative style, much of it is told. The author takes control by relating the stories of her character’s lives, detailing their inter-relationships, likes and dislikes. Much has been commented on the adjective-heaviness of this tale, and I have to agree, besides the stage directions and back story offered in parentheses is clumsy. And yet Oates is able to speak in the voices of her characters, forsaking proper grammar if and when needed. One is often forced to decide whether this is a generational story, a love story, or a tale of political intrigue, because all three themes interweave throughout the novel but take centre stage individually at times. The women are strong willed, hard-hearted, and even cruel: Claudine, the mother in law, is the classic upper-class bitch, Candace blackmails Ariah’s son Royall to marry her by pretending to be pregnant, and the “Woman in Black” artfully seduces her men across the generations. Ariah herself emerges as a proud, dominating figure, unrelenting despite losing both husbands to the Falls. The men, by contrast, are weak, idealistic and prone to tragedy: Rev. Erskine and Dirk Burnaby, Ariah’s son Chandler who puts himself in harm’s way during hostage negotiations, and Dirk’s nemesis, his uncle, who walked the Falls on a tightrope. Perhaps the Falls, Love Canal and the Woman in Black are intended as metaphors for death that stalks this multi-generational family. It is only in Aria’s daughter Julia and her reticent boyfriend Stonecrop that we see the roles reversed between weakness and strength. The ending is a bit of a fizzle, an overdone tribute to Dirk Burnaby after the Love Canal lawsuit is finally settled. And yet I enjoyed this book for its bold indictment of capitalism taken to ridiculous lengths in a developed country, and for its depiction of the lives of the social classes in Niagara Falls. Living close to the Falls myself (on the Canadian side, which gets scarcely a mention, other than for an admission by the author that the Horseshoe Falls provides a better view – and I agree!), I have a deep interest in this magical location’s allure, history and myth.

Told in multiple stream-of-consciousness voices, we get an interior story and a lesson on what leads to murder in a small town. The victim may be rescued, but she is left alienated, just as her oppressors once were, while the rest of the town goes back to its interrupted life. “Beersheba” tells of another crazy woman and her lustful step-father playing out the aftermath of childhood abuse; it is hard to feel sympathy for either of them.Three stories, “Nobody Knows My Name,” “Fossil Figures,” and “Death Cup,” deal with sibling rivalry. The first story is between a 9-year old girl, her baby sister and a mysterious thistledown cat, the latter more imagined than real; the second deals with fraternal twins where the best genes flowed into one while leaving the other a husk at birth, and yet the emotional bonds forged in the womb overcome mortal circumstances that divide them; the third, also involving twins, takes sibling rivalry to the point of murder.“Helping Hands” deals with a widow’s loss and her urgent need to replace the dead husband with anyone who will pay her some attention, even if it’s of the wrong kind. Contrasting her loneliness is the alienation of the injured young war vet who is out to take back what society has robbed of him – a dangerous liaison. The dinner scene where Nicholas, the vet, reveals his feelings, is effectively rendered: unorthodox, powerful fragments dropped on paper.The final story, “A Hole in the Head,” is an indictment of the rich and bored in American society, and of the “service providers” who leech off them. Like with “Helping Hands,” the reader is left to write his own ending to this story.The financial collapse of 2008 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq feature as constant backdrops to these stories, all condemned for being mindless and wasteful ventures.The writing style is unconventional for such a middle class milieu. I detected weak editing and proofing, and strange punctuation, but if the net result is that the voices of these bizarre characters come out more distinctly, then the author succeeds brilliantly (and damn the grammarians!)

In these nine long stories, using a technique that makesSolzhenitsyn returns to his familiar place and time, the Soviet Union between two world wars. In these nine long stories, using a technique that makes two story lines connect (or not), he unravels the ills of communism and it’s legacy, an ideology that held him in its utopian promise during his formative years but later abandoned and punished him as he grew more enlightened.In the title story, a young kulak (a landholding class) who has been rendered destitute by the Reds, writes to a celebrated Soviet writer asking for help and intercession; the writer, who lives in an affluent dacha, responds by remarking to his political buddies on how the language of this kulak mirrors the intensity of the times, he sees art in the situation and not the plight of the poor kulak. The story “Ego” is without hope, for it recounts an ill-fated peasant uprising within the Soviet Union, born of the corruption and ineptness of the Bolsheviks during their early years of rule; when the uprising founders, the leaders are forced to betray the rest of their comrades. In “Nashtenka,” two women bearing the same name are contrasted: one woman becomes a plaything of the bureaucrats in order to survive, the other resists moral decay and attempts to teach her students classic literature over the proletarian myths that have overtaken academia – a daunting task for literature has become subverted; “we don’t value a writer by what or by how he experiences life, but by his role in our proletarian movement.”The stories “Adlig Schwenkitten,” “Zyelyabuga Village,” and “Times of Crisis” seem autobiographical, for they feature historical figures and involve characters mirroring the many roles that Solzhenitsyn played during World War II: commander of an instrument reconnaissance battalion, decorated war veteran, and chronicler of events. They are episodic stories involving military manoeuvres, technology and politics. The price of failure is to be sent to a “punishment battalion,” and you are only as good as your last victory. Stalin, who in real life had Solzhenitsyn committed to eight years of hard labour, is portrayed as a vacillating hypochondriac. The author’s involvement is so intense that in some instances we see him slipping from third person to second person to first person points of view – an editor’s nightmare, no doubt.The last story “No Matter What” didn’t quite connect its binary story lines, but it concludes with the moral that “might is right” under communism, where no matter what wrong decisions the apparatchiks make, as long as they are protected up the chain of command, they will always be in the right. Joining the party was very compelling in those days, for it determined what job you got. And forget about education and landholding – they did not amount to much. Toe the party line, and you would be okay! Seems to happen in Wall St. too!Of all the stories, I found “Fracture Points” the most interesting, for it contrasts an entrepreneurial Communist-era factory boss who becomes an oligarch in the vacuum created during the Soviet Union’s collapse, against the plight of a scientific-minded new-generation Russian who is forced to start a bank (one of the many that started and collapsed in the aftermath of Glasnost and Perestroika) and who is lost; the strong message here is that the new Russia is not a place for the idealistic but only one for old vets who are able to carve out stronger niches for themselves in the confusion of system change. Towards the end of his days, Solzhenitsyn was criticized for being a man out of touch with the times, for being stuck in the time warp between the wars that had moulded his character. And yet, despite the narrative-heavy nature of these stories, and the inconsistencies in craft (blame it on translation!) he does pose interesting questions on humanity that make one pause....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 23, 2014","Aug 23, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10511023-apricot-jam

Reading the diaries of the young Japanese girl, Nao, and her Kamikaze pilot uncle, Haruki I, brings Ruth into a symbiotic and visceral relationship with this girl from another land and another time. Nao, a returning resident to Japan after growing up in Silicon Valley, faces unspeakable cruelty and bullying from her schoolmates and is contemplating suicide; her father, Haruki II, a downsized hi-tech worker and victim of the dot-com meltdown, is on the brink of suicide himself after being unemployed and unable to provide for his family in Japan. Nao finds wisdom with her 104-year-old great grandmother, Jiko, who became a Buddhist nun after her son Haruki I went unhappily to his “noble” death as a suicide pilot in WWII, and who now lives in a remote temple located where the tsunami is set to strike.Many parallels and opposites weave in and out here like waves of the quantum physics theory that is openly postulated in the book: Ruth is Japanese by origin, so is Nao, and both are marooned, Ruth on a remote, storm-ravaged island, and Nao in the harsh neon world of Tokyo; Ruth is struggling to write her mother’s memoir while Nao is constantly attempting to start writing Jiko’s life story; Haruki I was forced to commit suicide, Haruki II is looking at suicide to end his pain and shame; Ruth crosses into Nao’s world in dreams and influences events there, while the Jungle Crow from Japan visits Ruth’s island and leaves revelatory messages; the Internet connects the writing in the diaries in BC with information on its authors back in Japan; fiction and memoir mix, for although Nao may be a fictitious creation of the author, a character named Ruth who is a novelist and Zen adherent and living on a remote BC island is a lot closer to reality.The book touches on Zen, Marine Biology, Japanese culture and literature, the tug-o-war between left and right wing political extremes, and quantum mechanics, some, like the latter, expounded in great detail with appendices for further reading at the end of the novel. Island life in BC, with its frequent storms and power outages, and its insular society where everyone knows everything about everybody else, is well drawn; so is the harsh world of growing up “different” in Japanese society.Given the circular nature of time, or as Jiko says, “Time is being and being is time, then is now and now is then,” we do not expect this story to come to a “and they lived happily ever after” conclusion. Rather we see Ruth and Nao enriched by their exchange across this time and space divide, and looking forward to meeting for the first time in the next wave....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 09, 2014","Aug 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15811545-a-tale-for-the-time-being

He takes on the alias Joseph Anton (after Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekov), goes into hiding under protection of the British Secret Service, and emerges nine years later, alive, more famous, richer in many ways, poorer in others, an icon in a world divided between those who blindly follow and those who question, between religion and secularism.The early chapters of this rather long book provide background on the emerging writer: from his youth in India living with a wealthy but alcoholic father, to his public school years in England where he committed the sins of being foreign, being clever and being bad at sports, to his struggle as an emerging writer seeing contemporaries like Ian McEwen and Martin Amis make it while he struggled, until Midnight’s Children won the Booker. Though conforming to the rules of society, he is a closet rebel even during his formative years; humorous anecdotes about The Gravy Bomber and the Vetoed Footwear colour his university graduation ceremony, where he displays his passive-aggression. History studies at Cambridge and his marginalized life in England lead him to write The Satanic Verses. Satan, according to Rushdie, was the quintessential immigrant, expelled from Heaven and trying to find his place. “Migration plus Metamorphosis equals Immigrant!” But the disclosure of his version of the reality behind the real people in his novel (the role of he-who-questions-the-status-quo) runs afoul of those-who-do-not-want-their-bedrock-disturbed. The rest of the book covers his years in hiding and resembles a daily diary of events, musing, name dropping, justifying and philosophising. It’s tedious and repetitive, just as his long days in captivity (he claims it was captivity of a sort) with four Secret Service agents living in the next room must have been. It appears as if Rushdie wants us to feel his pain, his isolation, his need for validation, and nothing and no one is to be spared their privacy in order for him to achieve that, least of all those close to him, like his four wives. His sons get off lighter; there is actually great warmth flowing between Rushdie and his sons, more than there existed between him and his father, until at least Anis Rushdie’s last days.The fatwa bops around like a yo-yo; being validated one day, then being side-lined, then back in the news, only to be dropped again. But it catches innocent bystanders in its path and people die. One wonders whether Iran and its cronies are playing an unending soccer match vs. the US and its allies, and whether Rushdie is the ball, while hysterical fans are bashing each other in the stands. The fans may get hurt but the ball can’t go out of play - “No Rushdie, no cause.” One can’t help but get the impression that either his assassins are inept or that he is being spared by the powers that be on both sides per my soccer match analogy, because the number of places he is increasingly allowed to travel to, including months in the US without a bodyguard, the public readings and award ceremonies at which he makes surprise appearances, the private parties with the privileged where everyone wants a piece of Rushdie to enhance their own reputation, are rife with opportunities for a “hit.” For a man living in isolation during the fatwa, he enjoys many elevated experiences of ego-stroking, tightly controlled though they may be. The only near-death experience he encounters is a car crash due to careless driving, in which no one is hurt. Perhaps social media and Google Maps not being invented at the time may have also helped.As much as one has to admire his courage to defy the staggering forces arrayed against him (he caves once, when in a political move he recants publishing the Verses, a move he subsequently calls his Mistake) and uphold the freedom of the writer to seek the truth and go to places hitherto unexplored, one also gets the impression that he lacks humility and gratitude, and he gets called out for his shortcomings repeatedly. The Daily Mail newspaper describes him as “bad-mannered, sullen, graceless, silly, curmudgeonly, unattractive, small-minded, arrogant and ego-centric.” And his second wife Marianne says, “You are obsessed with yourself.” Whoa! Talk about the bull goring the man who has just fallen off a tree. But this man has not broken a leg during his fall; he had landed squarely on his feet and is now taking on the bull!The literary community comes across as a protective cocoon, offering him places of refuge (he has to find his own living arrangements, only security is provided at taxpayer cost), taking up his cause to lobby governments, and organizing to publish his future books as the Big Two publishers waffle. And yet his condition and attitude polarizes that community: the ongoing war of letters between Rushdie and John Le Carre makes for interesting reading. There are other letters too, many written by Rushdie to vent his frustration but never mailed. I would think twice before inviting him to dinner; the candid letter he writes to Prime Minister Tony Blair (who is on his side compared to his Conservative predecessors!) after being invited to Downing Street for dinner is pretty rude, although I am not sure the letter was ever mailed – but then Mr. Blair may have yet read the letter when he received his autographed copy of Joseph Anton. Towards the end, with three of his four marriages compromised, four more books published, a child born during the fatwa and the other forged in its cruel shadow, Rushdie emerges triumphant, partly due to his successful lobbying efforts on behalf of freedom of speech, partly due to regime change in the affected countries, and partly due to the world just getting fed up of this neverendum. The security is loosened, the fatwa pales and ends, but the stain remains forever.“To gain immortality you ruin your actual daily life,” seems to hold true here, but one can’t help avoid the impression that unlike his protagonist in the Verses, Saladin Chamcha, who fell out of an aircraft, Rushdie the ego-maniac and supreme risk taker, fell out of Las Vegas, took the gamble of his life, and won. He has now benefited generations of writers who come after him and hold the “Rushdie affair” as a precedent for extending the boundaries of literary exploration beyond The Satanic Verses. And the next time there is a call for a fatwa over a silly storybook, the aggrieved parties may yawn and say, “Nah, been there, done that.

Stamboul TrainGreene’s early “entertainments” were not as fluidly written as his later “catholic” novels, and that is evident when reading this book. Stamboul Train was probably intended as a screenplay, for it unfolds like one, with constant scene shifts, point of view shifts, and movement. The novel moves like the famed train from Ostend through several stops to its final destination in Constantinople. Snatches of dialogue hit the reader like overhead conversations in a dining car. What the camera will not capture however are the interior monologues running through the minds of the characters, which Greene articulates at great length, as they head towards their destiny at the Orient Express’s destination.The characters form a motley crew: Coral, the loose chorus girl in search of love, who believes she has found it in Myatt, the wealthy Jewish businessman on a mission to acquire a new business; Mabel, the alcoholic lesbian journalist, out for a scoop that will double her income so that she can hold onto her young companion Janet; Savory, the novelist (there has to be a novelist in a Greene book) and Opie the priest (there has also got to be a priest); the police chief who is more concerned with the finer things in life (like champagne and caviar) to alleviate his boredom at snow-bound border crossings, and his counterpart the army major who is obsessed with military rules and strategy; Josef, the cat burglar turned murderer, who is seeking infamy; and Dr. Czinner (sinner?), the communist going back to meet his doom in Belgrade. As the train moves forward, from cold weather to even colder weather, breaking down en-route at one point, the characters twine and untwine in shallow relationships with each other (what else can you expect from relationships formed in the isolation and unreality of a three-day train journey?) while dark secrets, prejudices and fears emerge. The only person with a real relationship, and who has a firm grasp of the unreasonableness of the world, seems to be the border guard, Ninitch, who is not on the train, and who regards his wife as the centre of his world.Greene’s lifelong theme that would find more airtime in his later novels—that of the sinner seeking redemption—is at play here, as Dr. Czinner involves the passengers in the drama awaiting him at his destination. And yet, despite the harsh lesson coming out of the climactic episode in Subotica, a transit station near the end of the line, the passengers go back to their lives upon arrival in Constantinople, playing their default roles, dealing in their same shallow games and pretences, as if Czinner and the revolution he had promoted had not existed. Almost like the first coming of Christ to an unready audience.This book would not rank as one of my unforgettable Greene novels, although I could see the emerging novelist grappling with the subject matter that would make him famous later in his career. And even though I got the feel of that trans-European journey, saw the changing landscape outside the window, felt the cold and isolation of the traveller, overheard the conversations of my fellow travellers, and witnessed their shifting allegiances, I never got to see and feel the Orient Express itself. It was almost as if Greene was on that train, spying on its occupants and chronicling their stories, but never once pausing to absorb and appreciate the famous locomotive he was travelling in....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 09, 2014","Jul 24, 2014","Jul 09, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/145039.Stamboul_Train

Only the love of his life, Leora, who faithfully and tragically follows him on his peregrinations to find his place in the world, and who spends hours in his laboratory compiling his tests and making notes, has him pegged: “You are not a booster. You are a lie-hunter, and a hick.” Arrowsmith’s other major influence is his research professor, Gotlieb, a renowned bacteriologist and an irascible seeker of the truth at whatever human cost.The novel is packed with incident and chronicles our hero’s life from his youth, through his university years, to his early life as a physician in mythical mid-western towns such as Wheatsylvania (pop. 367) and Nautilus (pop. 68,000), until he gives up on the role of the healer and follows pure scientific research by joining his former mentor, Gotlieb, in New York City. Arrowsmith’s brief stints and initiatives in public healthcare draw the ire of the private healthcare establishment (many of the protesters are his former frat-buddies), making this a topical book in our modern times of Obama-care. However, the world of research, with its well-stocked labs and laissez faire approach of “tooling around until you hit on something useful, even if it takes you several years,” also starts to show its ugly underbelly when Arrowsmith’s discovery of the X Principle is usurped by another within the international research fraternity.

With hundreds dying by the day, he faces the test of the researcher vs. the healer: does he deliberately keep a control group without giving them the vaccine so that he can document his results accurately, or does he vaccinate everyone and save more lives? His beloved Leora shows him the answer.From the climax in St. Hubert’s (where I thought the novel should have ended) we follow Arrowsmith a bit further to his life of luxury and privilege with a new wife, Joyce, until he faces the next existential decision: does he subside into complaisance and anonymity in Joyce’s world, or does he chuck it all up again and join a renegade research colleague, Terry, in a flea-bitten lab, extending the next frontier of medical research? The narrative style is one of brisk storytelling laced with underlying humour; much happens in the span of a few pages. The medical community, the research community, university life, and small town life are well drawn. People in small towns have “relations” as opposed to “sex” - a word or a line of dialogue explains a lot! There is however, a lot of medical and scientific terminology that can be a bit intimidating to the uninitiated – testament to Lewis’s own life lived within a family of doctors.Yet, despite the rationality of the researcher, Arrowsmith comes across as very human, and is governed by his emotions, making him an engaging character to take this long narrative voyage with. And like an artist, he is totally self-absorbed in his pursuits, until fate intervenes to make him pause and take stock of his humanness....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2014","Jul 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11389.Arrowsmith

It’sI have become increasingly disappointed in reading the posthumous novels of Hemingway: Islands in the Stream, Under Kilimanjaro and now this one. It’s as if the publishers were trying to squeeze every ounce of value from the scraps left behind by this tortured genius who exited the literary scene too early. I am sure Hemingway the perfectionist would have objected to these works being published in the state they were in had he been alive.The Garden of Eden tells the story of a threesome, a newly married couple and a female tourist they pick up in France. David is an emerging author, Catherine is his wife and patron; she is also sexually challenged as she is battling between being a woman and wanting to be a man. Catherine is jealous of David’s success as a writer, in his discipline, and in his masculinity, none of which she possesses. She wants him to chronicle their travels through France and Spain on this trip while he is being drawn towards writing a story about his father and himself hunting a wild elephant in Africa many years ago. There are bedroom scenes where Catherine wants to be the man, and David obliges, but what they do is subjugated to Hemingways’s iceberg theory, where what is said is only the tip of what is happening below – go figure it out. And use plenty of imagination!Enter Marita, a submissive and co-operative companion. Catherine takes Marita as a lover initially, on the premise that “this is one thing I have to do, or live the rest of my life not knowing.” She feels guilt after the act and turns the girl over to David, and when the two of them hit it off, Catherine turns furiously jealous. David initially dislikes having Marita thrown at him but is physically drawn to her and realizes that she has more of his interests at heart; he realizes that Catherine is using them both to realize herself and release her demons.The published part of this manuscript was part of a much larger work, and it shows, for there are many loose ends left to the reader to figure out. The characters themselves are a bunch of fragile, self-indulgent twenty-somethings only concerned with swimming, drinking, eating, taking excursions around the Riviera and into Spain, and sleeping with each other. David writes in the mornings, and seems to be the only one interested in doing some work to keep his growing career on track.The novel is obviously autobiographical, for it covers the period when Hemingway transitioned from his first wife to his second in France, but reading accounts of that affair, the threesome seemed to have been sponsored by Hemingway, not his wife. I wonder if this novel was a way for the famous author to put a new spin on things for the record books and exonerate himself. There are strong parallels between the reality and the fiction, with descriptions of the author’s workroom across the garden, the two way locks in the doors that allowed the lovers access to each other, and the number of books of the author published at the time. Given Hemingway’s style, the sex is implied although the kissing is liberally doled out. You get good primers on martini making, local swimming conditions and the food of the area. The dialogue is rife with trivialities that mask the occasional bursts of anger lurking under the iceberg. The subtext is loaded with seething emotions. And yet, I found that there was not enough to sustain the novel, and the high points were few and far between. When Catherine burns his African story in a fit of anger, David laments the loss of his work, “When it’s right you cannot remember. Every time you read it, it comes as a big surprise,” as if to say that he will never be able to reproduce that story with the same emotional intensity a second time. There is a parallel between that statement and Hemingway’s life; for after such triumphs as For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea and his notable short stories, I wonder whether in his later years, saddled with pain and addled by booze, Hemingway realized that he really would never reach the heights of Kilimanjaro again and these soon-to-be posthumous tomes were mere islands in the stream of what was once a great literary continent gifted to him. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 08, 2014","Jun 18, 2014","Jun 08, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10775.The_Garden_of_Eden

An unknown writer is discovered by American frienMuch has been written about this novel, and about the writing of it, that it is the stuff of legend. An unknown writer is discovered by American friends with literary connections, the manuscript is almost lost en-route to the publisher in New York, the last few chapters are delivered in a breathless gasp in person, and voila: a book is born that touches the heartbeat of a nation, and of the world.If everyone, black and white, in South Africa had developed a similar relationship with each other as the Rev. Kumalo and landowner Jarvis had between them, there would have been no need for the dreaded Apartheid regime that was to follow this book’s publication. Kumalo’s son Absalom leaves his impoverished village to make it in big, bad Johannesburg and ends up killing Jarvis’s son(also living in the city of gold and working for the emancipation of blacks) during a home burglary. And yet, despite this void of loss that adds to the prevailing societal void segregating black from white, the two fathers are able to transcend their differences to work for the good of the little village and to forgive and enlighten each other.This is a novel of voices; the voice of the Zulu in the narrative of Kumalo as he searches for his son in the shanty towns of Johannesburg and witnesses the marginalization of those who flee the village in search of illusory riches; the voices of those very marginalized, as they are led to build shacks on the edge of town; the voices of the police; the voices of the judge and prosecutor who damn Absalom without mercy; the voice of Jarvis as he searches for the message of redemption in this disaster that has befallen his family, and the voice of the intrusive narrator who paints the land for us and sets up each scene in biblical tones.“They are afraid because they are so few,” is Kumalo’s assessment of the white man in South Africa, and yet his son, Absalom, kills out of fear too. In fact, fear is the villain of the piece, dividing white and black. On the other hand, Kumalo’s brother, John, a businessman in Johannesburg, is the embodiment of he who has sold his soul in order to survive and thrive under circumstances in which the tribe and its stabilizing norms have been destroyed and replaced by the survival of the fittest ethic of the big city.Powerful scenes dot the novel: Jarvis and Kumalo sitting in the village church, constantly shifting seats to escape rainwater leaking through the crumbling roof; the planting of the sticks by white and black to build a dam for the betterment of the village; The Bishop suggesting that Kumalo leave his decaying church when the latter’s purpose for being there is just bearing fruit; Kumalo’s disgraced sister Gertrude discussing escape to the nunnery with Absalom’s pregnant wife, another fallen woman; and Kumalo’s trip to the top of the mountain while somewhere else in the country his son is facing the hangman’s noose.The liberation of South Africa’s blacks is still many years away, Kumalo realizes, for he is “the white man’s dog” content with the scraps offered to him, while the next generation, like the agricultural demonstrator, is looking for something more substantial, something that came almost fifty years after this novel was published, and two years after the author’s death. That Apartheid came into being soon after the book was released is an irony; perhaps in some small way the novel contributed to a resurgence of the fear described within its pages, a fear that fed the reviled regime and ran out of steam when noble leaders like Nelson Mandela were able to emulate Jarvis and Kumalo and teach South Africans that forgiveness was the more enduring path to peace. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 29, 2014","Jun 08, 2014","May 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6150.Cry_the_Beloved_Country

His Congo period is Casement’s personal journey into the “Heart of Darkness,” the novel written by contemporary, Joseph Conrad, where he sees first-hand the evils of commercialism and the exploitation of the locals by King Leopold of Belgium, who was granted the land to spread the 3 Cs of Colonization: Christianity, civilization and commerce. Instead we are opened up to a world where the locals signed away their rights to wages, were whipped, mutilated and raped when they did not meet their quotas of rubber harvested in the jungles, and were obliged to feed the foreigners who had brought them this great gift of colonization. Casement’s report on his findings sends shivers up and down the political capitals of Europe, and Leopold loses his grip on his meal-ticket. Casement is acknowledged for his life-risking work by the Crown and sent to the Amazon on a similar investigation of a Peruvian rubber company head-quartered and incorporated in Britain. His findings are no different, worse – there is even murder being committed by company officials in rural Peru. Another report, and the Peruvian Amazon Company goes belly-up, and Sir Roger is made a knight of the realm for services rendered.And yet, there is another struggle going on within this ascetic man: he is strongly attracted towards clandestine assignations with young men, and his exposure to the Congo and the Amazon has only strengthened his conviction that colonial nations can only be free if they violently resist their occupiers – his thoughts in this case turning to his native land, Ireland.The last section of the book focuses on Casement’s ill-fated and ill-timed strategy to align himself with Germany to wage a war on Britain on two fronts, so that Ireland may be liberated. His mission to procure arms and men in Germany to fight the struggle at home, during the period of the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 2016, ends in inevitable disaster. His Black Diaries, the accounts he supposedly kept of his homosexual encounters, were used by his prosecutors to tarnish his reputation at home and abroad. Had he bided his time he may have lived to see the Free Irish State emerge in 1922.There are some poignant scenes in this book, like Sir Roger’s bonding with his jailor who has lost a son in the war, or the two priests who come to keep vigil with him on Death Row. And some heinous ones too, of the kinds of torture inflicted upon Congolese and Amazonians. And of course, there are the secrets of the Black Diaries that Llosa exposes us to, in which events described are considered to be part real and part fictional desire on the part of Sir Roger. “If the ultimate reason for evil in humans is original sin, then why try to fight it?” seems to be the question that permeates the novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 19, 2014","May 29, 2014","May 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12980712-the-dream-of-the-celt

His dream for a united country emerging out of the land he liberated from the Spanish is in tatters, for narrow self-enterests of the rich families in various sectors are agitating to keep it fragmented for posterity.Bolivar is a flawed man, aged beyond his 47 years from the ravages of love and war, a man with boundless mental energy despite his crumbling body, a man who hates to lose even at a game of cards. He never gave of himself to those dear to him, especially to his many lovers, was never injured in the many battles he fought in, always blamed the other for his misfortunes, and wanted sympathy and adulation, despite his claims to the contrary.

On the other side, in Nigeria, we are introduced to three disparate characters: Winston, the scammer who uses internet cafes and a multiple of aliases to con gullible Westerners; Nnamdi, a fisherman thrown out of his livelihood by the indiscriminate drilling for oil in the Niger Delta, and Amina, a Muslim from the north, pregnant and running away to a new life in the oil rich and corrupt south. Ferguson skilfully weaves these disparate story threads to culminate in a thrilling and unexpected ending that is deserving of the novel’s Giller win.The 419 scam itself is simple: pretend that someone wealthy in Nigeria is in trouble and wants to get their money out. The Westerner contacted, volunteers to park the money in his bank account, but then complications arise and a fee for this and a fee for that is required, all to be deducted from the millions that will be coming shortly to his account. The millions never arrive, and the Westerner has to finally mortgage everything to keep paying those final, but final, unexpected fees. The revelation for me was that Nigerians see 419 as a payback for decades of colonial exploitation. Oil, kidnapping and scams drive the economy, and Nigeria is portrayed as a failed state. And yet peculiar codes of conduct prevail: “We who traffic in falsehoods must put a premium on the truth,” says the blood- coughing Eronsi-Egobia, the criminal mastermind who runs the scam artists. And when looked through the eyes of the characters, they seem to be doing no wrong; they are just trying to survive. This common desire for survival also binds them together in strangely distorted relationships.Laura turns forensic detective and uses her editing skills to pore through the e-mail transmissions, looking for sentence patterns, misused words and misplaced punctuation to connect the scammer, the single author, to the multitude of documents received from various government authorities and lawyers that had validated the scam in the eyes of her father and sent him downhill. She is also plagued by guilt that her father was reacting to “the young Nigerian woman in trouble,” out of love for his own daughter. Laura’s guilt finally pushes her to travel to Nigeria to recover the lost money. Her adventures in Lagos however, are a bit hard to believe, but the behaviour of the surrounding cast help to suspend disbelief. Books of this kind are important to raise awareness of the devils dressed in lambs clothing who are afoot in the world.

Zach goes on a hunt around the major book buying cities of the world in search of a final manuscript of the reclusive author that is supposedly lurking somewhere. I got the sense that Davidar was using this vehicle to revisit his own travels around the world and to reminisce about past highpoints, like the Frankfurt Book Fair. The novel starts slow and is told in a traditional story-telling format, developing into an exciting finale that is believable in light of recent events that have taken place in this close-knit industry. What most interested me were the insights that Davidar tosses in liberally:1)	The best chance a writer has is with her debut novel. The work does not have a dispiriting track record to weigh it down.2)	What it takes to excite a publisher: get him reading non-stop. Take him out to a world he didn’t know existed. (I wonder whether that’s why fantasy literature has made such a strong comeback!)3)	The world changed after retailers gained access to accurate sales data.4)	 No one knows what books are going to succeed in the marketplace. Business cases are doctored to acquire a desired work. Income statements are buried once the returns start to come in. (This is no different with any large corporate enterprise where the focus is on the current financial year; past performance is history as they say.)5)	No one edits manuscripts anymore; you just tidy them up for production.6)	“To sink into the voice of a great writer and come up with a faithful but new creation” – a translator’s dream.7)	“The whores go on holiday during the Frankfurt Book Fair, because the publishing folks are fucking each other.” – (talk of an incestuous industry!)8)	The Frankfurt Book Fair is a place where only the VIEW (Very Important Eminent Writers) are tolerated.9)	The “editorial meeting” shows how the writer has absolutely no control of his destiny.10)	 Formats, delivery and pricing may change but the role for the curator of content will always prevail.The last point is Davidar’s claim to the publisher’s continued existence in a changing world. Despite the internet democratizing writing and making everyone a potential writer, he holds out for the middleman who needs to provide order to the flow of literature.The final Ithaca chapter came out of nowhere and did not seem to fit, and like the journeys of Ulysses, I wonder whether Davidar was justifying the return to his homeland, India, as the best option for him and his hero Zach; a publisher’s dream place – to establish himself in what is soon to be (if not already) the largest book reading nation in the world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 30, 2014","Apr 05, 2014","Mar 30, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11406154-ithaca

There are Joycean walks in “The Walking Couple” and “Canadian Experience” where the protagonists walk the streets of Toronto observing life, raising regrets and ruminations in others, and encountering experiences not on their itinerary. And in keeping with the two-country shifts, we are treated to colonial nouns like “consort” and “constitutional” juxtaposed against North Americanism’s like “bum rush,” while the lethal Margarita “gilds her lily.”Antao is bold in bringing politics to the fore without trying to hide the issues behind his fiction; in “The Argument” Sebastian Lobo takes on Kashmir, beggars, unprincipled capitalism, freedom of speech and other blots on Mother India, in an open condemnation, and has to face harassment by Indian immigration officials. In Canada, by contrast, it is the lack of “playing politics” that prevents Vernon Rao, triple degree holder from India, from getting ahead in the public school system. The streets of Goa and Bombay come alive with their crowds, ghosts, class distinctions, smells and food while the barrenness of Toronto, when seen from the struggling, job seeking immigrant’s perspective, is a shocking contrast.The pervading conflict in this collection, which is brought out very effectively in the title story, “The Concubine,” is one between love and generosity of the human spirit against the exigency of feeding the belly, which when taken to extremes succumbs to greed. “Don’t ever fall in love with a man,” concubine Kusum’s mother advises her daughter as she grooms the thirteen year-old to offer sex for money.

What country goes abroad to kidnap foreigners, harvest blood from the dying, conscript its best and brightest (and most beautiful) to the capital Pyongyang from where they will never return, has its sailors tattoo their wives faces across their hearts and then erase them at will, has departments dedicated to torture and interrogation, and decrees that one should not plan for the future because the rulers will provide?One could argue that this novel is Western propaganda, for which westerner could penetrate this secretive state to the level that the author has to write this tale? Johnson admits in a conversation at the back of the book that he did visit the country on an orchestrated tour and that he did not get an opportunity to interact with the locals, and that he had to rely on his imagination a lot. Therefore, take this book with a pinch of salt, engaging though it is.The book comes in two sections: the story of the Orphan Master’s son Jun Do (John Doe?) who is weaned in the tunnels under the DMZ, trained as a kidnapper and schooled in the art of sublimating pain. Rising through the ranks, his reward is to be sent into extinction in prison for a failed operation in the USA. The second section is about a defection of sorts, but into the heart of the communist machine, where our hero is now a celebrated national figure, close to the Dear Leader and married to the national movie star, Sun Moon, herself a plunder from the countryside and built up as a national heroine in the capital. The storyline from then on mirrors the movie Casablanca, where there is escape for some at the expense of those who voluntarily stay behind and make the supreme sacrifice.I found the prose to be uneven, especially in the first section of the book, and many of the North Korean characters speak like Americans: “we were wiped,” “he crossed a line,” and “lucked out.” And yet, the observations from the Communist viewpoint are insightful: “In Pyonyang, you’re only as safe as your last success (sounds a bit like corporate life!),” “the story is more important than the person, and the person has to change to fit the story (another corporate factoid)” “in communism you threaten a dog into obedience, in capitalism you bribe him.” Yes, it’s all a question of perspective: Jun Do finds cheese and butter that is sprinkled liberally on American food to be revolting, while stealing fish eggs, turnips and ginger growing in no-man’s land is a luxury to North Korean prisoners. The scary inversion for me was that when a job is botched, people lie in order to escape punishment, and under extreme stress, they come to believe the lie – it reminded me of those financial scandals in the West that gave birth to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without the torture, that is. And sometimes people are given power and prestige by the Dear Leader, just so that he can crush them all the more by taking them away – not unlike the rags to riches to rags journey in the capitalist world reserved for risk takers.Symbols of freedom weave in and out of the story: the naked American rower singing in the night somewhere in the ocean is a beacon to Jun Do, and even the Dear Leader wants to capture her; freedom from pain comes in going to that “other place” in the mind, a place that Jun Do had frequently visited during his life, especially during his Pain Training period. The real defection to the path of freedom comes from the unnamed interrogator in the second section, a man trained to inflict extreme torture on his “cases” by scientific means, a man living with his blind parents who are scared to talk lest he “tell” on them. This man finally sees through the lie of his existence when confronted with the Jun Do case. But alas that kind of freedom in his country is not to be found in this life.I am sure this book will spawn other stories about repressive regimes, real or fictional, and will be even more bizarre than this one. This wave of literature may even lead to another “spring uprising” in that closed country to the north east. What is not clear to me is that with a system so tightly insulated and isolated as North Korea’s, would we be doing its nationals a service (or a disservice) by suddenly exposing them to the excesses of western society and taking away the high points of their simple lives, like the pleasure taking a walk in the park and smelling the wind, something they are still able to do, and something that our harried western lives might not give them the time to enjoy? ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 07, 2014","Mar 23, 2014","Mar 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11529868-the-orphan-master-s-son

Why?5) Why did the author choose the entire first chapter to talk about how he came to write this book? Was this his way of conveying how intensely personal this book was?

His life has so many layers: journalist, writer, spy, adventurer, frequenter of brothels, Graham Greene is always an intriguing figure to read about. His life has so many layers: journalist, writer, spy, adventurer, frequenter of brothels, leftist, lover, drinker, philosopher and strangely enough, in this book, closet politician. But then all serious writers are closet politicians, or failed ones.This book, written by Bernard Diederich, a correspondent for Time, and an ardent chronicler of Central American politics, and Greene, covers the later years of the famed author’s life, after Greene has declared that he has written his last novel, A Burnt Out Case, and will not be writing novels in future (never trust novelists who say that!). Greene takes an interest in Haiti and is resolute in his determination to see the Duvalier regime toppled. Through a trip that Greene and Diederich take along the border of the Dominican Republic (also recently liberated from a string of despotic and sadistic dictators) and Haiti, the seeds of The Comedians are born. Greene’s desire to dabble with danger and possible death is evidenced when he constantly strays into Haitian territory but is never arrested, kidnapped, or shot at. There is a sense of entitlement to life on the part of the author, who dabbled with Russian Roulette in his youth, a knowledge that he is not destined for the stray bullet, that death due to old age is a stronger possibility (as it was). The book goes onto portray the efforts that Duvalier takes to discredit the novel and its author, which only results in raising the profiles of both. There is an insinuation that The Comedians put the plight of Haiti onto the world stage and contributed in no small way to the ultimate fall of the Duvaliers.Greene then goes on to Panama and develops a close relationship with its dictator, Omar Torrijos, known as the General, and the subject of a later Greene book, Getting to Know the General. The relationship between author and ruler is friendly and warm, for the latter is one of those leftists leaning towards social democracy. Greene even gets his own back at the mighty USA, where he is persona non grata for having dabbled in communism as a young man, when Torrijos gives him a Panamanian passport to visit Washington as part of a delegation negotiating the repatriation of the Panama Canal to Panama.Other Central American and Caribbean politics flitter in and out of the narrative: Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Belize; this is a period of flux, as these “Banana Republics” swing between left and right wing politics, always with Big Brother USA’s assistance or interference. Greene is a central figure in these places, with access to the power elites, the power of his pen being a sought after weapon, and he is more at home here than in his native England. Sometimes I wonder, whether he was recruited to MI6 and built up as a writer so that this cover would give him access to centres of influence, and not that his life as a spy had given him the grist for his author’s mill – perhaps, bit of both was in play here. Greene is also embroiled in a battle with the Naples mafia during this period, over their involvement with the daughter of his then mistress, and he has to balance visits to Central America with staying at home in Europe to protect his family.Politics and intrigue notwithstanding, it is the enigmatic spirit of Greene that dominates these pages: “I am not a messenger, I am the message,” “I am not a heavy drinker, I am a steady drinker” (this from a man who could drink a bottle of scotch a day and a bottle of wine with each meal), “I have never hesitated to be used in the cause I believe in”; a man who thrived on the unknown and found boredom his greatest enemy, who bucked the gods and plucked immunity with impunity.For all his greatness, he also worked with an inefficient writing method: he wrote in longhand, read the writing into a dicta phone, and sent the tape to his sister in England to be typed; I wonder whether he would have treated the Internet, e-mail and a laptop as improvements to the tools of his trade, and whether his output in his later years would have increased consequently? Diederich writes with affection and sympathy for Greene, and there is a strong bond of respect and love between the two men that permeates the narrative. Definitely a “must read” for Greene lovers....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2014","Mar 02, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15806662-seeds-of-fiction

The servant on the other hand despises the master but is unable to shake off the yoke of servitude hoisted upon him from birth.This traditional relationship inverts when the duo arrive in America. The archetypal hero in the new world is the smart business person who can make a buck by hook or by crook, not the aristocratic fop. Therefore Parrot and his band of fellow artists soon start building the publishing business that was to follow in the land of the free, while Olivier studies the prison system in America with intent to report back to France on how the American system is supposed to rehabilitiate and not punish indefinitely. He also falls in love with the daughter of an American industrialist whose sole ambition is to marry into the aristocracy in France. Opposites attract!Carey's mastery of language is evident as he alternates writing from the first person viewpoints of Olivier and Parrot and really gets us into the heads of these characters, replete with prejudices, experiences, education and station in life. Olivier's narration is stylized and stilted, while Parrot is down to earth. Sights, smells, and the grunge of early 19th century life is vividly brought to life. In fact, the veracity of the prose also slows it down for there is a lot of telling going on which goes against the grain of our 21st century sensibilities.Of course, the French and the Americans will always remain different. A disappointed Olivier, who will never assimilate into the New World, ruminates to his former servant, ""In a democracy,there is not the class with the leisure to acquire discernment and taste of the arts,"" while Parrot, who has taken to the new continent like a duck to water, looks around at his farm, his family and his growing art business in America, and wonders what he has done wrong....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Feb 16, 2014","Feb 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6632372-parrot-and-olivier-in-america

Then someone tries to attack the committee members, inflicting serious bodily harm, and a smear campaign aims to expose the past lives of the owners: the retail bookstore text book meets the potboiler.I think what harms this book is that even though there is a serious attempt to educate readers on the intricacies and travails of the retail book trade, it bows to the very temptation that the fictitious bookstore has resisted: commercialization in the form of a mystery plot. In between, there is the palpable attraction between owner and manager that is not limited to the appreciation good books, and is by far the strongest thread of human interest in the novel.

Unless you I realized why I was having difficulty with this elegantly written book when I was about 40% of the way through - there is no protagonist! Unless you consider an entire family as one.After a brilliantly written first chapter, in which we get a tour around the town of St. Botolph's and its inhabitants, with the writer passing the POV like a baton from one character to the other, the story settles on the widely dispersed Family Wapshot. Coverley, the scientist, married to man-hating and frigid Betsy, lives in Talifer, a scientific research town; Moses, the brother is an alcoholic and lives with his cheating wife Melisa in Proxmire Manor; and rich cousin Honore who has not paid her taxes lives in the family homestead town of St. Botolph's.After this fact is established, the novel circles in episodic fashion around the lives of these characters, following each (and their spouses) for awhile, then jumping off to the next, until it comes full circle to the first and so on. In between we get exposed to a few more offbeat characters: Dr. Cameron, Coverley's psychotic boss, who is brought to heel at a senate hearing when his abandoned and handicapped son arrives and asks only for love, nothing more; Emile, the mercenery young man who is having an affair with Melisa, a woman recognized as his mother in the various hotels they hide out for their assignations; and Norman, the polite but relentless tax investigator who pursues Honora to Italy and explains the process of extradition to her with elan. The descriptions are oblique and hilarious: when Coverley is ""granted"" sex by Betsy, it's ""an ascent up the rockwall, the chimney, the flume, the long traverse over the last ridge until one has a view of the whole world."" Dr. Cameron's hard-on aboard a plane is ""a venerial reverie with a painful inflamation."" Some scenes appear contrived and caricateurish: the repeated breakdown of Getrude Lockhart's appliances leading to her catastrophic life choice is a bit overdone. Even Honore has the honour of plugging in her curling iron and knocking out the power in an entire ship!All families evolve through triumph and tragedy and this one, with it's foibles, is no different. When the remnants of the Family Wapshot gather to celebrate Christmas in the old homestead, they are all scarred from their individual acts of commission. No one is saved but everyone is changed, a bit poorer in the pocket book perhaps, but richer in the soul.The style is very direct, like reportage in some places and yet lyrical in others.

We believe it is George who is writing these stories at a later stage in life, but it is the author, Anderson, who is the intrusive and moralistic narrator, and so he must be, given how short these stories are, and given that he is trying to get into each of the heads of this wide cast of characters.And the cast includes drunks, disgraced teachers,itinerant philosophers,impotent men who hate women,reclusive artists, bankers' virginal daughters, dying mothers, all dealing with frustration, loneliness and longing, all on the edge of breakdown. Given that the author too suffered a nervous breakdown before he gave up his business career and devoted himself to writing, I wondered whether he was trying to catch that sense of quiet desperation in these stories. In between the sadness, wonderful truths emerge: ""be courageous to be loved,"" the drunken athiestic father tells his young daughter, ""everyone suffers and does wrong,"" says Dr. Parcival, who goes on to say, ""everyone is Christ, and they are all crucified."" Even the oil salesman has a quote: ""decay is always happening."" and he isn't talking about the process of creating oil beneath the earth.Marriage seems a mistake for many, including George's mother, who feel they should not have entered that institution, and yet are unable to stop others from embracing it. Sex is limited to lines like ""they became lovers."" And the multitude of characters seem to be trapped within their physical boundaries, in Ohio, moving only about the cities within the state's borders: Cleveland, Toledo, Columbus, and Winesburg, of course. Only George is the priviledged one, who is able to leave his small town, after having chronicled the lives of its inhabitants and reduced them to caricatures, and follow his mother's aspirations for him by heading on to wider pastures out of state.

Steinbeck won national attention with Tortilla Flat in 1935, followed shortly by Of Mice and Men in 1937, and his masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath in 1939 that won the Pulitzer Prize. Fame was assured after that, with access to the President of United States and other centres of influence. But with fame also came the loss of his creative power, for he subsided into a series of forgettable books, even writing war propaganda with Bombs Away, Lifeboat, and The Moon is Down, until Cannery Row in 1945 showed some of his former promise; and then the long slide into irrelevance, despite snagging the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. He had a disappointing career in Hollywood, where many of his projects and scripts were overshadowed or scrapped for the wrong reasons. Even his autobiographical novel, East of Eden (1952), also made into a movie and written towards the end of his career, did not make the impact he expected because by that time his writing had turned to extreme moralizing. Steinbeck was harshly viewed and dissected by critics who either expected him to write more of the same books that had made him famous – his depictions of the underprivileged in the Salinas Valley – or expected him to capture the zeitgeist all the time. For his part, Steinbeck was trying to further his art, and experimented, often discarding projects that held no promise to him. And as for the zeitgeist, he lost that connection after the war, and his portrayal of the characters populating The Wayward Bus (1947) showed just how far out of touch he had become. He did start another career as a journalist after the war and enjoyed success again, but that part is not covered in this book which only deals with his fiction.Steinbeck’s archetypal hero is Tom Joad – the man who does not conform to society and lives by his own rules, and yet the fame he acquired from the writing of those very novels about characters like the Joads, moved him to the other side, where fame obscured the artist.

In the age of Google, when we can look up anything that strikes our fancy (in fact, the author credits 90% of his research to Google)it is still great to have a single repository that stores all the foibles, fetishes, anecdotes, quotes, habits and frustrations of these driven people working in the world's loneliest and most engaging profession, and cataloged under various subject areas for easy reference.There is no use of even trying to summarize the sheer number of eccentric happenings in this book. Let's see: Walter Scott dictated Ivanhoe while screaming in pain over a stomach ailment; Milton dictated Paradise Lost when he was blind;Edith Sitwell sat in a coffin before starting her day;John Cheever dressed, took the elevator to the basement, undressed and wrote in his underwear in the storage room;Stevenson wrote Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde while under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs; Balzac downed 50 cups of cofee per night and died of cafeine poisoning; Dickens walked upto 20 miles per day after work;Simenon bedded 10,000 women, 8,000 of them were prostitutes - do you get the picture? The book begins with a detailed history on the evolution of the tools of the trade: the quill gave way to the pencil and the dip pen, that gave way to the fountain pen, that gave way to the typewriter, that gave way to the word processor. There were early adopters and laggards with every change in technology. Writers are superstitious people and believe that they are chosen to tap into a conduit of inspiration coming from...where...they do not exactly know, and they surround themselves with totems, talismans, tools, work settings and other familiar conditions to avoid disrupting the ""flow."" Bruce is careful to present a balanced picture: to every writer who proposes one method of writing there is another who has a diametrically opposite method. Thus, we have morning writers and evening writers, depressed writers and happy ones, those who manipulated their characters and those who were manipulated by their creations, those who drank when they worked and those who did not, those who were promiscious and those who were not, those who wrote sitting, standing, sleeping, dressed and undressed, those who wrote in quiet and isolation and those who wrote in a room full of people, those who were ""blocked"" and those who did not understand the meaning of the word. Obviously, there is no one true formula for how, when and where to write.Along the way we are regaled with illuminating quotes: ""Writing is imagination dancing with memory""; ""Cocaine produces 'Burbly Bullshit'""; ""Drunks ramble, so do books by drunks""; ""the pen is the tongue of the mind""; ""the quill is an implement of torture yielded by a goose and wielded by an ass""....and so on.A few statistical conclusions appear along the way: More famous American authors were alcoholics than British authors; in handwriting we want to shorten our sentences but with a computer or dictaphone we tend to lengthen them; immigration can create writer's block, so can fame - ""whom the God's want to destroy, they first call promising""; fewer literary works of merit have been produced under the influence of alcohol or drugs; the advent of the word processor made writers either over-edit or under-edit; having stenographers doubles the speed of writing - Dosteovsky hired one and finished a novel in 4 weeks! Reading this book was comforting for me as a writer for it made my eccentricities pale in comparison and made me realize that, like those who have gone before me, once you accept the cross (or the pen), there is no going back. As the author concludes, ""Writing is a dog's life, but the only life worth living.""...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 27, 2013","Dec 31, 2013","Dec 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6684308-page-fright

But I did, trapped as I was in the middle of the ice storm, and was glad for the experience.I was reminded of Raymond Carver and John Steinbeck when reading these stories, many of which are located in a town called Catamount, New Hampshire. The characters are mostly blue collar workers, often plumbers, leading hard scrabble lives, hanging at the edges of penury. They are scarred individuals, prone to alcohol, adultery, violence, racism, sexism, greed, and vanishing jobs, but with a strong homing call toward their roots in this small state that seems to be fond of Canadian Club whiskey. Children of broken marriages feature prominently and I wondered whether the 12-year old boy in the ‘50’s with a younger brother and sister, whose father abandons the family, a scenario occurring in more than one story (“Queen for a Day” and “The Visit”), is a reflection on the author’s life. However, adult children of broken families should never question their aging parents about what happened those many years ago to disrupt the family unit, as we discover in “Assisted Living.” Plain but strong women are entwined with younger and attractive men, leading to disastrous results (“Sarah Cole: A Type of Love Story”). Some of the shorter stories are told in parable form such as “The Fish,” and “The Neighbour.” Communist leanings come out in “With Che in New Hampshire” and in the dramatic recreation of Simon Bolivar’s last hours in “The Rise of the Middle Class.” An unexpected event can lead a man to question the new direction he is taking with his life after the collapse of a long term marriage (“Xmas”). And the final story “Lobster Night” is a dramatic exploration into what happens when individual breaking points are breached, for both men and women. The most moving story for me was “The Moor,” where a 50-something local thespian (also in the plumbing business for his day job, and divorced) meets his 80- year old former lover from 30 years ago, in a restaurant, and escorts her home.Banks is a slow burn on the longer stories where he takes time and lengthy sentences (some of which are clumsy and pretentious) to build character, but you have to stay the course to gain the benefit. Two of the stories, “The Fisherman” and “The Guinea Pig Lady” run 120 pages between them, and take place in the same trailer park (there are other stories too from this trailer park, pulled from his 1981 collection, aptly named Trailerpark) and are similar in construct; they portray the outsider who goes against the norms of society for altruistic reasons; there is even a section in both stories where the individual judgements of the trailer park denizens (aka society) on these outcasts who dare to go against the grain are laid out candidly and embarrassingly, for we too could be one of those people casting those judgements. The opening story, Djinn, set in a fictitious African state, is similar in theme, where those who rise to the top and look beyond are pulled down by the dictates of a conformist society.The unfortunate aspect of throwing a writer’s entire body of short fiction into a one mammoth collection is that there will be unevenness between stories, and there is in this one too given the 37 year span over which they were written. Styles vary from 1st person to 2nd person to 3rd person. In fact, the 2nd person constructs are very effectively rendered.All that said, if you have the time and patience to let Banks conjure up his scenes and characters in his deliberate and methodical fashion, this is a very enjoyable and memorable read....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 22, 2013","Jan 04, 2014","Dec 22, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26918.The_Angel_on_the_Roof

There are no good guys (except perhaps for idealists like Perry and Gail), everyone else is out to preserve their own necks.The writing is skillful but utilitatian, hinting perhaps that le Carre has a fixed quota of words to output per day. But he weaves in back story skillfully, and uses tense changes for effect without jarring the reader. There is a bit of celebrity advertorial going on as Roger Federer gets a more than required mention in the book.The tennis match sequence in the Caribbean and the final escape scene could have been shortened, I think, but the finale is all the more abrupt and shocking because of those longer preceding sections.

Was it to record the transient loves of a lonely man or was it to capture the spirit of the publishing industry when it came of age in the days prior to TV and the Internet?

The better story was that about the just-retired detective coming to terms with a divorce from his lifelong partner, his partiality to alcohol, his flagging libido that is transforming him into a dirty old man, and the prospect of retirement itself. His retirement party ends up in a sexual incident that sets Sunderson off as no better than the sexual predators he had pursued as a cop.What follows is a rambling narrative of ex-detective Sunderson's travels from Michigan's Upper Peninsula to Arizona and back as he latches on to a final case that he is determined to solve before going out to pasture. The hunt gives Sunderson the excuse to delay retirement for just a bit more. The case itself is to prove that a charismatic religious cult leader is a pedophile and a con artist. The challenge for Sunderson is that he himself is having fantasies over his 16 year old neighbour, Mona, who undresses for his benefit with her bedroom window open.Mona is a conflicted young woman, living with absentee parents and looking at Sunderson and his ex-wife as surrogate parents. She also becomes his technical research assistant feeding Sunderson with the dirt on the cult leader's shadowy life.What worked for me in this book is that Harrison lays his protagonist bare, warts and all. Sunderson's rabid sex drive is his lifeforce under threat, and therefore transcends sleaze to sympathy. The scenes of the outdoors are well drawn and one gets a sense, feel and taste of the terrain that Sunderson traverses. His recurring guilt over the divorce, his raging libidinous dreams, and his frightening thoughts of being a nobody, post-retirement, weave in and out of the narrative, while Sunderson liberally tanks up with plenty of alcohol along his peregrinations.That Sunderson is able to reconcile his feelings towards Mona and his ex-wife without breaching the bounds of propriety, while the great cult leader goes from bad to worse in his assaults on young girls, is what sets apart hero from villain. Perhaps this contrast is needed for us to understand Sunderson, but the title of Great Leader is a misnomer for the cult leader is just a foil in this novel which is really the story about our Great Detective....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 13, 2013","Dec 15, 2013","Dec 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10796809-the-great-leader

And I found this book to be startling in Pico Graham Greene is one of my favourite authors, so I am bound to be biased by anything written about him. And I found this book to be startling in Pico Iyer's insights into Greene and into that in-between country of guilt, doubt, compassion, faithlessness, inscrutability and betrayal we have come to call ""Greeneland.""Greene's many recurring themes are called out: (1)the visiting foreigner vs. the resident foreigner in an offbeat country, both out of touch with the mother country(2) The relationship between the local woman and the visiting foreigner, and its sexual subtext (3) the Catholic atheist (4) the Do-gooders (usually Americans) in a country that does not want to be saved (5) the compassion of the wounded towards the wounded. Greene's private life is also interesting: he stayed married to his first wife despite leaving her 43 years ago, and living with a string of mistresses afterwards. And there is an exact count of the number of prostitues he had been with. He did not drive a car, and preferred to live in a small 2-room flat despite spending his enormous royalty payments on buying houses, ranches and cars for those he cared for. He was the perennial outsider of the literary establishment despite being a a popular writer; I think the establishment had a problem in welcoming a spy and a lapsed Catholic into their midst although they did not have any problem in embracing alcoholics and suicides openly. But after his death, we can't seem to get enough of Greene - now elevated to a Christ-like figure, albeit with a mortal stain on it.Iyer tries to marry his own life and pregrinations along roads less travelled as a journalist in more recent times, his own father's life as an academic and philosopher living in the US, and Graham Greene, the man who lives within his head. It was this juxtaposition of the three strands that never quite wove together for me. I think that Iyer's travels and adventures would have made for a fascinating traveloge in its own right, and his insights into Greene and his work could have been extended to carry a separate book of literary crticism on the celebrated author. As for fathers, well, we all have issues in reconciling with them; they are the subject of memoir or introspection, not very interesting when displayed in the public arena, and fathers rarely fit between travelogue and literary observations. There is also a danger in using the name and work of a literary lion such as Greene to sanctify one's own life - it smacks of pretension.All that said, I'll look forward to the next book by Iyer on ""The Lawless Roads - travels with myself"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 26, 2013","Nov 30, 2013","Nov 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12688827-the-man-within-my-head

Perhaps like his protagonist David Kepesh, mortality is sounding its alarm bells and there is no more time to ""dick around,"" although there is plenty of that kind of activity in this book.David is an aging academic who has spent most of his life bedding his students upon their graduation, having deserted his wife and son at the dawn of the Age of Aquarius. Sex is revenge for him. Then he meets Consuela, a Cuban student, and actually starts to care. Their relationship is one of power and the loss of it: she gains physical mastery over this man of culture, while he goes mad with anxiety in the knowledge that she adores him but does not desire him. And their sexual acts are degrading, for him, but he laps them up, if but to keep her. This book is written as a confession by David to an unknown third party on how he moved from sexual animal to caring animal to dying animal. Part-way Roth intervenes to conduct a discourse on the freedom of the individual that goes back to the Puritans. He also deviates to talk about the rise of feminism in the '60's that Consuela's generation has inherited. There is a side plot with the abandoned son who is the opposite of his father, locked into a loveless and miserable marriage but unwilling to repeat history and leave it. And there are observations on the more mature lovers in David's stable (students of a generation ago) who have now built professional lives but have no success with relationships and ""drop in"" on their old master from time to time for a quickie and some sympathy in between business meetings.Concluding, Roth claims life, purpose and some sympathy for his protagonist (and probably for himself too) when it is Consuela who faces the life threatening illness and David is forced to examine his conscience and reach out, and discover that, deep down, he does have feelings....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2013","Nov 26, 2013",,,view (with text),/book/show/29776.The_Dying_Animal

Both are structurally siThis book on the life of Henry James is a good foil to Lodge's other biographical novel on H.G.Wells's life ""A Man of Parts."" Both are structurally similar: begining at the end of each writer's life, then threading through backstory to pivotal events, and ultimately showing the writers fall into irrelevance during the remainder of their lives. The difference here is that while Wells enjoyed immediate literary success and abused his windfall with his many sexual peccadillos, James remained sexually chaste and struggled for validation throughout his life, with success only coming posthumously.The book hinges on the relationship between James and his friend George du Maurier. The latter, a painter, turned Punch cartoonist turned novelist is successful at everything he turns his hand to, his novel, Trilby, becoming a publishing sensation at the turn of the last century. At the same time, James is trying his hand at playwriting and the London debut of his play, Guy Domville, culminates in a booing from the gallery when the author is brought on stage for a bow at curtain call, an event that mars James's psyche forever. The contrast between James and du Maurier is striking: James is of robust health, the celibate bachelor, intellectual, respected but a low grossing author, and du Maurier is a sickly family man, shallow and insular in his worldview, who finally took his fame and fortune for an inconvenience.The writing process in James's day is laid bare, and we are lucky to have computers and the Internet today. I chuckled when I read how the author would handwrite, mail the pages to a stenographer who would type them and mail back; the author would then make corrections and mail back, sometimes even sending corrections via telegram when deadlines were tight.Advertizing worked even then: Rider-Haggard sold 30,000 copies of his book with glitzy commercials while poor James managed 850 copies of one of his better known books, and did not even earn back his advances in many cases. James was a man out of step with his time; his morally fastidious heroes,decorous language, and themes of self-sacrifice and renunciations did not match the tastes of the public who was looking for sentimental comedy and farce (hence the popularity of Oscar Wilde at the time).James puts it down to the spread and thinning of literacy, the levelling effect of democracy, the rampant energy of capitalism, and the distortion of values by journalism and advertizing. If he were alive today, he would be happy to note that those observations are still valid. The narative style reads like a James novel, elaborate and detailed and does not contain a lot of drama other than on the opening night of Guy Domville, and yet to a writer, James's life is a beacon. His angst is a consolation to us plebes, and his observations on the art of writing are profound: ""A second chance - that's the delusion. There never was to be but one. We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.""Lodge concludes that James had to believe in an afterlife to have made any sense of his mortal endeavours, that he is among the heavens now watching us reading his work all over the world - an essential text in many universities and colleges - noting that much of his work has been translated to the cinema, and that throughout the world we still continue to discuss his complex literary style ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 12, 2013","Nov 20, 2013","Nov 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/69927.Author_Author

She is a researcher living off Daddy's generous monthly allowance and believes in focusing and smothering her man, poor Al. Eugene Shore is a hitherto unknown writer who lives in their Toronto neighbourhood, who suddenly keeps appearing in news releases and being mentioned by Al and Lisa's acquaintances. Al gets fascinated by this enigmatic author who calls a spade a spade, and switches his thesis to a study of Shore. However, Al is again unable to finish his work, much to Lisa's chagrin, as he continues to see ""vistas of possibilities"" but never closure.The plot then veers off into Shore having a brush with the law that exposes the rusty underbelly of our upholders of the peace, Al and Lisa breaking up due to Shore's invisible but polarizing presence in their lives, and a psychotic policeman taking the law into his own hands - ingredients that lead to tragic results. Everyone (even Shore, by gaining immortality) achieves their goals in the end, but with what consequences!I found the painting of Toronto and the literary scene in the 70's rather quaint: Al walks into a publisher's office, pitches his book idea verbally and walks out with a contract and an advance. Wow, times have indeed changed! The writing is dated: characters talk too much and think too much, and the pace is slow. If this book was raved about when it was first published in the '70's, it is a testament to how far literary tastes have grown in the intervening years and how short our attention spans have shrunk, and how more graphic our expectations for violence, sex and human drama have become. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 14, 2013","Oct 22, 2013","Oct 14, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1593201.A_Fine_and_Private_Place

Despite her bi-polar condition, Zelda was obviously the more gifted artist - writer, playwright, dancer and painter - of the Golden Couple who defined a new age between the two world wars. Unfortunately, she was born on the wrong side of history, when women were supposed to be muses and supporters of their more famous husbands, and expected to have no individuality of their own. Her struggle to regain herself against these indomitable forces only ends in their financial and emotional destruction.Scott comes across as a talented but insecure writer, who lives the high life and captures the spirit of the Jazz Age in his writing, only to succumb to the ravages that alcohol inevitably takes out of a human, no matter how invincible they are made out to be. He is jealous of anyone (including Zelda) who would topple him off the perch he had claimed in his early twenties of being America's most gifted writer. The shine goes off Fitzgerald when we see him adding his name to Zelda's short stories to get them published for a higher price, when we see him taking full editorial control of her first novel to the point that it is rendered incoherent, and when he sabotages her ballet career by asserting his rights as a husband that she not leave Paris for Naples. Ironically, despite this love-hate bond, Zelda and Scott remained married until death did them part, unlike other couples in their circle that were experimenting with shorter and more radical relationship combinations.One also gets another view of Ernest Hemingway, who is the villain of this piece. Not only is he a misogynist (which has been well documented elsewhere) but he is also Scott's alter-ego and Zelda's nemesis. Initially Scott's protege, Hemingway adds to his mentor's insecurity and leads him down the path to self-destruction.If Scott and Zelda were alive and writing today, my bet is that she would have long outstripped him on the success meter, and that he would have realized that $4000 for a short story (which is what he got at his peak in the '30's) was a damned good price to get for a piece of writing even by today's standards, and that he was indeed living, not just in the Jazz Age but also in the Golden Age of Writing. Perhaps he should have been a bit more grateful for the huge talent and opportunity afforded to him....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2013","Oct 14, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/15994634-z

This collection plumbs the depth and breadth of his efforts in the form. The writer exerts strong narrative control of his stories, many of them written in omniscient voice with an Irish cadence. The shifts and climaxes are subtle, and often sad. The themes are adult relationships, immigration, guilt, religion, abuse, revolution and death. Trevor's Irish immigrants always fare badly in the new country, be that England or America, and they return to the home country impoverished and beaten. His guilt theme is woven around pivotal events in his characters' lives: sexual abuse by priests, adultery, even a murder committed in the past that casts its deathly shadow on the survivors. Many of the characters are middle-aged with plenty of emotional baggage and life experiences to draw from.The religious divide in Ireland is brought to the fore in the story ""Lost Ground"" when the Catholic and Protestant priests meet on friendly terms, but realize that they are locked behind their ideological and socially conditioned walls. And the cloak-and-dagger world of the IRA is revealed in the creepily menacing ""The Mourning.""Trevor conjures up interesting situations in which to play out his human dramas: there is no respect for the dead in ""Sitting with the Dead,"" when an embittered housewife vents to the two sitters about her dead husband's limitations; the bastard lover and the abused wife make love in front of her drunk husband in the same hotel room in ""Le Visiteur""; the cultural differences between the English and the Germans are revealed when an about-to-be-married couple play the ""Telephone Game."" The most powerful story for me was ""The Piano Tuner's Wife,"" when the replacement wife has to alter her blind husband's view of the world in order to extinguish the powerful presence of his dead first wife.Given the number of stories, this is a well-crafted collection that must be digested in small bytes.

Makes one want to contemplate become a union card-carrying vegetarian.And yet the intrusive omniscient narrator who not only describes but also comments, who is overtly pushing a socialist agenda as the only utopian alternative to this pathetic state of the nation, starts to grate after awhile, and the writing oversteps the bounds from novel to manifesto. And this manifesto becomes abundantly clear in the last few chapters when we are treated to a discussion among the pundits of the time on the pros and cons of socialism vs. capitalism.No doubt Sinclair's novel brought about change in the form of new government regulations for the meat industry, and that makes this book rank above the mere ""entertainments"" that novels usually fall into, no matter what their literary merits. And yet, I found the reading of this book as a novel difficult. And let's not forget that despite the socialist posturing, greed is hardwired into all of us, especially those in power with most to lose, be they socialists or capitalists, as we have seen with the failure of so many socialist and capitalist states (and corporations) since the time of Sinclair. What alarmed me was that this barbaric gladiator mentality seems to have returned to fashion in the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, the loss of jobs to outsourcing, and the weakening of trade unions. When I hear of ""death by overwork"" that happens today, have we just changed the label from ""stockyard"" to ""stock market""? And if Sinclair was alive today, would he have taken on another sweatshop sector like the call centre industry and its pressure for higher AHTs and higher sales per employee as the new target for his socialist crusade?You stamp out one ill and another pops its head out from somewhere it appears, all devised by the ingenuity and fragility of mankind. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 14, 2013","Sep 20, 2013","Sep 14, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41681.The_Jungle

Grandma is a greedy, unscrupulous woman of immense wealth, extracted from the misery of others, including her family – she is the incarnation of the perethaya, the hungry ghost who cannot be satiated. And yet the grandmother has a strong emotional hold on Shivan, for she loves him in a cruel and possessive way to the exclusion of her daughter and granddaughter and showers him with presents as the form of expressing her love. She has plans and dreams for him which he does not share in.Shivan and his family move to Canada to escape Grandmother, and eke out an existence as “brown immigrants” in Scarborough in the 90’s, a place still not fully multicultural as the labels suggest. But Grandmother’s reach is long and she lures him back to the old country with promises of a better life. Sri Lanka is in turmoil with a Tamil insurgency in the north, a Marxist one in the south, and the unwelcome Indian peacekeeping force messing it up for everyone – a very dark phase in the life of this troubled island. Adding to the drama, Shivan falls in love with his old school mate Mili that culminates in a tragedy, further splitting the family apart and creating a permanent rift between grandson and grandmother.The rest of the book shifts between Sri Lanka and Canada with this schism leading to an unsettled period for Shivan; his relationships lead nowhere and he is miserable, until he brings himself to make a life-altering sacrifice for his grandmother in the last days of her life. I wondered whether this inconclusive ending leaves the door open for a sequel, as the author continues to document his life via fictional heroes. I found the Sri Lankan sections of the book to be well written and dramatic, and they captured the vernacular and the Cinnamon Gardens culture (i.e. the moneyed class) very well. Selvadurai offers no apologies or translations for Sri Lankan words and expressions that litter the text, and I found no glossary to assist the non-Sri Lankan reader. He captures the rudeness, the temperamental natures, the deceits, and the rather coddled behaviour of grown men from the Colombo 7 milieu. The relationships between Shivan and his male lovers are also fraught with petty jealousies, silly arguments and possessiveness, mirroring perhaps the relationship Shivan has with his grandmother. The Canadian sections were boring in comparison, perhaps indicating how, a safe civilized society, albeit with a few discriminatory practices, can be rather bland compared to a third world country seething with conflict and dysfunction on all sides and providing a writer with rich grist for his mill.Eventually the family members re-establish their identities in Canada, albeit changed, impoverished in some ways, free in others, just like all immigrants do. And Selvadurai socks it to the guys back home when he declaims (through Shivan, of course) “This is a banana republic. This is a dictatorship. There is no rule of law.” Good for him!  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 31, 2013","Sep 12, 2013","Aug 31, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12846205-the-hungry-ghosts

Lawrence, as I had an interest in reading about the famed author's life. The book, while giving us glimpses of Lawrence's life, is more a treatise on his works, grouped between the ones deemed triumphs and those condemned as failures - hence the title.Ranked among his triumps are The Rainbow (which caused him a lot of grief with the censors), Women in Love, and to a lesser extent, Sons & Lovers. The rest of his works apparently do not amount to much, other than for a few short stories; I was surprised to read that among the trash pile sat Lady Chatterley's Lover, perhaps his most (in)famous book, but apparently not a very artistic one.Prime among the reasons for his failure, often reflected in his didactic writing, was that Lawrence had a superiority complex and wanted everyone to embrace his views on sexuality, especially women, who were supposed to submit to their man without seeking their own pleasure. He was the ""experiential writer"" of tomes in which most of the action went on in the heads, hearts and loins of his characters. His writing is known to lack form, ""a chaos of incidents with no interelationships."" And his heroes lacked physical courage, in fact, ""one is left with the impression that they were all cowards,"" says author Vivas, a no-no in a world where readers live vicariously through their fictional heroes.In life, Lawrence was anti-intellectual and anti-science. He was power hungry and wanted to found his own commune in Taos but ended up with only two followers, his wife and artist Dorothy Brett. Much of his life was spent in poverty until his final years when his books took off; by then however, poverty was replaced by ill health. To his credit, Lawrence was a master of language and probably the inventor of the four letter word in literature. A writer who sticks to a single theme however, runs the risk of going out of fashion at some point. And I suspect that is what happened to Lawrence. After he made his contribution to literature by opening it up to the next level of expression, especially on matters sexual,he had served his purpose and had nothing more to say. Testament to that fact is when I went looking for his ranch that had been taken over by the University of New Mexico and turned into a museum, I found that it had been shut down and there would be no more tours, So I turned around and went to check out Kit Carson instead, who is indeed the most beloved son of Taos, an illiterate man who demonstrated his worth in deed, not word. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2013","Aug 27, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10794377-d-h-lawrence-the-failure-and-the-triumph-of-art

HoThe premise of this book is interesting: the rugged individual takes on the overpowering state, David vs. Goliath, the stuff of old western comics. However the execution failed, in my view.In a nutshell, an old rancher is being driven off his land in New Mexico to make way for a missile testing site. He resists and self-destructs. And the story reminds the reader that change is inevitable and those who resist it get run over. At a deeper level it also reminds us that America may be the home of the brave but is no more the land of the free than China is, especially when the government wants your land, and these are important lessons from the book.Now let's get to the execution. The story is narratted by the old rancher's 12-year old grandson, and this was I believe the main mistake in the delivery. The boy comes across as a cross between a child and a 20-something in his voice and manner. He is also a bit of a cold fish until the very end when he starts to gush emotion. He parrots and emulates his grandfather and seems to have no mind of his own. We do not feel his fears when confronted with the might of the US government. The relationship of the friend Lee to the old man and the boy is also not clear, nor are his motives for putting his life on the line in their defence when he has a family of his own. And as for the old man, even though we feel sorry for his plight, he comes across as a bit of an intransigent ass for not taking the generous settlement offered, moving onto another chapter of his life and leaving a dying ranch.As for the ""fire on the mountain,"" the book's concluding scene, I think it was a bit overdone and melodramatic. But I guess forest fires in the '60's were not what they are today and not as devastating as how they are made to look in our current mass and social media, so the old man's exit via the fire may have been an acceptable ""out"" at the time. I still would have looked for a subtler ending.The real hero is the land, which is evocatively portrayed by the author who seems to have been very much a part of it. And the villains are everyone who stole the land to call it their own since the beginning of time: the Indian, the white man, the railroad companies, the government; after all these players have passed, the land will prevail, it belongs to no one - that is the strong and clear message....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 27, 2013","Aug 31, 2013","Aug 27, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/764749.Fire_on_the_Mountain

In this collected work that compiles all of her short writing over a 30-year period, we are introduced to a variety of styles, subjects, arrangements, voices and situations that led me to crown her the ""magician of the short story.""Gothic is the overaching mood of her stories, but that is the only connection. The subject matter roams over a wide convas, from biblical tales to fairy tales like The Beauty & the Beast and Puss in Boots, with Carter placing her unique spin on them. In fact, we get two cuts of the B&B story, one in which the Beauty's kiss turns Beast into a human, and the other in which Beast kisses Beauty and turns her into an animal! The content then moves to the biographical where we get versions of the lives of Baudelaire and Edgar Alan Poe. The fusion of play, screenplay and prose is skillfully woven in the story of the movie director John Ford and his namesake, a Jacobean period dramatist. The most chilling pieces were the two stories on Lizzie Borden: an abject lesson that you can convey terror without spilling a drop of blood.Throughout, Carter evokes the senses, smell in particular, and her tendency to veer off into the macabre gives us liberal doses of sweat, vomit, feces and blood, all a bit much, but to be expected from a writer of gothic tales.The research behind her writing, particularly in the historical pieces, is evident, as her fiction is always a spin off from the real story, and given the wide canvas, I suspect Carter actually enjoyed ferreting out the real stories before fictionalizing them, lending texture where the purely biographical is unable to.And, as if to foreshadow her own early demise, there is the spectre of the grim reaper, a faceless man, who appears in many of her stories, blending in with the Gothic, but also making one wonder if the author suspected her own exit and pumped out these stories at a furious pace, leaving valuable lessons for practitioners of the short story to follow. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 21, 2013","Aug 10, 2013","Jul 21, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/763471.Burning_Your_Boats

Everyone is sleeping with everyone else, a sign of the times at the dawn of another war. Our narrator is smitten by Justine and fearful that the jealous Nessim (who is getting his own back by sleeping with Melissa) will bump him off during a duck hunt. Justine is totally self-absorbed and cares not for the damage she creates but for the exploration of her own appetites and destiny.The book is low on plot, and heavy on description. Alexandia comes out best in its various shades, alternatively called ""the city of incest"" and ""the city of anguished lovers,"" among others. The story line jumps around because the narrator believes in focussing only on intense set pieces, whether in or out of their chronological order.Along the way, our narrator, who is a writer scraping by on day jobs, makes interesting observations about his vocation. Authorly success is accredited to ""tastings of sex buttoned up tight."" The exhaustion of a writer after a novel is completed leads to flirtations with suicide, says he, the ideal state of mind to drift into directionless affairs with whomsoever comes along - Melissa and Justine, in this case.Nothing is really resolved in this novel (I guess that is left for books 2-4, or not) except that Justine suddenly vanishes after the tragic duck hunt, leaving her husband, lover and admirers stranded. She is later seen working for a living, losing her looks and her shape, ostensibly enlightened - i.e. becoming a normal human being.I wonder why Durrell wrote this book - was it to capture a formative period in his life? Was he the narrator? Was he trying to capture the essense of Alexandria, a melting pot of many cultures? In these two instances he succeeds. Why the elaborate prose? Was he showing off his verbal dexterity? A sure pass here too. Why repeat the story from four angles? Pretension? Lack of confidence? Providing depth and perspective? Perhaps readers in his generation had the patience and appreciated the novelty of this approach. In today's time-constrained world, this treatment comes across as over-writing. I suspect many readers will pick up one of the books in the quartet, get the story line and characters, and not explore further. They might skim the beautiful passages of prose, the descriptions of Alexandrian streets and Egyptian women, and the didactic philosophizing.

There were several aspects that I could not overcome in order to keep ploughing through its 600 plus pages. Perhaps it's me, perhaps I am suffering from reader fatigue and have lost my patience with books that do not get to their point, especially in an age when publishers expect (nay, demand) that the novel's trajectory be clear by the end of the first chapter.I picked up this book as I was interested in learning about Morocco in the period between the world wars, and the story of a humble seamstress surviving amidst the torrents of intrigue and upheaval of those times sounded very intriguing. I wanted to hear the vernacular voices revealing their world to me. Instead the voice of the protagonist/narrator (and all the other characters in her millieu) came across as educated, sophisticated and therefore out of character, there was much overwritten dialogue, and the pace was very, very slow. And Morocco did not come alive to me. I felt that the book could have been halved in length and we wouldn't have missed a beat. This may not be the author's fault entirely, but perhaps the translator's, or perhaps ""long is still beautiful"" in Spanish literature.I may return to this book one day, when I am older and less harried with the prospect of living, and start at page 200 and see if the remainder of the book erases my bad start....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jul 18, 2013","Jul 20, 2013","Jul 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10836813-the-time-in-between

The anchoring modern-day story(if 1996 - 2002 can still be considered modern) is rather poorly constructed, while the stories that recede into the past,as far back as 1480, giving us a picture of the journey of ""the book"" in question, the Sarajevo Haggadah, are well drawn and provide dramatic tales of endurance and loss.The Haggadah acts like a reminder to everyone it touches, that persecution, suffering and loss are the lot of the Jews in Christendom. It is also a testament to the fact that creating a work of art is the finest legacy mankind can bequeath to its progeny, no matter how hard the circumstances of creation. Brooks captures the spirit of each age very well: its technology, values, and its political structures and undercurrents.And yet Hanna Heath, in the modern tale, disappoints. This particular story comes out as too clinical and contrived, an academic's journal with highly unbelievable chracters. The editor must have had an inkling of where Hanna was heading, and said ""spice it up."" So Hanna's story suddenly veers off into a dramatic and unecessary car accident for her almost inhuman mother (who never quite becomes human despite her accident), and a cloak and dagger affair at the end with everyone trying to get at the Haggadah, reminding me a bit of the Pink Panther series - unecessary contrivances, in my mind.This book is a slow burn, as each historical piece gets better, and if you can ignore Hanna and her amatuerish antics, there are a lot of fresh insights to be gained about lesser known parts of history that this sacred book touches on its tortured journey into the present. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 02, 2013","Jul 18, 2013","Jul 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1379961.People_of_the_Book

But I wondered if had this book been written in the present age whether it would have been titled Much Ado About Nothing or dropped into the reject pile?Much has been said of Joyce's vivid descriptions of Hell in this book, worth reading for the language, and by Catholic priests looking for a marketing hook to keep the faithful from fleeing to more sinful pastures. But beyond this central piece, there really is nothing substantial here: disjointed snippets of school life and intellectual debates among students - more like a journal with Joyce observing himself as a third person narrator.Guilt and Sin played important parts in the lives of the devout Catholics of Ireland (and everywhere)and the Church ruled with the threat of hell and damnation freely thrown about in Joyce's day. The sins of Stephen Dedalus are more of the imagined sort for he is too shy to even approach a female, let alone commit the carnal acts he thinks he is guilty of. Reading this book today, one is reminded of how innocent young people were before the world wars and consumerism consumed them and bred our present generation to whom Joyce's mortal and venial sins appear like flea bites.One thing though, I hope Joyce had stayed a young artist - this book and Dubliners are infinitely more understandable than Ulysses and Finnegan's Wake. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jul 10, 2013","Jul 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7588.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man

He could represent an international,let alone Swedish, treasure trove of human memory. And yet, Allan Karlsson, the sterilized centenarian is just that: sterile. He has no emotions, no loyalties, deslikes politics and religion, likes copious quantities of vodka (although we never see him drunk) and can be a cold-blooded killer when called to the task.The story follows two paths: the present day ""escape"" from the nursing home and an unlikely getaway with a bagful of illegal money and a motley crew of helpers; and the history of Allan, where he is directly involved with the Soviet Revolution (he meets Stalin), the Chinese Revolution (he meets Mao), the Spanish Civil War (he meets Franco), the Gulag, Iran, Churchill, Sukarno & Son, Kim Il Sung & Son, and oh, Harry Truman.The two paths eventually meet and Alan goes onto an even more preposterous career in his 101st year.

I had to append this  to its summary and studIt’s strange that this book, one of Coetzee’s most powerful, does not have a listing on Goodreads. I had to append this  to its summary and study guide edition.Writers seem to be most powerful when writing in the crucibles that forged them, not in the promised lands that embraced them after they became famous, and South Africa during Apartheid (not Australia where he presently lives) is Coetzee’s crucible.The book takes the form of a letter from an academic, known only as Mrs. Curren, living in Cape Town during the dying years of Apartheid, to her only daughter who has escaped the system to make a life for herself and build a family in the USA. The narrator had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is unable and unwilling to leave the home she has lived in all her life. Instead, in her vulnerable state, she attracts the waifs and stranded in society, those who are being dislocated by the collapsing regime that has reached its most repressive stage. The old woman is Mother South Africa, gathering her damaged children about her. Her helpmate is a vagrant drunk who stumbles into the household, Vercuil, who helps push-start her derelict car whenever she needs to get about, and sustains her by just being around. He is the only man she can attract in her debilitated state and she ignores his sullenness and unpredictability – he is still a fragile sign of life to a dying woman; he even sleeps beside her bed and the smell of his stale socks reminds her of the fast-vanishing life still to be lived and cherished. The teenage son of her housemaid, Bheki, and his friend John, represent the revolutionary new South Africa – the ones who defy being obedient to the “mastah” after centuries of subservience, but they will have to pay with their lives before the new nation is born. The boys’ confrontation with the authorities who are bent on stamping out dissent, places Mrs. Curren squarely in the centre of the drama tearing the country apart, convincing her of the fraud she has lived with all her life. And the tragedy is that even the blacks (no one is mentioned by their colour in this book, one has to imagine that by the roles each plays in society) are fighting each other in turf battles. Coetzee gets to make his political speeches through the narrator who waxes lyrical on topics ranging from aging, to being white, to being a mother, to the lost South Africa of her youth, to dying. Sometimes, these stump speeches are a bit over the top, the one weakness of the book. The prose makes up for this shortcoming and is crisp and incisive, and we see glimmers of the Nobel prize winner in the making. Mrs. Curren describes her situation as brought about by “a cancer of the heart by drinking of the cup of bitterness.” She declaims that “war is old men sending young men to death,” and that “opinions must be heard and weighed, not merely listened to out of politeness.”The metaphor of this dysfunctional household as a representation of the larger country is effectively drawn. The parallel of the dying nation with the dying woman is obvious and yet Coetzee evokes a voyeuristic curiosity in us to peer into what was one of the most misguided aberrations of Calvinist thinking. I vote this is the most powerful writing I have seen from this author. It’s a pity that we can’t seem to find much information on this novel in a forum like this. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 26, 2013","Jun 02, 2013","May 26, 2013",,Nook,view (with text),/book/show/12267847-age-of-iron-by-j-m-coetzee-summary-study-guide

But this time, it is Yunior’s loser life that’s on parade. He is never short of women but he always loses them due to his lack of respect for anyone but himself. He calls his women sucios, cheats on them at every turn, and is childless and immature – so what’s so appealing about these short stories, almost all of them tales of love and loss of a specific woman in our narrator’s life?The plight of immigrant Hispanics in America is the searing picture emerging from this book, and is very well drawn. Straight off the boat, they huddle in ghettos, exploited by unscrupulous bosses, and handicapped by their lack of language and sophistication in Anglo ways. The women have it the worst, and like Yasmin, are thrown into the arms of single Latino men who have wives left behind in the home country, doomed to relationships with an inevitable expiry date on them. And yet like moths to the flame they flock to the “land of the free” – home life must have been tough in the Trujillo era – better the frying pan than the fire. Taking a photograph outside McDonalds, or one outside the gates of a university they will never enter, to send home, is a sign that they have “arrived.” Yunior himself travels between the US and the DR trying to find a place to settle, and his exploits with women straddle both countries. And back in the homeland, the women await returning Dominican Gringos to father their children and take them away to the promised land – if they only knew that the grass wasn’t greener...After awhile, the stories get repetitious and predictable - after all, how many times can a man lose his woman before we categorize him as a bit of an ass? The author’s liberal lacings of Dominican words throughout the narrative makes one wonder if this book is being written in Spanglish, or if this is the new American? The only bit of humanity that emerges from Yunior is when he writes about his older brother, his hero, who died young of cancer and left a large hole in his life. And at least, unlike our earlier hero Oscar, who died for love, Yunior fesses up that he really is a chicken shit coward, and writing a book about his discoveries in the field of love is his only contribution and reward. His honesty is his saving grace, and probably his attractiveness to women.After reading the Oscar Wao book, this collection of short stories looks like the residual notes that the author had compiled during his Pulitzer prize winning effort, that he had subsequently decided to cash in due to his new-found fame and publish in another book.

And we see it again in this novel, which is a story within a story within a story, told in Auster's favourite narrative style. Given that there is so much ground to cover in this short book, I'm not sure there is any other way but to ""tell"" this story. However, only the main story line heads towards any type of conclusion in this book, while the others stall midway, again, demonstrating randomness, perhaps?I like this book because it deals with the life of a writer, Sydney Orr, who has suffered a long illness and is just picking up his interrupted life. It is also a good study on plotting, for Auster weaves plot within plot in his embedded stories - quite deftly, it seems. Sometimes randomness can be a cop-out, when new plot points are introduced just to hype things up or slow things down. The late arrival of Jacob Trause, the truant son of Syney's mentor John Trause, and his suddden but drastic impact on the course of the narrative, pushes the concept of ""chance"" a bit too far. Auster also experiments with putting back-story and other non-essential detail into lengthy footnotes that overlap several pages and that can be read ( or not) to enhance the depth of the main storyline - this device worked for me..The lesson of randomness however, is quite powerful, because after the random event, all previous efforts by those affected seem trivial and unecessary.Which begs the question of whether one should strive in life or just go with the flow? ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 14, 2013","Apr 18, 2013","Apr 14, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10006.Oracle_Night

The army of the ruling party commits terrible torture on the few “barbarians” captured in its forays outside the walls, mainly to drive fear among those contemplating rebellion, and to assuage its own fear and convince itself that it can be an effective counter insurgency force. In a state of emergency no one knows who the bad guy is for both sides commit atrocities. Torturers are trained to detect the “tone of truth” in their victims – really!The magistrate narrator is the most complex character in the book. Compassionate to the locals after having lived in this outpost for many years, he has “gone over to the other side” for he has taken to consorting openly with local women. He sees through to the excesses of empire and its limitations. His hardest conquest however is the barbarian prisoner who is brought into the fort by the cruel military commander; she has been half blinded and her feet have been broken by her captors. The magistrate takes her into his quarters and attempts to heal her by bathing her and applying soothing oils on her body. He is unable to relate to her sexually, unlike to the other women – she is the symbol of the spiritually unyielding though physically vanquished. He assumes the role of the apologetic conqueror, trying to atone for the damage his kind has done to her. Coetzee also takes the opportunity to explore the flagging libido of the aging male, and the thoughts and actions that this evolution gives rise to.The military sees our narrator as a traitor and incarcerates him, but this is where the book takes a different turn. This is not the heavy, solitary confinement of the Count of Monte Cristo. The prisoner is able to move about, even escape rather easily. His punishment is the humiliation and degradation his captors submit him to, stripping him down to the existence of an animal before the eyes of his beloved subjects. And his real prison is circumscribed by the hostile country around the fort. He even returns to his cell, on his own volition, when he knows that escape is impossible.Coetzee’s book has a remarkable resemblances to colonial conquests of recent times: Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq come to mind. The conquering force can never really get to the barbarians and usually leaves after having created a greater mess which the local populace is faced with cleaning up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 09, 2013","Mar 23, 2013","Mar 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6194.Waiting_for_the_Barbarians

Single, under-employed as an English teacher, unkempt and unattractive to women, he does not provide any hint of the Nobel prize winning author he will eventually turn out to be. All he wants to do is write poetry. He hates teaching, the profession he will ultimately spend forty-plus years in. He is unable to give of himself, because he needs to preserve his energy for his art. He believes in manual labour, because that makes him feel like the “others,” and so he is seen building a concrete support wall around his father’s crumbling house – the only white man sweating it out in the heat, a place normally reserved for blacks and coloureds. He has no friends but holds firm views on the world: politics is a theatre for hatred, nothing is worth fighting for, the true natives of South Africa are the coloureds with the whites and blacks being the interlopers, and so on, he philosophises. The “biographer” travels around the world to interview five people (four women and a man) who all had a relationship, sexual, familial or collegial with the author who is supposedly dead at this time after having achieved global fame. Their dispersion around the planet is a reflection of the mass migrations out of South Africa that took place in the Apartheid years and later; Coetzee himself ultimately settled in Australia. “Don’t speak ill of the dead” does not apply here for those interviewed are candid on Coetzee’s inconsequence and lack of accomplishment during these wilderness years. There are additional undated notes in Coetzee’s notebooks to assist the biographer, in which the subject prefers to write of himself in the third person. The life of a famous writer is always of interest to readers and to other aspiring writers. But I wondered why Coetzee choses to focus on this dead period of his adult life, unless it is to show the time he spent with his father (the two weren’t really close, but enjoyed a forced closeness during this time). There is not much mentioned about his writing during these years either, except to say that he has published his first novel and is working on the second. The only conclusion I can draw is that Coetzee is slowly archiving his life as he ages: with Youth and Boyhood already delivered, Summertime is the next stage, uneventful though it is. He has already written semi-autobiographical novels like Disgrace and Diary of a Bad Year that talk to the aging academic and writer. Perhaps it will not be too long before we see the appearance of Fall and Winter, when the mature Coetzee’s real life is laid out for further public examination, and perhaps, this time he will not pull any punches but let it all hang out....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 26, 2013","Mar 14, 2013","Feb 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6337163-summertime

I could understand why HighsmitI had mixed feelings while reading this book of mainly unpublished stories by the queen of the psychological thriller. I could understand why Highsmith, an author who focussed on her craft, would stow away some of these stories, particularly her earlier pieces, in a box, and never want them published. Many are either too long for what they deliver, or too contrived and drive only towards a tragic conclusion.The book falls into two parts: The Early Stories (1938-1949) and The Middle and Later Stories (1952 – 1982) and I wondered why they had not been published as two different collections as they have distinct differences in style, pacing and theme. At over 400 pages it is a rather bulky tome of short stories. The early stories understandably have a dated style, are long on descriptions, take longer to develop, and emphasise women trying to find their footing in a world peopled by weak men – perhaps reminiscent of Highsmith’s own struggle to establish herself as a writer at the time. In this early phase, sinister elements such as pedophilia are only hinted to but not overtly expressed. Her later stories are better crafted but they take a darker tone and revolve around a predictable situation: the protagonist is almost certainly going to self-destruct.I was engaged by the second section although the situations felt contrived, usually involving a confluence of events that place the protagonist in an untenable situation from which he, or she, must get out or perish in the attempt. Consider the following: a sci-fi writer and his male secretary (who is having an affair with the former’s wife) go into the woods alone; a man is stuck in a hotel room in Paris with the daughter of his former lover who wants to seduce him like her mother had done twenty years ago; a suicidal woman at an Austrian ski resort has men falling all over her and threatening to commit suicide themselves. Some situations were too contrived: I don’t think that planes landed on schedule at European airports at 3am! And do cops let off a man who has just admitted to giving his wife a black eye?Highsmith’s preoccupation with death is obvious when reading these tales, and therefore I found no uplifting message, no hope. Some of her female characters like Hattie in “Quiet Night” are unapologetically cruel, and others are racist. Some of her men take the blame for crimes they did not commit as they see glory in the destruction of others and themselves. Although known as a writer who plumbs the minds of her characters, given that these are short stories, I found that Highsmith is more subservient to the exigencies of plot rather than character here, and some of her characters come across as caricatures. I did find one story that I liked very much however, “The Returnees,” which portrays the return of exiles to Germany after WWII and the conflicts that such a move entails; none of the contrivance here, just the heartache of re-establishing broken lives and discovering that home can never be home anymore.Altogether, a broad canvas of human situations given that the stories span nearly 45 years of the writer’s life. Some are difficult to engage with, others are predictably tragic, and a few gems defy the stereotype and stick out occasionally. I am sure Highsmith’s loyal fans will enjoy this book, but it may be a skewed introduction for someone picking this book as the first to read in her oeuvre. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 15, 2013","Mar 03, 2013","Feb 15, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85781.Nothing_That_Meets_the_Eye

Where The Shadow of the Wind is an exercise in plot gymnastics and The Angel’s Game gets lost in a plot maze, The Prisoner of Heaven is the easiest to follow with the usual twin but linear story lines, each a generation apart, converging in the late 1950’s Barcelona – a great gothic novel setting.This book is really the third in the sequence, having gone through Shadow and its prequel Angel. The usual cast of characters return: the Semperes, David Martin, Fermin and a cameo appearance by the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. The novel also borrows from the plot of Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo, replete with escaping prisoners in body bags. Despite David Sempere’s narration, the story is really that of the skeletal Fermin, described as comprising only of “cartilage and attitude,” a truly larger than life character who spews his street philosophy at every turn: “Everything can be forgiven in this world except telling the truth,” “Flags are painted rags that represent rancid emotions,” and on he goes...In the first story line, Fermin, who works at the Semperes’ bookstore, is preparing for his marriage to Bernarda, and being dogged by a mysterious stranger from his past. Daniel goes to help and discovers a secret involving his wife Bea. The second story line, set a generation back, takes place in a prison following the Spanish Civil War, where Fermin, Martin and others, are in custody under the evil governor Mauricio Valls. Mauricio is a mediocre writer harbouring grandiose plans for literary fame under the Franco regime. He wants Martin to re-write his books into literary works. Martin appears to be going insane due to the death of Daniel’s mother Isabella who was poisoned by Valls – you begin to see how the two plot lines intersect. The interesting thing for a writer reading this story is that all of the principal cast are either writers or connected with books, and the agony of dying an unrecognized author or of having ones work destroyed by a repressive regime such as Franco’s is brought vividly to life.The one deliberate contrivance that got to me was the ending of the book that was far from conclusive, even though the dust jacket claims that each of these works could be read as stand-alone pieces. Unlike in Shadow, Zafon keeps a lot of questions unanswered and spends the time setting us up for Book # 4 that will see the resurgence of Valls, Martin and the entire principal cast of The Prisoner of Heaven, trying to bring matters to closure (we hope!) Given how short this book is, I wonder whether it is a deliberate attempt by the publisher to get a two-fer deal instead of giving the whole plot away like was done in Shadow of the Wind? ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 10, 2013","Feb 15, 2013","Feb 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13623012-the-prisoner-of-heaven

I was reminded of the latest Bond movie, “Skyfall,” there the aging 007 is also in a similar predicament, being sidelined by younger, more digital operatives.Rebus is retired but hanging on in the Cold Case unit, that is also facing closure as police forces in Scotland integrate and combine but do not necessarily co-operate in the digitized era. He is looking to rejoin the CID at the slightest opening but he has pissed off too many people in his past life there and cares not to schmooze himself up the corporate hierarchy (that is one “old practice” that has not yielded to Internet 2.0) unlike his more successful colleagues. And yet he is the guy who finds the bodies and solves the murders while the all the other cops in Scotland are running around, digging the up the countryside and turning up empty.The plot surrounds the disappearance of several women over a number of years, some recorded in the Cold Case unit prior to when instant photos could be uploaded via cell phones, and others after social media went mainstream. Despite technology, this is still the typical plodding police procedural where every lead has to be followed, often leading to dead-ends. There are lots of characters to keep track of, all who are addressed by their last names, even the women. The mob is thrown in for additional sauce but all they serve is to complicate the mystery. However, we get a visceral tour of northern Scotland as Rebus follows the winding Highway A9 to the locations where the dead women were found, all connected via a single photograph of a site possibly linked to a serial killer.I cared not for the story, nor for the eventual unravelling of the murderer, which I thought was a bit thin in the plot department. I did however enjoy the character of Rebus, the compulsive cop, who is good for nothing else but police work, and is facing a retired life of booze and cigarettes if he is not allowed to hunt down more cases. He is also a compassionate cop and uses his heart as much as his head to get his man. The only person who appreciates his merits is his former partner, Siobhan Clarke, and despite his getting kicked off the case many times, the two of them always end up together, she on the official side, he on the outside, trading notes and getting results much to the chagrin of their superiors and the criminals.This was my first Rebus novel.

But my novel, The Ulysses Man, began in 1961 and Ondaatje’s is set in 1954, and I realized that a lot happened to change that country and its people in-between. While I saw the island slide into the abyss of civil war, Ondaatje left when the colony was still strong and there was much to give up in leaving. A sea voyage, free of parental control, for pre-teen kids must be a liberating experience, and yet it is a restricted one because they are now in another relationship with the adults, living around them in confining quarters and bound by the rules of the ship. To emphasise this fact, Michael, the narrator, and his friends Cassius and Ramadhin are relegated to the Cat’s Table, the lowest rank in the hierarchy of the dining room. As typical kids, they grab their freedom by smoking in various nooks and crannies, smuggling a dog on board, stealing goodies from the First Class section, and even lashing their puny bodies to a mast during a storm to feel its deathly wrath. Viewed from the child’s perspective, the adults are full of secrets; allegiances form and unravel as the ship heads from Ceylon to England via the Suez Canal. Ondaatje paints a colourful cast of characters: the reclusive millionaire seeking a remedy for hydrophobia; the teacher who keeps Ceylon alive in his mind by burning a hemp rope in his cabin; the botanist with a garden of exotic plants in the hold, not all of them benign; the dog trainer who plays Bridge at night in Michael’s cabin; the spinsters on the hunt for an eligible bachelor; the dumb man and the deaf girl with their secret identities; the mysterious prisoner who walks the decks in chains at night. The sea voyage and the events that transpire aboard are pivotal events in the three boys’ lives, for their futures are shaped by this journey: Michael, the insightful observer, becomes a writer (autobiographical, I think), Cassius evolves into a loud, distrustful artist and Ramadhin’s legacy haunts his survivors. The novel branches out into the future intermittently, to capture the lives of some of the other players in the “mystery” that occurred on the voyage, leaving Michael to put the pieces together as an adult and understand the plot and its consequences, something he never quite got as a child.I found this the easiest to read of Ondaatje’s novels. The style is personal and simple, devoid of poetical meandering. The flow is based on memory and various periods of the narrator’s life are explored at random and anchored back to that fateful sea voyage. The passage through the Suez Canal is for the history books given that we skip right over that route in an airplane these days. And yet Ondaatje’s use of gesture is powerful, where, for instance, the deliberate shifting of a woman’s shoulder strap heralds the ending of a relationship. And his use of colonial words like “Blaggard,” which I can’t find in a North American dictionary, is delicious!The voyagers on the ship never really find a permanent home in their later years. “We don’t belong anywhere, I guess,” says the adult Michael to fellow shipmate and cousin, Emily, years later on a remote island in Western Canada where she lives alone. My novel too concluded with home being more a state of mind than a place for those who left. And in The Cat’s Table, I wondered if the mysterious prisoner’s final act which sets him adrift into an undefined future is the metaphor for all those who leave their nests: one of being consigned to the uncertain seas of fortune? ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 15, 2013","Jan 22, 2013","Jan 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11076177-the-cat-s-table

In this short novel we see the ""us vs. them"" play of city vs. provincial citizens, with money being the measure of victory.Papa Grandet, Eugenie's father, is by far the most colourful character, a sort of Scrooge on Steroids, out to amass his wealth in the provinces without investing a penny of his own money but by getting others to bear the cost and the risk. He lives a frugal life and doles out carefully measured morsels of his wealth to his family members, keeping them always at a subsistence level. He is also out to avenge his brother who went bankrupt in Paris and died. Eugenie and Charles, the offspring of the elder Grandets, have no such material concerns and give themselves freely to their feelings instead. And yet, by a confluence of circumstances, the younger Grandets end up also amassing large fortunes. The only difference between the young couple is their city (Charles) vs. provincial (Eugenie) upbringing which accounts for their different tastes in fashion and concepts of societal status.In the process of explaining Papa Grandet's money-making schemes, Balzac treats us to a minor lesson in finance which I found to be the one drawback. The well-worn phrase ""Too much information"" was probably not invented in his time. That said, his descriptions are photographic - probably needed at a time when photography was not invented.The clear message here is that the rich will always attract money, just like the wealthy Cruchot and des Grassins families keep pursuing Eugenie as a prize bride for their male progeny.

And to add to the confusion, according to this book, the state of Israel did not happen when it did, instead the Jews supposedly found refuge in a designated area in Sitka, Alaska after WWII, which in our present day is on the verge of reverting back to the USA, thereby throwing the Jews out into the Diaspora once again. The phantasmagorical elements of this plot take away from the great characters, the in-your-face dialogue, and the awkward and funny situations that keep one reading.Meyer Landsman is an interesting Sitka police dick, efficient and vulnerable, suicidally brave, good at his job and bad at everything else. He also has a knack for getting knocked out and waking up in his underpants. He is estranged from his detective wife and current boss, Bina. Two months away from becoming redundant when the US police force is set to take over the territory, he is investigating the murder of a fellow resident at the fleabag hotel he is staying at since his marriage imploded, an investigation he has been ordered to drop by his boss. In the course of his stubborn investigation we get a tour of the “shysters, charlatans, grift doctors, real-estate hacks, poaches, smugglers, drug mules, chess players, boundary mavens, black hat gangsters”, and other bizarre characters who make up the underbelly of Sitka Jewry. In fact there are too many characters, and too many Yiddishisms in the writing which even the glossary does not cover. When the victim is likened to the possible Messiah, and the culprits are indentified as a band of Hasidic Jews hell bent on reclaiming Israel, the story veers off from the sublime to the ridiculous.Descriptions of the streets, the land, the customs and the people are superb but the writing can be pretentious at times. I liked lines like “...the snow fizzing, and the sizzle each snowflake makes as it hits the top of the gas lamp...,” but ones like “the thin string of carbon and iron atoms that is the consequential feature of a knife blade (describing a knife),” were a bit over the top. There is also a contrived tendency to keep the reader befuddled, with scene shifts occurring frequently in which characters exhibit uncharacteristic behaviour, until a side comment explains everything.Some scenes are downright hilarious: the Messiah’s funeral that turns into a slugfest; Meyer getting shot at, dying (in his mind), rising from the dead and vanquishing his opponents (not sure if there is a Biblical message here); Meyer crawling behind Bina in a labyrinth of tunnels below Sitka, staring upon her generous derriere and re-igniting his passion for her all over again. I think Chabon set out to accomplish too much in the book and falls a bit short. If the Promised Land sub plot line had been excised, this may have been a cleaner narrative: an interesting detective mystery that touches the lives of the principal cast, well drawn quirky characters, and a unique setting. But literary writers are never satisfied with the narrow genre and seem to want to globalize their canvases. Also, I wondered if the attempt to subvert history with events that never happened, and never could, undermines the realism of this novel. I can relate better to the fictional premise of Sherlock Holmes having tangled with Jack the Ripper, but the Jews of Sitka planning world disruption? Hmm... And I never did come across a police union, catchy though the title is, unless that said union was the rather tenuous relationship between Meyer and Bina.   ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 30, 2012","Jan 13, 2013","Dec 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16703.The_Yiddish_Policemen_s_Union

He seems to be a man with no past, meticulous in his habits; he interests the young girl in classical music, releasing a passion in her that she carries to great lengths in her adult years. Both have tyrannical caregivers in their formative years—Sheila’s harried mother and Sigmund’s prejudiced grandfather—they have absentee fathers, and both share a passion for music that lifts them out of their loveless worlds. Sheila falls madly in love with this older man who suddenly disappears when he receives a visitor bearing revelations about his past.The second half of the book fast-forwards to the present, where Sheila is in a marriage of convenience, is the proprietor of a burgeoning music business, and has a rebellious teenage daughter herself. Sigmund contacts her out of the blue and wants her to attest to his character because he is being “investigated” as a suspected Nazi who worked the death camps.The story moves at a relentless pace, hard to put down, and Sheila is forced to confront the fact that this kind and generous man she loves could have been a ruthless killer, if only to save his own life. Would we make the same decisions if our life would be spared only if it meant the taking of another’s? What makes this book stand out is that there are no perfect endings: both Sheila and Sigmund are scarred and they can only behave in ways in which they have been conditioned to behave, leaving a trail of troubled relationships and irrational behaviour behind them. The resolution of the novel leaves Sheila with great loss but with clarity of what she must continue to do in order to keep going, like Sigmund had to do after the war.The writing is well done. Short sentences say a lot. Sheila’s runaway years are described as “Had her second abortion. Graduated. Hitch hiking: a little feel up here, a little deep-throat there,” etc. Each scene is imbued with conflict and tension - hallmarks of great fiction writing. I wondered why the baby Jewish girl, a vital symbol in this novel, was taken into the gas chamber in her clothes, when Jews were routinely ordered to undress and step into the “showers” to meet their impending executions?

Perhaps, these inconsistencies add to the overall theme of incomplete and incomprehensible lives brought about by a major cataclysm.As for the adult Sheila’s life, which, unlike Sigmund’s, was untouched by the Holocaust, I wondered whether the author was making a statement on the state of our 21st century families trapped in their materialistic prisons: loveless marriages, mistresses, lost teenage children, abortions, and an obsession with making money. Despite his troubled past, I wondered whether Sigmund’s greatest gift to Sheila was not the music after all but the message that “you can’t take it with you when you go, and that love and forgiveness are more soul-satisfying.” A great debut novel from a writer who has plumbed the heart of the matter....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 22, 2012","Dec 30, 2012","Dec 22, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15903978-living-underground

Wells is described as a comet that arrived out of obscurity in the late 19th century, blazed over the literary firmament for the next few decadesH.G. Wells is described as a comet that arrived out of obscurity in the late 19th century, blazed over the literary firmament for the next few decades and then faded away, perhaps to return sometime in the future.A brilliant futurist who foresaw events like the World Wars (he saw only one, occurring in the 1950’s), World Government (the United Nations and its predecessor, the League of Nations), the birth of Socialism, and air power that would globalize warfare. Born to humble origins, he became a world-famous novelist who never had trouble getting his books published and who lived an affluent life off his writing. His vision of the utopian world bordered on Nazism: run by professional managers, where the People of the Abyss (poor, sick, unemployed, criminals et al) would be eliminated, and where free love would proliferate.It is his vision of free love that overpowers the book, for we delve into his complex world of love affairs more than into his vast oeuvre. Wells was sexually obsessed and needed a woman to look after him and provide him vigorous sexual exercise all the time, even if they were not one and the same person. It was unfortunate that the two women he married were weak in the sack, yet they provided the perfect cover of a respectable marriage behind which he could engage in his pasades. And there are many lovers: from the wives of his friends to the daughters of his friends, to ardent students struck in awe of his artistic vision. And when these women are in short supply there are also prostitutes. Children born out of wedlock are provided for, as are their unfortunate mothers. This short man with a high pitched voice, given to fumbling over his words, possesses a magical sexual charisma and he does exploit it well in this book.We get a glimpse into the conflicts at the Fabian Society, a precursor to the Labour Party in England. Wells is a promising star in this organization until his various affairs bring unwarranted attention and his concepts of free love and professional management run afoul of stalwarts in the organization such as George Bernard Shaw. There is also an exchange of letters throughout the novel between Wells and Henry James, a face-off between the practical novelist and the literary one. James admired Wells’ commercial success, something he could never achieve in his lifetime, yet he was critical of Wells wanting to change the world in his novels while James wanted to only describe it. Just as he was pilloried many times with damaging s by those closest to him (including lovers), Wells permanently damages his relationship with James by releasing a book, Boon, that caricatures the dying literary writer.David Lodge uses a clever device to intersperse Wells’ life story with a fictional interview between the ailing author and an interviewer (who is also Wells) taking place in 1944 during the London blitzkrieg, two years before Wells died. In this interview, we discover that Wells has declined as an author, his books, the ones published after World War I, are no longer being read, his visionary powers have dimmed and the insignificance of death is creeping upon him. And his women have died or deserted him. The interviewer holds the mirror to Wells, and the dying author defends himself where he is able to, and eats crow when he has no other option. The Fall of Man, indeed.Wells was a dreamer indeed, trying to forge the world to conform to his extreme appetites. And yet, Free Love does not account for greed and jealousy which Wells himself was prone to, especially when his former lovers married younger men. But he was a very lucky man indeed, to have wives and lovers - whom he constantly betrayed - faithfully edit and type his manuscripts, to have his novels catch the zeitgeist nearly every time, and to escape reputational damage from his dangerous liaisons.As much as he is loathsome, he is enigmatic and engaging, and is indeed a passing comet, the likes of which we will not see for a long time, perhaps never. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 09, 2012","Dec 22, 2012","Dec 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9372166-a-man-of-parts

Wherever they are, “Getting Goa out of the Goan” remains a difficult task, and their indomitable spirits (alcoholic or ghostly), lusts, foibles and religious obeisance stand out as unique markers. Having read all his novels, I got the impression that these 10 short stories came out as part of Antao’s exploration of the background and characters in those earlier works and therefore are an essential complement to that oeuvre. He also presents the Goan reader, his prime audience, with a dual experience via a translation of the same stories into Konkani on the reverse side of the book.The female psyche is explored in the stories “Maria Elena” and “Margarita.” The former is a prudish, scholarly colonial with a superiority attitude towards the locals and her former colonial masters, and yet she is inferior in her selection of love partners, among them, a Spanish waiter and her elderly uncle, both named Armando. Margarita, on the other hand, is the sultry wife of an expatriate, alone in Goa, and daringly exploring her sexuality without family around.The male character, Antao’s natural strength, is portrayed in several dimensions: Jovino, the crooked playboy on the hunt for any “available” woman, married or otherwise; the antagonistic Goan immigrants in Canada who display their one-upmanship over each other at a house party; the amoral Jacinto, who is willing to offer the bank manager his wife as collateral for a loan; the career climber, Frank, who has to change his game once he gets to Canada, and the rich simpleton, Xavier, who has to suffer the ignominy of his community for being weak in bed and therefore separated from his attractive young wife.The subtext is rich. Is there a sexual relationship between Father Tom and his favourite altar boy Mark, hinted to by the boy’s excessive washing of the priest’s hands during mass? Is Frank the job hopper seeing more than just career opportunities when he accepts his admin assistant Rachelle’s suggestion to pick up golf? Is Sebastian entering the madhouse never to leave (reminding me of the song Hotel California – ""you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave."") when the priest sends his taxi away?The last two stories, “The Guardian Angel” and “The Curse,” may sound corny by western standards but they are important in highlighting the world of superstition, and the juxtaposition of heaven, hell and earth in the life of the Goan. Roman Catholicism—with its rosaries, novenas, masses, and otherworldly spirits—is indelibly woven into the heart and soul of the Goan, despite his lustful transgressions in life.What also must be mentioned is the geography, food, transportation, ceremonies and landmarks of Goa that Antao richly layers throughout the stories.This is a good masala of stories that plays out in tempos that range from a fado to a mando, with lots of colourful characters drawing for us a lifestyle frozen in time, one that has probably vanished today as India rapidly modernizes to join the league of First World nations, where everything is the same and nothing is interesting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2012","Dec 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16194457-a-madhouse-in-goa-and-nine-other-stories

I noticed that there were noTo attempt to comment on this novel written in the ‘60’s by a revered Canadian feminist is bound to get a guy in trouble. I noticed that there were no other Goodreads s for this book even though its star ratings ranged from 4 – 1. Perhaps no one wants to risk controversy. So let me step out boldly, or foolishly; to observe objectively, or “put my foot in it,” as they say.Sarah Porlock (re-christened Bastard by herself,) is a confused academic who looks down on all things Canadian: its cities, its education system, its literature, and its way of life. The ‘60’s must have been a pretty shabby period in Toronto the Good, especially for an educated woman coming of age and wanting to embrace her own destiny. Sarah is single but secretly wrestles with the question of whether it would be better to be married like her sisters and be “normal”; but normal is to capitulate, so she wears her rebelliousness like a badge of courage, her way of standing out in the crowd. Her lovers are borrowed husbands, including, at least, one of her sisters’ spouses; the other brothers-in-law are intellectually and emotionally in her crosshairs too, but as Sarah is not overtly descriptive of sex, despite her liberated status, we will never know if they were ever romantically ensnared with her as well.A trip to Europe with a lover (another borrowed husband, Joe) and a resulting fling with brother- in-law, Sandro, enlightens her. She returns to Canada determined to quit her job and emigrate to...to where exactly we do not know. She believes that “edgy” and “creative” lies in Europe, and “smug” belongs to Canada. So, while her older, married and “smug” sisters remain in Canada, Sarah needs to break free. A series of farewell parties and farewell scenes ensue, with Sarah saying goodbye to everyone and every haunt in Toronto, while her family and colleagues implore her to stay and appreciate the bounty of her homeland. She finally makes it as far as Montreal and we will never know whether this idealistic, multi-generational Canadian flower-child from the privileged side of the tracks, bestowed with a good education, good connections and a cradle-to-grave support structure, ever left Canada’s shores. I find in reading these stream of consciousness novels that ramble all over the place, one is best served by not trying to figure out the story-line but to let it emerge, patchy and sketchy, as one enjoys the incisive writing instead; and the writing is fresh and cutting. Sarah, the first person narrator, is an unsympathetic character, ridden with sibling envy, uncommitted, undependable, selfish, and with premonitions of an early death (not unlike the author’s, who died at 52). Sandro describes her best: “Sarah still lives in a dream. And she does not know yet what she wants to be. Unless she marries, she will stay a child.” If there was to be a sequel, I hope Sarah finally grows up and remains in Canada, because as we all know, “the grass ain’t greener....” I am not sure how autobiographical this novel is, but from the afterword we understand that the author was also an academic in those dastardly ‘60’s, but she married, travelled the world, raised children, returned to Canada and made a great contribution to Canadian letters. Perhaps, Sarah was only an earlier iteration of the author’s life, if at all.This novel opens a window on the inferiority complex under which our best and brightest in Canada seemed to live in the ‘60’s. Perhaps Sarah Bastard is an example of the first attempts to break free of this stranglehold. Yet, given that she never made it past Quebec, it makes one wonder, whether this was an early half-assed attempt at best, like Flower Power and Occupy Wall Street, and whether the real breakthrough from the colonial yoke came a generation later?...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Dec 2012,"Dec 10, 2012","Dec 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1803200.Sarah_Bastard_s_Notebook

I wish myA panoramic novel, spanning centuries, where the tragic heroine is Mother South Africa, whose children are unable to live together in peace. I wish my school history books had been written like this, with the insertion of fictional characters to bring story and life into what is normally a dull narrative.After a preface on the early Bushman who inhabited the land since pre-historic times, the story follows the lineage of the Afrikaner Van Doorn, English Saltwood and Zulu Nxumalo families, from the arrival of the first Europeans in the mid 17th century to the end of the 1970’s. Dominant members of each of these families shape and are shaped by the history of the country. There are dozens of stories within this book, tragic, dramatic, humorous and downright inhuman, all extremely interesting and well rendered. The intent of the novel in its 1100 pages seems to be to capture the history South Africa and therefore we see characters enter and exit quickly along with their stories, with only a few like Tjaart and Detleef Van Doorn, Hillary and Laura Saltwood, Jonathan and Daniel Nxumalo and the timeless General Paulus De Groot leaving larger footprints than their relatives.The clash of white and black cultures is evident from the beginning when the Europeans land in Cape Town in the mid 17th century and migrate north as far as the boundary with Zimbabwe over generations, while the blacks in the form of the resident Hottentots, the Xhosa from across the Great Fish River, and their northern Zulu cousins separated by the Drakensburg range, all drift south seeking boundless grazing land for their herds. The Dutch Afrikaner and his nomadic cousin, the Boer, are portrayed as fierce, independent individuals, willing to fight against insurmountable odds, who in their Calvinistic faith believe that this land was given to them, by God’s covenant and that like the different colours of jelly, the various colours of race shouldn’t mix. The English, who arrive in 1805, are more interested in empire and the abolition of slavery, while the blacks simply want their land back, and the Coloureds reflect the sin of miscegenation. Mixed in with the fictional characters are real life individuals, three in particular: Shaka of the Zulu, Cecil Rhodes and Lord Kichener, men who never married, wreak havoc in the country in their misguided intention of maintaining order.Loyalties shift between the ethnic groups during each generation as they jockey for pole position. There is even a time when the Afrikaners throw in their lot with the Germans during the two world wars of the 20th century to be rid of the British, while the Xhosa starve themselves to death under the illusion that the Russians are coming to their aid after the Crimean War. The British are no better and open concentration camps at the end of the Boer War where many women and children die of typhoid, dysentery and other diseases.All this evolution only leads to South Africa’s darkest phase, when the Afrikaner Nationalist Party gains control in 1948 and institutes a form of Nazism called Apartheid. Horrible things happen during this time: whites have to carry Life Books with them detailing every incident in their life to protect their racial purity, Coloureds are to be deprived of their vote, blacks are given “Bantustans” (segregated homelands), transgressors of any colour are “banned” from public life indefinitely, and suspicion rules the land – for instance, the lack of freckles could imply that you are Coloured. The irony is that when racial investigations are initiated, even the “purest of the pure” are found to have some miscegenation somewhere up their family tree, making the whole issue of racial purity, in a land where early European male settlers could not find wives easily, a bit of a joke. It’s a pity that Michener ends his narrative in 1979, with Apartheid at its worst, with scores of the best and brightest fleeing the country for places like Canada and Australia, with blacks massing for revolution over in Mozambique, and with 400 years of evolution leading the country only to its worst boiling point. God’s Covenant, indeed - Calvin would be turning in his grave!We all know that Apartheid ended in the 1990’s and South Africa still lurches trying to find its feet under its new balance of power, and therefore this story has no ending, yet. Michener shows hope however, when he parallels Phillip Saltwood’s tireless search for diamonds, which finally yields the possibility of a find, to the search for peace in the land by its various leaders who are mining for diamonds in their fellow citizens’ souls.As for the fate of the panoramic novel, I think it has less hope than South Africa has, given the shrinking of attention spans these days. I took nearly a month to finish this book, engrossing though it was, and am unlikely to pick up another Michener tome for a long time to come.

In this second book in the series, it is time for Cromwell to shuffle the chairs on deck again and get rid of the queen he installed three years ago, Anne Boleyn, because she is unable to produce a male heir and has been rumoured to be behaving inappropriately with her courtiers, and mainly because she is making him nervous with her ambition that could unseat his position of influence with His Majesty. Cromwell’s insecurity and desire to be scandal-free leads him to live a sterile life after his wife, daughters and sisters pass away prematurely.Henry is a playful megalomaniac, roaming the country with his travelling court, scrounging off rich nobles, fancying himself a jouster yet getting knocked off his horse, and casting a roving eye on innocent damsels who might produce him an heir, knowing full well that his decaying body will not co-operate. Henry justifies the removal of his wives by inventing something that they did wrong and leaves Cromwell to put meat on that bone. And our Cremuel does so with marvelous manipulation; Katherine in the previous book, and Anne in this one, and the other three in the next books in this series that are undoubtedly to follow. Cromwell, unfortunately, will not last the run of Henry’s wives (six in total) for history tells us that Henry got bored with his jack-of-all-trades fixer and off’d Cremuel after wife #4 soured. But this book comes before all that and focuses on the demise of wife # 2, Anne: beautiful lady of the French court, ambitious for her own line to be part of British royalty (which she achieved posthumously through her daughter Elizabeth I), supposedly guilty of many amorous affairs as Queen with none proven, but all of which that provide Cromwell with grist for his executioner’s mill.For all their privilege, these royals have the hardest time procreating, testament perhaps to in-breeding, high infant mortality, and the sheer pressure that a birth caused in the power structures upholding the monarchy. Women are breeders and men are schemers, and the tell-tale sign of a swelling royal belly sets many sub-plots in motion. The courtiers and court ladies are a bunch of snakes, willing to tell-tales to save their own skin.Anne comes across as cold and unsympathetic, and one wonders whether her fate was pre-ordained given the stakes she played in. Her unseated rival, Katherine, is an old crone, dying in a convent, and the wannabe queen-in-waiting, Jane Seymour (pronounced Semer), is a plain, virtuous woman who will, no doubt, bore Horny Henry after a couple of rolls in the royal sack. And on the macro level, Henry’s amorous adventures are creating tremors among his allies and enemies, notably the Holy Roman Emperor, the Roman Catholic Church, and the French court. Cromwell has to balance all these variables as he spins his web. To his credit, he is a visionary and hopes that one day England will be a great socialist nation where the rich will be taxed to pay the wages of the poor.Although there are no good people here, the story circles around parties, hunts, and back room meetings where plots are hatched and allegiances made and unmade, and one gets a good feel for the lifestyle, sensibilities, and pre-occupations of the period. Henry’s obsessive rambling on Anne’s unfaithfulness is a bit tedious, as is the author’s insistence on calling Cromwell “he” all the time. After awhile we get our “he”s mixed up, especially when two or more male characters are in a scene together. Even the additional qualifier “he, Cromwell” is a clumsy compensation.I’m not sure that every twist and turn in this book is needed, but it appears that the author is trying to stay true to the historical record in this rendition, and in that she has succeeded by breathing vivid life into what must be just a bunch of fraying papers reposing in the British royal archive....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 20, 2012","Nov 07, 2012","Oct 20, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13507212-bring-up-the-bodies

What better person to write about flawed and vulnerable characters!In these tales, occurring around the western islands of Samoa which were occupied by New Zealand and its colonial master, Britain, Maugham brings to life the isolation faced by the westerner; he skillfully depicts how island life strips the foreigner of his dignity, localizes him, and finally destroys him. An about-face of the traditional colonial story, in which the colonizers go in imperiously, and, using a combination of language, laws and religion, civilize the natives. Maugham paints a reverse picture too, of the native transported back to Britain, who finds the climate, customs and culture oppressive enough to destroy.In “Mackintosh,” the colonial master is the old chief, Walker, who has been on the island for so long that he is good for nothing else. He rules with an iron fist with disregard for directives from the capital of Apia. He treats his islanders as his children, yet browbeats and pushes them over the edge when they disobey him. Mackintosh is the newly arrived aide, caught between his brutal master whom he hates, and the local population aching for a better deal. Mackintosh is unable to challenge Walker’s authority and succumbs to getting rid of the old man in the most diabolic way, thus succumbing to the guilt that accompanies his action. In “Pool” we see the marriage between the colonial and his native wife. The marriage is doomed from the start because, he can’t live in Samoa and be increasingly localized by the wife’s family, and she can’t live in Scotland where she is seen taking her traditional pool bath in sub-zero temperatures. She runs away back home to the islands and he follows only to be consumed by joblessness, culture, gossip and alcohol. Hints of sado-masochism emerge in this troubled union, for the wife only respects her husband when he beats her, and then disrespects him when he begs forgiveness for his actions – another sign of their incompatibility.In “Rain” we return to the colonial master using religion as a whip to guilt and subdue his subjects. By classifying every aspect of native behaviour as a “sin,” the missionary, Davidson, converts his flock into “civilized” people. While quarantined on the island of Pago Pago during an outbreak of measles, Davidson sets out to convert a young American prostitute Ms. Thompson. The ever-falling rain on the island during their forced stay acts as a metaphor for entrapment, for both the missionary and his charge are locked in a clash of wills that eventually vanquishes the former. In this case, human nature again shows its weakness, despite the accoutrements of civil conduct and religion.Maugham is a master for subtly upping the stakes, and what begins as a benign situation soon accelerates to a point where death is the only outlet. Although the writing style is a bit dated (this book was published in 1921 and some of the stories written earlier), Maugham’s insight into human behaviour under the pressures of empire, foreign culture and declining fortune is unparalleled. He was obviously one of those writers who saw the cracks in the empire and was unafraid to expose them, while still enjoying a vast following of readers in his day....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 13, 2012","Oct 20, 2012","Oct 13, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99661.Rain_and_Other_South_Sea_Stories

And as McEwan ages, his heroes follow him from middle age to old age; like him, they are successful in their fields, and are predictably thrown into a pivotal event that has long term implications to their lives and to those around him. The hero in Solar is one of the most slothful: Michael Beard, a short, fat, balding scientist who won the Nobel prize thirty years ago and has not done anything original since except live off the accolades. On top of that he is a rabid Lothario who eats and drinks too much, lives in a dirty flat, has run through five wives and countless mistresses, and, as he nears seventy, realizes that women still find him irresistible despite the organ malfunction that is taking place on an accelerating pace inside his aging body.The extremes of cold and heat, the pillars of climate change that anchor the story, are evocatively drawn when Beard travels to the North Pole on a study trip, and years later, when he is setting up a solar farm in the New Mexico desert. Humour runs through the book, making the heavy subject of alternate energy sources easy to digest: I mean, you do get the feel of how cold it is up north when Beard has to take a pee in a snowstorm and can’t zip his snowsuit up again because he has a frozen you-know-what blocking progress. And as for the heat in New Mexico: Beard gets out of an SUV in 112 degree heat, finds it difficult to breath, and, like a true scientist, remarks “Who would believe that a photon had no mass?”Humour, science and family dysfunction notwithstanding, this book raises some important questions: 1)	Is plagiarism in the name of progress good or bad?2)	Does honour accumulate only where past honour has been bestowed?3)	Can you frame someone for a crime he did not commit, however bad a person he is, and get away with it?4)	Can you run through countless women without running into one who ultimately turns the tables?5)	How much of a change can one individual bring about on earth? Aren’t we just specks in some divine plan, one which even Nobel laureates can only decipher measly fragments of?6)	How long can you fly on yesterday’s glory?7)	How quickly can you go from hero to pariah in today’s networked world with just one damning secret coming to light? 8)	Are the custodians of knowledge (i.e. the scientists) also obstacles to new discoveries that discredit current knowledge or impoverish their business patrons?9)	Is the provision for litigation now a part of the cost of doing business?10)	 Do the children of today care where their parents are as long as they are instantly accessible on the other end of a cell phone?Although the mid-section lagged with too much flashback and science, the story-line in the first and last parts of the book moved well, making for an engaging read.

Enough has been said about the plot, that meanders along a 60 year history, moving Saleem and his family between India and Pakistan and back, revisiting the border wars in which the lines of the two countries were drawn and a third—Bangladesh—was carved out in desperation, and finally arrives at the suspension of civil rights by the Indira Ghandi government and the forced sterilization of the fertile masses by her son Sanjay, with a harsher treatment reserved for the gifted Midnight’s Children, the shit disturbers of the status quo. And enough has been said about Rushdie’s style, his grammar that will make an English teacher faint, its pretentious meanderings that make you scream and say, “Arre - get back to the story, baba!”I am left with the following questions:1)	Why did he write this novel? Was it an attempt to render India’s 20th century history in a fable so that it may be comprehended better, if it ever could be comrehended? Was it an attempt to show how clever he was at coming up with metaphors within metaphors? Was it to thumb his nose at his colonial English teacher and say, “Damn your Shakespeare and Dickens, ma’am – this is how we write colonial English now – get used to it!” He passed on all three counts based on the global reception to this book.2)	Did Rushdie care at all for his readers? This is the most irritating book to read. I skimmed pages sometimes and then discovered that important facts had been littered in the digressions and had to go back to find them. A tedious read. He failed here. Hence my three stars.3)	Why did the Booker committee decide that this should be the Booker of Bookers? Was it a political statement, given Rushdie’s checkered past and his still murky present as a target for those who deny free speech? Or, did the Booker team want to acknowledge that the English language needs to evolve beyond the “prim and proper,” recognizing that this evolution is happening fastest in Britain’s former colonies. 4)	Did Rushdie foreshadow his own life story in depicting the decimation of the talented Midnight’s Children, when he, as one of the world’s most original authors, was emasculated and driven into hiding by a dreaded fatwa shortly thereafter with the publication of his future book The Satanic Verses? Was he trying to say that the gifted in India will only be chewed up in their own land, and that they had to venture abroad, like he did, to realize their talents?A good book leaves many thought provoking questions behind. I found that to be the most redeeming feature of Midnight’s Children. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 14, 2012","Sep 30, 2012","Sep 14, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14836.Midnight_s_Children

In Llosa’s hallmark is the weaving of disparate story lines, often unconnected, into a coherent (or incoherent) whole at the conclusion of his novel. In The Green House, being one of his earlier works, we see the writer either exploring the edges of this style or hopelessly lost in his own creation.Comprised of four or five story lines, some separated by a large time gap in between, each with its unique style, Llosa draws a dramatic canvas of the Amazon and its inhabitants. There are the poor and exploited: native Indian tribes (and I counted about six tribes with very little delineation between them), prostitutes, smugglers, bandits, musicians, even soldiers; and there are the powerful: politicians, clergy, industrialists, and other soldiers. The styles are complicated. Some are stream of consciousness runs-ons, others are spliced dialogue from two different scenes in two different times mixed into one, one is a complete paragraph with many people speaking and only prefaced with a “and (character name)” to identify who is talking, and—to my relief—I found one story line that read like a normal novel. It was as if the young Llosa wanted to confuse his readers with as many literary experiments in his bag of tricks and see who would hang in with him for the entire ride. I wondered whether Llosa was competing with his contemporary Julio Cortazar, who had written a similar book at the time, Hopscotch, which also meanders down alternative routes to its conclusion. Perhaps, a fashion in its time....The stories? Two smugglers reminisce about old times, a mystery man opens a brothel—the Green House—in a small town only to have it razed by a priest and restarted under a different shingle, soldiers and bandits raid native villages in the jungle, industrialists and politicians strategize over control of rubber exports, nuns kidnap native children to “civilize” them, and the desert encroaches on the land by forever spewing it with sand and dust. The Green House symbolizes the savagery of the jungle and it cannot be destroyed despite the futile interventions of the clergy and others. Llosa is also unreserved in his depiction of the cruelty shown by the colonizers towards the indigenous Amazonians, who are robbed, raped, kidnapped and “civilized” at will. Many questions are left unanswered: why do some soldiers defect over to the bandidos, when and how were the latter vanquished, who is the little girl with the Mayor, and why does the author use different names for the same character in different scenes—a crude device to create mystery and suspense, perhaps? The problem with this approach to writing a novel—as much as it is original and stretches the form—is that the author has to jump from one situation to the other like a host at a crowded party, without giving any of his guests his proper attention. Tension is created only to be dissipated when we move to the next scene, and when we return to the original we have forgotten where we left off. More of the overall puzzle is revealed as we delve deeper into the novel but I also feel that we squander the earlier sections for not having known their true import at the time. Perhaps this is a novel that is best appreciated by re-reading or by reading it backwards.Having read several of Llosa’s books, I think he hit his stride with this layered story line style in mid-career when novels like Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter had the right balance and a dramatic fusion of the disparate strands. But then he seems to have strayed again since. I was disappointed with one of his more recent novels, The Storyteller, as much as I was with this one, which left me hanging with a bunch of loose ends far in excess of the ones that were tied up at the end. Maybe he doesn’t care for balance and wholeness and, like the savage Amazon, wants us to catch visceral glimpses of a fragile life within its clutches, incomplete, tragic, violent and sudden—if this is his intent, I think he has succeeded....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 02, 2012","Sep 14, 2012","Sep 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53972.The_Green_House

Two story lines make up this novel: one of the American, ironically named Jonathan Safran Foer, who chronicles the family history dating back to 1791, and the other by the English-challenged tour guide, Alex, who escorts Jonathan on his voyage of discovery to the now- vanished ancestral shtetl.Using a variety of styles—improper English, poetic verse, Joycean sentences that run several pages, italicised dialogue, dialogue without paragraph breaks, translation that repeatssentences, play script etc.,—the narrative takes us on Jonathan’s journey. The added twist is that both Jonathan and Alex are writing different segments of the story and trading their writing to each other via mail and we get Alex’s stilted English correspondence connecting the two halves.The story begins and ends in water, with a Moses-like baby coming out of the river Brod (Jonathan’s great-grandmother to the powern — also named Brod), and the predictive destruction of the shtetl and the drowning of its inhabitants by the Nazis. As in all Holocaust novels, the Nazis provide the grim reckoning, forcing their victims to choose self-preservation in exchange for renouncing everything they hold dear to them: no-win choice, physical death or survivor death. Outside of the Nazi menace, the shtetl and its denizens are quirky and sexually hyperactive (they did not seem to have much else to do but have sex with each other or with themselves) —Jonathan’s grandfather Safran himself is reputed to have had over 130 lovers, comprised mainly of aging widows and panting virgins, and he started at the tender age of 10— we would call that pedophilia today and cast Grandpa as a victim. Contrastingly, Jonathan and Alex are kind of sexless, despite the latter’s claim to penile prowess.The poignant element to me in this novel is the quest for memory, both for recording history by unaffected people like Jonathan so that it is never forgotten, and the dredging up of it with its dire consequences for custodians like Alex’s grandfather and the mystery woman Augustine, both who lived though the destruction of WWII. Not all the missing history is cleared up—and so it should be for a community disrupted by war—but we get a vivid picture of what life must have been during the early years of matriarch Brod and how tragedy marred the life of Grandpa Safran on the night that he finally fell in love. Experimentation is fine but sometimes, it doesn’t quite work. I found the dialogue became difficult to follow who was saying what to whom at times, and the frequent and unnecessary translations slowed down the pace. Also, Alex’s English was a bit overdone in the beginning, although he improved by the end of the book; perhaps his exposure to Jonathan helped here. At the same time, without experimentation this would have been yet another Jew-Nazi novel with its predictable tragic end.This is a great first novel and I look forward to reading more from this very talented and bold writer....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 25, 2012","Sep 02, 2012","Aug 25, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/256566.Everything_is_Illuminated

His two Jewish friends however feel that “a minor indiscretion, or two, does not matter,” and shrug off Treslove, saying that he can never become one of them – there is more to it, than a simple conversion, goy! Unlike the guilt-ridden Treslove, Finkler is a unrepentant womanizer, while the older Libor has had his share of Holywood starlets as a former journalist even though he was devoted to his wife. Both Finkler’s and Libor’s wives have recently died when the novel opens and this adds to Treslove’s guilt for not having loved a wife like Libor did and for not having treated the mothers of his alienated sons with respect. Finkler is the most successful of the three friends, having his own TV show, being the author of a best-selling book and the head of an organization called the Ashamed Jews, which he uses to promote himself while bashing Israel and other Jewish sacred cows. Treslove secretly envies Finkler and tries to outdo his friend in the only thing he feels that he can succeed: being Jewish. Finkler’s soon to be dead wife also envies her unfaithful husband’s success and takes her revenge by having an affair with his best friend: Treslove. Do you see where all this is going? The novel meanders between the three men and their affairs, and their conversations on the Jewish question (or the Finkler Question as Treslove likes to call it), on Israel, on marital fidelity, the BBC (which they dislike!), circumcision and male potency. Sometimes I wonder if this farce is thinly wound around the author’s need to argue the pros and cons around these larger questions, especially the “Finkler one” that lies unresolved for centuries. There is very little story, except for a mugging that sets Treslove on his quest for the Promised Land and Libor’s final solution to his grief (that also adds to Treslove’s guilt!) The dialogue and narrative is in-your-face witty and keeps one reading, and expressions like “Crying Wolf-owitz” and “The Real McGoy” pop up frequently. The author’s philosophy trips off the pages on the Finkler Question and there is even an Eleventh Commandment proposed somewhere.

When I mean told, there is very little dialogue and most of the incidents come out in dribs and drabs, out of sequence, and from a rather unreliable narrator who constantly contradicts his statements. The narrator goes over old ground frequently, mostly trying to reconcile events in his own head, expanding on an already recounted incident or reversing it. A jumbled picture emerges, both of the characters and the storyline.The plot is thin: the English wife is frigid and the American wife has a weak heart. Consequently both marriages have not been consummated. The English wife, a Catholic, is content to preserve her husband’s peccadilloes, covering them up, paying blackmail and helping to cut their losses by running the family finances frugally. The American husband is rich, has never worked in his life, is a bit of a dullard yet is content to protect his fragile wife and her health. However, the American wife and the English husband are having an affair and cheating on their partners in the meantime. All are well meaning individuals and are bound by the conventions of their cultural and social standing. It does not require much imagination to figure out the tragic ending. I suppose the author was experimenting with a new style and he achieves it with this novel, for it takes concentration to read and unravel the various story threads from the messy tangle in which they are presented. Is it a style I prefer? No. I can understand why Madox Ford complained bitterly that although he was Hemingway’s senior and mentor and was responsible for 80plus books and the founding of two noteworthy literary journals that gave debuts to well known writers such as Wyndham Lewis and D.H. Lawrence, he never achieved the recognition he was due. Experimental forms are always going to take place, but to be successful they need to strike a chord with readers. This book unfortunately did not strike any with me. Madox Ford is left praising his own novel in the long dedicatory letter to his wife that prefaces this book, in which he refers to The Good Soldier being “the finest novel in the English language” more than a couple of times in more than a couple of indirect ways.

A time of self-induced routines: champagne breakfasts, sunning, swimming, bridge, cocktails and the annual pilgrimage to Pamplona where the running of the bulls herald death in the afternoon. Some, like the Hemingways survive it, other like the Pounds require it, and yet others like the Fitzgeralds are consumed by it. Hemingway dominates the book, as usual. Convinced that he is destined for greatness in the literary field, he applies himself single-mindedly to his booze and his craft at the expense of family and friends. He befriends literary greats such as Gertrude Stein and Sherwood Anderson only to dump on them in his books. He makes new friends by inviting them to box with him. He craves the support and company of Hadley only to betray her with other women, finally sleeping with both his present wife and future wife, Pauline, in the same bed and asking the former what is wrong, and why can they not continue this arrangement, if but for the stimulation of his writing (and his libido).There is also the love story of Ernest and Hadley, two souls sharing solitary childhoods, domineering mothers, and warm-hearted fathers who each committed suicide with a gun. She is older than him, 28 to his 21, but then even with Pauline, Hemingway seemed to prefer older women (his third and fourth wives were younger; perhaps he was stuck in a “wife time warp”).The cracks in the relationship start to appear as Ernest’s career takes off and Hadley’s is stuck around keeping the home fires burning in their pokey Paris apartment and minding the inconvenient baby who seems to be in the way of his father’s burgeoning greatness. There is also the temptress Pauline, Hadley’s best friend in Paris, who inveigles herself into the Hemingway household and slowly usurps the throne.Paula McLain has done a great job in evoking the period and these two ill-fated lovers, and rendering to us what could have been a very accurate picture of the young Hemingway and his Paris Wife that is not well represented in the biographies and autobiographies that proliferate around this couple.I was left with several truisms: the pure artist is a self-centred person, almost psychotic; nothing gets between him, his art, and the fuel that he needs to deliver that art whether that be wine women or song. Hemingway embodies all of this. In addition, given his war wounds that left him in periods of extreme physical pain, he lived in constant fear of death and sought it out, confronting his mortality in the bull-fights, the big-game hunting, the deep-sea fishing and in trouble spots around the world that he visited, finally facing it down the barrel of his shotgun before tripping the trigger with his toe and leaving us only with his genius. The artist consumed by his art. As for Hadley, and let us not forget that this is her book, narrated from her POV, she outlives her younger husband, marrying again, a more sedentary marriage this time, and lives out the rest of her life in obscurity. I’m not sure, given her innate weakness and better sense of balance, that she was capable of anything more. And yet Hemingway reminisces towards the end of his days that Hadley was the great love of his life, not just the Paris Wife, but the best one....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 17, 2012","Aug 07, 2012","Jul 17, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8683812-the-paris-wife

I was also looking for a jolly good adventure to bring that period alive. On the first count, I was lucky; there is a lot of historical detail here, factual and fictional; but on the second, I lucked out as that same level of detail and the pre-occupation with nautical intricacies trumps what could have been a very good story.Given that this is about the twelfth novel in the Kydd series, the heroes Kydd and his confidential secretary, Renzi, must be well entrenched with their readership. But being my first read, I was looking for some depth in these men; all I saw were master calculators, incapable of fear or doubt, incessantly plotting their next moves; only Renzi shows a bit of emotion when he contemplates asking for the hand of Cecilia, Kydd’s sister, in marriage.The plot centres around the British flotilla that sets out in the aftermath of the Battle of Trafalgar to expand the British Empire, now that the Brits have their nemesis across the Channel on the defensive. First stop: Cape Town, which is still ruled by the declining Dutch who are in turn under the protection of Napoleonic France since they were overtaken at home and rechristened the Batavian Republic. The British gain quick advantage as the Dutch army retreats into the mountains surrounding the Cape and the incumbent governor surrenders. Renzi is appointed acting colonial secretary and adopts a policy of minimum change and involvement, in exchange for taxes, to get the local populace onside. There is a rumour however that the French are mustering a land and sea attack on Cape Town to re-take the colony. Our heroes set off to find out how and where: Renzi going overland into the interior to visit his constituents and make enquiries, and Kydd patrolling the coast around Cape Town. Both finally stumble on the plot in their own way and their paths converge as they attempt to wrest this new threat to the burgeoning British Empire. The novel is ripe with information of the perils encountered when sailing in convoy or on patrol in foreign seas; of storms, enemy ships, treacherous waters and hostile coasts. It diligently covers life in Cape Town at the dawn of the 19th century and is very detailed on sea manoeuvres, land battles and the politics of the period. There is even a chapter on the funeral ceremony of Admiral Lord Nelson in England, which has no bearing on the story at all other than to symbolize the glory of Empire, a cause these men willingly give their lives for.As the French plot emerges, the novel takes on a James Bond type flavour, replete with the criminal mastermind giving the captured Renzi a detailed overview of plans for the assault to take back Cape Town. One is left twittering one’s thumbs waiting for the hero to turn the tables on the villain supported by the cavalry (in this case the navy, led by Kydd) that arrives in the nick of time.A book heavy on plot and detail, but thin on character, such as this, makes for a quick read and does not leave one with the delectable aftertaste of contemplation....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 02, 2012",not set,"Jul 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13592704-conquest

Apparent peace that is, for both countries are dressing up warships as merchant vessels and stirring up trouble along their sea routes, jockeying into position for when the next war breaks out. War is a good business; a panacea for unemployment, a means of acquiring new markets and extending colonial empires. Peace is to be decried. Nothing much has changed today it appears, just the technology and the positioning.Lewrie is an honest rake and uses women for entertainment, just like his father Sir Hugo. Young Alan embodies the life of a sailor who makes hay while in port and then risks his life and works his ass off for king and country while at sea. Some of his women strike back however and give our hero his well deserved comeuppance.

The characters themselves are shallow and one wonders, that given the bloody business they were engaged in—where hundreds died in the most brutal ways in the various skirmishes at sea—could they afford to be anything but cursory? The battle scenes are well rendered, and if one can stand lots of gore, they hold attention. Also the power dynamics of navy, army and civilian leaders employed on a secret mission sanctioned by the King, interacting with each other in the close confines of a naval convoy, are well articulated.What I found weak was the dialogue-heavy plot movement. Characters speak or speculate on where the story is going next and that comes across as a bit contrived. Lambdin has obviously created a very durable anti-hero in Alan Lewrie. That, plus the immense sea chest of incidents that are recorded during the Age of Sail, will make for a rather long and successful series for the author who has a firm command of matters nautical. Lewrie will however have to remain at sea for this is very squarely a series of that genre....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 27, 2012","Jul 02, 2012","Jun 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/75289.The_King_s_Privateer

Although shy and gangly, 17 year old Midshipman Hornblower is The first in the Hornblower series and an introduction to the brave but mercurial hero. Although shy and gangly, 17 year old Midshipman Hornblower is brave despite his inner fears, willing to take incredible risks, is well read compared to his colleagues, is tone-deaf, and honours his commitments even if they commit him to captivity or put him in harm’s way. He embodies the phrase “Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun.” This novel is a collection of linked short stories showing the trajectory of the young midshipman from his first arrival aboard ship (he actually gets seasick in the shore boat rowing him over) until he earns a lieutenant’s commission for his achievements. And those achievements are many: duelling colleagues who insult him, commandeering enemy ships and losing them, steering enemy fire ships away from the fleet, helping an émigré imperialist French battalion’s abortive attempt at regaining their country from the revolutionaries, being quarantined at sea to save his fleet from the plague, attacking Spanish galleons, and finally enduring captivity in Spain until his liberation.Hornblower, for all his bravado, is a fallible young man, unworldly, yet singular in his pursuit of duty to his country in the most honourable way. He wins as much as he loses. His self-doubt and “feel the fear and do it anyway” approach make him a very sympathetic and endearing character. He tends to grow on you.Forester writes in ‘naval speak’ and this book is a good primer on all the moving parts of a sailing ship of yore, of its typical experiences at sea and of the techniques of sailing, especially in times of duress. The narrative is stilted but helps evoke the period and its rigid rules of conduct. The short story format however glosses over the inner motivations of the characters in favour of recording incidents and bringing them to resolution. Apart from our hero, the supporting cast does not stand out, other than the Duchess of Wharfedale in the last story.The Hornblower series has spawned a whole industry of followers, but reading this first book, I understand why it holds its own. It romanticises this colonial period with touches of ironic humour and serves us up an honourable hero while others have riffed off this standard to produce more jagged versions of the original. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 22, 2012","Jun 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/84748.Mr_Midshipman_Hornblower

It also left me wondering whether this was a novel being narrated in memoir format as claimed, or a memoir masquerading as a novel.Written in lyrical, essay-like chapters, some a few lines, some a few pages, the narrator, Yalini, a twenty-two year old Tamil student born in the USA visits Toronto to care for a dying uncle and attend her cousin’s Arranged Marriage wedding. In the ensuing period she revisits family history on both sides, going back several generations, and unearths quite a few skeletons in the family closet.The Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka, since the country’s independence from Britain in 1948 (and not in 1947 as implied), permeates the entire novel, and separates as much as it unites Tamils between those who remain in the struggle back in the homeland and those who flee to other lands and support the war to appease their conscience and stay engaged. Yalini will always be the outsider looking in and is viewed somewhat scornfully by her 18-year old cousin Janani who is straight off the boat, committed to the cause, disdainful of the West and yet marrying a Toronto based mobster who in turn is funding the conflict back home on the proceeds of his illicit deals. This arranged marriage also symbolizes the formalizing of the Tamil conflict abroad and exposes its global tentacles.The style of the narrative is poetic but borders on the sentimental and melodramatic, with lines often repeated for effect than for substance. Yet one is able to forgive this 22year old who is in awe of all things “back-home”—a condition of those born abroad who feel dislocated, live in awe of their parents’ chequered pasts and think that the grass is more alive on the other side, though bloodier. And there are no referees in cricket, dear Yalini, only umpires—take note! The characters do not come alive to me in this format and are mere sketches, even though their personal stories are interesting. The author is courageous however, in tackling the thorny LTTE practices that finally ended up getting that organization proscribed as a terrorist group in the West, but she shies away from naming its leader by his real name, probably because he was still alive when this book was published.The unfortunate loser in this novel is poor Canada, and as a Canadian, I took notice. My beloved adopted land is portrayed as open to misuse, allowing avowed terrorists to enter and avail of our generous medical system, while our government at the time turns a blind eye on terrorist funding sources that flourish and fan carnage abroad. I can see why the incoming Conservative government with their “let’s get tough on crime” push and “don’t play us for a sucker” stance on immigration was so popular at the time. This is a bold first novel, and judging from the author’s educational background and the editorial clout listed in the credits, she has had much support in bringing this book to life. But I question whether the elaborate detailing of wedding and funeral ceremonies, however exotic they may appear to Westerners, makes for good literature, or whether the elimination of quotation marks that separate dialogue from narrative—especially in this style of writing—makes for easy reading, or whether the mixing of tenses is cool grammar. But who are we to question the evolution of the novel? Wherever it lands next—this style or some other prevailing—that will become the new normal; just as the Tamils will have to accept the new normal of Sri Lanka, where their place is even more in question after the end of the civil war.The grass is not really alive on the other side, dear Yalini. Perhaps that is the underlying intent of this novel, to reveal the post-1948 Tamil condition and then to retreat, never to prescribe or take sides. It is a heavy yoke and will pre-occupy Sri Lankan Tamil writers, both at home and abroad, for a very long time....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 07, 2012","Jun 12, 2012","Jun 07, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2524055.Love_Marriage

I haven’t read the protagonist, or thieftaker (a.k.a. detective), Benjamin Weaver’s earlier episodes, but in this book he is blackmailed into spying on the Company to uncover secrets that even he is not told about. From this murky beginning a plot unfolds with revelation upon revelation that renders all that has gone on before irrelevant. Over-plotted, was my take, a situation requiring frequent analysis, summing up and explaining. Over-plotting also complicates the dramatic arc of a novel and the rhythm of this tale takes on more of a see-saw motion rather than building towards a heady climax. And yet it is the era (circa 1722), the Company and the supporting cast who are of interest, even though the plot meanders down a confusing maze. Ellershaw, the company executive, is the ultimate pointy-haired boss with his lack of relationship management skills, people management skills, teamwork skills and all the other soft skills of leadership. He is overtly racist and a bigot. The Company is a place of secrets and partisanship, a place where innovation is sacrificed for the bottom line, where even murder will be condoned if it fattens the coffers, however temporarily. The Fleet prison area of London and its strange “rules” play a prominent role, as do French spies, silk weavers, phaeton chases (the 18th century equivalent of car chases), and an extraordinary inventor, bigamist and bi-sexual by the name of Absalom Pepper, whose invention everyone seems to want, for better or worse. Weaver excels as a detective, is noble, brave and witty but is overtly verbose and a bit of a prude in the romance department unlike his doctor friend Elias who can’t stop chasing a skirt. For his behaviour, Weaver is unlikely to be promoted in any organization, even today. And the mysterious Celia Glade never emerges from being...well... mysterious – a rather underdeveloped character. Spoiler alert: if you are looking for sex, read another book.Reading this book however, I got the impression that the author was trying to say that nothing much has changed in the way of greed fuelling the business world. “They are all foul,” says Weaver summing up company men, to which his friend Elias responds, “It is very strange that when dealing with these companies, the man who acts out of spite and revenge, as you have now, comes across as the most moral. That, I suppose, is the warping power of greed.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 22, 2012","Jun 02, 2012","May 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1852624.The_Devil_s_Company

Or else this book was written in snatches over a long period with no continuity checks, or pages were lost in translation, or the translators tried too hard to render the original Russian in English and failed. The result is a jumble of characters and viewpoints that stray even to minor characters who disappear shortly thereafter, and naming conventions that defy comprehension: Lara is known alternatively as Lara, Larochka, Larissa Fyodorovna, Raissa Komarova, Antipova and Strelnikova; and when you transpose that on the myriad others with variations of their first name, name and patronymic, last name, nick name, pseudonym and so on, it makes for quite a maze. Descriptions of the landscape during war and peace and of the seasons are well rendered from the author’s poetic stance, but the plot line is often contrived and dialogue amounts to stilted speeches that go on for paragraphs, often by the same speaker. The much vaunted romance between Zhivago and Lara, which was brought out so evocatively in the movie and in its theme song, is limited to a few brief pages, again more concerned with each other’s political stance than with their emotional one. There is more feeling expressed in their loss at parting than in their being together.The span of the story begins from the dispersal of Zhivago, his family and his privileged upper middle class associates from Moscow with the onset of WWI, follows their travels to the Urals and into Siberia during the time of the Russian Revolution and civil war that ensued between 1917-22, tracks the good doctor’s return to Moscow at the culmination of that turbulent period, and concludes with the end of his impoverished life in that city eight years later. There is also an extended epilogue during WWII, when two of his colleagues try to reconstruct the Zhivago diaspora. During this span, characters intersect with each other under different circumstances in random manner; lives are changed and loves are lost by the most chance of incidents. In one such incident, Zhivago, who is out on a surreptitious visit to his mistress Lara, is kidnapped by Red soldiers to serve as a doctor at the Siberian front and he never sees his official family again. Contrivance or real life?The strength of this novel—yes, despite its shortcomings there is great strength—lies in the fact that it was written by a writer living and witnessing the period of the Russian revolution and civil war, without taint of the propaganda that symbolized the Soviet era. Pasternak is frank in portraying the White Russians and the Bolsheviks as equally guilty of patronage, corruption and cruelty. Zhivago’s (and Pasternak’s) own political stance is revealed when he says, “I used to be in a very revolutionary mood, but now I think we will gain nothing by violence. People must be drawn to the good by the good.” The other powerful force in this book is its symbolism: Lara is the embodiment of Mother Russia, corrupted at an early age by her mother’s lover Komarowsky of the ruling class, and then left bereft of her idealistic and revolutionary husband Antipov, and her beloved man of science and art, Dr. Zhivago. Lara laments that she is left with a reinvented Komarowsky, “a monster of mediocrity.” The historical notes help marry the fictional events with the real life background. I wished there had been a glossary of names as well. And Zhivago’s (Pasternak’s) poetry at the end reveals much of the doctor’s character and his spiritual development in this crucible of devastation that was the early years of the Soviet empire, much more than what comes out in the novel itself....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 04, 2012","May 21, 2012","May 04, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/130440.Doctor_Zhivago

It has all the elements that make up the transplanted soul: the sudden dislocation from the known world, the outsider’s view, the early struggles to gain a foothold, achieving success, seeking for what has been lost, obsessions, and the desire to fuse all of the resting places into a coherent whole called Home.Sir Christopher Ondaatje has definitely led a full life: from frightened colonial schoolboy arriving in a strict British boarding school, to struggling immigrant in Canada, to gold medal winner in an Olympic bobsled event, to successful businessman, to world explorer and writer, to living in a scenic haunted house in the British countryside, and all of that anointed by a knighthood to boot. There is no overt attempt to fictionalize any of these short essay-like stories which come straight from the author’s life, although some of the tales are so tall, I wished they had been fictionalized to lend more credibility. Interesting personalities dot the pages, like J.R Jayawardene, former president of Sri Lanka, Rudolph Nureyev who sat next to the author on a coast-to-coast flight, and the (nude) portrait of Anais Nin. The author is an acolyte of Leonard Woolf, Ernest Hemingway and Sir Richard Burton and walks in their footsteps by undertaking expeditions to Sri Lanka, India, the Middle East and Africa under rather dangerous and difficult conditions. Ondaatje comes across as the quintessential risk taker, which he likens to being an artist: “the true artist, driven by unknown forces, breaks away from routine and embarks on an exploration of the unfamiliar”— an apt executive summary of this book.Birds have special meaning: suicide birds that plunge to their death in Assam resemble those who play on the edge, Ondaatje being one; the devil bird whose cry at night signals a death to come; the white crow in Colombo is supposed to be the re-incarnation of an English woman who had an affair with a famous Sri Lankan politician, a story recounted by former President Jayawardene as he opens the window to his garden and has the said crow settle possessively on his shoulder. The leopard is another animal that obsesses Ondaatje; it is alternatively a goddess, a bad omen and a protector as he recklessly pursues variants of this beast in Sri Lanka and East Africa and shoots it—with a camera. The leopard is also the predator, one that Ondaatje had to become in order to survive in the cut-throat business world of Bay Street. And the black leopard, that most elusive of creatures, is the author’s pursuit of the unattainable – the spur to great achievements in life and perhaps a metaphor of the author’s unending quest for his father who died when Ondaatje was a teenager. There are lots of ghosts too—the mark of a colonial who is able to entertain and integrate the old world of superstition with the rational world of facts and figures.The author’s style is eloquent but business-like—matter of fact storytelling—none of the literary musings of younger brother Michael. And the canvas is broad: from England in the ‘40’s to Toronto and Montreal in the ‘50’s, to Tanzania, Kenya, Syria, India, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean and finally back to Devon in the present. Ondaatje aims for the punchy ending, always delivering a crucial bit of information in the last paragraph that makes one go, “Oh!”The final story, “The Glenthorne Cat,” set in Ondaatje’s present home in Exmoor, is by far the most fantastical, and an attempt, I believe, of the author trying to find purpose for his life’s journey that has led him to this scenic place, fusing ghosts, man-eating cats, Sri Lanka and England, legend and reality. Fact, fiction, dream or delusion—who cares? It’s another rollicking good yarn, just like the rest! The one point I would disagree with Ondaatje is when he calls himself the Last Colonial. This is a book for displaced people of every generation who witness a way of life disappear and have to re-invent themselves in a new world. And there will be more colonials as empires fall in future, some closer to home in North America. Sir Chris’s timing during the changing of the guard in his empire was impeccable, leaving Sri Lanka just before the colonial party ended in that country plunging it into civil war, and arriving in Toronto just as the financial party was getting under way as Montreal declined under separatist fears. His journey is certainly an inspiration to all of us who follow and find ourselves somewhere along that path, albeit with slimmer pickings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 02, 2012","May 08, 2012","May 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12430144-the-last-colonial

I was disappointed in the way Paul Auster chose to “tell” this story.The main story line hovers around a son – parent estrangement that occurs around the accidental death of a sibling. Miles the son, believing he was responsible for his step brother’s death, quits college and drifts between various dead-end jobs to end up in Florida and fall in love with an underage orphan. His father, Morris, a publisher in New York, in battling to keep his second marriage intact after having had an impulsive one night stand with a colleague. Miles is forced to end his seven-year drift when his lover’s sister threatens to have him jailed for having sex with a minor. He heads back to New York and takes up abode with lifelong friend Bing. Bing and his band of twenty somethings are squatting in a house left vacant in the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008. Predictably, squatters end up being evicted and the interplay of the characters’ ruminations on their lives play out until that inevitability occurs.These are interesting people. Miles is a small publisher of serious literature and has a stable of loyal and famous writers. His ex-wife (Miles’s mother) is an actress who has re-invented herself many times over, and his present wife is an academic. Bing is an amateur musician and works to restore artifacts of a certain vintage. Alice, one of the squatters, is writing her PhD and works for PEN and is engaged in promoting the cause of a jailed Chinese writer. Ellen, the other squatter, is a realtor and paints, specializing in nudes, preferably the nude portraits of the people close to her. The squatters resemble the Occupy Movement with jobs: protestors against the failed establishment, making it by their own rules. They are also lonely people, trapped in prisons of their making, repressed sexually, economically and professionally. Their sex lives are complicated, and I will not reveal too much in terms of their behaviour in this area, but it makes for amusing yet sympathetic reading. After a while, it becomes clear that all the squatters are in love with Miles, while he, blissfully unaware, pines for his girlfriend and can’t wait for her to come of age so that he can cohabit with her again, openly this time. Father and son bond through baseball talk and there is a lot of baseball stats here. Also lots of detail on Hollywood and a list of famous people buried at Green Wood Cemetary, Brooklyn – somewhat excessive, I thought. The lives of authors and publishers are dissected; actors and independent film makers also go under the microscope – interesting material to someone interested in these areas, but what good they do to advancing this novel is not clear. PEN gets a bit of advertorial too.There are interesting philosophical insights: “Until you are wounded, you cannot become a man,” “Baseball is a universe as large as life, all things tragic and comic fall within it,” and “there is always room in the brain for another story.”What disappointed me most was the narrative-heavy style. There is very little dialogue or forward movement as the story is backwards looking. The conclusion also failed to grip me. The fated re-unions of Miles with his father and his mother are mentioned in passing. And the last chapter reads like a summary, as if an impatient editor was requiring the author to limit his word count. And since little airtime is given to exploring the interactions of the denizens of the squat house, especially from Miles’s point of view, the final parting is rather flat despite some last minute pushing and shoving. On reflection, I realize why a story “shown,” especially one with such interesting characters and situations, can be far more satisfying than one that is “told” in driblets spilling from the minds of each of its characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 02, 2012","Apr 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7944987-sunset-park

But I am glad that I finally found it. The Pearl is a precursoBeing a Steinbeck fan, I am not sure how I missed this novella during my student years. But I am glad that I finally found it. The Pearl is a precursor to Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea: a man finds a fortune and inherits the misfortune than comes with it; letting go is the only solution.Set in a Latin American locale, impoverished pearl diver Kino and his wife Juana are visited by a scorpion that bites their baby Coyotito. This opening scene sets off a chain of unfortunate events. Juana believes that medicine for insect bites from the colonial doctor is best, even though she is able to suck out the poison from the baby. Kino must find the money to pay the colonial doctor, for his meagre supply of pearls is rejected by the fat, greedy quack. Kino’s dive that morning bags him the most unusual pearl, one as big as an ostrich egg; he calls it the Pearl of the World.The Pearl sets off a string of misfortunes; everyone is out to steal it from Kino or to cheat him of his treasure. From the unscrupulous doctor who makes Coyotito sick again to prove that the child still retains the poison, and then makes him well to earn a fat fee, to the greedy agents who collude to under price the jewel, to unnamed thieves who strike in the dark to steal it, Kino is plagued by a sea of troubles. He turns from hunter to hunted, and is soon in flight with his fragile family, pursued by a gunman and two henchmen. Juana sees through the lure of riches and repeatedly implores her husband to cast the Pearl aside and return with her to the village. Her urgings and the dark forces arrayed against him only make Kino obsess more over his treasure. Only a catastrophic and tragic event can cause him to learn his lesson and turn back. But those who return to the fold are forever altered. Steinbeck maintains the escalating tension of cinema in this parable. The imagery is clear: the haze of the gulf represents the uncertainty of life; the Pearl, which is created by an accident of nature, is a lottery, and attracts evil despite its lure of riches. The village, and its insular inhabitants, represent the traditions that Kino is determined to step beyond to redefine himself in the city. This is the universal struggle of human’s to evolve, of never being satisfied with the status quo, the trait that distinguishes man from animal. And it is a struggle indeed, for Kino finds that even the gods are against him, although in his philosophy “the gods do not love success unless it comes by accident.” And personal growth comes only with loss, not with riches.The Beatle’s song “(Money) Can’t Buy Me Love” came to mind as I read this short book, which, like the song, ended too soon for me....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 22, 2012","Apr 29, 2012","Apr 22, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5308.The_Pearl

I temporarily set aside my research and let the author transport me back to this turbulent time in the Indian Ocean at the dawn of the 19th century and the sunset of the Napoleonic era.In keeping with its title, the book is segmented into two parts: the first section covers the storms at sea that played havoc with the First and Second Fleets as they sailed out of India via the Cape of Good Hope for England, and the second part covers the various battles for control of Mauritius (Isle de France as named by the French) which was a haven for French frigates and privateers who preyed upon British traffic between the Cape and the Indies. Interesting characters dot the book: Eliza Barlow, wife of the unpopular Governor of Madras, mother of 15 children and notorious for the sexual peccadilloes that finally brought down her husband; Mathew Flinders, navigator of Terra Australis, prisoner on Mauritius who later died in poverty before his best seller was published; the wicked but brave Captains Corbett and Willoughby who whipped their men mercilessly and were feared by the French for their daring; the battered East Indiamen ships that carried these souls back and forth on the ocean and switched sides in battle as they were captured by the French or the English.Setting out between England and India was a perilous endeavour in the early 1800’s, not many survived, and those who did had their characters altered forever. A body being thrown overboard daily was a common sight. Overcrowding and sickness was endemic. Whipping of the crew was a standard practice: 48 lashes for theft, 36 for drunkenness, 72 for desertion, and so on in multiples of 12. The Navy regularly press ganged the crew of merchant ships, and although the Governors of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta were from the British East India Company, they had to negotiate an unholy alliance with Her Majesty’s Navy. A voyage lasted six - nine months, depending on the winds (8 knots was a good speed) and during this time the various social classes on board lived together in close proximity, sharing food, smells, sounds, often separated only by a canvas partition; sex was limited, washing clothes was forbidden on Sundays, a band played during dinner, and crossing the equator was celebrated by ducking lubbers. The hurricane scenes that wrecked the First and Second Fleets are vividly described. In these storms, “Each ship for itself, God for us all” was the maxim and when the fleet regrouped or limped into port in single file, often days apart from each other, several among them had vanished. Broken masts had to be repaired, flooded holds had to be pumped out, and the hull re-caulked before setting out again. As each East Indiaman was a floating company (the captain and the BEIC had invested in the payload of cargo and passengers) each sinking usually sunk their fortunes as well.Constant losses to French frigates based in Mauritius finally led the British to take control of the situation – they needed to conquer Ile de France and its sister island Bourbon. Several smaller battles led to the final conquest, aided somewhat by Emperor Napoleon’s pre-occupation with his other battles in Europe that left his Indian Ocean flank unprotected. Captain’s Corbett and Willoughby dominate this section with their daring attacks on the French. The battles scenes are again vividly described. The Indiamen and their smaller cousins the men o’war frigates, while treacherous in luring the enemy with their disguised flags and false signals, resemble lumbering elephants, prone to the whims of the sea winds and liable to run aground in shallows. They are also madly suicidal when they draw up broadside and shoot the heck out of each other, often suffering worse losses than their opponents. Battered decks resemble charnel houses and the dying groan sans pain killers.Without giving much away, let us say that the British Navy prevails with its sheer might, and the book concludes by tracing the lives of the key characters after these pivotal events in 1809/1810. Many lived long lives, some in prosperity from the profits of their years in India, some in shame for breaking societal mores; others like Flinders died in penury, and others never left those battlegrounds in the Indian Ocean that shaped much of colonial history.I recommend this well documented history book, which draws on the logs of many of the vessels that plied the England – India route for veracity, and yet reads like an action novel in places.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 12, 2012","Apr 25, 2012","Apr 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2338878.Storm_and_Conquest

I picked it up a second time and the stories still held me but I could see that they were not (yet) Greene’s best writing, given that many were written during his formative years.The situations are bizarre and typical of “Greene-land”: a gigolo encountering role reversal with a prosperous whore, a man who wants to commit suicide with his reluctant girlfriend, a witness having the unenviable task of identifying a killer from among identical twins, a religious businessman whose assistant’s main job is to schedule his calendar with religious events that will earn him indulgences in the next life, a bum meeting a murderer in a darkened cinema – or is it the blood-soaked victim?Many stories end up with a dead body, many have various possible endings, many are narration-heavy, and quite a number of the shorter pieces such as “The Second Death,” “Proof Positive” and “Alas Poor Maling” are underdeveloped. The earlier pieces cover children in which adults are portrayed as absent, uncaring and full of secrets – clues perhaps of Greene’s own upbringing. The much touted “Blue Film” is quaint by today’s standards given the amount of porn now available online. I would also argue that “When Greek Meets Greek” is too contrived in relation to the modern short story.The best pieces are the ones where Greene steps out of England and begins his globetrotting in Africa and Mexico, and he comes into his “power and glory” in “The Hint of an Explanation” where the metaphor of the temptation of Christ plays out in the luring of the little boy to sin in exchange for a toy train set.There is a certain amount of effort required to read these stories, for one enters them at different points and gets right into the convoluted worlds of these characters. Sometimes the conclusion is satisfactory and sometimes not. Sometimes it leaves the reader with more questions. I think Greene took a secret satisfaction in confronting his readers with the murkier and quirkier regions of human experience, rarely offering solutions but always holding the mirror to our faces like a true fiction writer....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Apr 2012,"Apr 12, 2012","Apr 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48865.Twenty_One_Stories

Steinbeck thereby elevates this story from yet another WWII tale to the universal lesson inherent in a conflict between occupiers and the occupied, which has eerie parallels with what has happened in Afghanistan and Iraq recently, something he had probably never envisaged when writing this novella as part of his contribution to the Allied war effort in 1942.The occupiers, with the help of collaborators take over a small town somewhere in Europe (The Channel Islands come to mind) and force its incumbent mayor to run the administration under their control. The target is the coal mine that the occupiers need to fuel their war effort. Locals who do not follow orders or try to sabotage the coal supply line are summarily executed. Over time, the occupiers become the prisoners for they have difficulty coping with the isolation, the overt and covert hostility of the locals, and the random acts of sabotage. The younger occupying officers miss their social life, they miss the “girls,” and one of them who crosses the line and fraternizes is killed mysteriously. The seasoned commander who has fought in the last Great War understands the prospect of defeat and is pragmatic about their situation, which could go either way, while his younger subordinates, who have only been fed with the rhetoric of victory, have difficulty accepting their worsening lot. Help comes to the vanquished in the form of sticks of dynamite dropped off aircraft flying over from the mainland, with instructions on how to store and use the explosives in further acts of sabotage against the occupier. Faced with inevitable defeat, the occupier can only kill the leaders among the vanquished in the hope of quelling the rebellion. The book refrains from making a definitive statement as to who wins or who is better off in the end, for both sides pay a heavy price and seem to be pawns in a larger human struggle outside their control. The novella has the structure of a play with set indoor scenes, the principal characters entering, delivering their lines and leaving, and the action taking place offstage. Weaving through is Steinbeck’s omniscient narrative that stitches everything together. Some universal truths drip off the pages:•	Defeat doesn’t last•	Conventional law and order is irrelevant. In a state of war it is the duty of one party to kill the other •	Trials must be public for they are lessons for the general public, not for the offender•	In times of need, leaders pop up like mushrooms•	Herd men win battles, free men win wars•	The ‘mayor’ is an idea of free men – it will escape arrest.Both sides are portrayed as humans with feelings and ideals and no one is overtly cruel. The cruelty which is displayed by each is done out of necessity to carry out their roles as occupier and occupied. Perhaps the mayor’s wife is the smartest, for she believes that all this talk of conquest, with its consequences, is “nonsense” and is the creation of a testosterone-driven masculine hierarchy that rules the world at that time.

And yet, their trials and tribulations were no different from what writers face today, just different. All believed in a story being told and not in merely having beautiful language leading nowhere. All were highly opinionated and I could immediately identify with them despite being of the opposite sex.The anecdotes in their lives are very engaging. Let’s see: Isak Dinesen sent her manuscript to America via the British Embassy’s mailbag (she had connections due to her aristocratic peerage) because of the war interruptions to mail traffic, Katherine Anne Porter spent 15 years honing her craft before feeling worthy of being published, Rebecca West lost her hearing and much of her eyesight during her career, Nadine Gordimer missed most of her schooling but was a published author at 21 and went on to win the Nobel, Anne Sexton was a compatriot of Sylvia Plath and took her own life at 46, Joyce Carol Oates gets depressed between finishing a novel and starting another and works on short stories in between. The interviews are unstructured and go where the writer wants to take the interviewer. Some ramble, others hone in on sensitive subjects such as book banning, and the dismissal of literary greats and sorority groups. I mentioned opinions; here are some to whet your appetite:Dinesen: “Unlike children of today, who are content to be observers...we were creators.”Porter: Didn’t think that Scott Fitzgerald or the people he wrote about amounted to anything – “they led perfectly stupid lives.”West: Liked Mark Twain and Doris Lessing; didn’t like Tolstoy (didn’t make his point very well), E.M. Forster (much ado about nothing), T.S. Elliot (poseur), Somerset Maugham (couldn’t write for toffee, but was an interesting man), Kafka (couldn’t write about sex) or Lawrence (awful nonsense about sexual violence). Didn’t think the New Yorker editors were any good.Eudora Welty: Didn’t think much of biography. A writer’s life must be in their work.Gordimer: Influenced by Hemingway but thinks his undoing is the intrusion of his own voice in the stories.Sexton: “Suicide is the opposite of the poem.”Cynthia Ozick: “Forget about ‘write what you know.’ Write what you don’t know, for you will begin to think beyond home-thoughts. You enter dream and imagination.”Joan Didion: “Hemingway wrote perfect sentences, no sinkholes. Henry James wrote perfect sentences too but with sinkholes.”Many of these writers felt, that given the time they were writing in, it was easier to be a male writer than a female writer. Didion says, “A man who wrote novels had a role in the world and he could play that role and do whatever he wanted behind it. Women who wrote novels were often perceived as invalids: Carson McCullers, Jane Bowles, Flannery O’Connor.” I have to disagree with this view in today’s context. With the proliferation of women writers and the majority of readers being women, I think the tables have turned during the last generation.Despite the changes in the times, what comes out clearly in these interviews is that these women writers were totally committed to their art and made great strides during their time.

Was this fiction, practice for the fiction to come, or a commissioned set of synopses of these historic villains’ lives? Then I stumbled on a Wikipedia entry that explained that as part of his editorial work at the newspaper Crítica, Borges had written these pieces, some as a cross between non-fictional essays and short stories, and the others as literary forgeries. The short stories not only have beginnings, middles and ends but they also have prefaces and epilogues. His canvas is broad for the subjects range from the gangs of New York to Billy the Kid to the Tichbourne Claimant (I have previously ed an entire book on this incident alone), the American Slave Trade, Chinese legends and The Thousand and One Nights. In the literary forgeries, in which Borges takes on the role of translator of these lesser known works, he inserts some important lessons:a)	Look for the gold in your own home, not elsewhereb)	Don’t open forbidden doorsc)	Those who wish evil on others will receive it themselvesThere is one short story which is supposedly his original composition, “Man on Pink Corner,” set in his native Buenos Aires, a clever whodunit, reflecting Borges’s lifelong fascination with the mystery genre.The style in all of the writing is elegant and yet he captures a lot of detail with a very economical selection of words.Given that this short collection of writing is his first, one cannot be too critical and I will look forward to reading more of his work as his art evolved, particularly after he went blind in the late 1950’s and continued to publish well into the 1980’s.

The journey provides movement, the juxtaposition of passengers in the close confines of the bus allows for an in-your-face scrutiny of their character and inter-relationships, and the introduction of external threat exposes their vulnerabilities and strengths. And so it is with The Wayward Bus as the title suggests – another bus story with all of the above.The only problem here is that the bus does not commence its journey until way after the first 100 pages and so the movement is provided by Steinbeck bopping in an out of each character as they sit it out in the bus station at Rebel Corners in California, waiting for the old bomb to get roadworthy. Once the bus gets underway after its homemade repair job, the inclement weather forces it to take a route less travelled and bog down in a muddy stretch of a unused road (the only external threat), forcing the characters to make choices and face up to themselves and their values, even though help is only four miles away. Without having to introduce bandits and other extreme threats to spice up the plot (like I did in my novel), Steinbeck is able to show us that we are our own worst enemy.The cross section of society that gets on board as passengers is interesting. A corporate executive who only moves with people like himself, a war-vet novelty salesman who is suspicious of corporate promises, a table top dancer who has had too many disappointing relationships, a wannabe actress dreaming of a relationship with Clark Gable, a spoilt-brat rich daughter who is panting to get laid and her equally pampered mother who does not lay anymore even with her husband, a pimply youth who has difficulty containing his sexual urges and wants to lay all the women on board the bus, a dying man who sees a problem in every opportunity – make up the payload. The driver is fifty-year old Juan, a half breed Irish-Mexican, who, despite being chased by gringo women, sticks around with his alcoholic American wife because she is the only one who makes proper beans north of the Rio Grande.Steinbeck brings out some home truths: Honesty and thrift do not work in a post-WWII America, men of whatever age will always chase attractive younger women, business is not about using good grammar but about what you can produce, inventors are most likely to get squeezed by their corporate exploiters, spouses sometimes invent illnesses to control the other, the young will always have stardust in the eyes, and civilization is only skin deep.This is not one of his better novels, and I was disappointed in the constantly shifting viewpoints, rendering the characters like puppets under the control of Master Puppeteer Steinbeck. Nothing much is resolved either; we just get an insight into a cross-section of American society in the late 1940’s when the difference between the sexes was wide as the Grand Canyon, and whether that was reality or Steinbeck’s bias is debatable. The redeeming features are the descriptions of the Californian landscape and the vagaries of Mother Nature, which Steinbeck describes superbly.

Parse out the non-fiction from the fiction and send me two manuscripts, both of which, I am sure, will make very interesting reading.”Melville packs everything into this mammoth book: allegory, Shakespearean soliloquies, analysis of the whale from its physical, metaphorical and mythical dimensions, whaling ship log, primer on the whaling industry and nautical practises, the effects of monomania, and a rollicking good yarn about a whaling hunt gone wrong.Much has been written about this book and I do not want to add another analysis on Melville’s initially vilified and then re-discovered masterpiece. I found the account in Wikipedia to be quite comprehensive and would recommend it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-DickSuffice to say, that I was intrigued by both the fiction and the non-fiction in this book, its Quaker language notwithstanding. The short and descriptively titled chapters made it easier to identify and skip the parts that detracted from the main story line. But I found myself returning to the non-fiction parts because they piqued my curiosity. I mean, it’s not common to read about how a whale is reduced from a majestic leviathan gliding the oceans into barrels of oil in the mouldy hold of a ship. Or of what takes place during a Gam, the old whaling world’s equivalent of an Internet meeting place.The series of premonitions and foreshadowing of events, magnifying in gravity, that take place as Capt Ahab and his crew near the end of their hunt, envelopes the novel with a sense of impending doom. The final and inevitable three-day chase of the White Whale is high adventure and the end comes suddenly, still a shock despite the old comics and movies I devoured about Moby Dick during my youth.I am glad that I finally read this book after years of procrastination, because much of American literature has encircled Moby Dick. Like Capt Ahab, I was finally able to slay this leviathan of a tome in about 5 days, sometimes reading over 200 pages a day (a rarity for me) because I found the material engaging. And I did not have to suffer monomania nor meet Ahab’s watery end in order to accomplish that.I also wondered whether Capt Ahab's fixation on the whale was symbolic of Melville's obsession with this novel about all things whaling, endeavours that harmed both character's and creator's reputations and put their sanity into question. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 02, 2012","Mar 08, 2012","Mar 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_The_Whale

His sources are wide and varied; from Whitman to Woolf, James (Henry) to Joyce (James), Kafka to Melville, Flaubert to Wells, Poe to Conan Doyle, he plucks examples with confidence, losing us in his complex sentences and thought patterns.I picked up a few of his insights which I thought might be useful to mention:1.	“Art happens, it cannot be crafted” (this was a quote from Walt Whitman – one of Borges’s brilliant pluckings).2.	All meaningful metaphors have already been created.3.	Economy of words is better than lavishness.4.	All poetry is confession.5.	Immortality is sometimes achieved by association of place (e.g. Burns of Scotland).6.	The domain of passion is still open to claim. No single poet can lay claim to it.7.	A writer creates his precursors because his latest work dates what has come before8.	Conan Doyle cheated on the detective story by not concealing who-done-it.9.	The integrity of the novel lies in prophecy, in magic, not in cause and effect.10.	Kafta’s writing is like a moving body that never reaches its destination, an expedition to the North Pole.I found Borges’s handful of short s that were included in this book to place more emphasis on the writer than on the work. And here too Borges draws from a wide selection of sources outside the writer and his work to make his points.A whole section is dedicated to the detective story, from its origins with Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” to its evolution since. Borges posits six principles for the crafting of the perfect detective story and elevates the genre to high art, an intellectual exercise for the reader. He observes that England still promotes the intellectual detective novel while in America the genre has drifted towards sex and violence.This is a book that will send you on a goose hunt for other books mentioned within.

Short chapters, each with incidents of dramatic consequence, thread about 20 years of the hero’s life, from his days on the family farm in Natal to his intention of returning home to visit his alcoholic twin brother; the typical hero’s journey: escaping home, adventures abroad and regaining home.Sean is the opposite of his twin Garrick. His ebullience and impulsiveness leaves Garrick a cripple. His lustful impetuousness lands damsels in distress and Garrick has to clean up after him. He fights in the Zulu uprising, sires bastards, makes and loses a fortune in the Witwatersrand, goes elephant hunting in the Limpopo, loses friends, wives, children and, while still in his early thirties, decides to cut his losses and return home with a stash of ivory. That is, if the home he has known can ever be regained. In a nutshell, that is the story, but there are far too many twists and turns in this plot to record or remember everything in between. Smith leaves the book well poised for a sequel, and for many more featuring the Courtney family.The culture of the times is pretty clear: the white man is king, the black man follows and puts his life on hold for his fair master, women are chattels, greed is fuelled by gold, racketeering is rife in frontier towns and “In order to live, man must occasionally kill.” Hunting is a possessive love. Scenes of the South African Veldt, and its flora and fauna are authoritatively drawn.All that said, there is a lot of awkward writing. The characters and their emotions run shallow unlike the deep gold veins that they mine in Johannesburg. Sean bounces back from his many tragedies like a bird shaking off water from its feathers. Some scenes are glossed over for there is too much happening anyway. The foreshadowing is clumsy, almost like an omniscient narrator intruding to alert us to what lies ahead, even reminding us of what is to come during the Boer War, which is outside the time span of this book. The sudden shift in POV, especially when it is carried by a minor or newly arrived character, is jarring. And the melodrama...oh the melodrama... Part three of the book is the best section as it portrays a deeper character investment, as if Smith is maturing in his craft just as Sean is maturing with his many losses.This is a good adventure story and a great debut novel for Smith at the time.

That’s the question I am left with upon reading this intriguing life of the most reclusive celebrity author ofWas he a saint or a brilliant marketer? That’s the question I am left with upon reading this intriguing life of the most reclusive celebrity author of recent times.Salinger’s output was sparse: a collection of nine short stories, his signature novel The Catcher in the Rye, two novellas combined into a full length book (Franny and Zooey), another two novellas combined (Raise High the Roof Beam and Seymour – an Introduction), and a smattering of short stories published in various “slick” magazines that he did not care about. His focus was on the characters in the fictional Caulfield and Glass families and he followed their development over a period that mirrored his life. And yet he claimed that he only wrote stories about “young people.” His work took a turn towards the religious after Catcher made him a household name. By the time he got to Zooey he was into Vedanta and Zen, and was targeting American materialism and intellectualism as the opposites of spiritualism.Born into the privileged upper middle class society of New York, he had a relatively comfortable life until he went to war in 1944 and survived the hell of D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, the fall of Cherbourg, the Battle of the Hedgerows, Bloody Mortain and others, ending the war in Intelligence, suffering what is today known as PTSD and emboldened with the realization that his survival had a purpose: he would elevate the horrors of war into high literature.His literary journey was no cakewalk and yet he reaped rich rewards. Salinger endured more rejection that he gained acceptance, especially in his early years. Publishers had Machiavellian holds on him and insisted on “compressing” his work to meet journalistic requirements; they also published and republished his work without his permission and took the liberty of changing the titles of his stories – dangerous ground to tread with an author whose ego was as big as Salinger’s. His response was to be difficult with publishers and publicists (Salinger only gave one public speaking engagement and quit) and others who wanted to make him famous – the net result was that his hermit status gained him more fame and fortune that he could imagine. Salinger enjoyed the enviable position of being on The New Yorker payroll on a retainer of $30K per year (in 1947 dollars) for giving that venerable magazine the first right of refusal of his stories; his output in that period:1948 – 5 stories submitted, 2 published, 1949 – 7 submitted, all rejected. Wasn’t that just the glory age of publishing, and a cushy time to be a writer?Salinger’s Spartan and spiritual approach made him specify that his book covers only had to be in text, with no pictures (especially no author pictures!). He refused the distribution of advance  copies and decried advance publicity or promotion. He was noted for launching lawsuits against any perceived infringement of his control of his work. I wonder if J.D. Salinger would have even made the cut as a writer in the publishing universe of today in which shameless self-promotion and lots of “free content” is de rigueur.Little is known of Salinger’s personal life, especially of the later barren years when he published nothing but continued to write copiously. He had a short-lived first marriage, a longer second one that produced children and a third late in his life. His work overpowered relationships and family time. He entertained young people from his village in New Hampshire but as the world got nosier about him, he withdrew further into his cave. His last published work, a novella, Hapworth 16, 1924, released in 1965, was a disaster – the critics marked their scorn by remaining silent, and Salinger never published anything new again until his death in 2010, aged 91.This  is but a snapshot of the book and the interesting times through which Salinger traversed, interesting people such as Hemingway and Oona O’Neil (Eugene O’Neil’s daughter and Charlie Chaplin’s future wife) whom he engaged with, and the transformational events such as WWII that forged much of the 20th century and influenced his work. The writer of this biography, Kenneth Slawenski, tends to lionize Salinger and I wished for a more balanced view of his subject which would have still made interesting reading. Nevertheless, the book sheds much light on this reclusive writer and is a motivational read for the rest of us scribes who are toiling in the dark, thirsting for the fame and fortune that Salinger overtly scorned – or did he?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 06, 2012","Feb 22, 2012","Feb 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8822656-j-d-salinger

The painting portrays a white-skinned oral storyteller with red hair, a disfiguring birthmark on his face, sitting in the middle of a circle of Machiguenga. The narrator wonders if this his old friend from university, Saul Zuratas, Mascarita as he was nicknamed, a Jew, who supposedly vanished to Israel after rejecting a post-graduate scholarship in ethnological studies.This intriguing opening then departs along two story lines, each with its own style: one depicts the narrator’s journalistic account of his hunt for Mascarita by embarking on various expeditions into the Amazon, the other is a profusion of mythological tales about the origins of the Machiguenga, which appear to be coming from the mysterious storyteller himself. Llosa used this dual narrative approach in his previous novel Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter to much greater effect by converging them in the end, but in this novel the two threads do not quite meet.The journalistic narrative is flat and lacks conflict and is full of extraneous detail. The mythological one is dreamlike and merges one story into another; mixed in is the story of Creation, the story of Jesus, the coming of the white man to South America and bits of Dante’s Inferno, and one wonders – given this is being narrated by a red haired white man – if the storyteller is cloaking western mythology in Amazonian imagery. The storyteller is colourful in his descriptions of earthquakes, plague, gods, slitting of bellies to pluck out babies, women bearing fish from their loins, shit fights and the constant migration that the Machiguenga are consigned to. “Diaspora is survival,” seems to be the lot of the Amazonian tribes and of the storyteller as he wanders the Amazon forests telling his tales. The imagery of the mythological narrative is graphic at times: “his farts were like thunder, his belches like the jaguar’s roar...” Despite these colourful visuals however, one wonders if it is hubris on the part of the author or the translator’s lack of skill for why there are so many native words in the storyteller’s recounting; it is quite disruptive to the flow of this English translation and does not in any way enhance its uniqueness.Mascarita’s voluntary conversion to the Amazonian way of life is his act of total rejection of Western civilization and its technology. His assimilation into a pre-historic lifestyle is indicative of our ability to delayer as humans and return to our origins. His affinity to the Machiguenga is reflective of his being Jewish and living with the badge of persecution just as his new hosts do. Llosa makes some insightful connections here.And yet for all its profundity, I wish this book had been written differently. Some fundamental principles of the novel – character, conflict and story – are sacrificed in favour of giving us the grand panorama of Machiguenga legend, leaving me with a question: would this narrative have been better written as a no-nonsense, non-fiction history of the indigenous tribes of the Peruvian Amazon, instead of as a flat novel with a jumble of myths?...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 28, 2012","Feb 05, 2012","Jan 28, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13419393-the-storyteller

What had driven this country like an honourable woman from one suitor to the other? Alas that was not to be found, for this is a very domestic story surrounding the landowner class who seemed to prosper in the post independence period, embroiled in their petty-bourgeoisie conflicts. The only reference I had to Cuba’s political reality was the line, “they (foreign sugar companies) own everything, the land and the industry. We willingly abandoned it on condition that they left us politics and public appointments, which means the path to fraud and a life of very little work.”This then is not the political story of Cuba, but a portrait of a class of its citizenry. Victoria is a sheltered young woman of a wealthy landowning family, who has to fall from grace in order to understand the value of her honour and reclaim her sense of self. Surrounding Victoria are the others in her limited circle: her sister Alicia, married to a villainous businessman with mistresses in every corner, who is rendered barren from a sexually transmitted illness gifted by her husband; the childless Graciela, Victoria’s friend, who knows how to extract what she wants from men and ascribe to them their true value, nothing more. There are in-laws and unmarried aunts and parents, locked into the choices they made at the flowering stages of their lives, floating in and out of the narrative; after awhile they all begin grow on you. This is not a dramatically fabricated story, for the events are mundane – a family luncheon goes on for 26 pages, a wedding for a whole chapter – and so one gets a sense of what life must have been for an honourable woman of the landed gentry during that time.The author is skilful in evoking the world of the sheltered gentlewoman, one of gossip, shopping, chastity before marriage, dress, being courted, sewing, domestic chores and secrets. There are detailed descriptions of hysterectomies and abortions. The men are weak and not very bright, allowed to drink, have affairs, make money and demand unwavering fealty from their wives. Both sexes are deemed “old” if they are not married by age 30. Told from Victoria’s point of view, we see her world as a narrow but unexplored prison. She is sexually frigid and uncomfortable at looking upon herself unless clothed; she withdraws from her loyal but violently passionate husband’s advances and considers sex “dirty.”The author provides a statistic that three-quarters of married women do not experience satisfaction in intimacy, making the newly-married Victoria a representation of the malaise facing the majority of honourable women of her time. Then her life suddenly takes a sharp turn when she is sexually awakened by an older man, her husband’s boss, who takes his time in the “dance” to seduce her, make her pregnant and leave abruptly. Her fall from grace, the subsequent abortion that has to be kept secret to save her honour, all go towards making Victoria aware of where her true loyalties should lie, with the man who stands by her during her long return from the abyss, himself unaware of her “illness.” She finally falls in love with her husband and returns to him, a sexually responsive woman, much to his delight.The lessons abound: honourable women need to be conquered even after they say “I do” for them to feel possessed and to respond spontaneously. They must also be the most important of their husbands’ mistresses. The honourable woman must protect herself against passion and yet clear up the damage discretely. The perfect wife must be the archive of her husband’s memory, his secretary, nurse, admirer, pupil, and the maternal figure to protect him with her solicitude. Much is expected of the honourable woman, with very little in return.Despite this authoritative and immersed inner view on the world of women, de Carrion digresses and the reader occasionally gets the opinion of an older male intellectual speaking through Victoria. The last chapter is a diatribe on the state of mankind in the aftermath of the Great War – not sure where that fits in – a contrasting long term view on where humanity is headed perhaps, and a welcome respite from the insular world of Victoria.In the end, an enlightened and older Victoria, pregnant with her second child (both from her husband, thank God!) ponders the future of the next generation of honourable women – will they be slaves like Alicia or avengers like Graciela? Victoria, who has visited both extremes and understands their limitations, is left floating in a safe middle ground.   ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2012","Jan 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13431934-honourable-women

He lives in seclusion in Geneva and is surrounded by a bunch of toadies, whom he takes the greatest pleasure in humiliating at his famous soirees. He rewards his guests lavishly, feeding their greed for material possessions and then wreaks his hatred on their weakness. Narrated by Jones, the unlikely hero, a maimed translator who marries Dr. Fischer’s daughter, we are introduced to Dr. Fischer’s parties which become increasingly bizarre as they progress towards an inevitable and tragic end.Jones places himself out of reach of Dr. Fischer’s mind games as he holds the love of his younger wife above all material possessions. When she dies in a tragic accident, Jones is heartbroken, becomes suicidal and foils the doctor’s final game, the bomb party, which pits greed against life itself.Greene paints some quirky characters in the Toads as they are called: a drunken film actor, a rich widow, a shady accountant, a former divisionnaire in the Swiss army, an international lawyer – all who are indebted to the doctor for their lifestyle. The doctor himself is a self absorbed, heartless scoundrel who cannot bother to answer the phone even when his only daughter is dying. Greene’s own experiences with Russian Roulette plays out in the climax, in which the guests are faced with the choice of taking a gamble on a rich reward in exchange for putting their lives at risk. Dr. Fischer’s philosophy is that only those who have suffered or lost develop a soul. Well, in that case, we know that the only winner is Jones, for the others all walk away with rich financial rewards, in exchange for humiliation of their character which they do not seem to value anyway. As for Dr. Fischer, yes he too loses, but one wonders if that loss comes too late for any benefit to his soul? And as the doctor says, “Hate isn’t contagious – it does not spread.” Therefore one could argue that Dr. Fischer was his own walking bomb, and with him out of the way his Toads are now free, free of hate, free of greed, free to return to their former lives before they were ensnared by him.A fast-paced and easy read with all the twists and turns that one typically encounters in the murky world of Greeneland. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 25, 2012","Feb 05, 2012","Jan 25, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/309323.Doctor_Fischer_of_Geneva_or_The_Bomb_Party

The Bishop is ostensibly on a shopping trip to buy his new vestments and the ex-mayor is looking to get away and bury his hurt from losing the last town council election. In the back seat of their battered car, aptly named Rosinante, is an inexhaustible case of good Manchegan wine.Monsignor Quixote is firm in his Catholic faith but is anti-establishment, and so is his travelling companion. They enter into many discourses along the way, Quixote standing up for God and trouncing the Church, and Sancho pleading for Marx and dumping on the Politbureau. No subject is taboo: masturbation, the rhythm method, the withdrawal method, the Bible and Das Kapital. They read each other’s books and take pot shots at each other’s faiths; Sancho even has a theory about the Prodigal Son: he posits that the Prodigal got bored and disappointed upon his return to his father’s right wing wealth and fled back to the swineherd to live among the proletariat. Quixote compares the Holy Trinity to three bottles of wine from the same vintage – the same essence in three distinct entities. As they journey along it becomes clear that Sancho is the closet Capitalist, espousing fine wines, luxury hotels and good food, while the Monsignor represents the proletariat, reluctant to even announce his newly appointed promotion to bishop. Quixote is also naive, thinking that the movie his worldly companion takes him to, The Maiden’s Prayer, must be a religious one; he even chuckles at the graphic sex scenes not having known physical love.The Guardia, who constantly interrupt our heroes’ journey, stand for the windmills in the Cervantes chronicle as they tilt to the tune of every regime in Spain. In the eyes of the Church, Quixote is mad and must be put away, before he brings any more embarrassment through his ramblings around the countryside with a Communist, even seen exiting a pornographic movie theatre. And therein lies the thrust of the story: the struggle of the honest individual against the uncaring Establishment – a timeless theme that always grips the reader.The travellers’ individual philosophies that ooze out of the novel are priceless: “Man can’t live without a tranquilizer – opium, wine or religion,” “all the best people have been for awhile in prison,” “In a perfect world, what need would there be for hope?” and “I never pity the dead, I envy them.” There are many others.Greene’s Catholic novels have always posed the great question – can one be on the “outside” and still be classified as a believer? And his heroes have suffered tragically for taking that position. Monsignor Quixote is not spared this end either. However, I was heartened to read this book, for unlike in his other novels where protagonists wrestle with guilt and remorse in their dark worlds before arriving at redemption, Greene takes Quixote and Sancho on a grand tour of the Spanish countryside, fuelled with wine and camaraderie, and deposits them gently into their earned redemptive states.

To restore my faith in mankind I had to remind myself that this writer suffered for many years from depression and finally succumbed to it; this world was his, not mine.Brief Interviews With Hideous Men is an extremely robust book in terms of the styles and formats of the stories contained within: interviews, monologues, dialogues, pop quizzes, medieval tragedy, author notes, footnotes, confessions, dictionary and still life. The characters are indeed hideous people: the sexually repressed, sexual molesters, neurotics, mother haters, father haters, child haters, suicides, rapists. There are also the lost ones like the lavatory attendant and the boy on top of the diving board. After a while, they all blend into a soup of human misery. And all throughout is the author’s pretentious prose that adds to character homogeneity. These are not “shown” stories, they are very “told.” What kept me reading was the irony and the unusual situations: a dying father hurls curses at his successful son while on his deathbed, another father wags his penis at his young son scarring him for life, a woman feels a karmic connection with her attacker and comforts him while he goes about raping her on the side of a road, the guy proposes voluntary bondage on every third date with a new partner, another guy involuntarily yells “Victory for the Democratic Forces of Freedom” every time he has a sexual climax leaving his partners running for the hills.No doubt, Foster Wallace was a brilliant writer who stretched the form of the novel and the story to new heights. Somewhere in there however, he seems to have lost interest in his reader, or he doesn’t appear to care. Sentences go on for pages at times and the circulatory and repetitive nature of the propositions within get quite boring. Foster Wallace alludes to this with his reference, “the artist doesn’t need the reader’s permission for what he writes nor does he need to be liked by the reader.” I agree, but if you don’t make it interesting for us, Mr. F Wallace, why should we care either?For those attempting to read this book, prepare to work at it, it is not easy reading. In the end you will learn some new words, become somewhat dispirited with humanity and come to understand how it must have felt to be a (mad?) prophet crying in the wilderness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 06, 2012","Jan 14, 2012","Jan 06, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6753.Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men

Margaret Atwood has not only lived in just about every province of this country, she is also a child of the great Canadian wilderness and has been a witness to major events that shaped this country in the last half century: the feminist movement, the FLQ crisis, literary Nationalism, the small press mushroom, the founding of the Writers Union, and recently taking on the Ford bothers for their disregard for public libraries (the book covers only her early career, I threw this last bit in because, well, I couldn’t resist it!) Atwood certainly exposed the myth depicted in the movie The Red Shoes (from which the book gets its title) that the female artist does not have to choose between writing and family, although she believes that writing, family and work can be a bit much!The book brought home to me that each generation of writers faces a unique set of challenges. Margaret’s were: male domination of the literary and academic establishments at the time, and the fact that Canadian writing was considered inferior to those imports from abroad, particularly from Britain. Taking on the role of writer as activist and not victim, she was able to forge an identity for herself that was tempered with fierce criticism, public adoration and a bit of good luck—winning the Governor General’s award for her first published work of poetry was, without doubt, a great weapon with which to slay the naysayers.The lessons from her early life for the next generation of writers are:1)	You have to commit to your art, even if it impoverishes you. Some of the digs she lived in during her university days were pretty crappy!2)	Be bold – she took on Marshall McLuhan during a lecture3)	If you are not invited to the party, make your own4)	Movements do not define the writer; the writer is her own master and has to be an independent thinker. Although a feminist, Atwood stayed on the fringe of that movement 5)	You must give in order to receive. Her dedication of time and effort to the broader development of CANLIT is admirableMy only criticism of this book is that its subject is portrayed as beyond reproach and it would have been more balanced to show some of the neuroses and vulnerabilities that plagued this great writer.After putting down The Red Shoes I pondered the state of CANLIT, then and now. Certainly it can be argued that there is no shortage of Canadian writers and Canadian female writers today – Atwood and her cohort certainly solved that little problem. But as literary nationalism has swelled and dumped many writers on the shores of Canada and abroad, expanding this cadre like the increasing sizes of a Babushka Doll, the audiences for each book and writer have been shrinking in reverse size. Ah, but that is a problem for the next generation of writers to solve.

Although never advertized as such, this is a collection of short stories connected only by locale, the city of Kittur, a microcosm of Mother India with it all its fables and foibles.And so Adiga takes us on a seven-day tour of Kittur, unearthing its myriad denizens and their bizarre situations: from low castes to Brahmins, violent school teachers to anarchist students, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, bicycle wallahs, crime kingpins, immigrants from the countryside sleeping on the streets, and child beggars. The situations are graphic and unsanitary: a coolie sticking a cow dung-laced finger in anger into a prostitute’s mouth while she services another customer, the factory owner showing his contempt for a corrupt tax collector by mixing him Red Label Scotch stirred with his own shitty finger; after awhile the shock-factor becomes predictable and pales. The tour is supposed to mirror events taking place in the seven years between the assassinations of Mrs Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv, although I saw very little parallel.The messages however, are very strong: communism is being trumped by capitalism, caste lines shall not be crossed even though they are blurring in a changing India, getting married apparently stabilizes a man, a childless woman is a disgrace to her family, and those in the lower depths like our bicycle wallah will die from exhaustion before they reach the age of 40. Fraud is everywhere and circular – everyone is being screwed by everyone else – Adiga claims India to be the world champion in black marketing, counterfeiting and corruption. A few brave ones— the journalist who tries to write one article a day with the truth and goes mad in the attempt, and the Maupassant wannabe who creates characters who do not want but falls for a young woman and succumbs to desire—try to stem the tide and are consumed in India’s relentless march to become a global economic powerhouse.I found the writing style clumsy in certain stories and colloquial – these stories were probably written over a long period of time as the author evolved into his current Booker-winning stature.Living among tycoons and terrorists can be a source for interesting fiction, but I wonder what Adiga’s point is. Is it to shock us with insights into this subterranean culture that westerners would find titillating and escapist as the vampire genre or Chuck Palahniuk? Or is it to warn us that as India globalizes, and the world normalizes to the lowest common denominator, the underbelly of a rampant capitalist country, such as Kittur, could one day be our reality as well?

The author shows a remarkable understanding of human nature and of the stages of human development in bringing these characters to life, but falls prey to occasionally injecting his literary voice into their narratives – the drawback in having too many first person narrators who are supposed to be different and distinct. The novel looks backwards, for much of the action has already taken place in the years leading up to Harry’s last visit, and his emaciated presence seems to jerk memories from each of the players. There are no bad guys here; the only antagonists are death and guilt.Harry wants to catch his last fish before he dies, and wants to enrich the lives of Joe and Lucy by buying the property at twice its value and donating it to Jordan, who will run the camp well into the future. During Harry’s visit, we discover the back-stories of Joe Sr, who had half his face blown away during WWII and who brought his wife and the infant Joe Jr. to the camp to set up a new life away from everyone he knew; we learn about Harry’s loss of his wife and of his suicidal tendencies, of his foolish love for Lucy who is young enough to be his daughter; we gain insights into what it is to be on the lam for draft-dodging; we explore father-son relationships where each generation needs to have its own war to prove itself, and father-daughter relationships that are marked by secrets known but not talked about; and the parallel story of the group of out-of-town lawyers with their own set of tangled relationships.The splintered and interlinked narratives that jump all over in place and time are cleverly woven to move along a mounting trajectory towards the culmination of Harry’s visit – a showdown out on the lake. Despite this craft-mastery, the drips of sentimentality that intrude from time to time hit a sour note with me. And while we see Harry’s melancholy side, we do not get an insight into his sharp business mind that made him the successful entrepreneur as he is billed. Nor was I impressed with Joe Jr’s ultimate demise – it looks contrived and introduced for dramatic value. The final chapter, by a fifth first-person narrator, Lucy’s daughter Kate, also did not work for me as it seemed intended solely to plug the loose ends of the story; I wish this chapter had been deleted.

He was outspokenly opposed to a colonial government that siphoned off the resources of his island while subjecting it to brutal governance. First imprisoned at the tender age of 16 for his political opposition, Marti embraced martyrdom for his country as his sole purpose on earth very early in his life: “Cuba is an altar for the offering of our lives, not a pedestal for lifting ourselves above it.” He was a vocal anti-slavery proponent who had a liberal, somewhat Utopian vision for Cuba, in which black, white and mulatto would live in equal prosperity. He was also a tireless organizer of the revolution of 1895 while exiled in America, a country he was impressed by and yet wary of for its designs to annex or buy Cuba from the Spaniards. He wooed the Cuban émigré population in Florida to help with the revolution in Cuba but warned them about cozying up to their host nation. Due to his Modernist style where everything from essay to political speech reads like a prose poem, he can be a bit overbearing to read, and I wondered how much he managed to stir the masses with this flowery rhetoric. His speeches read like a rant, recycling the same issues, suddenly darting into new areas, then returning to older themes. His allusions and metaphors are hard to relate to, and his references to the history of America (meaning both South and North) need a trusty encyclopaedia by your side for reference. I found his letters more personal, for he is communicating with his family or with close friends, on the eve of his death. And he is unabashed in expressing his love for those near to him. His war journal, chronicling the last month of his life, while at the battle front in Cuba, is the most dramatic, for it cuts out the rhetoric and captures the imminent danger ahead. Marti’s love for South America and for Cuba in particular, jumps out in his writing. He was also imminently qualified to speak on behalf of the southern continent for he was consul for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina while in the USA and he also lived briefly in Venezuela, Mexico and Guatemala. And yet he held the most ambivalent attitude towards the United States. While impressed with the North American work ethic and progress, he was appalled by its racism and its disparities in income and lifestyle. “Between the shanties of Dakota and the virile and barbaric nation in process of growth there, and the cities of the East – sprawling, privileged, well-bred, sensual and unjust – lies an entire world.”Marti died in action in 1895 by venturing into the revolutionary war he had helped start, because he felt that he needed to be in the vanguard, because he could only earn the trust of his co-revolutionaries if he led from the front and not from the safe shores of North America.Reading his writing, I understood why he is regarded as a saint in Cuba even to this day, and why his memorial in Santiago de Cuba still has a 24/7 changing of the guard routine that has endured for all these years: his passion for his cause is palpable. And yet, Marti’s efforts notwithstanding, Cuba was liberated from the Spanish in 1898 only after America entered the conflict. This liberation led to another form of slavery and corruption by a procession of the island’s own rulers culminating with Fulgencio Batista, and was then followed by communism in 1959 when Castro came to power. When I look at Cuba today, I wonder if it is really a free nation. By freeing itself from Spain, did it not become hostage to its own form of economic and political bondage? Would Marti be happy with his Cuba if he were alive today? Or is his legacy still a work-in-progress? ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 11, 2011","Dec 19, 2011","Dec 11, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/463579.Jose_Marti_Reader

Arthur is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the renowned creator of Sherlock Holmes, and George is George Edalji, the lawyer son of a Parsee vicar and a Scottish mother. Their stories converge late into the book when Arthur takes on George’s case, a case which exposes the ills of racism that plagued Victorian and Edwardian England.Despite his mixed racial origins, George considers himself an Englishman, and so does Arthur whose roots are Irish and Scottish. They differ on religion with George being the pious and meek one and Arthur being the scientific type whose belief extends to the paranormal. While Arthur enjoys fame and fortune, George is subjected to a poison letter campaign, is accused of mutilating farm animals in his village and is sent to prison for three years on trumped up evidence. Arthur too, despite his better circumstances, lives in an emotional and sexual prison as his first wife Touie is suffering from consumption and is unable to perform her wifely duties. He is madly in love with the younger Jean, but has to keep the affair chaste and secret out of respect for his ailing wife. When Touie finally succumbs to her illness, a depressed Arthur looks for a cause to fire himself up and finds the George Edalji case befitting of a Sherlock Holmes type investigation.Reality mirrors fiction as Arthur and his assistant Wood play Holmes and Watson in re-opening the cold case (for by now, George has served his time and been released but is living with a criminal record which bars him from returning to his trade). Their Holmesian deductions and tampering with evidence jeopardizes the case and allows the Home Office to maintain that George deserved his “time” but is also eligible for a pardon – in Arthur’s irate words, “The great British solution has been applied. Something terrible has happened but nobody has done anything wrong. Nothing shall be anybody’s fault, and especially not ours.”The author concludes that much of the material contained in this book is factual, which left me wondering whether I would have had the patience to read this book if it had been about two unknown individuals and if I had not been such a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Probably not, for the style is biographical, especially Arthur’s segment, and the conclusion at the séance for the late Sir Arthur is anti-climactic and therefore the book does not come across as a novel, as it is claimed to be. And yet the prejudices, behaviour and practices of turn-of-the-last century England have been brought vividly to life by a writer who has obviously immersed himself in the history of that period and painstakingly drawn it with all its grace and imperfections. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 09, 2011","Nov 29, 2011","Nov 09, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45369.Arthur_George

One could argue that in today’s world the little chapters on each of these writers could be gleaned from Wikipedia and other Internet sources. But the spirit that the writers Henry and Dana Lee Thomas infuse into this book is what makes it special. I did not feel so alone and neglected as a writer while reading about these “greats” who had plenty of neglect, suffering and loss during their lifetimes. Some of them had climbed dizzying heights of success during their lives; others had only stared into the abyss.Let see, Rebelais, Cervantes and Defoe had a distrust of the law and their writing was artistic but flawed in craft; they all served prison sentences and flirted with bankruptcy and madness. Swift’s satirical solution to ending poverty was to have all one-year old children of the poor classes be eaten as food. Scott made a fortune in his writing and lost it all on his printing business then repaid his huge debts by writing more. Balzac was eternally broke and Flaubert died unrecognized. Hugo was successful as an author but his entire family predeceased him. Dostoevsky and Solzenitsyn fought the czar and communism respectively, a hundred years apart, and ended up in Siberian prisons (Solzenitsyn is not in this volume, I use him as a reference only). Tolstoy went from godliness to godlessness to war to anti-war to celibacy to abandoning his family in his old age. Maupassant committed suicide brought on by venereal disease. Zola went bankrupt defending a Jew’s rights to a fair trial. Twain disdained the low-brow tastes of his readers, yet wrote for the money. Critics called Hardy a “vile writer” for daring to speak out against the Social Code of his time.All these writers were gifted as children; they were not necessarily accomplished in school and were considered to be misfits. Their love lives were full of anguish, loss and, in some cases, infidelity. Many achieved their greatness late in life (i.e. past their fifties). They were unsung visionaries: Defoe saw the concept of a League of Nations 200 years before it came into existence. They constantly wrestled with the concepts of good and evil, justice and injustice, God and death; Twain considered death and insanity better rewards than life or God. Each chapter covers one of the writers, their life, a synopsis of one of their masterpieces and the circumstances leading to their death. If I were to level one criticism against the writing, it was that these writers’ ultimate deaths are glorified as a joyful passing, as if their lives on earth had been hells that had squeezed out some of the greatest literature for us to enjoy, and for achieving these feats, the writers were then allowed to enter the pearly gates having served their mortal purposes well.

So I guess my comments need to be appreciated in that light.The premise is interesting: the war viewed from the perspective of Germans, both those loyal and those disapproving of Hitler. Not all Germans were Jew-hating xenophobes, but all German’s paid the price for the Fuhrer’s megalomania. The narrator is even more interesting: Death, who is overworked and exhausted from the sheer number of souls he has to extract out of the war’s carnage and take over to the other side. The story centres around an orphan German girl, Liesel, who is raised by a compassionate and kind house painter and anti-Nazi, Hans Hubermann and his equally compassionate but brusque wife, Rosa. Liesel is considered “slow” in school but teaches herself to read by stealing books from the most unusual places, at a time when books were being burned by the Nazis. She even befriends the taciturn Mayor’s wife, who encourages Liesel to read and allows her to steal from the secret library in the mayoral home. Hans encourages Liesel in her quest for literacy by reading the stolen books with her, often late at night when Rosa is asleep. The family helps a Jew, Max, seeking refuge from the Nazis. Max lives in his hosts’ basement for almost two years, placing the Hubermans in danger. During that period an unspoken love develops between Liesel and Max, expressed only in illustrated stories written by the latter on painted-over pages of Mein Kampf. Leisel is pursued by her school mate Rudy—who runs faster than Jesse Owen—who would like nothing better than to kiss her, but she denies him this privilege, much to her later disappointment. Shades of Anne Frank’s Diary abound, albeit from the German perspective. Liesel soon graduates from reading stolen books to writing her life story, just like Anne did.The story moves very slowly towards its inevitable climax and is more a chronicle of three years in the life of Liesel, without a strong narrative arc. With Death as the narrator, we are forewarned of the inevitable tragedy to befall the Hubermans and their neighbours. And forewarned is an understatement for Death continues to give us chunks of advance information—call it foreshadowing on steroids—on what is going to happen to all these characters, which I found irritating. If Death was seeking to add a shock effect to my reading experience, he failed. Despite inventive devices such as bold indented notices littering each chapter to give us sudden bursts of new information or make side comments, and the using of Max’s cartoon pictures for relief, I found the clipped paragraphs, the one line sentences, and the sentimentality oozing out of the tragedy to be a bit overwhelming at times. Perhaps a younger audience may find this style more engaging. And yet to counterbalance this overdone treatment, there is great imagery: inmates’ gas chamber experiences, civilians under aerial bombardment, the Dachau-bound Jewish prisoners reacting to a piece of bread found on the street, Rosa sitting for hours with her absent husband’s accordion, the distraction that reading a book aloud inside an air-raid shelter brings to its cramped occupants, and Max “stealing stars from the sky” when he sees the outside world after months of living shut away in the Huberman’s basement. It is clear that not only despots like Saddam and Gaddafi drop bombs on innocent civilians, the Allies did their fair share of collateral damage when they bombed German cities during WWII. We know how things are going to end, badly for all, Germans and Jews alike. There is little hope in this book. Even Liesel who lives to a ripe old age after the war, is left an empty husk. Although she is re-united with Max after Hitler is defeated, it is not clear what became of their future relationship. Perhaps this aspect may have been developed more at the expense of wading in lot of unnecessary sentimentality.The lasting impression left on me by this book was not just that war is a futile endeavour – many books have been written about that – but that the power of words surpasses death. The book thief steals books to learn, then destroys her life story because she is incensed with the power of words, in their ability to destroy; after all, Hitler had used words to dazzle and blind his people into following his mad dream. But our narrator Death rescues her story from the trash pile because he knows that Liesel’s words are more powerful than he—another powerful image!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 20, 2011","Nov 15, 2011","Oct 20, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief

The creator of the Johnson Dictionary, a precursor to the Oxford English version, the man was a critic, poet and intellectual, blessed with a robust constitution and yet plagued by the “black dog” of death and prone to jerky movement now put down to Tourette’s Syndrome.This book covers the last twenty years of his life when the aging, dropsied and gout ridden giant of letters, failing in eyesight, begins to frequent the company of the wealthy Thrall family, and in particular, Mrs. Hester Thrall. Hester is also a woman of robust health, giving birth to 12 children, many who die young, and yet she possesses the vivacity and spirit to charm a coterie of writers, actors, musicians and artists who frequent the Thrall family home in Streatham. The most smitten is Johnson, whom she leaves heartbroken when she marries the musician Piozzi after Henry Thrall dies of stroke by gorging himself to death.Given that James Boswell wrote the “mother of all biographies” on Johnson and covered this very period, I wondered why the author chose this topic. The title says this account is “according to Queenie”, the Thrall’s oldest daughter, who is a baby when Johnson first arrives and who helps put the record straight at the end of each chapter by correcting various biographical references of the more detailed Boswell. Perhaps this is the authoritative and objective “woman’s perspective” of the great man.Nothing much happens in this book except that the reader is taken on a tour of the eccentric and idle lives of the privileged and their retinues: touring in France, listening to the political wrangling in Johnson’s household between his quarrelsome staff and permanent residents, or Johnson’s own his eruptions with Mrs. Thrall whom he needs as a constant audience for his brilliance, the cautious narrative references to there being more than a “friendly” relationship between Johnson and Hester while her husband is still alive, and the intellectual discourses at Streatham that range from the death pangs of scorpions to the benefits of onanism. The only antagonist here is Death, who comes suddenly and unexpectedly, at childbirth or at the onset of a mild cold.We get rich glimpses into life in the 18th century: actors losing it and battling each other on stage, buggery in the French court while the Royal couple partake of their meals in front of a viewing gallery, children given tin pills for worms that make them sicker, and ladies going “behind the bushes” while on long carriage rides. The narrative voice is archaic and fits the period; matters sexual are only referenced indirectly and the action is referred to obliquely. Thank God for Queeney’s summing up that help fill in the holes. Johnson, for all his greatness, is depicted as a rough and rude man with strong convictions, needing constant validation; he even sleeps with his wife’s maid while the former is dying, because he needs comforting. His descent into old age is pathetic and a grim reminder that mortality is no respecter of earthly achievement. And yet he peppers the book with interesting quotes: “It’s the fear of God that keeps me alive” and “Without a knowledge of hope, sorrow is unknown,” are just a sample. It is ironic that the two women Johnson loved the most, Hester and Queeney are both distanced from him during his final days. They say that men of great intellect are unable to excel in matters of the heart, and this is one such example. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 17, 2011","Oct 22, 2011","Oct 17, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/724014.According_to_Queeney

Reilly is certainly one of literature’s unforgettable characters, and so are many of the supporting cast of this farcical morality play, written by a writer who committed suicide in his 32nd year, winning the Pulitzer posthumously.Ignatius, a self-proclaimed genius, is lazy, opinionated, hypochondriacal, idealistic, flatulent and sexually scared, content to relieve himself with solo performances in his room. He is unemployed (and unemployable), lives in New Orleans with his harried and broke mother, and has an ambivalent relationship with his radical but sexually frustrated girlfriend, Myrna, who has run away to New York to start her own political movement. On his mother’s threat of declaring bankruptcy, Ignatius gets a job at Levy Pants, a derelict garments factory that exploits its employees. Ignatius tries to organize the workers to demand for better working conditions in an event that turns into a nightmare and gets fired. He ends up pushing a hot dog cart around the French Quarter, eating much of the product himself. He is the quintessential messiah for the downtrodden, eager to pick up any cause that will ease their burden. In these days of Occupy Wall Street, his story takes on special significance and reminds us that nothing much has changed in labour relations. Surrounding him in his adventures is a motley cast, the confederacy of dunces: a hapless policeman looking for his first arrest, Mrs. Reilly’s new boyfriend who sees a communist around every corner, and the denizens of the Night of Joy, a derelict bar, whose proprietor Lana Lee is selling more than booze. Lana also has a love-hate relationship with her cleaner, Jones, who works for her for peanuts, fearing being arrested as a vagrant if he is out of work. There are also the Levy’s, the owners of Levy Pants, locked in their own love-hate relationship, and the ancient Miss Trixie, who is not allowed to retire from Levy Pants for Mrs. Levy believes that will hasten the old lady’s physical and mental demise.Ignatius gets into some of the most bizarre situations and the book skirts caricature and contrivance in places – my only criticism. The author brings out the underbelly of New Orleans vividly and humorously, and the accents and prejudices are well displayed. Like a play, the scenes weave together fluidly with secondary characters taking centre stage the moment lead players make their exit.Certainly, a page-turner if you can stomach a gross, unhygienic and sometimes unsympathetic hero, who has the whole world conspiring against him, including his mother.There is an ending reminiscent of the movie “The Graduate.” We are left wondering if Ignatius, now re-united with Myrna, and free of the confederacy, will step out of his comfort zone finally and have that one explosive orgasm with her that will restore him to normalcy and retire him from the pages of literature as one heck of an unforgettable guy!

Doctor, writer, playwright, cricketer, politician, war correspondent, lecturer, volunteer soldier, businessman, inventor, investor, philanthropist, country squire, spiritualist, and political advisor are some of the titles that stick to him. However, while all the others could be considered “dabblings” or “strivings”, it was as a writer of popular fiction that Doyle effortlessly left his mark on the world. Sherlock Holmes, modeled on his teacher Dr. Joseph Bell, became his cash cow, his nemesis and a creation larger than Doyle. And despite the author’s attempts to throw Holmes off the Reichenbach Falls and re-invent himself as a “serious” writer of historical fiction, that attempt failed by popular demand, and Doyle lives on in posterity under Holmes’ shadow, much like his alter ego Dr. Watson.The letters could have been distilled to the most important ones, because there was a lot of unnecessary detail. One also has to make allowance for the fact that a son, so devoted to his mother and always wanting her approval, would couch even the most depressing news in a positive light. And yet, glimpses of the private Doyle appear in these letters: the lean years when he struggled to make it as a doctor and had to account for every penny, his devotion to his first wife, Touie, who was dying of tuberculosis while he went from strength to strength in his writing career, the support and generosity he afforded his large but less affluent family, the struggle in consumption-ridden hospitals he served in during the Boer War, the private sufferings when many of his family were killed in the Great War including his eldest son, the struggle with his mother on the issues of empire, spiritualism and adultery, views she held contrary to his. The last aspect arose from Doyle's relationship with Jean Leckie who ultimately became his second wife after being his mistress for several years while the ailing Touie was still alive. What was interesting for me was that Doyle too had to earn his stripes and put in his time before his writing career took off - 10 years. And yet a hundred years ago, the short story writer/novelist was at the pinnacle of earning power, in relative terms, and that was Doyle’s payoff for his hard work. It is also worth noting that his life was not one of achieving all his goals: his medical career fizzled, he failed at political office twice, his invention of the Autowheel was ahead of its time, his plays had mixed success, and his historical novels were overshadowed by Sherlock Holmes. Doyle’s final retreat into Spiritualism was his way of coming to terms and keeping in touch with his family who had predeceased him; and here too his efforts at championing this cause garnered indeterminate results.In the end, one could conclude that Doyle achieved one goal – the one we all aspire for – he lived a “full, varied, and useful life,” one he had always desired, as he revealed to his dear “Mam” once....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 03, 2011","Oct 05, 2011","Oct 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/359482.Arthur_Conan_Doyle

The novel disappoints, for it flatlines on story and character (even though Ravelstein is a multifaceted personality), whereas a biography or memoir of the real duo would have been more impactful.Ravelstein and Chick (Bloom and Bellow respectively, as I made out) are a modern day Socrates and Plato. Ravelstein is a flamboyant philosopher king who hit the jackpot with one bestseller and is now dying of AIDS. He urges his protégée Chick, an accomplished writer, to write his memoir. The protégée resists, believing that once he has written the book, there will be no more reason to live. Chick, who is older than his mentor, has a young wife, Rosamund, one of Ravelstein’s former student’s, and is therefore reluctant to give up the ghost yet.And so we are entertained to a series of Socratic dialogues in which the two academics debate every topical subject under the sun while in Paris and later in Chicago. Brush up on your understanding of Keynes, Greek Philosophy, Jewish history and the Classics (art, literature and music) if you want a deeper appreciation of this book. Ravelstein not only dominates his students in thought, he dissects their personal lives and relationships. The lengthy discussion where the master disassembles Chick’s first marriage to the beautiful and talented Vela, starts to get rather uncomfortable for Chick, and for this reader too.The philosophical nuggets are the best parts of the book. Lines like, “artists fall in love, but love is not their primary gift,” and “nature and solitude are depressing to educated people getting old,” are priceless. But I take issue with Chick’s literary prowess when he arbitrarily introduces a character as “Rakhmiel was neither a large man nor a healthy one, but he was physically conspicuous just the same – compact and dense, high handed, tyrannical, fixated and opinionated.” Wow, “show don’t tell” does not apply to this master, it seems!And then, as to be expected, Ravelstein dies, but only past the midpoint of the book, and the story veers over to Chick’s brush with death by accidentally eating toxic fish while on holiday in the Caribbean. There are oodles of hospital scenes and hallucinations that follow, and sleepless nights suffered by the loyal Rosamund, until Chick is well again but never to regain his former self. Chick also never completes Ravelstein’s memoir and the novel fades away into nothingness leaving only the parallel with Socrates and Plato who also succumbed to the poisons of their age.I think only someone of Bellow’s stature would attempt a book like this, but stature notwithstanding, in not sticking to the rudimentary structure of a novel, it fails to hold. The final image of a weakened Chick day-dreaming of his erstwhile colleague in full flight left me wondering whether Ravelstein and Chick and their two incomplete story segments were like the severed human looking eternally for his other half, ostensibly the subject of Ravelstein’s bestseller, which we also did not get a chance to sample....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 24, 2011","Oct 03, 2011","Sep 24, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/324245.Ravelstein

Is this a trend?A close relative stuck this book in my hand and said, “You’ve dabbled in the corporate game, read this book.” So I did. And I enjoyed the boardroom intrigue of Nick Conover, CEO of a major office furniture manufacturer in the Midwest, facing the hollowing out of manufacturing in North America replete with outsourcing, layoffs at home, take-overs, sell-offs and executive suite allegiance-shifting that can raise even a reader’s blood pressure. Then another story began to hover for prominence, a crime and its cover-up involving Nick. It reminded me of the TV series Columbo, when we know whodunnit at the outset and the tension hovers around let-see how-the-cops-figure-out-how-he-dunnit. And then to compound the situation, in keeping with the stock advice to thriller writers of “place your protagonist in a sticky situation, then make it worse, then make it even worse, and more...until the reader is screaming for reality to return”, the crime story veers off into a Fatal Attraction type scenario with a final Hollywood-style conflagration where everyone is at risk until the neglected and suppressed cop, Audrey, pulls off a winner.I wished the second strand had not been included, although I understand why: this is a thriller, and certain rules of the game have to be followed, even though they can be melodramatic and distort what was otherwise a well-grounded and realistic human drama.I found Nick and Audrey and their respective family scenarios well developed although some other aspects were shallow. For instance, I couldn’t understand how a drunk former accountant could immediately spot a flaw in a corporate sale contract that none of the other sober ones could, and how an unemployed manager would be having dinner in the town’s fanciest restaurant; recurring melodramatic statements like “the hand that held her was also the hand that held the gun,” were a bit of a turn off too. And yet, some truisms about corporate life were nicely slid in: “Corporations are about continuity, capital markets are about creative destruction,” and “Bosses have bosses. There was always somebody whose ass you had to kiss.”Although I read this page-turner very quickly and was engaged throughout, I had to ask myself why I was left feeling ambivalent in the end. Is it because corporate worlds, police-procedurals and psychopathic thrillers don’t mix very well? Or is it because, in combining all three, we sub-optimize the individual components? ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2011","Sep 06, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/375955.Company_Man

In keeping with the There are two distinct story lines here and I wondered if they would have been more powerful if developed as two separate novels. In keeping with the title of the novel, we are introduced to seventeen year old Lizzy and her family and their stay at the Retreat for her mother’s “rehabilitation.” Weaving through is a more interesting story of two Native Indian brothers fighting for survival and validation in a white man’s world, and failing.Based around an event when the Ojibway occupied the Anicinabe Park in Kenora, we get to spend the summer of 1974 at the Retreat with the Byrd family: Lizzy, the doer and surrogate mother to her younger siblings, her fourteen year old brother Everett grappling with his blossoming sexuality that could tip him in either direction orientation-wise, Mrs. Byrd, the absentee mother, who is constantly looking to discover herself even if it means having trysts with the Retreat’s self-styled guru Dr Amos, Mr. Byrd who thinks the Retreat is a big joke but will do anything to keep his wife and family intact, and four-year old Fish, the youngest child, who likes to wander off and get lost and bring the family face-to-face with its deepest fissures. Surrounding the Byrds is a motley cast of visitors, permanent and transitory, to the Retreat, seeking wisdom from the enigmatic doctor on how to cope in the real world. There is even a crippled writer, Harris, who befriends the children, whose wife is making out with another guest while he likens himself to “a dull moth banging at an unlit lantern.”On the other side of the spectrum is Raymond, the eighteen year old Ojibway boy who likes white girls and constantly gets into trouble with prejudiced law enforcement officers as a result of this fatal attraction. Raymond snags his girls by being indifferent and remote, partly due to his fear of being arrested, but that cocktail is irresistible to his more privileged girlfriends from the other side of the tracks. His brother Nelson is more outgoing, but as he was once taken away from home and adopted by a white family, Nelson is more cynical about the plight of the Native Indian. Both are likely candidates to be drawn into the Ojibway occupation of the park that is to follow before the summer ends.Viewed from the perspectives of the children, we see that the adults are all screwed up and are poor role models for their progeny. As Lizzy observes, “most adults wanted what they couldn’t or didn’t have, and they would hurt people to get it.” Yet the sexuality is downplayed while the sensuality is notched up – there is a lot of touching and smelling going on, especially among the young ones. I found the style distinct: sparse prose, pronouns dropped, dialogue “told” or narrated, and sentences ending on prepositions (the English teacher’s nightmare!)What disappointed me was that there was a lot of waiting between events and I felt that I had spent my whole summer at this Retreat by the time I ended the novel. There are missed opportunities for drama between Raymond and the cops, when Fish goes “walkabout,” and when Lizzie wanders around in the woods or in town on her own, but they are all downplayed, resolved quickly or ignored. I wonder if that is something about writing a Canadian literary novel and preferring bland. And despite the major portion of the book being dedicated to the inhabitants at the Retreat and to Lizzy’s coming of age, the novel ends with a more tense sequence of events involving Raymond and Nelson. I guess, after all the waiting, some tension was called for, but in the presentation it felt like two different stories were trying to cohabit within the same book, almost like the Indian boy and his white girlfriend trying to find a life together and failing. In that sense, I wondered whether The Retreat was a misnomer and if Two Different Worlds may have been more apt?...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 22, 2011","Sep 02, 2011","Aug 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3265232-the-retreat

Back in 1951-52, the key to escaping death on the frontRoth’s short novel captures the fear inherent in American youth at the time of the Korean War. Back in 1951-52, the key to escaping death on the front lines was to obtain a university degree and land a job in Intelligence.Marcus, our protagonist, is a sophomore at a small conservative university in Ohio, far away from his home in Newark, and far away from his father, a kosher butcher, who obsesses over Marcus’ safety to the point of paranoia. Marcus is focussed on his studies, fuelled by a fear of flunking and being sent to the front. He is therefore reclusive, does not join any fraternities or sports teams, or visit the chapel 40 times a year (a mandatory condition to obtain his degree). His single date is with a mentally disturbed, suicidal classmate, Olivia, who specializes in “going down” on her boyfriends, much to Marcus’s surprise and subsequent pleasure. He soon can’t get enough of Olivia’s ministrations; she even obliges him while he is recovering in hospital from an appendectomy. Marcus’s solitary behaviour gets in the way of him living amicably with his roommates and catches the attention of the Dean who likes to probe the intimate lives of his students.Quirky characters dot the pages: Flusser, the roommate who practices theatrical lines aloud in bed to the accompaniment of Beethoven music; Elwyn, the other roomie who prefers cars to girls; University President Lentz, who addresses his students like General Patton at the Italian front; and of course, Olivia, flashing her scarred wrists so that potential mothers-in-law will run scared and hide their sons from her.We are treated to discourses on Bertrand Russell (Marcus’ hero) and to ever widening incidents of masturbation, so much that the entire campus explodes in a riot and the male students spray themselves all over the women’s dorm on a wintry night of infamy and shame that goes down in the campus’ history books. The humour amidst the paranoia helps dispel some of the dark tragedy lurking in the wings. Marcus is not absolved of the impending doom facing his generation, and despite his valiant efforts, he suffers from his father’s persecution complex and is drawn into the nightmare he has dreaded all along.I wondered after finishing this book, whether Roth was commenting on the legacy of guilt and fear carried by the Jews over the centuries and if he was trying to suggest the inevitability of tragic destruction for the individual carrying it.

Right there we see the looming disconnect, because aristocrats did not work in the trades and trades people viewed the aristocracy as people with “fine manners and unpaid bills.” Charles encounters the older, more mature but mysterious Sarah, the French Lieutenant’s Woman, a fallen woman and a governess, and is immediately infatuated with her. Sarah leads Charles on a dance of desire with her aloofness, mystery, depression and unpredictability. After Charles and Sarah have their first sexual encounter, he breaks off his engagement to the virginal Ernestina out of a sense of duty towards his new lover and gets sued for his actions. Well, that’s one of the juicier endings, I won’t reveal the others. Through the action of the book, and the narrator’s invasive prodding, we discover that Charles is the embodiment of Victorian Man (follow the rules, duty above self) evolving towards Modern Man (self over everything else); Sarah is the emergent emancipated woman, educated to be above her station, waiting to be released from her Victorian bondage. She is also the warrior who out-manoeuvres the pampered intellectual man, Charles, from possessions and territory. In between the story there are digressions: we are treated to long lessons on the forms of Victorian contraceptive devices, a primer on geological specimens and an overview of the social classes in England—from the “snobs” of 1867 to the “mods” of the 1960’s. There is also a rich treasury of new words that I added to my vocabulary: eleemosynary (charitable), barouche (horse and carriage) and helot (lowest order of serfs) among others. The narrator even takes it upon himself to define God as “the freedom that allows other freedoms to exist.”Having read The Magus and now The French Lieutenant’s Woman, I get the impression that Fowles uses the novel as a device to play out a much larger social commentary. Like his Magus, he uses a combination of alternative scenarios, manipulation and intrusive observation to get his points across all the while engaging us in a story to dull the edges of what would otherwise have been an academic treatise on post-modernism....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Aug 06, 2011","Aug 15, 2011","Aug 06, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56034.The_French_Lieutenant_s_Woman

Interesting observations dot the stories: “Drunks wear their innermost urges on their sleeves.” And interesting confessions too: “I’ve not had sex in a thousand days,” says the uncle as he succumbs to his nephew’s drug regimen. The lessons in the story “The Bronze Miracle” cover the opportunities in life, the power of luck and the futility of planning.Many of the characters find redemption through their actions, even though those actions may be harmful to them: the drunk out on parole keeps downing drinks and repeatedly driving past a RIDE patrol because he thinks the female cop on duty is the sweetest thing he has seen since being released.Altogether a smorgasbord of human situations covering an uncomfortable theme, rendered with compassion and humour.

However, I came to understand why novels and poetry stand apart as two different forms, and although they borrow heavily from each other, the fusion of the two into “the same sea” leaves one quite “at sea.”The author enters the minds of a group of people in Israel: a widowed father, his soul-searching son, the son’s stay-behind girlfriend and her lovers, the son’s pick-up girlfriend while on the road, the father’s wannabe girlfriend who is herself a widow, the matriarch while she is alive and dead, and most interestingly, the author himself, who as the narrator mixes freely with his characters and dissects their lives.Nothing much happens in this book other than for the narrator offering us rich insights into each of the characters through set pieces of poetry or short prose. Their relationships to each other, their desires (or loss of desire in the case of the widower), memories, angst and feelings are laid bare in lyrical language. Oz takes us into taboo places: the father’s lust for his son’s girlfriend, the girlfriend’s reciprocation, the son’s anger at his mother dying on him. I felt the author was enjoying himself not only in taking tea with his characters and spying on them but also in playing with words.

I was left hanging, wondering how much more impactful this novel would have been had Oz, given his flair for language and his fearlessness to plumb character, decided to write it as a conventional novel, replete with a story line that would have seen some of the conflicts resolved; how much further could he have travelled with this book that way?

It read more like a year in the life of the protagonist, Isabel, with a series of incidents, rather than a story that builds towards a climax.Isabel, a 14-year old girl, has a spiritual and symbiotic bond with her older brother Isaias, who has left their drought-ridden village to make it in the big city “down south” in this unnamed South American country that could be anything from Brazil to Peru to Argentina. Isabel follows in the path of her brother, undertaking a perilous journey on a flatbed that nearly kills her, partly to be reunited with him, and partly to escape being dependant on her parents who are eking out a living on the farm. She finds employment in the city slum caring for a cousin’s baby during the week and waving flags for a political candidate on weekends. Her quest for Isaias takes her into some dangerous situations but the imagined presence of her brother, who seems to be always around her, steers her out of trouble. The revelation in the end is anti-climactic, but the message, that out perceived greatness is not inherent and only comes from those who confer it upon us, is clear. The other inevitability: the drift from village to city, where the villagers end up in dead-end jobs, and that this cycle is perpetuated with every batch of new entrants, is more than clear too.The writing is beautiful and this redeems the book somewhat, but the conflicts come in a series of little bumps which quickly resolve themselves and do not build upon each other. More could have been done with Isabel’s disastrous outing to the discotheque in the city, or when she lost baby Hugo on the bus. The author conjures the impression that everyone is waiting for something to happen, like Isabel waiting for Isaias to show up; alas, as a reader, I too was waiting but nothing happened for me to say “ah, ha!” in the end.I liked the descriptions of village and city and they come across as if the writer spent considerable time in these locales and immersed himself in the life there.

He is out every evening boozing, partying and womanizing. Yet his wife, Amina, is only allowed to leave the house to visit her sick mother.

The interesting fact is that both the men and the women of the al-Jawad household are stable within this role-based life and no one is seen to be doing anything wrong, least of all Ahmad in the eyes of his women-folk.In this insulated household, how does Amina conceal an accident that causes her injury when visiting a mosque she was forbidden to visit, how does Yasin deal with being caught sleeping with his wife’s maid, how does Fahmy disguise ‘handing out pamphlets’ from his father, and how does Ahmad himself explain to the British military why he is out late at night during a curfew? The answer is to lie. Concealment becomes second nature within this family.And then life intervenes into Ahmad’s perfect world. Ahmad who is willing to support nationalism from a distance as long as it does not interfere with his lifestyle or family, is gradually drawn into the changes that are sweeping across his country and pays a huge price; and so does his family. The book leaves him suffering but enlightened and not yet out for the count (there are two more books in this trilogy) and one is curious to see where Ahmad and his way of life will end up as the country matures and goes through yet another world war and more upheaval in the Middle East. Not very far I would conclude, even after nearly a hundred years, considering that Egypt went through another convulsion to expel a dictatorial regime this year, and has launched a website called Harass Net to combat the sexual harassment of women. I found the writing sensitively rendered but laboured. The omniscient narrator plumbs deep into the minds, hearts and motives of each of the principle characters, leaving little to the reader’s imagination. There is dialogue followed by explanation of the dialogue, then more dialogue and more explanation and I wondered whether the English translation suffers due to the original text being in classical Arabic. And yet some scenes are diabolic (Ahmad expelling his injured wife from his house) and others hilarious (Ahmad seducing the actress Zubayda with a delicate mixture of poetry, innuendo and fawning).Nevertheless, I continued through this very long book, engaged with this family, dysfunctional though it may appear by western standards, whose members, including our anti-hero Ahmad, have endearing sides to them. Ahmad emerges from the pages as a truly unforgettable literary character, warts and all. After all, how can you fault a benign sociopath who believes that he is doing the right thing?Perhaps, in consenting to this English translation, Naguib Mahfouz was trying to caution westerners to beware of trying to bridge cultures with political interference, wars, education or trade. Perhaps each culture needs its own route to evolution and should be judged on its own merits....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 07, 2011","Jul 22, 2011","Jul 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/762134.Palace_Walk

Kyatruk in this novel, one most likely to end in failure. The pacing of the thriller gets diluted with literary musing and we end up with neither a literary piece nor a thriller. If I had to place my bet on this book though, I’d say it is more literary than thriller. I liked the contrast of the mountain climber risking his life for personal glory vs. the doctor who risks his for others, and the writer’s conclusion of leaving the latter to continue healing for another day while the climber self destructs after coming to terms with his demons.Based on a true incident on the border of Nepal and Chinese-controlled Tibet, a group of North American mountain climbers witness a group of Tibetan refugees being stopped at the porous dividing line by Chinese troops in an altercation that involves shooting and injury. The Canadian doctor among the mountaineers, Lewis Book, a selfless healer, opts to cross into Chinese territory to help the injured and is arrested, while the leader of the team, Wade Lawson, prefers non-involvement and retains his focus on this last shot at scaling the mountain and restoring his former reputation as a mountain climber. Sophie is Book’s rebellious teenage daughter struggling for her father’s attention and willing to risk her life to gain it, while Amaris, a Chinese-Canadian film maker, committed to covering Lawson’s last climb, is having an ambiguous and unsatisfying sexual relationship with the mountaineer while being attracted at a deeper level to the good doctor. Sprinkled amidst these westerners is a motley group of Tibetans: soldiers, rebels, nuns and young families, some whose names and forms I could never quite get because they all seemed to speak in one voice. The story diverges with the border incident, one strand following Book’s odyssey into China and his return via a tortuous trek accompanied by the same band of refugees making a second attempt at freedom, while the other follows Lawson up Mt. Kyatruk, both lines converging once more at the base of the mountain at the novel’s predictable climax.Heighton uses this opening incident at the Tibet/Nepal border to full advantage, viewing it repeatedly from many of the characters’ viewpoints. It is a clever device to introduce back-story on the principal players and tell us how each of them came to be in this location at this point in time.Using the present tense attempts to provide immediacy but somehow it is out of tempo with the plodding narrative where everything and everyone on the trail had to be covered in great detail at all times; the omniscient narrator is like an attentive tour guide constantly checking up on his charges. Frequent flashbacks also intrude on the pacing, some appearing in the middle of a tense scene, diffusing the tension. That Heighton is a poet is obvious, when lyrical but unformed sentences pop up all the time: “An anxious cacophony,” “The Tibetans filling out.” And I think he needs to brush up on his sex scenes; the desperate fumbling between Book and Amarys while in camp, kind of lost it for me. Compensating for all this is the moonscape-like terrain of this region that is brought vividly to life in the writing. All that said, I enjoyed this book given its rare setting and strong metaphors. If I can coin an unformed sentence like Heighton to summarize the novel, I would say, “Blind ambition and blind service separating at a blind border...” ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 27, 2011","Jul 09, 2011","Jun 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8110917-every-lost-country

It is part journal, part memoir, part flash-fiction collection, part self-promotion, and partly an emerging author’s experimentation with “anything goes.” I think the best way to describe The Lexical Funk is that it is an early scrapbook of what could become a unique voice in the literary canon in future, the attempts of an emerging writer trying to discover a new form. Those who have succeeded in the past are the ones we remember the most: Flaubert, Hemingway, Miller...will we add Clausen to our list one day?Daniel Clausen makes no claim that there is a unifying theme to this collage, except that he is playing with words and not pulling punches with his insight into character. His characters are an eccentric mix of marginalized denizens: fetishists, necrophiliacs, sexually abused women, androids, aliens, starving college students and talking vegetables, among others. One character recurs throughout many of the pieces: a rather highly strung, fringe-dweller male (Clausen?) with a penchant for calling it as it is. The pieces range from one-page rants to a long college journal on the penis envy raging between our marginalized male narrator and his one-track-minded buddy, Brian. There is a real energy in the writing and one feels the sincerity and earnestness of the author.The two stories that have the best form, structure and messages, elements I look for in fiction, are “Rich Jacobs Searches for the Meaning of Life” in which talking vegetables are smarter than humans and reveal that “to be eaten” is our manifest destiny in this hierarchical world where those above in the pecking order eat those below, and “Starlight Terror & the Cappuccino Machine” in which an alien teaches our hero that the only way forward, is forward. I found the other pieces were either too short, incomplete, or too cryptic and I resisted having to decipher their profundity, if indeed there were pearls of wisdom to be found. A reader does not have to work hard all the time, and a writer’s job is to provide enlightenment seamlessly. In that vein, I wonder whether “Murder in New York” could be blown out into a full-length novel?That Clausen is at the beginning of his quest as a serious writer, and is self-absorbed in his mission, is obvious, for he frequently intrudes into the stories and does not let them unfold organically through his characters. A case in point is the early android story in which I wanted to tell the robotic narrator to shut up, for he kept “telling” us everything about the theory of androids aping humans; I wanted to tell our android friend to just get on with bonging the human he was plan to bong and let us decide where the divergence between humans and machines lay. But therein lies the power of these stories, for they elicit strong emotions in readers.After reading every page in this book, I sat back to reflect on my own writing style. Has fiction moved on from where we traditional story tellers have been mining all this time? In a 140-byte universe, will poetry and flash fiction emerge as the leaders in future? Clausen is surely onto a good thing here, and we would be well advised to keep tabs on where he is going and where the form of the short story and the novel are heading in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 27, 2011","Jun 27, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2927664-the-lexical-funk

The reader is free to write his own ending.Veronica is a fortyish female from a large Irish Catholic family, who is having a meltdown in the wake of brother Liam’s suicide a la Virginia Woolfe (stones in pockets and all!). Liam’s death brings on the ghost of a secret the two shared since childhood, and when that secret is revealed midway (thank God, for I am tired of those books that burrow their way only to land at the beginning), it is not such an earth shattering event after all, and it did not even happen to Veronica. I wanted to scream out, “There are worse things happening in this world, child! Grow up!”Veronica is not a very pleasant protagonist. She is sarcastic, bitchy, does not work, is removed from her young children, does not sleep with her breadwinner husband whom she stole away from another woman, drinks most days, stays awake most nights, and is obsessed with male penises. The entire story happens in her head and events are all jumbled – stream of consciousness on steroids. Some of the events described, particularly those around Grandma Ada and her lover Nugent, may not even have happened but could have been imagined by Veronica. Could, for instance, the seminal event (pardon the pun) that took place in 1968, have been a figment of Veronica’s penile fascination and not the cause of it?As the large family gathers for the funeral of Liam, the tensions and dysfunctions start to surface and they seem to be the typical outpourings of a large Catholic family that grew up in a crowded space where secrets were hidden and conflicts buried only to explode at weddings, funerals and baptisms. And yet nothing is resolved and the family members fade back into their little cubbyholes after burying their dead sibling. Only Veronica is left in meltdown country and forced to face her dysfunctional life and – for the first time – do something about it (which I presume will come out in the sequel, given that this book ends on such a pregnant note)I’ll grant the writing is visceral and energetic and gets the reader into the characters’ bloodstreams and seminal ducts – hence perhaps the nod from the Booker committee.

Sam Clay is his New Yorker cousin who also worships Houdini and writes fantastic scripts and pulp novels. Put these two together and they come up with a series of comic books that rival the established superheroes of the day: Superman, Captain America, Batman et al.Kavalier impotently fights the Nazis through his superheroes and dreams of helping his family escape the concentration camps to America, while Clay is trying hard to cover up his latent homosexuality. Both are trapped in metaphoric coffins, while their alter-ego hero, The Escapist, with his Hitler-bashing escapades, becomes a hit and makes them rich in the New World, and makes their unscrupulous bosses even richer. The theme of entrapment and escape runs through the novel: Kavalier’s escape from Prague, his enslavement in an observation station in the Antarctic in the company of dead crew and dogs, his later forced hiding inside the Empire State Building as he feverishly works on his new line of comic books, his desire to escape again by jumping off the said building. Clay too has his share entrapment: his sexual orientation, the marriage he falls into out of duty and as an escape from homosexuality, the dead-end jobs at various publishing houses after the magic of Kavalier & Clay has run out, the public inquisition into his sexual preferences for creating his superheroes with young male wards (even Batman and Robin are not spared here). In the end, the love of a good woman and her son conquers all, our two heroes find their niche, and there is a hint of the triumphant reincarnation of Kavalier & Clay.I liked several aspects of this novel: the snippy and witty dialogue, the creativity of the young artists locked in a garret coming up with amazing storyboards , their self-deprecating humour, “I didn’t know they were making detectives out of Jews,” the footnotes in various sections which read like factoids and lend a sense reality to this work of fiction. There are bold extensions into the real world as well, when the legal wrangling of real-life competitors in the comic book industry is brought into the mix, and when the author comments on the personal grooming of Gala Dali or observes that Orson Welles smells like Dolores Del Rio – I guess one is allowed to take license with dead people!What I did not like was the elaborate set-ups, the stories within stories that are “told” by a rather didactic and pompous omniscient narrator to bring us up to speed on what had taken place during a time gap. The prose is clunky and littered with heavy doses of information on the history and mechanics of the comic book industry. Much of this could have been cut out to create a tighter novel. The author himself sums up this vilified art form (which has re-emerged as the more dignified “graphic novel today) as “the inspirations and lucubrations of five hundred aging boys dreaming as hard as they could for fifteen years, transfiguring their insecurities and delusions, their wishes and their doubts, their public educations and their sexual perversions, into something that only the most purblind of societies would have denied the status of art” – need he have said more?Excesses and digressions notwithstanding, I liked the story. This is story-telling at its peak; and in the end, great novelists are great story tellers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 07, 2011","May 22, 2011","May 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay

Stephen King is known to create interesting scenarios, toss unforgettable characters into the pot, and let them work their way out of the stew—this novel is certainly one in which all of the above is done superbly.The one drawback for me is that the entire book focuses on the situation: Paul Sheldon, bestselling author of romance novels, crippled in a car crash, is held hostage for several months by Annie Wilkes, his number one fan, in an isolated farmhouse in the Rockies, and is forced to bring his heroine Misery back to life, a heroine he had gladly killed off because she had made him famous but stereotypical and had prevented him from writing his more serious novels. And so goes the game of cat and mouse in this remote house, in which Annie periodically flies into rages and dispatches pieces of Paul the moment he diverts his focus from re-incarnating Misery, or whenever he pisses her off with his irreverent comments during her “bad moods.” Intriguing though Paul’s battle for survival is we do not learn much about him as a person, or why Annie Wilkes had become this demented mass murderer.King uses compelling imagery: the piling emerging on the shore when the tide goes out resemble Paul’s shattered legs; the waves are his accompanying agony when Annie’s painkillers wear out; the bird in the Boston Zoo, far away from its natural habitat in Africa, is analogous to Paul being held prisoner in Annie’s farmhouse. And the keys fall out of the old Royal typewriter which Paul uses to breathe life back into Misery in even time to him parting company with his organs under Annie’s ministrations.Annie alternates as Paul’s tormentor, his muse, and the unintelligent reader who dismisses his serious work for popular faire; she is unaware of literary devices and is accepting of hackneyed ploys like the “parachute under the airplane seat” which gets heroes out of jams in pulp fiction. And of course, how does she turn a mild-mannered author into a killer himself? Just burn the only copy of his latest manuscript and watch what happens.Given the central focus on the situation—two people duking it out in a farmhouse—King uses long swaths of narrative and italicized monologue to convey Paul’s terror, especially each time the unkempt and smelly Annie approaches him with an axe, a blowtorch or an electric knife – will you spare my dong this time? The draw of the book for me—and I am biased as a writer—is when King drops occasional hints about how a writer approaches, and is wedded to, his craft: how, despite the shambles of his personal life, the writing keeps him alive, how the writer will risk death to save his manuscript, and how the greatest plotting comes under times of great stress. A few gems for the writing scrapbook: “art consists of the persistence of memory” and “memory is more important than talent for the writer.”And yet the dialogue lets King down at times: Paul frequently speaks to Annie as if they are having a drink at the bar, not as a person weakened by his injuries and living in terror of her next unpredictable move. The melodramatic Misery story that dots the novel is hilarious for its overwrought style and is a good foil for King’s energetic prose in the main story line. In the end, the tables are predictably turned and the cavalry come to the rescue, but King clutches hold of the reader for a final gasp, reliant mainly on the febrile imagination of Paul (or King) the writer.This is an enjoyable and fast read, although some parts, especially the ones of slash and burn, could be skipped without losing the plotline. There have been repeated questions raised whether King is a literary writer. Even though this book was written over twenty years ago, I think not, although he is a master craftsman and a superb story teller and that in itself renders him in a class of his own....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,May 2011,"May 08, 2011","May 01, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10614.Misery

The editor promptlI once wrote a novel about memory and it came out as a series of linked (and unlinked) short stories that tied together at the end. The editor promptly told me to turn it into a “proper” novel, with a dramatic arc, and a main story line enriched by sub plots, and to include all the trappings of fully rounded characters and a coherent theme and so on and on; and I meekly complied. In this short novel (novella, perhaps) Ross takes a “damn the torpedoes” approach to the novel form, throws out all those recommendations my editor had given me, and gives us a series of short vignettes from the life of Ben, the Jewish protagonist; they appear like staccato bursts of unconnected memory, “one’s life flashing before you at the point of death,” and the reader has to wait until the end to find out why. For this “novel” approach, I applaud Ross’s irreverence for the status quo and for his desire to stretch the novel into new frontiers. The central plot circles around a mysterious (and unexplored) anti-Semite named Rolf Köber who is shot dead in the street by Ben’s mother for some unknown reason. She is dying of cancer and has lost most of her family to the concentration camps during WII—is this her single act of defiance against the Third Reich? Who is Köber and what is his relationship to Ben’s family? In between humorous reminiscences of Ben’s childhood, we keep returning to this soul-altering scene, which Ben tries to explore from multiple viewpoints, even from that of the bullet that killed Köber. Ben is a bit of a loser. A performance artist by trade, and not a very good one, he seems to have ambled through life losing his family members along the way: both parents to cancer at different times, and a brother to a stroke or mysterious illness which robs him of memory. Ben does not appear to have any other deep relationships, male or female, except for a sobby dalliance with his brother’s girlfriend. While I enjoyed the humorous, sincere and incisive writing, I wished Ross had not used so many names and lists from history to anchor his story; parsing them out led to an even shorter novella—perhaps a long short story—in the end. I am not sure why I needed to know all the titles in the Hardy Boys series (all of which I have read, by the way) or the menu list at the Dragon Paradise Chinese restaurant—but if this is all part of “one’s life flashing before you” I’ll withhold judgement on Ross until I am at that moment myself one day. Without spoiling the end for the reader, I’d like to say that this incoherent meandering is all revealed ultimately and the novel comes full circle when you realize that “ the end is the beginning is the end” (is that the title of that Smashing Pumpkin song? Strangely I do not recall the Pumpkins mentioned in any of Ben’s copious lists, but there were too many names on those lists anyway and I skipped quite a number).I was disappointed at the ending. There is no redemption, no hope. Everyone loses, except for perhaps for Ben’s Mama, when in that brief moment of defiance she pulled the trigger and sent the Jew-hater and his hard hat up into the sky—or was that repeating scene a part of Ben’s addled imagination too? The trauma of the holocaust is known to plague subsequent generations—but dammnit—it would have been nice to see our hero Ben break the cycle. Many questions linger at the end of this book, foremost among them being, despite the irreverence and the experimentation, is this still a novel as claimed on the front cover?

He hates the lifestyle she represents yet willingly settles for a generous “allowance” so that he can live apart and “poor.” This pseudo-poor state does not do his soul any good (for he can always go back to mama for a stake if times get tough) and he drifts into an obsessive relationship with a seventeen year old working class girl, Cecilia, who was the model for an older painter and neighbour, Balastrieri. The old painter has just died, reputedly in the throes of wild and compulsive sex with his model. Dino rationalizes that if he can quickly love and dump Cecilia, without any emotional entanglement, he should emerge the superior. The reality is that our weak hero quickly takes Balastrieri’s place by falling for the young woman’s deadly mix of indifferent affections, apparent naivety and primal carnality. What follows is a chase in which Dino attempts to possess Cecilia so that he can discard her, while she leads him on a dance of jealousy as she openly shares his affections with a younger actor.Despite a thin story line, psychological tensions run high in this novel as each character is trying to gain possession of another: Dino’s mother of her son through money; Dino of Cecilia via sex, money, marriage, even contemplated murder; Balastrieri of Cecilia via his health-destroying romps in the sack and obsessive painting of her half-woman, half-child body—none of which work and only lead to more emptiness and desire. And it takes a knock on the head for Dino to come to his senses and realize that people can be loved even if they stand separate from each other, and that this is the most endearing and satisfying form of love. Cecilia represents the childlike beacon, steering those who come across her path towards this epiphany. I found the writing dense with long narrative passages relieved only in places by staccato dialogue. Dino (like the author, I suspect), the first-person narrator, is obsessive about detail and gives us too much information most of the time, particularly around his thoughts and motivations. To his credit, the author gives us the painter’s appreciation for form in his descriptive passages; Dino analyses Cecilia’s physical frame into a myriad of dimensions and characteristics: “the thinness of the torso, the vigorous curve of the lower back, the superabundant masculinity of the loins” etc. A subtle vein of humour also permeates, especially when the jealous Dino gets constantly sucked into ridiculous interrogations of his lover’s activities and associations, and when he futilely spies on her movements. And the class distinctions between the working class and the aristocracy are well drawn.I wasn’t bored with this book, despite its overbearing style.

Shepherd only wants to write novels about the former grandeur of Mexico and the causes that led to its decline, but his books eerily remind those in power that nothing much has changed between one empire and another. He becomes the object of persecution by the Committee on Un-American Activities (on whose bench sat one Richard M. Nixon, hmm!) until he finally decides on his own exit from this flawed world via the Lacuna, both a metaphoric and physical gap between one world and another.Shepherd is the quintessential observer, hiding the dark secret of his homosexuality, while always being under the domination of a stronger older woman: first his opportunistic and flamboyant mother Salome, then the bombastic and original Frida, and finally the organized and steadfast Mrs. Brown. He is a loner and a voracious chronicler of events, sights and sounds (some sections of the book read like a travelogue); he shuns publicity and is fiercely loyal to only a few people in his small circle. And yet the power of his pen mobilizes fans worldwide and infuriates governments. However, he is unable to staunch the wave of character assassination that washes over him because of his past associations and writing – a cautionary tale for writers today as well, in our increasingly litigious society. What impresses me about this novel is the variety of styles and devices used to carry the story: part journal, part epistle, part newspaper article, and part interjections by Shepherd’s loyal secretary, Mrs. Brown, who assembles the collection into a coherent whole after her boss’s exit from the stage. The writing too carries different voices: Shepherd’s 13year-old beginnings, his early Mexican accent, the slang of his late teens in America, the return to servant humility while working as Riviera’s cook in Mexico, his emerging confidence as Trotsky’s typist and his final tongue-in-cheek rebuttals to the kangaroo court that prosecutes him after he has become a successful author; the newspaper clippings that are so one-sided and defy all conventions of journalistic balance; and Mrs. Brown’s mountain English that is closer to the Biblical than Luke’s.What scares me about the subject matter is that the state (any state, be it a so-called benign democracy or a benighted totalitarian regime) can fabricate anything it wants to make someone guilty of a crime that was never perpetrated. And that we replace our demons periodically: Hitler was replaced by Stalin’s Communists, who in turn were dislodged by the Terrorists – who will be next? “People want to believe in heroes and villains when very frightened –it’s less taxing,” says Trotsky, who also bemoans with his dying breath, “There is no hope – for social democracy.” Welcome to the world of Right and Left with a giant Lacuna in the middle. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 22, 2011","Jun 05, 2011","Apr 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6433752-the-lacuna

Our Daring Duo go over to the German-occupied side on their egg-hunt and encounter a myriad of adventures, some hair-raising, others side-splitting, as they find their treasure and bring it back to their Colonel, who has forgotten all about the incident in the meantime and has become the beneficiary of a raft of smuggled goodies, far exceeding eggs, for his beloved daughter’s wedding. So much for the story – sounds like one of those old westerns, eh?Now for the images that stuck with me: a dead German floating over the starving city in his parachute, killed by the cold instead of bullets, the well-fed Colonel’s daughter skating on the Neva while her city starves, the dying boy guarding his solitary chicken while his grandfather’s frozen copse reposes next to him, the human sausage factory for those who aspire for a bit of “meat” during the siege, Kolya and Sonya having sex and making loud conversation amidst a room full of starving refugees, dogs strapped with explosives and used as mines against the advancing German tanks. These are but a sample. The ebullient Kolya and the gangly Lev are great foils despite their physical and psychological differences. For all his gregariousness, we also discover that Kolya is attempting to write the Great Russian Novel in snatches during breaks during their quest, writing furiously with a pencil stub on scraps of paper. The ruthless sniper, Vika, a young woman who dresses like a man to hide from the Germans, provides the love interest for the restrained Lev in ways that even surprise him. The burly Abendroth, the German Einsaztkommando (an elite group of killers deadlier than the Waffen SS), is the epitome of an arch villain, swilling schnapps, playing chess, seeing through our heroes’ guises, and killing people at random.Even though the ending was predictable, some of the lines stuck with me long after I finished the book, etching the characters indelibly in my mind: Kolya, who stumbles on a farmhouse with four healthy Russian women kept as sex slaves for the invaders, recounts the episode as, “my balls were ringing like a pair of dumbbells,” while Lev seeing his raunchier buddy blissfully making out with an old girlfriend remarks “the loneliest sound in the world is other people making love.” And as for the author, who seems to have borrowed much of the story from his grandfather, he follows Grandpa’s advice when things don’t make sense and “makes it up” for the reader, thus giving us a memorable read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 12, 2011","Jun 24, 2011","Apr 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1971304.City_of_Thieves

We are introduced to his inner life, to his ambitions, his fears, and his sexual preferences. He is tortured by the embargo placed on him by the USA for his assassination attempt on the neighbouring Venezuelan ruler, by the disloyalty of the Catholic Church, by the rise of Fidel Castro, and by a cancerous prostate that is starting to let him down in bed. The dictator in turn rules by fear, surrounded by a mob of sycophantic ministers, and protected by his Intelligence director Johnny Abbes, himself a twisted murderer whose torture techniques defy the imagination. In return for his ministers’ loyalty, Trujillo rewards them materially and openly screws their wives and daughters, and is clear about his particular preference for deflowering virgins. Through open intimidation and unpredictable reversals, he controls his followers’ minds and renders them useless to act on their own, except for the ostensible “puppet President” Balaguer, a poet, who secretly does not submit to the dictator – perhaps Llosa’s portrayal of the pen being mightier than the sword. Through the voices of Urania, the violated virgin who returns to exact revenge on her dying father—once a minister in the Tujillo administration—for “offering” her to the Goat in order to protect his job; through the voices of the four assassins, each whose lives had been touched tragically by the Goat; through the diminutive Dr. Balaguer and his manoeuvrings to eject the Trujillos out of the DR once and forever; and through Trujillo himself on the last day of his life, we get a vivid multi-dimensional picture of the uncertainty inside a dictatorship. The important lesson coming out of the assassination is that a nation subjugated to the will of a dictator for such a long time is unable to rise and take control of the situation, and just as the Reign of Terror arose in France following the storming of the Bastille, the vacuum created by Trujillo’s exit leads to power factions fighting each other and to a mass manhunt for the killers, in which hundreds are imprisoned and tortured. The torture scenes are horrible and I got the impression that in order to sanitize the suffering, Lllosa decided to list the “treatments” that the victims were subjected to. I wondered how they remained alive and coherent after such degradation and assault.To say I was riveted by this novel is an understatement. But I was also disappointed in the writing from this Nobel Prize winner. Perhaps it is the translation. Pronouns are in constant overuse, often to describe different people in the same sentence – there are times when one does not know who the “he” or “him” we are being referred to. Given that Llosa is drawing heavily from the historical record, he often drops in multiple names, addressing many with different last names and pet names, adding to a confusion of characters, many who are incidental to the story and could have been dropped. Tenses too get confused, and the experiment to juxtapose back- story with present story in the same tense, and without a clear delineation, is jarring.This is an important novel for these times, given that despots are falling all around the world and leaving shades of the Trujillo story in their wake. More importantly, it is a cautionary tale to citizens in countries who take democracy for granted and do not believe that a Goat can grow up in their backyard, fed on ignorance and complacency....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 02, 2011","Apr 17, 2011","Apr 02, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53969.The_Feast_of_the_Goat

Yes, his cancer goes into remission, he is able to fly, make people levitate, walk underwater, read people’s minds, plant thoughts in others minds, and stop a speeding bullet. He even gets to visit the “otherworld” located under Lake Minnewanka to find out the distress he is causing the souls in Purgatory – God has forgotten them because He is pre-occupied with Stan!Stanley’s powers attract a motley band of misfits—each of whom are in the midst of a personal crisis at the time—to gather around him in Banff, where the new Messiah explores his new-found powers, some of which even surprise him, like falling off a mountain and landing unhurt! Convinced that they are in the midst of a great power and synchronicity that has brought them to this place, the band members, each in their own way, tries to propagate the new religion—the Stan. One of them, Tanya, a former TV executive from Vancouver, sees a chance of fulfilling her own ambitions and orchestrates a media broadcast of Stanley doing his shtick to the whole world. Masses of seekers arrive from all over to flood tiny Banff and request for personal, mostly material, favours from the “Lord”. Fundamentalists also arrive to get rid of Stanley for rendering their beliefs obsolete. Stanley, the reluctant and pragmatic messiah, in his new found wisdom, sees that this is all going the wrong way and pines for the status quo, even if it is riddled with cancer, and for his wife Frieda who has left him to return to their home in Edmonton because she cannot put up with his new fame. In the end, Stan has to choose between immortality and what is right for him and his fellow mortals. He does so with grace and compassion, even leaving those seeking monetary gain from the Stan to buy into the franchise with its absentee leader. I found the premise intriguing; Stanley’s inner circle of characters are eccentric and well delineated from each other, but the delivery lags, and the fantastical is sometimes hard to visualize, especially the scenes underwater. The narrative point of view moves among the various members of Stanley’s tribe and this makes the story circle in one place without moving forward. There are occasional prize quotes however, that slip out amidst the sparse narration and punchy dialogue: “No one finds their fortune, except sons of bitches,” “Religion and Happiness are products, like cars,” “American Idol – a symbol of Unironic youth desperate to be famous,” are a few that stuck out for me.This is a bold book, timely for our media obsessed, attention span challenged times and I applaud the effort. I could not help speculate however that perhaps the author was taking on too much. After all, a religion, even as simple as the Stan, is complex and needs more than just a short sojourn in Banff to digest and comprehend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 31, 2011","Apr 04, 2011","Mar 31, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1256540.The_Book_of_Stanley

I **spoiler alert** I picked up this book after reading a series of literary novels full of dense prose, subtle metaphors and much-ado-about nothing. I needed an escape. And I was not disappointed, for this novel is the classic tale of the hero who escapes his home in the Old World, makes his fortune in the New World and returns to rescue his bride, punish his enemies and live happily ever after, or so he believes. The twist however is that home is not home anymore and it is the New World, which had forged his identity and made him his fortune, that ultimately beckons, and the adventurer is destined to make his life in this new frontier surrounded by those survivors who have proven loyal to him— an enduring theme played out from Homer to Dumas to Sabatini. Pedro de Vargas, a young hidalgo, whose father is a retired but celebrated soldier, falls foul of the ruling elites and the Inquisition and is forced to flee Spain for Mexico while his family is jailed and later exiled in Italy. He is in a state of idealistic love with the fair Luisa, whose aristocratic but mercurial father bends to the swaying political winds. Pedro`s true love however is the tavern worker and dancer, Catana, born of low birth but of feisty spirit and fierce loyalty. The villain is Diego de Silva, land-grabber, with eyes on the de Vargas estate and on the lovely but naive Luisa, and who is in cahoots with the corrupt local Inquisitor. Enough said—Pedro loses the first found to de Silva and flees to Mexico to fight under Hernand Cortes. A series of adventures leads him to discover gold in the New World. The treacherous political winds follow him to Mexico where the Spanish governor of the Indies, Valasquez, and Cortes are at odds over the spoils of conquest and over control of the conquered lands. The situation finally resolves itself back in Spain where the bad guys are outed and the good guys get their well earned share of the booty pillaged from the natives in Mexico. Pedro is faced with the conundrum of the immigrant, where home is no longer home, and returns to Mexico with his true love Catana, and best friend and fellow-adventurer Juan Garcia. I found the style hard to plough through: lots of passive sentences and words (perhaps, almost, the other, though, probably etc.), and subtle but unnecessary shifts in point-of-view. While the principal characters mentioned above are well drawn, there are far too many peripheral characters and they all end up as a bunch of names. The first part of the story leading up to Pedro fleeing Spain reads well and then falls apart in a jumble of history, multiple characters and shifting loyalties. I quickly skipped forward a couple of hundred pages and caught up the story and its resolution in the last 75 pages or so.What becomes clear, if Shellabarger`s research is correct, is that the Inquisition was Christianity`s equivalent of the Holocaust, or France`s Reign of Terror, and that colonial conquerors of the past were no better than pirates and terrorists of today, and that no matter what mantle of sanctity we cloak ourselves in, mankind`s capability to commit evil deeds is as great as its propensity for doing good. A frightening thought when you consider that modern developed nations in the Old World were built on these horrible and tragic foundations; a grim reminder indeed for us immigrants to the new world who look back in nostalgia towards the lands of our origins. Perhaps we would be better suited, like Pedro de Vargas, to turn our backs on those old homelands and cleave to our new home built on lessons learned from the past....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 12, 2011","Mar 23, 2011","Mar 12, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/547172.Captain_From_Castile

To my generation who “went west” as young people and never returned to the family nest but created our own nests instead, this is a social tragedy that is often overlooked because one does not know where the cause lies: globalization and the lowering of entry level wages, over-indulgent parents, spoilt children whose lifestyles are beyond their pay packets, or a combination of all three?Edie and Russell are the fifty-something parents of three grown children who move out periodically. When the last child, Ben, leaves the nest, Edie has withdrawal symptoms while Russell is looking forward eagerly but futilely to reclaiming quality time with his wife. A series of mishaps befall the children, nothing tragic, just the usual stuff of growing up—losing a job, breaking up with a partner, buying an unaffordable condo—and the kids trickle back to the nest, much to Edie’s delight and Russell’s chagrin. To add to the parents’ now-crowded life, Edie, a fading actress, has added a young starving actor, Lazlo, to their domesticity by offering him temporary accommodation in their home. Contrasting to Edie’s exhausting but “lived” life is her sister, Vivien, who has an only son departed for Australia to surf with a local girlfriend in the Lucky Country and never return, while her unfaithful husband Max is planning to re-enter her empty life and cheat on her again. The plot weaves in and out among all the characters and ends with new beginnings, a birth, and the commencement of a new cycle of parent-child entanglements.I found the long sections of interior narration, where we are “told” the motivations and back story of the characters a bit trying. This is contrasted by lots of dialogue, and the missing element is action; the characters emerge on the page, in indifferent combinations, deliver their lines and retreat, almost like the cast in the Ibsen play that Edie is cast in, her last hooray. Also, the multiple viewpoints lead to sameness – no particular character, other than Edie, stands out. The lack of sharp conflicts makes this novel more or less a snapshot of reality, a middle-class reality play; I think fiction demands something more, even if reality has to be distorted.All that said, the writing is elegant and fluid and Trollope has hit on a key topic of our times and seems to suggest that until this generation of 24-35 upwardly mobile wannabes start having their own children, they will not emerge from their self-indulgence and stop leaning on Mum and Dad to bail them out, particularly at a time when the parents are descending the productivity ladder. Being in that fifty-something cohort who also fathered some of these wannabes, I wonder if Trollope’s solution is an over-simplification....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 04, 2011","Mar 13, 2011","Mar 04, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/116972.Second_Honeymoon

And I wasn’t disappointed in reading this book. He picked two winning strategies with this debut novel – humour and controversy. Some Great Thing could be renamed “Days in the Lives of Journalists” for it follows the episodic scoops and shenanigans of a bunch of journalists at a newspaper in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The central character is an autobiographical version of the author (if I follow Hill’s resume), with the unlikely name of Mahatma Grafton, who is on a mission not only to explore black-white relations but English-French tensions in the province as well, while his boss, editor, Don Betts, is determined to re-write Mahatma’s filings for more nefarious and personal ends. The supporting cast is a delightful but motley crew: Edward Slade the reporter from the rival newspaper who lacks empathy and sensitivity as he zeroes in on the “scoop” at all costs (he and Betts would make a good duo), Judge Melvyn Hill (any relation of the author?) who is looking for any form of publicity to promote his cause as he has topped out on the career ladder (not a bad climb for he was once a railway porter), Helene Savoie who is ashamed of the childhood drubbing she received from her teacher for being French and prefers to be known now as Helen Savoy, Jake Corbett the welfare junkie who looks for any public forum to denounce the government for cheating him off his well(fare) earned money (he and the Judge would make good partners for the return of Socialism), and Hassane Moustafa Ali (aka Yoyo), the optimistic reporter from Cameroon who finds Canadians somewhat daft. And of course, the wisest one of the lot, Mahatma’s father Ben, a retired porter and a former colleague of Judge Hill, who is compiling a black history of Canada, and who loves and steers his son through the travails of journalism and motivates him to do “some great thing” with his life. Some situations are hilarious and typically Canadian. Mahatma, who is second generation Canadian-born, is asked “Where are you from?” His answer: “Winnipeg”, a puzzled comeback: “Where is your father from?” Reply: “Winnipeg.” An even more puzzled, “But I thought you were Pakistani.” Priceless! Some observations are chilling: “One drop of coloured blood made you black.” The prose is unsophisticated and shouts “first time writer,” there are too many character names in some scenes, and many of the characters are funny but caricature-like. Even Mahatma is underdeveloped on the romantic side and I wondered if this guy had any other depth or vulnerabilities other than to fight for what is right as egged on by his father. Everyone winds up in Cameroon by a freak of fate and circumstance (the only other French-English bilingual country in the world according to Yoyo), and the novel has its denouement which saves it from the upsy-downsy “days in the lives...” theme, and all ends well. I would have cut out the epilogue, for it tries (too hard) to tie up all the loose ends and tell us where the survivors end up.

The escape was certainlHaving gone on a fantasy thrill-ride with The Shadow of the Wind and enjoyed it, I expected the same escapism in this prequel. The escape was certainly there, amidst the familiar settling of gothic early 1900’s Barcelona, but this time the plot, which seems to be Zafon’s dominant feature, faltered, and the premise was questionable to me.David Martin a frenetic, emotionally frozen writer of pulp fiction, secretly ghost-writes his benefactor’s novel which soars to the bestseller lists, while his own literary debut bombs. He is contacted by a mysterious publisher, Andreas Corelli, who offers him a huge sum of money to write a book about a new religion, plunging David into a web of intrigue in which everyone he seems to come in contact with dies mysteriously.Just like The Shadow of the Wind, I figured this plot must have been extensively story-boarded to make all the pieces fit, but it appears that some of the boards may have blown away in the wind, leaving gaps. Who was Ricardo Salvador in the end? Why was David’s chest carved up? Who was the “boss”? And what was this religion all about? Do we have to return to the sequel, or to yet another unwritten book to find out? Familiar replays from The Shadow abound: parallel story lines mirror each other a generation apart; The Cemetery of Forgotten Books makes a re-appearance; Sempere & Son, the antique booksellers, are peripheral characters; and of course, dark strangers, gloomy buildings, unrequited love, rooms with secrets, nasty cops, and the brooding city of Barcelona, all make their presence felt again. Acute observations of life and literature peppered through the book, help soothe rambling through this convoluted plot: “Emotional truth is not a moral quality, it’s a technique,” “Good literature is science tempered with the blood of art,” and “Justice is a rare illness in a world that is otherwise a picture of health,” are but a few that made me pause and think in between turning pages to discover what was going to happen next.The prose is fluid for a translation and yet the tone of the dialogue in places is at odds with the characters’ moods as depicted in the narration. David comes across as snappy and upbeat all the time in dialogue, but he is otherwise a gloomy, moody and haunted character. Also, the dialogue (especially the longer pieces when characters are providing swaths of back-story) tends to withhold plot points in a manner that hint strongly to contrivance. The ending left me frustrated because it took the book way out into the outer orbits of magic realism and left me hanging. If Zafon was trying to say that the writer’s soul remains eternal and that the quest for the “masterpiece” is a lifelong one littered with hardship and loss, I get that; if he was saying that life is circular and that we get second chances (the younger Cristina), I get that too. But if he was trying to say that we have to make a pact with the devil (Correlli) to achieve that, then I don’t quite buy it.

Mercifully, one does not have to pay income taxes to live in this joint called the Emptiest State, a place “peripheral to the real world.”And so Proulx sets us up around a town called Elk Tooth in this arid land and explores many of the town’s denizens in consequent stories. Some are generational tales told as family histories with skeletons falling out of the closet, some meander in the middle before scoring their mark in the end, and others are short pieces which leave you wanting more. There is magic realism in a couple of the pieces and one wonders whether this departure from reality was needed for these stories which are in of themselves rich with character and event – the realism was quirky enough. Proulx often uses the vernacular in her narration where “a” stands for either “to” or “of” and her imagery is drawn from the land: “the drought settled like lamprey eel sucking at the region’s vitals.”One of the main threats to the state at the time of these stories is the oil and gas exploration companies damaging the drinking water supply with their activities, and this subject surfaces often. Given the adverse effects to faming with this development, many of the farms are being sliced into smaller parts for sale to hobby farmers from out of state or being sold to big business, and the conflict that this brings to established farm families is grist for the writer’s mill. And yet cultural norms stay strong: the outsider who betrays the cardinal rule within the state, which is to help a stranger and not treat him with suspicion, is quickly sidelined.Proulx has done her country and her state proud by introducing international readers to Wyoming’s culture in a humorously entertaining way with this collection. Frankly, I did not know that such an eccentric place existed in this day and age.

Elizabeth Costello, I did not like, because in that novel Coetzee tried to pitch the author as moralizer, got lost in the last chapters, and frankly turned me off. In Diary of a Bad Year however, he returns to the same pitch but formats his presentation differently and pulls it off. He gets to be preachy within the bounds of a story. So here we have an aging male writer, Senor C – not difficult to imagine who that is – once famous, now in physical decline, who is writing a series of short essays (not unlike blogs) for a book to be published in German titled Strong Opinions. And his opinions are indeed strong. Senor C is a devout anti right-winger, opposes competition, and airs his opinion on democracy, the state, animal cruelty, avian flu, terrorism, child pornography, Iraq, and other contemporary hot potatoes, amidst more expected subjects such as academia, writing and the classics. Helping him transcribe his essays is a young, attractive Asian woman, Anya, who disagrees with the old man’s views but takes pity on his decrepit condition, while her investment banker boyfriend, Alan, has designs on Senor C’s idle fortune. Their three story lines eventually run across the pages, separated by white space in between, and the reader can either continue to read a page at a time or each story line at a time. I chose the former route and found it to be more rewarding as the story lines, even though not running concurrently, converge in the end, and I wasn’t left knowing the plot in advance of its conclusion. The moral aridity of Alan’s worldview is contrasted to the arid and fading passion of Senor C, and Anya is opened to both their limitations and left to make a choice about her own life as a consequence. She is attracted to Senor C’s honesty despite his poor hygiene, and repelled by Alan’s greed and drunkenness despite his sexual prowess. The love story that emerges in the end is tender and fleeting and softens the heavy intellectualizing that is inherent in Senor C’s essays and that form the bulwark of the novel. As a writer I was moved and enlightened to hear this master of the craft draw upon the example of Tolstoy and admit that the mature writer goes past pessimism to didactic, sparse fiction with the diminishing of sexual and physical energy. Coetzee’s philosophy is interesting and compelling. Moralizing notwithstanding, he appears to care for the planet and seems to believe, like all writers, in the pen being mightier than the sword—and he wields it expertly. It’s a pity that in spite of his Nobel Prize for Literature, he doesn’t appear to be universally recognized as a heavyweight in the global issues he chooses to dabble in now. I wonder if that comes from him being a product of two minor colonial nations, South Africa and Australia. Would the world pay him more attention if he were from the US? But then would he be so outspoken if he were placed thus, smack in the epicentre of his critical judgements?

Aslam takes on a lot here, trying to cover the lives of a handful of characters from the period between the Soviet occupation in 1979 and the present day. With the amount of back story on their lives, casually tossed in all the time, I felt that he could have written a novel on each of these tragic people. His constant feeding us with flashbacks intruded on the main story line, and that was my only peeve in an otherwise well-crafted piece.The imagery is stunning: books pinned to ceilings, the sound of worms eating the town’s seized books, bone-punctured bodies of girls thrown from helicopters after being raped by Russian soldiers, sexually repressed boys re-opening a grave to retrieve a fragment of a woman’s photograph, butterfly mines falling out of the sky, a bullet in a bowl of water signifying a bullet to the head – this is indeed a surreal world existing in the 21st century and begs the question: dare we try to civilize it so rapidly?Marcus, a retired British doctor living in Afghanistan for several years, and who has lost his hand, his daughter and his wife to the Taliban, is still optimistic about finding his missing grandson. He hosts other expatriates in his crumbling house. They are all holding vigil and entertaining hopes of discovery, of loved ones or of themselves. Lara, the Russian, is seeking her missing soldier brother, David, an ex-spy, is trying to find himself, Dunia is waiting for her father to return and save her from being stoned, and the Taliban soldier, Casa (is he Marcus’s lost grandson?), is seeking refuge from his own people who could kill him for a botched operation. And the gathering storm, a feud between two warlords in the area—one pro-American and the other pro-Taliban—is set to erupt and engulf them all. The world of the terrorist is vividly brought to light: the deprivation and isolation that begins the journey towards martyrdom, the tests and trials of physical endurance during the “training”, the brainwashing, and the reluctance to accept another viewpoint. I wonder if the author risks retaliation for having probed so deep and brought so much to light.In the end, the wasted vigil is a hopeless one and ends tragically, perhaps signalling the author’s view that Afghanistan is a lost cause, at least to us westerners, although we may remain optimistic that some-day our efforts will be rewarded—just like Marcus, who is one of the few left standing in the end, still optimistic of finding his grandson. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 19, 2011","Jan 29, 2011","Jan 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3417673-the-wasted-vigil

Napoleon has been at it for many years, drifting through multiple locations after deserting his young family, until he is hauled by his two daughters to the lakeside home of a fallen comrade’s father, located on the shore of a lake below which lies an old town; the lake serves as a metaphor for Napoleon’s submerged and deteriorating memories of a war in which “might was right,” dope was nirvana, and orders were meant to be obeyed—however unjust.The daughter’s visit never releases the dying man’s memories and guilt, although he comes close at times, and the denouement only comes in the long epilogue, in the form of a military transcript released after Napoleon’s death, in which there are hints of atrocities committed against civilians, but whodunit is obfuscated by the administration. The narrator even tries to explain the non-event at the end, which only makes matters worse.The plot therefore is ho-hum, and so I looked to the telling of the story and the characterization to redeem the novel, and I was disappointed in both. The narrator is distant and seems unable and unwilling to connect with her sozzled father; she is not even around in his final days, being pre-occupied with her own romantic travails. Napoleon too does not reveal much of himself, and his host, Henry, is just a foil. The constant scene shifts do nothing to elevate the story and while the daughter’s prose is elegant but dense, Napoleon and his Vietnam buddies’ sole claim to hanging tough seems to come from uttering the f-word umpteen times.I applaud the novelist’s boldness in experimenting and stretching the novel’s form with this approach to writing. Yet somewhere in there was lost why we write novels: story and character were submerged, like the town below the lake, or Napoleon’s memories....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 15, 2011","Jan 16, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7579973-the-sentimentalists

She delivers a Christian noblewoman’s baby (forbidden by law) with her pair of crude custom-made forceps (also forbidden) in an attempt to raise money to pay Isaac’s ransom. Isaac, for his part, is also making plans to escape and return to Venice. Immediately, the scene is set by placing these two lovers in opposite corners, in hard-to-win situations, and as they make their ways towards each other, the stakes are progressively escalated according to the fiction writer’s manual. Some chapters even end with the overt question – what will happen next? Overkill, perhaps?Hanna’s and Isaac’s story lines alternate between chapters, which makes the action jerky. It also took me until the end of the novel to realize that their respective stories were about three months apart. And as the plot twisted, turned and reversed, the contrivances stuck out for me. Which parent would leave an infant, the sole heir to the family fortune, with a pair of murderous uncles who stand to inherit should the wee one “accidentally” die in plague-ridden Venice? The plague itself becomes a useful device to kill off the unlikeliest players, while the goop-covered, starving baby, tossed from breast to breast, continues to stay alive.The women are portrayed as super-heroes, while the men are inept and effeminate, and the clergy (both Jewish and Christian) are mean-spirited. Hannah can plug a woman’s womb with a pebble to fit on a pitching boat, a pebble which she conveniently pulls out from a nook aboard the rocking vessel. And yet, a fully armed Uncle Jacopo loses his knife to Hannah in a tussle? Hmm...Sister Asunta will tether her slave Isaac to her cart and ride him into town in order to give her horse a rest. And the love-struck, sheep-piss covered Joseph has designs on the beautiful widow Getrudis, who in turn is enamoured with the emaciated Isaac... indeed!If you can ignore the plot and situational inconsistencies, this is a good beach read, with factoids from that period in history rendered imaginatively.

This part is refreshing from the stereotypical coffee-guzzling, sleep deprived, divorced North American (or Swedish) cop who guzzles pizza and burgers whenever hunger calls, but who always gets his murderer. Brunetti gets his man (?) too, but remains powerless against the movers behind the scenes: the bribe takers in the bureaucracy, the black market economy – the “normal” in his society in which “poor notaries are as inconceivable as celibate priests.”Venice, past and present, comes to life as Brunetti walks, water-taxis, and plods about the city in search of clues in the death of a 20year-old virgin (virginity is a key plot point here) who had sought him out earlier to clear her Fascist grandfather’s name, and who was a student of Brunetti’s professor wife Paola. Everyone knows everyone in this water-logged community and family secrets come out from unlikely sources, revealing the country’s Fascist past about which nothing much has been written, unlike the more vilified German Reich of the time. These secrets seem to be awaiting a precipitating event like a murder to come flooding out.There are clichés too: the commissario’s boss who is not involved and only wants his underling to find the murderer quickly and close the case before it draws too much attention, and the super-efficient police assistant Signorina Elettra who has a her own ways of beating a corrupt system by maintaining her own version of pirated phone directories and cultivating sources in high places who do her “favours.”The pace is slow, reminding me of the pace of life in this dreamy touristy city, and the writing constantly summarizes actions and the intent behind certain lines of dialogue, all of which I found unnecessary. And there is a lengthy section after the murderer is caught, when we are left hovering over “why dunnit” which we are, at that point, quite clear about.Someone said that the modern murder mystery has moved beyond the basic crime puzzle to become a platform for social observation and commentary. That the modern murder mystery is now even a political novel.

The writing style is engaging and the prose fresh, although I wonder why Verena is referred to as a “confidence man” on more than one occasion. Is this to show the innate sexism of the times, or were “confidence women” not already on the scene by then? The interesting part of this novel for me is that everyone wins in the end, even bad Leopold is rewarded with a circus bear to go play his parlour games with. “And they all lived happily ever after” could never be more true, except in the case of this very competent writer, when he finds out that I picked up this new hardcover copy for under $5 on the remaindered shelf of a large book retailer in Toronto recently.

The towers fall, survivors who emerge are dazed, their lives forever altered. Soon after the event, a “falling man,” dressed in a business suit, makes periodic appearances on the top of tall buildings, from which, strapped to a safety harness, he jumps off into the void to hang suspended and scare onlookers, until he dies, wittingly or unwittingly, in one of those jumps.The opening scene of Keith, clutching someone else’s briefcase, emerging from the wreckage is powerfully delivered. He asks to be taken by a friendly driver to his estranged wife’s apartment where she cares for him, and even allows him to sleep in her bed until his physical recovery is complete. But 9/11 has changed them forever and they drift into different worlds while remaining within the boundaries of a re-united nuclear family. Keith has a brief relationship with Florence, another survivor of the towers, and the woman whose briefcase he brought out of the wreck with him. Theirs is a shared experience and his visits to her offer an opportunity for both to expunge the trauma resident within. But after the catharsis is complete, she moves on and he returns to his dysfunctional family. The prose is sparse and impactful with minimum attributions, which I found a bit hard to acclimatize to as I did not know who was speaking at times. I found Keith and his wife Lianne sympathetic characters, pawns to the events that befall them and the periodic rages that overcome them as a consequence. Lianne finds her catharsis by assisting Alzheimer’s patients record their life stories before they lose their faculties; her father had decided to end his life prematurely when he was first diagnosed with the illness. To some extent Lianne, Florence and Keith are like Alzheimer’s patients themselves, stumbling along with frozen memories, disoriented from the “event that changed history.” And Keith’s poker players and their rules reminded me of the extremists and their rigidity. Many of the poker players too are destroyed in the falling towers and the survivors are released from the norms that bonded them and are dispersed to become professional gamblers, free to make their own rules.De Lillo aims barbs at America and the terrorists alike through his characters: quotes like “America is becoming the centre of its own shit” and “They (the terrorists) are not liberating a people, casting out a dictator – kill the innocent – only that.” The survivors of the event however do not blame either of these entities, instead they blame God; and their desire for revenge seems to be a natural reaction to such a violation.I was prepared to give this book higher stars than those given by many of the other ers, but then I stumbled upon passages that took me into the world of the terrorists – passages which must have been re-written from umpteen newspaper articles that had attempted to decipher their murky world in the days following 9/11.

In his quest to find his missing Lebanese father, Mishka gets involved with a bunch of suicide-bomber terrorists and flies out to Lebanon where he disappears. On his tail, and on Leela’s, is the twisted and tortured Cobb, also formerly from Promised Land, a veteran of the Iraq war, now a contract security consultant; Cobb has secretly admired, pursued, and been scorned by Leela while they were growing up in Promised Land. Now it’s payback time for Cobb as he holds the power to bring Mishka back alive, or not.The story flips back and forth between Boston, Promised Land, the Daintree rainforest in north-eastern Australia, and the Middle East. While the American and Australian scenes are well developed (probably due to the writer’s first-hand experience of having lived in these countries), I found the Middle Eastern ones sparse, suggesting that Turner Hospital had no real experience of the locale and was writing from sketchy research material. That said, there are great contrasting scenes painted in the US and Australia: the dreamlike sequences when Leela and Miskha first meet and later when they realize that they are implicated in terrorism after a subway bombing in Boston; when Mishka recalls growing up at Chateau Daintree deep in the rainforest, the only child in a quirky multi-generational family of transplanted music –loving Hungarian Jews released from the Holocaust, as unique to the area as the quandong trees that grow only in the Daintree; and when we are taken back to Promised Land to visit Leela’s and Cobb’s respective cantankerous fathers, both dying of cancer and waiting out the other guy. Strangely enough, I was enjoying the literary nature of the book until the pace quickened after Mishka was kidnapped and the novel veered off into the thriller genre, and, in my opinion, failed at that point. Because what happens in the Middle East is so fragmentary and all the action happens off-stage, I found this section more like a data dump where all the loose ends were tied up in a perfunctory way, as if the book was being suddenly rushed to market. It’s a pity, because the build up to that point was superb.Shortcomings apart, this book is a good reminder of how terrorism has penetrated the fabric of life and literature in the developed west, be it in the US or Australia, and how it has conditioned our behaviour and expectations. And it also says to me that the literary-thriller genre is still an open field, and that it’s tough to integrate two different genres without readers on both sides of the scale left wanting “a little bit more.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 03, 2010","Dec 10, 2010","Dec 03, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1139021.Orpheus_Lost

Mullally paints a broad canvas covering the abortive strike and its tragic aftermath. He introduces us to the practices on board a British man-o-war, to the fragility of life for the men who worked below decks, and to their women who often ended up widows, and who had to make do with the scraps of life and love pulled out during brief moments on hammocks or in dark corners while the ships were in port.Caro Lapsford is the brave heroine who ventures out of her comfortable Sussex fishing village to London to be meet and rescue her lover Kemp Saunders who, along with his two brothers, was illegally “recruited” to join the British Navy just as his merchant ship was heading back to England after a long voyage, and just prior to his marriage to his sweetheart. Their brief sojourn in London is interrupted by the strike when Kemp is implicated as one of its ring leaders. The disastrous fallout leaves Caro to deal with two men who are in love with her for different reasons.The book lays bare the inhumanity of the ruling classes towards the working poor: flogging, kidnapping, rape and execution were ploys to keep those lower down the totem pole in check and to help Britain rule the waves. It left me with a bad taste for the touted glories of colonial empires.Mullally is a stickler for accuracy and historical detail. In the process of reading the novel, I learned about the origins of phrases such as “three sheets in the wind,” “eating oysters on the thumb,” and “show a leg.” I learned about bum boats and jolly boats and hay boats and sea shanties. I tried to piece together the naval hierarchy: officers, midshipmen, petty officers, warrant officers, masters-at-arms, bosuns and seamen; all essentially powerless because the Captain held sway over everyone on board. And there was a cast of over seventy characters in a book of 170 pages, some managing only a few lines of mention at most.In painting the broader canvas and from a social, historical and political standpoint, the author succeeds. Where the novel falls short is in the characterization of the principal players. Kemp, our hero, gets swallowed up by the other men on board and does not truly stand out for the time he is on stage. Caro’s life post-Kemp could have been a novel in itself and yet it was relegated to a few pages. Hers is the plight of many young war widows of the period who had to balance their need for security with the voices inside their hearts, and this is an aspect that could have been explored further to maximum impact on the reader. I think Mullally has made an important contribution to the literary canon of this period and has been bold in lifting the covers of propriety over Rule Britannia. There are no heroes in this book, only survivors, and yes, many villains who got off scot free, because they had the right connections....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 21, 2010","Dec 02, 2010","Nov 21, 2010",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/9647676-if-i-were-a-blackbird

Both are destined for failure, it appears: the former is shackled by guilt while the latter is destroyed despite her valiant efforts to escape. So, I wonder, why write this story? Little Bee is the African teenager who flees her homeland after losing her entire family to a massacre over oil-rich lands. She spends two years in a British detention centre, is released in error, and makes contact with the only English people she knows, a couple, Sarah and Lawrence, who witnessed a brutal event on a beach in Nigeria, along with her. The English couple’s lives have changed indelibly after the event, making them question the complaisance of their spoiled and empty existence. Despite the horror of her short life, Little Bee is optimistic and sees beauty in the world, except that she is always on the lookout for a quick way to kill herself “if the men come suddenly,” a legacy from the trauma she has experienced; Sarah and Andrew are guilt ridden, and, in their respective ways, seek ways out.Although an intriguing story that circles back to that pivotal beach event which straightjackets the characters and keeps them connected, I found several imbalances in the novel. Little Bee comes across as too mature and English for her age, background and circumstances (how does one get such a good educational and develop social skills in a detention centre where the inmates speak patois and are prone to suicide?) The scene between Lawrence and Bee, during his final hours, is melodramatic. And why does Bee have to confess her “bad behaviour” in the first place, and to a duplicitous bastard like Lawrence, Sarah’s lover? The pace, after Bee comes to live with Sarah, drops off noticeably; and then it moves at light speed when our little heroine returns to Nigeria with Sarah to capture a series of stories on the mass murders of her people. And why is italics intended for dialogue and interior monologue and used liberally throughout the novel? A note on the violence: we all have read about unspeakable mass murders in Africa, but why drag it out for our benefit? There are times when this horror, made even more horrible when rendered via the upbeat voice of Bee, makes you riled at the author for daubing us with it.I asked the question earlier, why write this story when in the end, no one wins? One can only hope that someone like Sarah, a fashion magazine editor (“Nobody dies when we write about fashion”) will be transformed and stay alive and engaged long enough to publish her expose on the greed, corruption and violence in Africa, something that her depressed husband did not have the staying power to complete. Or will she, like another spoiled Westerner, go back to her convenient lover, brainless magazine and precocious son, and forget the whole endeavour when she returns to civilization? The author keeps us hanging over this possibility – perhaps he is not too sure himself whether “taking it for granted” and “it’s someone else’s problem” will win again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2011","Nov 16, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4078927-little-bee

And it was worI was cautioned by those who had attempted to read this book that they had found it like “work.” Some had even given up in the attempt. And it was work in the opening chapters, when I was treated to excessive descriptions on engineering and botany, and given the exact number of villages, houses, people, goats, camels, ducks, geese and other assorted denizens who were moved during the building of the Aswan Dam in Egypt in 1964. And this excessive “dumping” of research data repeated whether in describing the objects in an open-air marketplace, or the types of maps in existence at the time, or in identifying the variety of birds that populated the flood zone.The story line is sparse: engineer Avery meets botanist Jean, they have a still-born child; botanist leaves engineer, finds solace with an émigré painter, Lucjan, whose life experiences in wartime Poland are so extreme that botanist runs back to engineer. There is also a weaving of extraneous detail of the main characters’ parents and their lives, which tends to overpower and deflect from the central story.The theme of loss and displacement that Avery and Jean go through with the death of their child is contrasted against the wider loss and displacement of entire communities to accommodate mega engineering projects like the building of the St Lawrence Seaway and the Aswan Dam, and the wanton destruction and alteration of Poland during WWII to accommodate the Nazi expansion, and later, the Soviets. Avery and Jean are restorers by profession: he moves temples and others buildings in the line of flood to safer ground, and she replants indigenous and rare plants which are under the same threat, but they are each challenged when having to transplant and transform their own lives in the face of loss.The dialogue runs on for long passages of recounting by Avery, Jean or Lucjan and is somewhat artificial. There are also long sections of philosophical discussion by these three, which I thought unnecessary. What happened to “show don’t tell?”That said, the language is beautiful and the author’s poetic prowess shines in this area, and reading some of the passages made me abandon my “work” load to simply revel in the poetry. Lines like “Language is approximate, violence is precise,” or “Everything we do is false consolation, or any consolation is true,” made me reflect, long after I put this book down. And the anecdotal descriptions of the destruction of Warsaw will live long in my mind.Having limped to the end and bested my peers who had given up in the attempt, I paused to ask a couple of questions:1)	While a poet has a reader for a few minutes at a time with her poem, and can therefore take the attitude of “figure this out if you wish, I don’t really care, I write what comes to me,” can a novelist take that same approach?2)	Is there an obligation on the part of the novelist—despite taking detours into metaphor, lyrical language and rich research—to also tell a story that flows easily for the reader?If the answers to the above are Yes and No in sequence, then I think Anne Michaels has succeeded brilliantly. If the answers are reversed, then she gets a failing grade. And of course, if there are no clear answers, which I suspect is the case, given that the form of the novel continues to evolve, I give her my three stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Nov 15, 2010","Nov 21, 2010","Nov 15, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4682252-the-winter-vault

There are no protagonists or villains, perhaps a few ignoramuses, as each chapter is dedicated to an individual member of the newspaper’s staff. Loosely threading the chapters are italicised back-story slices which offer glimpses of the evolution of the newspaper from its origins in the 1950’s through to its demise in the present day, primarily driven by its inability to change with the times.The chapters could be likened to linked stories, except that the only linkage is the flitting about of the newspaper’s cast of characters, all fellow employees, who have either been explored in a previous chapter dedicated to them, or are in cue for the treatment in an upcoming chapter. Oh yes, there is one departure: one chapter covers a reader who is faithfully reading every edition, cover to cover, and is behind by about 12 years, but then she too is the mother of one of the former employees and is thereby connected.The chapters are somewhat formulaic too as there is always the pitting of its designated character against a foil, to highlight the former’s central predicament. By virtue of their quirks, the newspaper’s staff members are Imperfectionists, as the title suggests, and are interesting character studies. The novel suffers from the lack of a dramatic arc as each chapter is a self-contained story in itself and the whole reads like a boat cruising over a series of waves with no real storm to overcome. Also, as each character is limited to a single chapter, their development lacks depth; this is a pity because some of them could have qualified for having their own dedicated novel.I wondered in the end, if the unnamed newspaper is the real tragic hero of the piece, and if the author is hinting to the strong possibility of the demise of his industry as the Internet 2.0 era matures. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 08, 2010","Nov 14, 2010","Nov 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6834410-the-imperfectionists

They truly are lost sA revolution in a small Caribbean island exposes deviant sexuality, and gender and racial hatred among its principal characters. They truly are lost souls without hope of redemption.Jimmy Ahmed is the unlikely bi-sexual, mixed-breed revolutionary, who hates England for having made him into a plaything and who hides out in a foreign-sponsored farm on his native island waiting for the moment to spring his revolution. My problem with Jimmy is that he does not appear to have charisma that will inspire a wide revolutionary following—in fact, there is no evidence of a following, more the opposite, with recruits leaving the farm—except for Jane the conflicted Englishwoman and Bryant his jealous young male lover. And Jimmy’s ruthlessness is only directed towards women—he is not your regular Che Guavara who orchestrates lightning raids and moves about steaming jungles with a motley band of armed guerrillas. Roche the former South African hero who endured torture and wrote a book about it is also somewhat impotent, his relationship with Jane ending, his farm project on the island languishing. And Jane herself, the succubus, cold to Roche, attracted to Jimmy and to his deviant sexuality, is not sure if her place belongs on the island or back in England.Most of the story happens in the minds of these characters, and the revolution, when it does erupt, happens off-stage and is a damp squib, quickly put out by the authorities and the police (who are fed by the islanders – so where are the guerrillas and where is their support base?), and the foreign investors who are eager to protect their investment. And Jimmy is left isolated in his farm, seemingly immune from arrest, with no followers, thirsting to avenge himself on Jane and Roche who represent the colonial yoke that thwarts true change on the island. Among the locals, the establishment of the state of Israel around that time seems to be their only sign of hope; they believe that Africa’s and, by extension, their island’s turn is next – how, they do not know, or seem to care about.I wondered if this story was a metaphor for the author’s own trajectory from a Caribbean island to fame in England as a writer, where he has won every conceivable literary prize but where he still refers to himself as being in exile. Jimmy stands out as the neutered colonial outpost while Jane and Roche represent the equally improvident mother country, unable to provide any more and therefore needing to pay for the sins of the past. I was amused to discover little-used words like “dirtiness,” “youngish,” “racialist,” “that that,” “had had,” and “straiter” – colonial words that I had once used and have now forgotten.The style is intellectual, much of the plot is revealed through discussions between the expatriates and the wealthy locals (who have compromised their principles and increased their waistlines or obtained landed immigrant status in Canada), and through character introspections. I also found the descriptions of the island vivid but excessive and they intruded on the pacing.On the other hand, whenever Naipaul speaks in the patois of the locals, it reveals much and is very incisive.I have been a big fan of Naipaul and have enjoyed his earlier works and his non-fiction travel writings. Yet I have had trouble with his “middle passage” books like this one and even his most recent ones. Perhaps a colonial writer at some point needs to shuck the yoke of his origins and move onto other themes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 06, 2010","Nov 08, 2010","Nov 06, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3337997-guerillas

To expiate himself from the crimes of the Waffen SS to whom he had been attached at the tender age of 17? To pin down events before a fading memory lost them forever? Or to take the high road and cling to the claim that he never fired a shot during the war, but was shot and bombed to hell and back as a member of a defeated German army in the dying months of WWII, and therefore deserving to hang on to his Nobel Prize for Literature that everyone wants to take away from him because of his infamous past associations?Motives apart this memoir is truly a portrait of the consummate artist as a young man, and a primer on the conditions that gave rise to his art. From a two-bedroom flat where as a child he had a makeshift room under a window ledge from where he painted and sketched, to his brainwashing in the Hitler Youth organization on the glories of pre-war Germany, replete with Olympic victories, the Hindenburg Zeppelin and the magnificence of Mercedes Benz (an experience similar to those of insular kids in other past empires who were raised to believe that the sun rose and set on their nation and that everyone else lived in darkness), to his war time misadventures, to his long rehabilitation as a POW, and then as a struggling artist in an impoverished post-war Germany, this book offers a fresh perspective on the war—a German one—where not every German is a bad guy, and where German women (Grass’s mother being one) were raped by the victorious Allied armies, just like all conquering behemoths have done throughout history irrespective of their stripes. Grass uses the onion metaphor for memory, peeling back the layers that sweat and bring out tears. He also uses the opposite symbol of amber that freezes objects within as it encases translucently, like memory frozen around certain events.Towards the end of the war, the illusion of the glorious Nazi Germany unravels for young Grass, again like the proverbial onion, and he defies the administration by pissing into the coffee he delivers to his senior SS staff leaders. If the world is making a case that Canadian Omar Khadr was brainwashed as a child to be a killer, then we have to cut young Gunther some slack. After all, in his words, he didn’t even fire a shot! He even played cards with a fellow inmate, one Joseph Ratzinger, while in prison – perhaps that should buy him some additional indulgences!I was intrigued by the life described by Grass in post-war Germany, from its bombed-out, black market-ridden blight in 1945 to the flourishing of art, material wealth and order that quickly followed despite the occupation by Allied forces and the partitioning of the country into East and West. In this shift, Grass quickly graduates from brain numbing mine work to gourmet cook to jazz drummer to art student to sculptor to poet to novelist, in Dusseldorf and later in Berlin - a great re-integration from a wounded POW suffering from hunger for months on end. The final part of the book reveals the images that led to his creation of the character Oskar Matzerath, in The Tin Drum, the novel that launched his career as a Nobel Prize winning writer. Oskar epitomizes the damaged child of Germany who emerged between its two wars and is a collage of different people and situations that Grass encountered during those early postwar years: his own drumming in the three-piece jazz band, the child of a friend who rudely interrupted a party by banging on a tin drum, and his hunchbacked art teacher – all ingredients that go into the making of the memorable Oskar.In the end, Grass leans on his faulty memory for escape from thornier issues and mixes up sequences while still recounting key events with exacting detail, slumping into third person whenever the memory is too painful. But throughout, his writing remains bold, rhythmic and honest—even to the point of once describing his private parts as resembling those of Caravaggio’s Cupid!A great book chronicling the making of a writer, if you can forgive the man of the crucible that forged him....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Oct 29, 2010","Nov 05, 2010","Oct 29, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35740.Peeling_the_Onion

I will however, return to the remaining three at some point in the future.Bellow paints a stark picture of Depression-era Chicago in many of the stories which are centred within the Jewish community. During his life, he decried being labelled a Jewish writer but his immersion in that culture does not absolve him of the moniker. Personally, I think he should have worn the badge with pride, for he brilliantly explores the depth in his Jewish characters, exposing their sharp edges, their ambition to make it in the new world (by hook or by crook), their tribal nature, and most of all, he draws the distinction between the European Jew who has earned his stripes by suffering the pogroms and persecutions of the past, and the American Jew who is selling his by assimilating and embracing the American Way.Some interesting factoids of the era get tossed into the mix as we read along: how until the nineteenth century, the Pope entered the Jewish section of Rome and spat ritually on the garments of the chief Rabbi; how common it was to bribe private medical colleges with “donations” to earn a degree in the US; how the public service system was riddled with more bribery; and how the prisoner gets his hernia fixed, cataracts removed, false teeth and hearing aid installed, all at the cost of the US penal system, costs he could never afford himself while going straight.Some lines of dialogue say a lot: “You don’t support your children,” Mrs Skoglund says, on meeting Morris Selbst for the first time, revealing much of both their characters. Bellow is pre-occupied with fat women and big men and many of his characters fall into these categories – is this a metaphor for the American Jew who has forsaken his origins and settled for life, liberty and the pursuit of Mac-happiness? Why did I stop reading then: because of the density and waywardness of the prose. In particular, the longer stories are packed with lots of interesting but inconsequential detail. I guess, a Nobel laureate has the luxury of drifting and expecting his readers to catch up, not really caring for the contract he has with them, and ignoring their entertainment and enlightenment quotients. There are digressions into philosophy, poetry, politics, literature, and the lives of peripheral characters, in random order, which only serve to move the reader away from the central conflict in many of the stories, and these parts are tedious to get through. And his character descriptions are often overdone; I was never allowed to forget Sorella Fonstein’s “fatness” – it came up at least a couple of times on every page. I liked the shorter pieces however, like “A Silver Dish,” “Looking for Mr. Green,” and “Something to Remember Me By,” which seemed to enforce more discipline on Bellow with their conciseness.Is Bellow a master of the short story form? Probably not. Is he a master of human observation – absolutely, for in plumbing his characters in these sketches, he has revealed much of what is hidden in the lives of his people who fled European persecution and toiled as bakers, shopkeepers, grocers, taxi drivers, mobsters, political advisors, lawyers and writers, wrestling with guilt and ambition while nursing dreams of success for themselves and their progeny in this New World of opportunity which was in turn, ironically, mired in the throes of the Great Depression. Just as his critics had labelled him, he seems to be saying, “You can run but you can’t hide – once a Jew, always one.”  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 03, 2010","Oct 23, 2010","Oct 03, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11909.Collected_Stories

I should have noticed the signals when the piles of hardbound copies in Being a lifelong fan of Hemingway, I was disappointed in this book, his last. I should have noticed the signals when the piles of hardbound copies in the bookstore were selling for under eight dollars apiece, when it was polythene wrapped so that I could not flip pages to sample what I was buying (in publisher hubris – “don’t question the master, dude!”) and when most of its interesting parts had already been published in a much smaller version titled, True at First Light some years ago.Although dubbed a fiction, this is a thinly veiled journal of Hemingway and his fourth wife Mary’s sojourn for several months in a hunting camp under the shadow of the great mountain Kilimanjaro. There are endless rounds of drinking, hunting, killing, eating, trading jokes by campfire, bathing, diarrhoea, going local, driving and flying around the game reserve – the routine of life in this place which to Hemingway is his nirvana. The elements of tension and conflict needed to render this travelogue into a novel are provided in the hunt for a lion by Mary and a leopard by Papa, in the latter’s abortive attempts to take a young African wife while still being in love and married to his American one, and from the constant threat of approaching Mau Mau marauders who never really appear in the end.In his meandering ruminations (I am sure the two editors dared not touch the ramblings of the Great One) Hemingway opens us to his past encounters in the literary field with luminaries such as Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound and Scott Fitzgerald, plus his sojourns in France, Spain and Cuba, and he expresses his resignation for not winning the Nobel that year (he lost to Winston Churchill but won in the following year) – not sure what all these had in common with the African novel, but they were good insights nevertheless. I also realized in reading this book that Hemingway used most of his life experiences to form his fiction and that his imaginative component was but a smidgeon applied to a collage of real life experiences.Hemingway certainly belongs to a vanished age of macho men whose lives were better than their fiction; people who came of age with weapons in hand, surrounded by death, and who had to kill their meat in order to be validated. There is no mention of him ever eating vegetables! Even Mary who comes to hunting later in her life gets hooked on the sport, and obsesses over killing her lion even though her shooting is suspect, and she begins to take pleasure in killing animals as the novel progresses. As a writer, Hemingway’s ego is total; I am sure he would have had choice words for this  if he was alive, just as he tears into the critical reader from Iowa and ends up calling her a bitch. In the process, the hierarchy of creation in Hemingway’s world becomes clear: White Man =>White Woman=>Black Woman=>Animal.African tribal rituals and culture are brought alive as Hemingway goes native and tries to belong – to be a brother, to smell like them, eat like them, hunt like them, celebrate like them, and love like them. In exchange, and much to the game warden’s chagrin, he teaches his African brothers to drink like him. He also claims relationship to the Native American Indian and talks about his God, Gitche Manitou, and of the Happy Hunting Grounds where there is endless and unrestricted game hunting, drinking and celebration – sometime I wondered whether he was deliberately leading on the locals (and his readers). The Hemingway style got to me this time. The run-on sentences, word repetitions, indirect and stylized dialogue, oblique references to events happening off stage, the sparse use of commas and the heavy use of the word “and” – lyrical though they may be – did not flow for me this time and I often had to revert to re-reading sentences or to skipping them in frustration.A nostalgic book for Hemingway aficionados, no doubt – but this is the work of a writer whose best work peaked a long time ago. Just as the trip to Africa in Under Kilimanjaro is a repetition of the one Hemingway did 20 years prior and chronicled in The Green Hills of Africa, this was my romp through a Hemingway tome after a similar time gap – just for old time’s sake!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 20, 2010",Oct 2010,"Sep 20, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/104234.Under_Kilimanjaro

The story is of Jacob de Zoet, a clerk who comes out east to earn his fortune so that he can return in five years to marry his bride-to-be in Holland, and Orito Aibagawa, a disfigured Japanese midwife. In them, we realize the schism that eternally separates the West from the East. In Japan, the Westerner is always the foreigner; and even though he may takes wives, father children, learn the language, and contribute to the country’s education, economy and security, he will never be permitted out of the “foreigners only” zone and into the intimate secrets of the host country. Japan looks after its own; even justice to Japanese wrongdoers is meted out by the Japanese, in their own peculiar way. There are three related stories in this narrative: (1) the arrival of Jacob and his boss, Vorstenbosch, to clean up the tiny Dutch trading post of Dejima on the shores of Nagasaki, a place steeped in corruption and failing finances, reflective of the larger VOC at the time, (2) The story of Orito who is gifted to a temple in the mountains where, unknown to the rest of the world, the most heinous crimes against humanity are being committed, and (3) the arrival of the British on the heels of the collapsing Dutch empire. Through these events, Jacob matures to lose his idealism and accept that the best laid plans notwithstanding, life happens.Despite the elegant prose and detailed descriptions that bring this period vividly to life (check out the opening paragraph of chapter 39 – one of the best prose poems I have read, and a fantastic description of Nagasaki), I found several shortcomings in the book. Being a historical novel, the narrative is in the present tense. I found the constant italicised interior monologues that go on in the heads of the various characters to be distracting and a rather poor device to provide depth of perspective. The author is also challenged in dealing with three languages – Japanese, Dutch and English – in English. This could have been managed better if he had not lapsed into wordplay in scenes where the Japanese are shown to be struggling to find the right “Dutch” words; the examples provided are English alliterations: “lewdness” for “rudeness”, “whore’s helper” for “horse helper”, “vocation” for “vacation,” and so on. There are also just too many characters, and after awhile, I gave up trying to remember names; some names, particularly of the multitude of interpreters, slaves and samurai do not have to be mentioned. The research is overdone and pretentious in places, where copious quantities of scientific and medical theory of the day are discussed. And yet, a Tamil slave is supposed to be talking in Ceylonese—which is a nationality, not a language! That said, all the side stories of the Dutchmen of Dejima that come out at various points in the narrative help to illustrate a Western world pre-occupied with conquest, profit, cheating, stealing, lining one’s own pockets and dying over acquisition. The Japanese are no better, for the magistrate ruminates that “Japan was once ruled by nobility but is now ruled by deception, greed, corruption and lust.”Humour lies under the surface of many of the situations, and when mixed with the terrifying revelations that occur from time to time, is a compulsive “must-continue-reading” formula.I am indebted to the author for tackling this obscure subject in this remote corner of the world, and for paving the way for more contemporary literature on the VOC during its sunset years.

It is also a metaphor for Albania during its Communist rule in the 20th century, for although the invading Ottoman empire circa 1474 is portrayed as the bad guy, the implication and insinuation is that this totalitarian empire is a reflection of later day Albania itself.In a nutshell, an Albanian fortress is besieged by an invading Ottoman army, but prevails despite everything that is thrown at it – from ladders, to death squads, to tunnelling, to cannon, to shutting off aquifers, to cutting off food supplies, to throwing poisoned vermin over its walls. There are spies on both sides; the reward for failure is imprisonment or death (even cannon that don’t fire straight are ‘fustigated,’ life is cheap, and God help any female Albanians taken prisoner – they don’t last even an evening in the hands of their sex hungry enemy obsessed with blond women’s pubic hair.In the end, the Ottomans retreat, and Albania is safe until the next invasion...and the next... for victory is finally achieved only when the minds of the opponents are vanquished.I was intrigued by the vast support network that buffets an army of this size: mufti, dervishes, astrologers, spell casters, architects, chroniclers, poets, hoxas (professional prayers), dream interpreters, keepers of the seals, knife grinders, dwarfs, harem wives, eunuchs, and water carriers, to name a few.Even though the story is primarily told via the lowly chronicler, Mevla Celebi, the point of view pans the various players in the invading camp, including the commander-in-chief, who is most at risk for a failed campaign. We also begin each chapter with a page or two from the diary of an unknown soldier on the Albanian side, which sums up the reaction to the previous chapter’s events from those under siege. The style mixes humour with terror to bring out a chilling effect on the reader. On reflection, I realized how reminiscent the Ottoman Empire’s practices are of present life, not only during Communism in the 20th century, but in our modern public or private sector corporations today. For even though superstition has been replaced by rationality and the human casualty rate may not be so high today, the following still applies: win at all costs, scapegoat and sideline those who fail, spy on one’s competitors, some people are more equal than others in the human bureaucracy, pick your battles, the chief solicits feedback but makes his own decision in the end, human resources are disposable etc., etc. Certainly a book worth reading and reflecting on whether much has changed since the 15th century, especially in our attitudes towards conquest and acquisition. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 04, 2010","Sep 15, 2010","Sep 04, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2101872.The_Siege

This I visited Coventry Cathedral (the newer version) back in the ‘70’s on a trip to Oxford but never took much time to understand its fiery genesis. This book was a welcome filler-in of my information gaps from the perspective of the survivors of that inferno.The lives of the two protagonists, Harriet and Maeve, intersect at critical points during World Wars I and II in the city of Coventry. At the dawn of WWI, Harriet and Maeve meet by happenstance and enjoy a double decker bus ride together, soon after the former has said goodbye to her recently married, 18-year old husband, Owen, who is heading off to the battle front in Belgium, never to return alive. The women forget to trade names or addresses on that first meeting and lose contact. During WWII, the two women meet again as refugees when the city of Coventry is under aerial bombardment; both are looking for the 22-year old Jeremy who has affected their lives in different ways, and who has gallantly gone off to save lives from the inferno. Outside of these two ghastly global conflicts, the two women’s lives seem unlived, but the crucible of war gives them definition and purpose. Their wartime experiences bind them inextricably, well into old age, and each in her own way begins to express and record the indelible images of war: Harriet as a writer and Maeve as a painter.This is a very short novel, almost a novella, and the prose is simple and elegant. It is also an interior book as we see Coventry through the eyes of these two women, and much of the political machinations behind the bombing of that city are out of scope. That said, I found much of the back story, outside of the wartime events, being “told” to us: Maeve’s expulsion from her family when she gets pregnant, and Harriet’s wicked mother who is hell bent on burning everyone, are two examples; we even get a page of exposition on Maeve’s late marriage to Tom, another painter, just three pages from the end of the book. The book woke me to the fact that much of the tragedy of history occurred, or was exacerbated by the technology (or lack of technology) of its time. For instance, if cell phones had been around at the time of the bombing of Coventry, finding Jeremy would not have been such a difficult thing for either of the women, and their lives (and Jeremy’s) may have taken a completely different direction. The book also woke me to the fact that so many hapless, silent, and stoic women of that period not only lost their husbands in one war, but they turned around to lose their sons in the next one – a truly persecuted generation.

And what a gift it was, considering that I lived for the first 24 years of my life in Sri Lanka and also took a motorcycle journey around the island once, albeit when things were much saner.Mark Meadows, avid traveller and adventurer, takes it upon himself to travel to Sri Lanka in 2003, during a ceasefire in the country’s 26-year civil war, to interview both government and rebel leaders on how they viewed their respective causes, and to sample life among the simple folk in villages and towns across the island. He takes tea with leaders on both sides, recording the ensuing conversations on tape. Given the respective track records of the combatants as highlighted in the world press, one wonders whether the word “terrorist” mentioned in the title applies to all of his fellow tea drinkers. It is revealing to discover how those who commit mass murder in the name of freedom, subsequently enjoy positions of ministerial and senatorial power in the Sri Lankan Government by simply turning in their guns and switching allegiances, by giving up the military option and seeking a political one. Is atonement and forgiveness that easy? If it were, why did this conflict start in the first place? One of Meadows’ hosts, a former Tiger cohort, likens the Tamils’ struggle against the majority Sinhalese as similar to moving an elephant. You cannot shift the creature, it must move on its own. “You have to make it feel something, prick it with something small”. A military leader on the rival side claims that the Sinhalese “have a better history.” And so goes the battle for supremacy without accommodation, leaving behind carnage in the northern half of the country, which is littered with landmines except for a strip of narrow potholed highway that leads Meadows through the bullet scarred shells of towns and villages of a once-thriving society.And yet there are also heroes and saints along the way: the woman who gave up her life to run outside and shut the gate of the Kandy Temple and foil the terrorists from blowing it up completely, the soldier at Elephant Pass who took on a makeshift rebel tank with a grenade, the man who accosts Meadows on the street to give him a message from God—“Unity is Divinity.” In between his peregrinations, Meadows observes and ruminates on the state of war: fear is our most basic instinct, our most social emotion; in war zones people cough; in war zones the sky is terrifyingly large (i.e. all tall buildings have been knocked down); sometimes we have to destroy our bodies so that the power of the soul can find its way out of the clogged unreality of life; war defines limits, war creates identity ; (in war) an equal is needed, otherwise we call it genocide, massacre, holocaust; we are as warlike as we are sociable. If these quotes are originals, they are priceless and Meadows’ reward by his muse for putting himself in harm’s way.The book is an interesting addition to the canon of post-LTTE literature on Sri Lanka because it goes behind the scenes of this ethnic conflict that provided the world with suicide bombers and child soldiers. It records verbatim the experiences and thoughts of some of its main characters (it’s a pity that Prabhakaran did not grant an interview) while also giving us the photographic view of the outsider-looking-in through the viewpoint of a foreign author, or the “pink” as Meadows calls himself.I held back giving this book a fifth star because there were certain historical inaccuracies within its pages, and the author’s Sri Lankan sources did him a disservice by not correcting some incorrect English translations of the vernacular. These are not major flaws and do not detract from the main story line, but to someone knowledgeable about the country and its genesis, these nits draw you back to the proverbial ink spots on an otherwise spotless white shirt.All that notwithstanding, it requires physical and mental courage to undertake a journey like this, on an unfamiliar motorcycle, through a dormant war zone that could erupt at any time (and it did; the ceasefire was abandoned in 2008 after transgressions on both sides, and the Sri Lankan armed forces launched their final onslaught soon thereafter, defeating the Tigers and ending the war in May 2009), tip-toeing around landmines, eating unfamiliar food, sleeping in flea-infested rooms, and communicating in a foreign language. It also takes moral and spiritual courage, and a caring for humanity, to attempt to plumb a foreign culture, its religion and psyche, and expose its warts as lessons for us all, while running the risk of being labelled “Ugly American.”In the end, Sri Lanka is revealed as a crucible of mankind’s foibles; a country ruled for the major part of its history under the principle of “might is right.” Will she emerge from this last quarter century of bloodshed and reverse the equation to that Arthurian utopian ideal: “might for right”? Will she even try?I hope more people around the world, let alone in Sri Lanka, read books like this. It may hopefully moderate our warlike nature and influence us to seek political solutions first, instead of pursuing the military kind.

Reader, in this case, is the writer, suffering from the dreaded “Block”. We get glimpses of him as someone who has suffered losses of friends and family, of health and livelihood, and is all alone trying to write this novel.Reader is distracted from developing his plot and characters by the random thoughts and trivia of all the books he has read over his lifetime. These one-liners drift in an out of Reader’s emerging novel, and they form the most interesting part of the book, at least for me. Did you know that Isaac Newton died a virgin, or that Thomas Hardy sold less than 20 copies each of his first three books, or that Virginia Woolf dismissed Ulysses as “an illiterate and underbred novel”, and Voltaire condemned the works of Shakespeare as a “dungheap”, that Nietzsche paid to publish Thus Spake Zarathusthra that went on to sell all of 40 copies—the list of trivia goes on...It is the most heartening collection of notes for struggling writers who feel alone and unappreciated—“You are not alone,” Reader seems to say,” others, great ones, have suffered this mortal coil too.”Woven in between the vignettes is a record of painters, poets, musicians, and writers who committed suicide throughout history and of the artists – Jews and Gentiles alike – who in Reader’s opinion were anti-Semitic. These ominous signs foreshadow where Reader is heading with his novel.Reader’s principal character, aptly called Protagonist, is a reflection of himself, sick and alone, who finds himself in two simultaneous scenes that he can’t seem to exit from: in a graveyard where he encounters a woman beside a grave, and in a house by the sea (which has a boarded cellar piled with boxes) where, while walking along the beach, he follows another woman. This is the extent of his novel, which ends like his life, as identifiable as his trivia selection—non-linear, discontinuous, collage-like, an assemblage—in the wastebasket. Initially, I wondered if one took out all the trivia, was there was really a novel here? Protagonist’s story only amounts to about half a dozen pages. So then, does one reward the author for the elaborately compiled collection of trivia (in an era prior to Google and other search engines)? Is there a code in the arrangement of these facts (Wikipedia seems to concur with their veracity)? Is this a lament to the futility of the artist’s life while he is alive? All the troubled and eccentric real-life people mentioned in the trivia became giants in their respective fields, especially after their deaths, although their lives were far from pleasant. Certainly much food for thought and fuel to continue the painful journey that is the life of the creative artist, although I would hate to end up in the wastebasket for all my effort!...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2010","Jul 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/195607.Reader_s_Block

Her first marriage is one of convenience as Alexandre continues to pursue his career, take mistresses and sire illegitimate children, despite having a son and daughter by Rose. The Reign of Terror descends and Alexandre is imprisoned and later guillotined for his failure to win a key battle. Rose follows him into prison but escapes on a reprieve when Robespierre himself (the patriarch of the Terror) is executed.A released Rose continues her survival and the protection of her fledgling family by artfully affiliating with the right power brokers of the shifting political hierarchy. While other histories chronicle her as being the mistress of several powerful men during her widowhood, this novel shows her with only one lover, a married man, General Hoche, until she meets Napoleon, and agrees to another marriage of convenience: for her, to dispense an obligation to the all-powerful Deputy Barras who is paying for her children’s education and is one of the ""rulers by committee"" of the new Republic; for Bonaparte, to legitimize his Corsican heritage with the French and be appointed Chief of the Italian Army.The novel is written as Rose's diary and hence certain events occur off-stage, and yet the on-stage happenings are vividly re-created with penetrating intimacy. What is fascinating is the portrayal of the shifting allegiances of the time: people in-favour one day are out of favour the next, the aristocracy is forced to become ordinary “citoyen” while the common man steps into seats of power and influence and are seen ""drinking water from finger bowls"" and ""blowing their noses on table cloths."" Marriages are formal and loveless, while passion is found only with lovers. Even Rose and Alexandre take different lovers while sharing the same prison and awaiting their impending execution. Peculiar customs of the time: footmen arranging women's hairdo's, young women being ""bled"" to give them a fair and pale complexion in public, rinsing with urine to numb a toothache, maids standing by with needles and thread for emergency garment repairs during the Queen's ball, ""having flowers"" aka having a menstrual period, drinking port and beer during a pregnancy - very interesting indeed!I believe I will read the other two books in this trilogy, for this indeed is a “Sodom and Gomorrah” period of recent history and Gulland deserves kudos for the meticulous research behind this effortlessly delivered novel....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 20, 2010","Jul 26, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70287.The_Many_Lives_Secret_Sorrows_of_Josephine_B_

Humans have been reduced to cannibals, even to eating their young in order to survive. The protagonists, the man and his son (no names offered, none needed) are the good guys – the last ones with the “fire” of morality in them, and a love that sustains them when food and shelter is scarce.This “journey story” is about our heroes’ trek from the freezing north to the south, in an area located somewhere in eastern North America, after a huge firestorm has reduced the earth to ashes. The father is ill and has only a few bullets left in his pistol, one of which he is reserving for his son, in case they are set upon by the bad guys. He would rather kill his offspring than see him fall into the hands of the baddies who could have the boy for lunch.The story meanders like the road they are on to the southern coast, with our duo encountering various obstacles and making new discoveries, and this was the part that dragged for me. The literary agent’s mantra of “give me the story on the first page” does not apply here; one has to wait for the last few pages. And yet the universal truths that fall out occasionally, like the scraps of food they find, are very illuminating. Here’s a sample:1)	Dying is not an option. We crave survival under the direst of conditions2)	When we all die, Death’s days will be numbered3)	As for food, God will provide in the most mysterious ways4)	Children crave community, adults are isolated5)	Children are open to sharing, even at risk to themselves; adults are selfish and suspicious6)	Love and family can sustain us through any cataclysm The father-son bond is enhanced by the occasional terse dialogue between them, in which their fears, hope, desperation, hunger, struggle to survive, and morality are expressed.There were some inconsistencies which I forgave in the light of this being fiction. For instance, it was never explained how Father and Son had survived in the cold north all these years before they began their trek south, or how eggs could be preserved in the house full of food that they stumble into en-route.The “cavalry” comes to the rescue too neatly at the end, and even though it hints of the “pat ending,” it reinforces point # 6 above and makes one heave a sigh of relief that there is a shred of hope in this rather hopeless world after all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Aug 29, 2010","Sep 03, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6288.The_Road

He has a brief relationship (one of many) with an Australian woman, Alison, in London, then breaks up with her, despite her deep feelings for him, and takes a position as an English teacher in a Greek school on the island of Phraxos in 1953. There he meets Conchis, a middle aged, wealthy man, who lives on a secluded beach property on the island. Through several weekend meetings that intensify in conflict and mystery, Conchis reveals his life to Nicholas, and introduces him to the twin beauties, Julie and June. Nicholas falls madly for Julie which starts a myriad of shifting scenarios that make him hang onto his own sanity, as she cruelly punishes him with her flagrant infidelity and changing personalities. Who is Julie? Is she a cryogenically frozen Lily, Conchis’s lover, from another generation, or a clever actress? Who is Conchis? Is he the island hero who withstood the Germans, or is he a traitor? Is he dead, or is he alive? Is he a hypnotist, a psychotherapist, or a fraud? Is Alison dead or alive? And who are the people who show up at night in German uniforms and classic period costumes? Is this a movie set or a reality show? What is the motive? Is this a story about behaviour under drugs, hypnotism, or schizophrenia? These are some of the questions that plague Nicholas (and the reader) as he is irrevocably drawn deeper into the Magus’s web. A postmodernist web, indeed. While it could be argued that this book is a page-turner, I thought it was over plotted and a third of the novel could have been cut to produce a tighter outcome. There is too much dialogue in places with scant attributions so that it is difficult to find out who is saying what. Conchis’s own indictment of fiction (he favours non-fiction) seems to ring true of this book when he says, “Why should I struggle through hundreds of pages of fabrication to find half a dozen very little truths?”Nicholas arrives at the understanding that love comes when loss is experienced and atonement is made. He accepts his limitations too: “men see objects, women see relationships.” But the Magus fades offstage somewhere, and even though we know that he is still the master puppeteer pulling those final strings, we do not know who he is, or where he is, or what his part in Nicholas’s love odyssey is, and why he really bothered. One can only cling to Conchis’s theory that “Everything is a matter of hazard,” and that our hero’s transformation is a result of a confluence of events outnumbering those of the Magus’s making....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Aug 18, 2010","Aug 27, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16286.The_Magus

They do not work for a living and are good at absolutely nothing, other than their good looks and elegant tastes. They abhor the middle classes, who are considered the enemy, and who are depicted as “perspiring, tearful, struggling, greedy, ambitious, bearing hope more sordid than despair.” Anthony and Gloria stagger from one drunken party to another, idolizing beauty, and pouting poetry, philosophy, Existentialism, Bilphism and other idle speculations of the day, and continue to run through their friends and fast- depreciating capital in post WWI New York, while living in hope that Anthony will inherit the millions of his grandfather, another one of those middle class types who ended up a wealthy industrialist and a right wing philanthropist.But Grandfather Patch is not impressed with his grandson’s lifestyle, disinherits him, and dies, leaving Anthony to wade through the courts to recapture his lifeline. Too late, Anthony’s and Gloria’s attempts at employment, driven by desperate economic need, end in total failure: Anthony tries to become a bond salesman and winds up drunk in a bar after a day of rejections, while Gloria auditions for the movies only to be told that her fading beauty (the single thing she values) is only good for a “minor mature role.” Their tragedy is heightened because in their case it is the rich trying to enter the world of the poor and failing at it. The prose is mellifluous although dated. Sex is limited to kissing and therefore no one gets pregnant, as most romances predictably do, thank God! Dialogue is not Fitzgerald’s strong suit, for some of the lines seem to come out of a P.G. Wodehouse world of upper crust England of the same period. I thought New Yorkers spoke differently! Some scenes are even written as script out of a stage play and I wondered whether this was an acquired style of the time, or a Joycean emulation that subsequently went out of fashion.Following a slow start, in which the author takes his time to set up scene, character and setting (I’m not sure that publishers will have patience for this kind of pacing today), the novel marches on, gathering momentum, to a tragic conclusion with a twist that surprised me.Despite his own alcoholism, Fitzgerald probably intended this novel as a cautionary tale to those contemplating the idle life of leisure. Basically he was saying, “If you don’t work, you don’t eat.” Or another way of looking at it, as Gloria would say, “Let’s burn through all our money in three years, and then let’s die.”...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/762116.The_Beautiful_and_the_Damned_Volume_1

Duncan MacAskill, who is a ""hit man"" for his church, responsible for removing sexual predators from among his colleagues to safer grounds, (so that they are free to commit more crimes, it seems from the news reports these days).The story focuses on Duncan's unravelling and descent into alcoholism from combinations of the guilt piled on during his childhood, his suppressed feelings towards the women in his life, the isolation of his office, and the ""sins of the fathers"" that he has to clean up.Three stories intersect: Duncan's father and his buddies' wartime ""collateral damage"" which result in later abuse and suicide, Duncan's sojourn in the Honduras during the ""70's which also ends in tragedy, and his present story when he is sent as custodian of an isolated parish in Cape Breton (really intended to get him out of the way of a nosey press), not far from where he grew up and where his closet's skeletons are eagerly awaiting him. Bringing the three story lines into sharper focus and towards a painful resolution is the suicide of a young man in the parish community - by now, a recognized outcome of unresolved sexual abuse. Fr. Duncan is impelled to hunt down the perpetrator, despite having walked away from his previous job. The author draws a sympathetic and haunting portrait of Duncan MacAskill, who seems to bear everyone's guilt, of victims and perpetrators alike. The sense of community in the parish is also evoked very well by people frequently bumping into each other or visiting the priest for a drink, and by illicit sexual couplings between parishioners from among the rather slim pickings available. Viciously guarded family secrets prove to be the only impediments to Duncan finding out ""whodunit.""The author uses an economy of words, both in narrative and in dialogue to convey a lot. I particularly liked his short treatise on the Burdens of Priesthood (a.k.a. ""what they don't teach you in seminary""): the struggle against idle speculation, the sterility of moral power in the age of secular celebrity, living alone without privacy, the burden of trust without intimacy, and struggling with fantasies about the ordinary - enough to make one take the cloth and shove it!Despite this being a Giller winner, I couldn't help feel a bit lost in the rapid, and sometimes unwarranted, time shifts - some contrived for effect and pacing. I also felt that the tenses could have been better written and that it would have been okay once in a while to be a bit more direct about what was happening.

I don't necessarily agree that this level of detail on the human condition is required in literature. But when a narrator talks about ""not washing his hands after pissing, extracting sweet nectar from between women’s legs, examining used condoms, and eating shit"" I think we are in the zone of ""extreme shock value."" It's as if the writer has no confidence in using less graphic prose to draw his reader in.Then there is another form of writing that frankly irritates me: the lack of punctuation and quotation marks. I know that we are in an age of experimenting with various new writing forms and older practices are being dropped - all part of continuous improvement - but when there is a story within a story and both narrators are ""I,"" for instance, the lack of quotation marks can be quite misleading, and it happens quite frequently in this novel. I think punctuation and quotes were invented to overcome the shortcomings in straight prose and to discard them arbitrarily shows a lack of respect for those ""who have gone before."" As for the plot, in this novel, it seems to develop midway. What was initially a character story about the aimless ramblings of our Cockroach, becomes a crime/espionage story in the end, as if an editor said, ""this is not good enough, brother - kick up the action"" and our unwilling author, not wanting to screw up his sophomore novel, complied half-heartedly. For all the graphic descriptions in the first two-thirds of the novel, the ending was minimalist and disappointing.Despite all these shortcomings, Hage opened me to the inner lives of Iranian and Middle-Eastern immigrant groups operating on the fringes of Montreal society. One wonders whether these immigrants were better off in their homelands, despite the threat of physical torture and incarceration they faced there. In their new homeland in Canada, they are eternally condemned to marginalized lives, poverty, identity-crisis, the bitter cold of winter (a form of torture to those improperly clad and from warmer countries - Cockroach is jubilant when he steals a pair of boots that finally warms his feet from the cold), and hope that can only to be found in the underground, into which our resilient Cockroach finally descends.

In this novel, evil, in the form of a travelling circus, visits the same town, testing the values of protagonists, Will and Jim, a year older than their colleagues in Dandelion Wine, yet still formative at the tender ages of 13.Mr. Dark's circus promises longevity; ride the carousel backwards and retreat into your youth to capture lost dreams and correct past mistakes; ride it forward, and age, rapidly. But to this Faustian promise there is a commensurate downside. Those who succumb are also trapped: the circus feeds off people's unhappiness, and its freaks - the witch, the fat man, the thin man and the dwarf - are manifestations of the lives these people once led, and are imprisoned in the circus forever.Jim, the kid impatient to grow up, is fodder for the circus while his buddy Will is more cautious and wary of the carnival's elusive promise. Supporting them is Will's father, Charles, who is the town library's janitor, and who spends every spare hour reading up on all the books in the library, harbouring the lost dreams of a closet philosopher.Despite the surface promise of entertainment, the circus slowly devours the weakest in the town, converting them into freaks for its stable: Miss Foley, the school teacher who secretly liked midway rides, is reduced to an unhappy child, and the lightning rod salesman ends up as a dwarf. Mr. Dark then starts to converge upon Jim, Will and daddy Charles.Just as unhappiness is the fuel of the circus, laughter is the key to destroying its power, similar to the way vampires shrivel under sharpened stakes and garlic, a secret which Charles discovers by a combination of research and accident. Armed with this knowledge, our fearless trio strike back with bellyaching laughs to thwart the ambitions of Mr. Dark and his gang. As ""Laughter is the Best Medicine,"" it's a foregone conclusion as to who triumphs in the end.Once the premise is established, and the circus has set up its tents in the town, the book marches on at a brisk pace, in uneven chapters which end at any point where the suspense is at a peak, making you want to read on (watch out for single-sentence chapters and anything beyond that in length)My only beef with this tale - which I would classify in today's parlance as a young adult novel - is the unnecessary profusion of poetic narrative. Bradbury was a poet first and foremost, more than a science fiction writer. And in this novel he gives free rein to his poetic writing, to the point that it obscures the free flow of the plot. There were more than a few times when I had to read certain passages twice over to figure out what was really going on.

The language is dated: a 25-year old married woman is called a ""girl"" while her 32 year old divorced companion is called a ""woman""; we hear of Turkey carpets and Monkey jackets and the word ""queer"" is bandied about freely without concern for political correctness. And yet, these period inconsistencies aside, (isn't Shakespeare's language rather archaic, despite being cutting edge during his time?) Cronin spins an intriguing tale about a doctor's journey from mission and guilt, to love.Dr. Harvey Leith beset with guilt and is fleeing a botched experiment that led to the deaths of patients in his care. He is boarded on a ship by a friend, bound for the Canary Islands, in the hope that some time at sea will clear his mind. Instead, he meets a motley crew of characters like him, all running away from some gap in their lives. Cronin is bold when he simulates and juxtaposes the accents of an English/Spanish cockney, an Irishman and Americans from Connecticut on board the sea voyage; at times the assault by dialects is difficult on the ear, especially when one of each of the above ethnicities are in a conversation together.Harvey is beset by two women during the passage. The beautiful Lady Mary Fielding, wife of a rich landowner in the Canaries, and bored with her married life, harbours a premonition (or is it a recollection of a past life, we never know) that she has met Harvey somewhere. Counterbalancing Mary, is the religious Susan Tranter, who is willing to sacrifice her life for this tortured doctor whom she is deeply drawn to.When the ship docks in Grand Canary, an epidemic of yellow fever binds the passengers closer, as Mary falls ill and Harvey is determined to save her, making one wonders if this desire is purely driven by love or by a need to redeem his past failures. The other characters circle to provide colour to the central conflict with their own side stories and experiences: Mama Hemingway and her bawdy house; ex-pugilist Jimmy Corcoran, the Irishman, dreaming of getting a new start on the islands by hook or by crook; Susan's weak evangelist brother Robert, falling for the fleeting charms of divorcee, Elissa Baynham, and ending up in Mama Hemingway's brothel - each landing where their character destines them. The scenes are cleverly interwoven and constructed with tension and drama, making the reader want to read on. The omniscient third person narrative works very well here. There is a subtle clash of science with mysticism, and a hint of class elitism when the doctor (Harvey) and his volunteer nurse (Susan) interrupt their humanitarian work in the villages of Grand Canary, helping the locals deal with the epidemic, to nurse the sick Mary. I found the Tranter siblings a trifle melodramatic in their dramatic swings from ultra-religious to ultra sinful and ultra suicidal.Cronin's descriptive powers are to be noted for their originality, especially when he describes his female characters: Mary - ""the curve of her small breast...graceful like swallows in flight"", and Mama Hemingway's quivering bosom was like ""blancmange agitated by an earthquake!""Like his suggestions of prescience, Cronin leaves his ending open ended: a whiff of freesia flowers, Mary's signature perfume, is all that we get when Harvey, on his return from his adventures in the Canaries, is thinking about whether Mary will leave her husband and come to him.

It reads like a non-fictional record of the last three years of Whitman's life by narrator and Whitman acolyte Horace Treubel.It is a meandering tome, hopping over many issues, recollections and incidents without a firm narrative trajectory, and in which the author uses Whitmans's voice to comment on the state of the nation at the time: slavery in America, the Civil War, Canada and its government (Whitman seems to have enjoyed a love-hate relationship with my fair country), the British Empire and its copyright laws that were harmful to the prosperity of writers of the day (has it ever changed? Or have things worsened here?)Walt's secret? Well, by skimming through I discovered it, and it's an interesting one, connecting Whitman to the power brokers of the day and to certain historically tragic events that I will not record here for spoiler alert reasons. And all the while, I thought it was his homosexuality that was his dark secret, and which seems to have got an easier pass, while his co-horts on the other side of the Atlantic were going to Reading Gaol for their ""inversion.""As for Whitman - he emerges as an interesting and compassionate man, giving freely to caring for the dying and injured soldiers in the civil war, sacrificing secure government clerical jobs in exchange for pursuing the truth in his art, and being considerate to his friends, lovers and loved ones. He was also a master self-promoter, insinuating himself to every photo-op or newspaper article he could get into - the local newspapers carried a ball-by-ball commentary on the progression of his deteriorating health, for instance in his last years. He is also attributed for having communicated with the ""other side,"" the spirit world, for his inspirational poetry.I was interested in the life of Walt Whitman, that is why I had some hesitation, and mild curiosity, in picking up this book, which is dubbed a novel. But given its non-fictional, memoir style, and the mixing of fact and fiction, I am not sure if I what I managed to piece together is a true depiction of the Great Grey Poet.

In the beginning, Lin, our protagonist, is waiting for 18 years to divorce his first wife, going to court each yearThe title “Waiting” is an apt one. In the beginning, Lin, our protagonist, is waiting for 18 years to divorce his first wife, going to court each year and being turned back for various reasons; in the end his first family is waiting for him to bury his new wife and return; and between these bookends we get a glimpse of “Courtship, Marriage and Divorce in a Communist Country” – which could have been another title for this novel.This is a very slow moving book with occasional bumps in the conflict and tension. Scenes that could have had higher dramatic impact (the rape of Manna, for instance, or the denial of Lin’s divorce on the 17th occasion) were quickly diluted and explained away in the very “telling” form of narrative. The interest in this book is therefore generated from peering behind the Iron Curtain, where the state bureaucracy indeed has a role in the bedrooms of the nation: from regulations about dating, sexual relations, divorce and everything else in between, activities that we in western society consider private.Characters go from “no sex” to “more sex” in this suppressed society. Manna, Lin’s ultimate second wife, is a case in point: relegated to only walking and talking with Lin for 18 years, within the precincts of the hospital in which they both work, she becomes a sexually charged virago after marriage, making Lin go off sex and feel his age.The book also subtly hints to the abuse of privilege among the ruling classes in Communist China, where senior officials can have mistresses and concubines and other “fringe benefits” while juniors may not, and where the cost of the hint of a scandal is the denial of state approved job promotions. I think it is creditable for a Chinese author to be writing this book in English, but I was put off by the passive voice that permeated the book, slowing down its already leisurely pace. The use of “were” and “was” intruded constantly. So was the use of a “collective voice” at times: the hospital staff, for instance, who like an angelic chorus, observe the goings on of Lin, his soon-to-be ex-wife, Shuyu, and Lin’s soon- to-be-present wife, Manna. Was this collective voice a reflection of the collective society portrayed in this novel? Then, as if trying to a counteract this style, the author injected a few western words into the dialogue which only helped to burst the exotic picture I was developing of the setting; words like “Dad” and “Killjoy” took me out of this surreal world, back into my real one. I did feel for Manna and Lin in the end. Something eagerly awaited and romanticised for so long can indeed turn into an anti-climax once consummated. Perhaps the patient Shuyu, who is always waiting, is the victor after all; she waits many years before granting Lin a divorce, now she continues her wait for Lin to return to her. Is waiting a larger metaphor for China, waiting to be free of the yoke of Communism, only to find that Capitalism has its own challenges? Is waiting a metaphor for our life on earth, no matter what political system we live under? That “waiting” is everything; that at the end of waiting lies only death? Thought provoking, indeed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 02, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/235773.Waiting

I like open ended short stories, but I kind of feel taken for a ride when the same happens in a novel. The story flips between Ireland and Australia. Adair is the officer sent to execute Carney, a convict captured in the nascent unruly nation of Australia back in the 1820’s. During a night of conversations in a god-forsaken hell-hole of a place called Curlow Creek, both connect with the larger-than-life character Fergus, who, in different ways had brought them to this pass. In the end we don’t know whether Carney was executed or escaped (one of those nagging open-ends for me) or whether both men find the answers that they are looking for. We get the sense that Fergus is dead somewhere in the Outback, leaving Adair free to pursue the enigmatic Virgilia back home in Ireland.Australia is a metaphor for the Inferno, where men go to find answers and seek redemption before entering paradise. But if Adair’s return to Ireland, after paying his dues in Australia, is likened to entering Paradise (Ireland), I’m not sure I buy that – I thought the Irish were getting ready to leave for the Americas at about that time to escape the coming Potato Famine?I found the style pompous. The author’s obvious flair for language intruded in the voice of the narrator Adair from time to time. Yes, Adair is part of the aristocracy, but he is also a soldier in a rough land – let him reflect that in his speech and actions. Yet, we had this literary voice mouthing metaphor and poetic turns of phrase in the wrong places. I also have a beef when a writer obfuscates and conceals a story line in narrative that is cryptic, with occasional name and incident dropping to keep us pegged. I relegate it to contrived plotting. And the back story section comprised of the genesis of Adair, Fergus and Virgilia in Ireland begged the question of what happened to “show don’t tell?”I had heard good things of David Malouf being one of the best living writers today and picked up this book, perhaps with higher expectation than I should have.

Walking the streets of Neutralia while waiting for a visa to join the British army and get back into the battle, he meets and falls in love with a fellow refugee, Odette, who is planning to head off to America. Suffering a nervous breakdown due to Odette's abrupt departure after a ten-day love-fest, Peter is rehabilitated by Sonia through a rigorous process of psychotherapy, where his ills are related back to the guilt over the death of his brother, a guilt that causes him to throw himself into difficult causes, like fighting wars, and enduring torture.Having rationalized his drives, Peter decides to follow Odette (and Sonia who also leaves for America after Peter’s physical and mental recovery is complete).However, the battle in Peter’s mind, between his ethical belief and taking the easy way out, is still raging, and finally gets the better of him. Peter makes a completely different and an altogether unsurprising life decision.I found this a gripping story. There are many forces at play here: the sexual tension between Peter and Sonia, between Sonia and Odette and between Peter and Odette, is palpable; the scenes of torture and of the killing of prisoners is grimly recorded and riveting to read, distasteful though they may be; even the clinical discussions on guilt and its implication on the physical body was a revelation to me. What was most revealing is how the body and mind behave under torture.

As Stephen tries to grapple with his loss and revisits his own lost childhood, his friend and one-time publisher, Charles, gives up the good life of a successful businessman and politician to retreat into the woods in Suffolk and play on tree houses, even visiting prostitutes to have himself spanked by matronly whores. Through their retreat into the past, both discover an immutable truth, which is the moral of the novel: redemption lies in creating,in moving forward, not in retreating.I found the writing was very narrative-focussed and the constant weaving of past and present put me on edge, because I never knew when I was going to be in the past vs. the present vs. somewhere in between. Yet, the prose is elegant and McEwan has the knack of bringing out mood, character and setting in a single complex sentence.There were little asides on the fate of the writer which interested me: writing is deemed a social act in a public medium; writing extends the private life. Charles and Stephen embody this philosophy: the former as the author of a ""how to"" manual on the raising of children sponsored by none other than the prime minister who has a secret sexual interest in his protégé, and the latter as an author of children's books.And yet many of the elements of the ""novel"" were missing: Charles' sexual deviancies were ""told"" to us by his wife Thelma, rather than ""shown"" to us in his behaviour; the parliamentary committee on children’s issues goes into speeches and moralizing to indicate their stance on the subject they were supposed to address; and Stephen, our narrator, is constantly in his head trying to sort out one scene in his past from another - if he was lost, so was I at times.Having written these kinds of books in the earlier part of his career, I am glad that McEwan is now moving into telling us better stories, with the accent on ""story"", not ""head games.""...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 25, 2010","May 30, 2010","May 01, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6869.The_Child_in_Time

The author uses the Red Tent as the listening post where all these family stories, some predating Dinah herself, are narrated to her via her four mothers (Jacob’s four wives) when they gather for three days to menstruate together around the dawning of each full moon. This “synchronicity” of bodily functions to the movement of the moon does not get much mention in our 24/7 culture today. And the men, shepherds, as was Jacob’s occupation, are portrayed as masturbators and fornicators of any available woman (or sheep), hard negotiators for wives and dowry, and bloodthirsty barbarians who will slaughter their fellow men, even while the latter are recovering from the painful procedure of circumcision. But as all this is written in the Book of Genesis, one can’t fault the author for bringing these events vividly to light.The lot of women in this time is to get married as soon as possible and have babies, and more babies, given the high rates of infant mortality, and to be subservient to their men at all times. The alternative is to become a midwife or a dancing girl, or a slave whose master may require sexual services, which could end up in the siring of more (second-class) children. There are multiple scenes of childbirth—a bit excessive I thought—good ones, bad ones and ugly ones. And the customs of the period are interesting too: human ashes in a mourner’s hair to honor the dead, a virgin’s first menstrual blood sprinkled on the earth as a libation for the crops, the mother naming her children, and bonded employees following their migratory masters.Given the multiplying of Jacob’s family and Dinah’s extended family in Egypt, many of the names in this narrative remain that – just names. Some however, emerge as fully rounded characters: the beautiful and tempestuous Rachel, her son Joseph the dreamer, Jacob the wily patriarch, Leah the most fertile of Jake’s wives, the lecherous Laban, and Dinah the midwife - these characters lift themselves off the pages amidst a secondary cast of cardboard cut outs.The severing of family ties that follows her husband's death is poignantly brought out as Dinah curses her Jewish family and moves to Egypt, pregnant with the only child she will have. Despite her return years later as an anonymous handmaid, she prefers to remain a myth, a story told around future gatherers inside the Red Tent. Her milk-brother Joseph too, now an Egyptian nobleman, remains estranged from Dinah. And as for those murderous brothers of hers, Simon and Levi, they fail to lift themselves from the page as fleshed out characters after being responsible for the pivotal event around which this novel revolves.Not everyone is reconciled, raising this book above the “and all end’s happily ever after” type. Death to Dinah is a passing from one world to the next, a re-uniting with her dead mothers whom she loved dearly, and a continuing of the journey towards perfection, something that seems to have been lost in many of the Judeo-Christian religions, in which a virtuous life on earth is claimed as the single shot at gaining Paradise, whatever that is....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 17, 2010","May 23, 2010","May 01, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4989.The_Red_Tent

My inability to peg this future was disappointing, because many of our present day institutions and practices prevail: supermarkets and burgers, and rifles and spas. And yet something has happened to this world: Corporations rule through their security police the CorpSeCorps, splinter religious groups and anarchic gangs (plebe rats) abound, infrastructure is in decay, people have lost their ability to love, sex is an animal appetite only and provided in various permutations and flavours of deviancy, and no babies are being born despite all the sex. Blame it on the Fall of Man syndrome.And in year 25, a Waterless Flood adds to this decline and decimates most of the living. I understood this to be a pandemic generated by a poison inserted into a sex pill. The survivors are those who were isolated from their fellow humans at the time. I didn’t know that Viagra-breath was infectious! Add to this, Man, in his ultimate desire to discover immortality, has embarked on the Paradice Project, which at best produces a species of humans with enormous blue penises who are ready and willing to load and shoot their seed “on demand” 24/7.The action centres around two principal characters: Toby, a middle aged woman who worked for the God’s Gardeners, a vegetarian sect believed to be the promised ones to survive on the earth after the Flood, and Ren, a younger woman, another ex-Gardener who sells her body as a prostitute because the love of her life Jimmy is out of her grasp (I believe he becomes Oryx or Crake in the previous Atwood novel).I grant Atwood her imagination and play of words. Most products are hybrids in this world: bimplants (breast implants), garboil (boiled garbage), leobams (lions crossed with sheep), soydeens (soya and sardines?). Take a trip to a spa in this world and pamper yourself with mildew formula, dermal mood lifts, vegetable nanocell injections, and flat wart leech peels. Or take a BlyssPlus pill (a sex pill) served in chocolate-dipped polyberries or Soylectable olives and enjoy multiple orgasms, and wuzzy comfy feelings with no microbe death downside – but don’t overdo it for your dick might split!(the author's words)The story is in two sections: (a) the 25 years leading up to the Waterless Flood and the lives of Toby and Ren and the God’s Gardeners during that period, and (b) the survival after the Waterless Flood strikes. The last section reads more like a search-and-rescue story, as Toby and Ren venture out into the unsafe and unstable outside world to locate and rescue their survivors, a world populated by predatory hybrid animals, escaped Painballers (prisoners who live in a survival jungle) and melting corpses succumbing to the deadly pandemic. There is no explanation as to why the survivors will not catch the residuals of this germ as they traverse this gory landscape.My one disappointment with this novel is, for all Atwood’s brilliance, there is a coldness about her characters, humanity is indeed missing. God’s Gardeners have become expert in going back to nature and extracting life from vegetation by the most ingenious means (imagine using maggots to clean wounds!), but they seem to have lost their souls along the way. As for Oryx and Crake, they are dangled as shadowy figures towards the end of the book, almost like a teaser for readers who did not read the previous novel to go and buy it now – slick marketing!I did feel a kinship with Atwood at the end. I wrote a novel about a Flood too, published around the same time as The Year of the Flood, one with water, and one firmly pegged to a date and place in history.

He also reveals the consequences of living in a world without love.In this book, based on a discovery he reported on as a young journalist, of a 200 year-old skeleton with a growing head of copper coloured hair discovered in an old church crypt, Maquez weaves a tragic love story of what might have been.The young girl in question, the daughter of an aging and idle Marquis in Colombia, is bitten by a dog and everyone fears that she will go mad, when all that afflicts her is a lack of love. And when she finally finds love, in the form of the young priest sent to exorcise her, societal, religious and family forces conspire to rob her of that love - a telling indictment against a closed colonial society.In the process, Marquez creates vivid characters: Sierva Maria, the girl, with ankle length hair, who prefers to spend her days in the slaves quarters than with her parents; Bernarda, the matriarch, addicted to fermented honey and cacao and walking around her house naked, screwing the slave Judas Iscariote like a bitch in heat while her husband naps in a hammock in the garden; the old Marquis himself, who is destined to fall in love with insane women and lives next door to a lunatic asylum where his former lover bombards him with letters in the form of paper butterflies; the young priest Fr. Cayetano, obsessed with books and learning and discovering that love can be an equally overpowering experience; his asthmatic bishop and mentor who is at cold war with the Abbess of the Santa Clara convent over a 100 year old misunderstanding; Dr. Abrenuncio the Portuguese-Jew, who is able to predict the exact moment of death of his patients. Abrenuncio brings rationality to this superstitious world by making some interesting observations to counteract the suffocating cloak of the Catholic Church that is firmly draped all over this novel, when he says that there is little difference between exorcism and witchcraft, and advocates that ""happiness as the best medicine"" for most of what ails us, and that ""crazy people are not crazy, if one accepts their reasoning.""

Set sometime in the future, five people in different parts of the world get stung by bees, during a period in which bees have gone extinct due to the proliferation of a drug called Solon that cures human anxiety.So begins their odyssey, when the five characters are immediately quarantined and subjected to a barrage of tests to find out what made them attractive to the bees. Following their release a month later, with no conclusions reached, and only having become instant celebrities, they are rounded up again and isolated in a Haida community off the coast of British Columbia and asked to relate stories to keep themselves aloft while more blood samples are taken from them at various times as their impromptu story telling alters their moods.Ultimately (and without giving the plot away) the five discover the awful secret of their incarceration through their stories. They escape, but the world still remains the same. At the end, we are told that the drug production has stopped but not why and how, we are told that the bees may come back but we don’t know when. And the five characters end up becoming “hive minded” as they are inextricably bound to each other by their experiences. Despite this inconclusiveness, the writing is vibrant and funny, the manufactured stories are pure flights of the imagination, and are told like parables by the five while under house arrest. The stories feed off each other and cover various themes: the shallowness of our glorified super-heroes, the emptiness of a consumer society that takes its cues from branding, the pervasiveness and invasiveness of media ( A Channel Three News team appears in almost every story), and the carnage that ensues when people lose their ability to read, write or count. The only saving grace is that reading and story-telling are espoused. One character finds a copy of Finnegan's Wake and uses it to cure his addiction to gambling. He even starts to make comparisons of Joyce's work and calls Ulysses ""a lower priced house brand of Finnegan's Wake."" In the end, the five arrive at the reality of their situation through their stories and the final story is a parallel to the plot behind their incarceration. The villain, who is captured by them, tells his own story in similar fashion, giving us the final piece to this puzzle.I had one peeve. I wished Coupland had done his research better. He bases Qatar in the United Arab Emirates (wrong!), and he talks about Trincomalee being close to the Bandaranayake Airport in Sri Lanka (wrong again! - they are at opposite ends of that island nation) and finally, he makes Trincomalee the capital of Sri Lanka (absolutely wrong - the capital is Colombo!) Having lived in both these countries for many years, I felt a bit annoyed at this obvious faux pas by such an imminent writer. I was also less than enthused with his character Harj, a Sri Lankan call centre worker who talks and acts like an American.

I had this book on my shelf for over three years before attempting to read it, wondering how the author would sustain my interest over its 560-plus pages. And, once making the bold attempt to finally pick-up the book, I had difficulty putting it down at times.The novel is visual, reminiscent of a screenplay. MacDonald uses a variety of techniques to hook the reader: the rapid mixing of tenses and point-of-view, anchoring the story along pivotal events and replaying those scenes from different vantage points like different camera angles applied for the same screen shot, hiding information in scenes and gradually revealing more clues in subsequent takes of the same scene, using combinations of journal, memory, snappy and irreverent dialogue and tight unconventional narrative that focuses on visual imagery rather than on syntactical propriety - yes, a masterful performance for a first novel, and great learning for emerging novelists.This story has a resemblance to the King Lear tale but is not as obvious as in recent re-takes such as Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres"". The patriarch, James Piper, marries a Lebanese child-bride and begets daughters, some whose mothers are unclear until the end. There is Kathleen the budding opera singer, Frances the evil one, Mercedes the pious one, and the crippled Lilly the saint. Incest is at the core, which hobbles and fractures the family over a time horizon spanning the dawn of the twentieth century to the 1950'sPivotal events such as Kathleen's tragic birthing of twins and its series of catastrophic aftershocks, Frances' shooting and the events that precede and follow, the unravelling of what happened to Kathleen in New York - are all launching points to move the story forward and grip the reader in a non-stop read.The four sisters emerge gradually from their childhood as the indistinguishable offspring of James Piper, into fully flushed characters with different personalities and histories over the time span of this novel. Unfortunately, Momma, or Materia their Lebanese mother, gets no accolades for the girls' destiny, apart from a few Arabic words they banter around, and the occasional Middle Eastern dish they prepare for James. Daddy, in his twisted, well meaning way, gets all the credit for the disasters that befell their lives. A great read, I recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Mar 17, 2010","Apr 02, 2010","Mar 17, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5174.Fall_on_Your_Knees

Three people in an ailing van - 28 year-old Aunt Hattie and her 15-year old nephew Logan, the basketball junkie driving without a licence, and his unwashed super-intelligent 11 year-old sister Thebes - all running away from an impossibly suicidal Mum in Manitoba, and searching for Dad in California. All this travel can get a bit boring at times, despite the snappy dialogue, humorous situations, the vitality of youth exuded, and the interesting bookended parental figures. There were only so many novel things the travellers could do on the trip before I got the sense that the author was contriving dialogue and situations to keep this story moving, just like that ailing van.Now that I have been unkind, let me speak to the part that enlightened me: psychotics should never procreate and raise families, despite how loving they are to their children; it’s absolutely selfish on their part, because it's those around them who have to pick up the pieces and deal with the guilt. And Toews, in this dramatic-comedy, gets this point across very elegantly. Min is the psychotic mother, hell-bent on self-destruction, while Hattie is her younger sister, plagued with responsibility and guilt because of it. No one is spared: Min's father drowns trying to save her, Hattie breaks up with her boyfriend to come to Min's bedside and takes responsibility for Min's children while Min tries to ""discover"" herself yet again, Cherkis, the children's father, is chased from the family home in one of Min's rages, and the children, Logan and Thebes, are constantly on the alert for Mum's next meltdown, and trying to avoid the realization that they are alone in the world.My next revelation was that these characters, the Troutman family, symbolize the 21st century middle class in Canada, and are so emotionally conflicted and impoverished that they almost come across as freaks: not socially responsible or socialized, leading lives that go from one self-absorbed moment to the next. Thebes does not wash herself but finds pleasure in asking questions prompted by a dictionary, or in making giant gift cheques; Logan is constantly buried under his hoodie with his headphones on, or in a pulp magazine purchased at the last gas station, or is found carving cryptic messages on the dashboard, or shooting hoops on any basketball court that comes his way. The Troutman represent the new poverty class in this country, the poverty of the soul. Is this the legacy of Min and her self-destructive nature?In the end, some break out of this cycle of guilt and others are drawn back into the vortex the moment Min is released from hospital and her whereabouts are unknown. I liked this ending - it's true to life. It says to me that one is never free of these psychotic siblings or parents - they are a curse that you are gifted with until death do you part.I also realized that I prefer the use of quotations marks to indicate dialogue. This book had dispensed with quotation marks and I found that Toews’ conversational narrative style confuses dialogue with narrative at times and forces her to use a lot of unnecessary attributions.Certainly a quick read, but not one of my better ones....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 08, 2010","Mar 17, 2010","Mar 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2940207-the-flying-troutmans

Who would discard this doyen of CanadI picked up this hard cover David Adams Richards novel off a discarded pile in a local library out of curiosity. Who would discard this doyen of Canadian literature, a writer I have had the highest admiration for?Then I realized why. This is a hard book to read because its style is so unique, and unlike the other books of this author that I have read. An omniscient narrator flits around all the characters, twisting and turning them into a plot line that goes around in circles, leaving the characters and the reader dizzy at times. Who is chasing whom? Of course everything fits into place in the end: the good are rewarded, the bad punished, and the lost ones find redemption by sacrificing their lives. The narrator also confidently gives us ps from time to time of what is to come (stay tuned, for the next chapter of...etc.) even going so far as to predict that secretarial skills would be obsolete in 10 years ( as the main action of the book takes place in 1974 – he is pretty close).The terrain is familiar Adams Richards’ land – New Brunswick farm country. The characters are abused, bereaved, lost, drunk and discarded, and invent their own version of morality. Gossip and rumour fly fast in this place, through a powerful internal grapevine, and the guilty (or the supposed guilty) are punished by having their farms burned down by unknown vigilantes.Michael Skid, a privileged kid, son of a judge, falls in with this God-forsaken set of misfits and their charismatic and violent leader, Everette Hutch, and this union leads to a chain of tragic events culminating in a string of murders and suicides. Some of the situations border on implausibility even though the narrator tries hard to convince us that this is so: Michael’s vulnerability and attraction to the fallen, when he has so much going for him. The narrator also takes it upon himself to occasionally throw in new bits of information on the characters that shout “contrived”: Michael’s intention to marry Laura McNair – that news, among many others, comes out of left field.I fully appreciate the author’s original voice, and in not submitting to a proper editing that would have rendered him indistinguishable from many other Canadian writers; for example, I lost count of the number of times he began sentences with “But” or “So” and how often he used the word “suddenly. But his choice of narrator makes this book a very “tell not show” one and I am not sure that he needed to go to such an extreme against the conventions of the novel to provide an outstanding voice.

I took the highway and occasionally strayed off onto the scenic route when I was trying to figure out what was happening on the highway. I suggest the reader of this book dip into the supplementary chapters as well, which the author calls ""expendable chapters"" in order to get the full weight of this rather complex novel.Horacio Oliviera, a replica of Cortazar I take it (Argentinean poet living in Paris - how many are there of this description?) leads a bohemian life in Paris with a bunch of fellow artists, known as The Club, who have nothing better to do than drink, listen to jazz and argue on pointless esoteric subjects, never facing the realities of life. Oliviera is looking for unity, and heaven (his kibbutz, as he calls it), by bringing all the irrelevant strands in his life into focus and finding meaning. He seeks love but is unable to show it to the women in his life: La Maga, the woman he pursues relentlessly, especially after he loses her in Paris (he then goes onto pursue her lookalike Talita in Argentina) and Gekrepten.After standing by impotently while La Maga's baby dies in her flat in Paris, amidst a bunch of arguing intellectuals, Oliviera flees to Argentina and seeks a second chance of finding love in Talita, the wife of his friend Traveler. In his home country, Oliviera alternates between working in a circus (analogous to his former Parisian Club), listening to tango music and being a caretaker of an insane asylum, and finally goes round the bend himself when his quest for unity leads him to concluded that there is very little separating him from the inmates. The ending of the book is not what it seems at the end of the ""highway route"" to reading it, and in continuing on to ""expendable chapters"" 57 and 58, I realized that there was another possible ending.The stream of consciousness narration alternates between first and third person and the English is fluid and rich even for a translation. Some pieces of wisdom are priceless: ""In the name of the past, we carry out the greatest deceits in the present"" and yet the endless intellectual ramblings make other quotes apply to the book itself: ""I can't stand for this garbage,"" Etienne says, ""It's moving, but its garbage."" Some scenes are played out in great detail and act as pivotal anchors to this book that is otherwise loaded with internal monologue and intellectual discourse: Oliviera's visit to aging Bertha Trepat's concert and the aftermath; the gathering of The Club in La Maga's apartment as her infant is dying, everyone is aware of the child's condition but no one wants to face it directly, instead they debate the subject of death; Talita stuck on the makeshift bridge between her apartment and Oliviera's with Oliviera and her husband at either end; Oliviera in his booby-trapped room waiting for ""them"" to come and get him - four scenes with great situational power.This is a layered, heavy book, one that can be read multiple times to extract more meaning every time, and not one for those looking for a fast read....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 24, 2010","Feb 06, 2010","Jan 24, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53413.Hopscotch

After an unexpected development in the Sonora Desert (explained only at the end of the novel), the duo move onto Spain, Israel, Africa and end up back in Mexico. They live a shoestring, nomadic existence - always searching, but never finding, often putting their lives in great danger. And in the end (without giving the ending away,) they find their quest - similar to that of all who seek the holy grail - anti-climactic.Even though I learned nothing much about visceral realist poetry, other than for a few abstract drawings supposed to depict this form of expression, it was the writing that was visceral to me. In one very humorous segment Garcia Madero tries to show off his knowledge of the various poetic meters and definitions while his heroes Belano and Lima, much to his disappointment and chagrin, know nothing about them. They in turn then switch the nomenclature around to ""street-speak"" vernacular and our narrator is in turn left clueless. The only one comprehending Belano and Lima is the prostitute in the car with them who is also sleeping with Garcia Madero at the time - I found the metaphor quite apt.The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 is narrated in the form of a daily journal by a rather pompous academic neophyte, Juan Garcia Madero, a university student into classical poetry, who drops out of academia and middle class life to follow Belano and Lima in their quest. Part 3 continues this odyssey into the Sonora desert and to their epiphany regarding Cesarea Tinajero. However, it is the very long Part 2, aptly titled ""The Savage Detectives"" and detailing Belano and Lima's lives after the events in parts 1 and 3, that I found the most interesting.Part 2 is narrated by the various people (many were from the visceral realist movement that ultimately fizzled) who encountered our heroes in their travels. These observers include prostitutes, academics, alcoholics, poets, inmates of lunatic asylums, journalists, photographers, publishers, drifters, cave dwellers, sword fighters, pimps...the list is endless. We get first-hand insights into the lives of these narrators, with only side glances at Belano and Lima, and this format resembles the Gospels to me - i.e. the main story line of the life of Christ and his followers always observed and narrated by a third party. This narrative ""distance"" enhances the mystique and aura around Belano and Lima without getting us into their heads.Given that the writing is from Roberto Bolano's personal experiences (and it shows)I came away with a huge admiration for the author, for his total absorption in his art despite the toll it took on his life, for his insight into human nature from all angles, and for his very audacious form of writing of the novel. He certainly demolishes literary stereotypes in this very large tome.

This remoteness comes home even when the omniscient narrator refers to white people as Goras. In fact, I had difficulty with this narrator who kept indiscriminately popping in and out of the heads of the characters, both principal and minor alike, reducing them to cardboard cut-outs in places. This was the one flaw in an otherwise well crafted novel with slices of Indian life and dialogue that is fresh, humorous and insightful.The span of the action covers the greater part of the 20th century and many time periods and events in the lives of the characters are skimmed over to zero in only on key ones. Hence we do not hear much of the birth of Nimmo’s daughter Kamal, but we get a drawn out scene of Bibi-ji and Pa-ji’s visit to the school principal to discuss their adopted son Jasbir’s misbehaviour.The private tensions in the lives of the three women are reflections of the wider conflicts facing the newly independent India, both internally between its diverse citizens, and externally with its neighbours, even between its distant exiles in Canada. The indiscriminate loss of life in this conflict also comes home sharply when key people start dropping like flies from chapter to chapter. In the end, the survivors are left bereft and horribly changed and the only person finding redemption from the conflict is Jasbir, the bad apple in the family who left to join the Khalistan rebellion, and finds his way back home after seeing the damage that the movement, its actions and consequences wreak on his own family. When I put this book down, I couldn’t help but feel that as much as the author was humouring me with scenes of domesticity and social intercourse in Indian society both at home and abroad, she was hammering me with some brutal lessons of history that I never got to read about from the inside. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 17, 2010","Jan 24, 2010","Jan 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1224261.Can_You_Hear_the_Nightbird_Call_

A cellist who witnesses the tragedy, and is saddened by the incident resolves, to play Albinoni's Adagio every day for 22 days in the open under threat from snipers. His act is one of hope, proof that there is beauty despite carnage; that life can be different from what it is. This incident is apparently a true record. The novel wraps itself around the cellist’s act and explores the lives of three people during the 22 days of his performance: Arrow, the female sniper who is sent to protect the cellist, Dragan the elderly bakery worker who has sent his family to Italy but remained behind to protect his job, and Kenan the former office worker with a wife and young children, who spends his time trying to carry eight containers of water across town for his family and his ungrateful neighbour.Sarajevo is now an inverted world. Life can be snuffed out at any moment by a random sniper bullet or mortar explosion, food and water is scarce, young people put their lives on hold and assume pseudonyms to defend the city, the rich are profiting from the war while the poor are trampled and randomly shot at, and the political winds shift constantly. Dragging a dead man out of the street under threat of sniper fire is considered victory, carrying expired medications to those in need is social assistance, learning to take a shower with the water one would have used to make a cup of coffee is considered good economics, and placing flowers in the bomb crater besides which the cellist plays is the only way to honour life in this city of death.The people of Sarajevo under siege, remind me of ant colonies - they keep going, and going, When their formations are disrupted by humans or by nature, the ants regroup and continue going about their work; so too do the people of Sarajevo. Dragan observes, ""If the people get content to live with death, Sarajevo will die.""The writing style is lyrical. The opening chapter is pure music - with a repeating chorus line, the action moves from present to past to future tense and ends with that screaming chorus line again.In the end, Galloway drills home the message that hating and fighting fire with fire only ends in death. Dignity for the denizens of Sarajevo lies in not running, in not giving in. Dragan realizes that they need to maintain their dignity and poise, and like the cellist, keep playing despite the mayhem hovering about them.

Greg Mortenson is indeed a Messiah-like figure to the educationally impoverished tribes in the Karakoram and Hindu Kush Ranges on the northern borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, places where self-reliance, tribal norms, family feuds and survival against the elements trump political machinations taking place in Islamabad, Kabul and Washington.Born and raised in an American missionary family stationed in Africa, devoted to his frail sister who passed away at a young age, Greg swears to conquer K2 in her name in the early '90's. He fails and decides to educate the girls of Karakoram and Hindu Kush instead. I am glad he failed to climb K2, because that turning point in his life ignited a beacon to the world that says, ""You fight terrorism with books not bombs.""Greg is the quintessential fringe dweller - neither American, nor Asian, but one who can be comfortable in both worlds without becoming ""of those worlds"". He constantly lives on a shoestring, treating time as circular, a lesson he learned by climbing mountains, and he has the ability to sleep dreamlessly when under the greatest stress. He possesses a remarkable faith in his ability to survive until his mission is complete. His sense of purpose after the K2 debacle is clear - he braves fatwas, bombs, spies, tribal wars, kidnapping, poverty and other obstacles to build schools, one at a time, until he has over 50 of them running, teaching girls literacy up to grade five while the heavily funded fundamentalist madrassas flourish alongside. He is also blessed in his journey by having a supportive wife and family, and sponsors who heed his call when times and finances get rough.My only comment on reading this book was that the author David Relin tended to overtly deify Mortenson either in dialogue or in narrative and I would rather have seen Mortenson's achievements speak for themselves. The unanswered question remains as to whether this quest to educate the next generation will not cause its own pressures between this new generation and the previous illiterate one somewhere down the road and whether Mortenson's organization was taking steps to mitigate this coming conflict.These minor shortcomings aside, this book is certainly an antidote to anti-Americanism and proves that if there were another 50 Greg Mortensons in this world, the war on terror would have been fought with the pen and not the sword....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 30, 2009","Dec 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49436.Three_Cups_of_Tea

There is no expliNabokov declares that Pornography = Obscenity mated with Banality, in order to elevate himself and his novel into the realms of art. There is no explicit obscenity in this book, which is also far from banal. Check. He further goes on to say that he does not write didactic novels but writes purely for aesthetic bliss ( i.e. curiosity, tenderness, kindness and ecstasy), and thus pulls himself out of the seething criticisms that this novel and its subject of pedophilia have been subjected to.All that said, I had difficulty understanding why he selected this subject; his explanation is that it was a recurring ""throb"" that began in 1940 and ended in 1954, when after many attempts, the manuscript was completed. The intensity of feelings and inner thoughts that we are plunged into in his character Humbert Humbert ( HH ), makes me wonder if the author himself was plagued by these obsessions during those years and hopefully only expunged them through the pages of this novel and not via some vulnerable real-life nymphet.This long preamble is to justify not sinking into an all-out attack on the author and his kinky subject, that most readers have done, but to look at the literary merits of this novel. And it is indeed a unique novel. The first person narrative is infused with subtle humour throughout, especially in the most perverted passages. HH goes from obsession for Lolita to delusion by the end of the novel when he feels betrayed and stalked by everyone and the narration skilfully conveys that. In the end, the victim Lolita turns the tables on her captor by cheating on him and escaping with Quilty (who had the makings of a much more deranged character than HH, but we only see Quilty through HH's, by now, delusional eyes, and the image is caricaturish and blurred).Nabokov is a stylist and a linguist and uses great sentence structures and alliteration, and plays with words or derivatives of words for rhythm and sound. One gets the depth of HH's depravity in a chance word or phrase dropped here or there while nothing is revealed overtly. The author also uses an indirect style to deftly convey events going on: e.g. HH's replacement girlfriend Rita getting beaten up while trying to help HH find Lolita, was appended to a part of a sentence, which I nearly missed. The European HH’s treks across America with his American nymphet struck me as a metaphor for Europe conquering virgin North America, or as one reader reversed the observation to say, ""America screwing corrupt old Europe,"" but Nabokov, who does not fancy symbols and allegories, does not admit to either. I found it hard to accept that this story, which had plagued the author for so long, could have just been written with no underlying message but for pure artistic bliss, as Nabokov claims. I would have bought psychological and sexual release being a more of a logical reason if there was no intended metaphor.In the end, although I could not understand his choice, I forgave Nabokov for his topic, his personal demons notwithstanding. After all, Poe and Dante had taken child brides, why not HH? HH's pedophilia should not obscure the fact that he did love his nymphet and cared for her well being, leaving her most of his money. And as much as he warped her life, it was she who broke his heart....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 17, 2009","Dec 11, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7604.Lolita

That pretty much sums up this book.In the process however, we get vivid glimpses of life in Cuba before Castro, of Hispanic immigrants struggling to make it in New York City, of passion, of the fragmentary and vulnerable lives of itinerant musicians aiming for their 15 seconds of fame, and of obsession with drink and sex as a way to drown out depression. I lost count of the number of women Cesar, the elder Mambo King, bedded in this book and I was envious of his glorious “member” which seemed to be the only thing standing (well, almost) while all his other organs had collapsed. The narrative jumps points of view frequently, as if mirroring Cesar’s scattered thoughts, but as there is no plotline as such, just Cesar’s odyssey from Cuba to a hotel in New York, it isn’t hard to follow. We go frequently between Oriente in Cuba to Havana to New York and back. Real life personalities juxtapose with fictional ones – notably Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, and the entire cohort of mambo stars of the ‘50’s and 60’s are mentioned at various times in passing. At one point I wondered whether this was a thinly veiled biography of an actual mambo artist known to the author that had been fictionalized.The Mambo Kings are the Castillo brothers Cesar and Nestor. Cesar is the gregarious, women-hungry, booze hungry elder brother, while Nestor is the introverted, haunted younger sibling pining for one Maria who jilted him in Cuba and has become the muse for all his future musical compositions. They embody the free spirited artist sowing his seed at will vs. the happily married man who has to curb his passions or re-direct them only towards his spouse. The attachment of the brothers to each other is brought full circle when Nestor dies tragically, sending Cesar into a spiral from which he never recovers. In fact, the book may have ended with Nestor’s death, because the second half is really Cesar debasing the virile image we had of him.The style is visceral, dwelling frequently on the size, shapes and colours of women’s pubic hair, the smells and emissions of bodies in heat, the overpowering pleasure that Cesar ( and occasionally Nestor) gives his women as he makes vigorous and passionate love to them, the fat-laden food, and the detritus and danger of living in the slummier parts of Manhattan.We never discover why Cesar was prone to the self-destruction he embarked upon after Nestor passed. Was it his abused childhood that had left him rudderless? Was Nestor the real talent behind the Mambo Kings? Was Cesar feeling guilty for making out in the car the day Nestor went off the road? All we see is Cesar’s overwhelming desire to drown his grief in sex and booze. And in the end, as if to validate that this is not the way to go about reconciliation, we see Cesar, drunk and dying, listening impotently to the sounds of his neighbours, a younger couple, making glorious love, with sounds and all, while all he can do is reminisce and take another drink that is killing him by the sip.This novel is a powerful portrayal of life among immigrant musicians pursuing the American Dream. I would have liked to have seen these characters display more intellect and artistry however – perhaps those qualities may have got them out of the ghetto and into those echelons where people like Desi Arnaz, another Cuban, landed.

Where the search for redemption is their only remaining life force.Dr, Plarr is the central character, a British-Parguayan doctor who sleeps with his patients' wives but loves none of them. He is secretly loyal to the revolution in Paraguay, to which he lost his father, and lives in a border town on the Argentinian side, while his exiled mother overdoses on pastry and sugar in the affluent suburbs of Buenos Aires. Plarr's foil is Fortnum, the Honorary Counsel, a Brit forgotten by his government, consigned to this outpost out of convenience, a drunk and aging man who has fallen in love with his twenty-year old wife Clara, a former prostitute from the town's whorehouse. Clara has slept with every man in town, including Dr. Plarr. She is presently carrying Plarr’s baby although Fortnum is under the impression that it is his own.Revolutionaries from Paraguay flit over the border into Argentina in an attempt to kidnap the visiting US Ambassador, helped with some inside information from Plarr, but they capture Fortnum instead in a mixup. Thus starts the situation where Plarr is forced to save the man he hates and wishes dead. The pressure cooker plot corners the kidnappers, Plarr and Fortnum inside a shack in the barrio, surrounded by police who are determined to kill the perpetrators and rescue the Honorary Counsel. Fortnum and Plarr, and the kidnappers, are forced to face their mortality and come to terms with issues such as their belief in God, in love, and in justice. Often their conversations slump into becoming confessions.Now that I am an older reader of Greene and not in idealistic awe of his work anymore, I found some limitations in this book: the dialogue was excessive went in circles at times, and scenes inside the shack were claustrophobic and resembled debates on the existence of God - as if Greene was trying to come to terms with his own conflicted faith. The metaphors were striking -e.g. Plarr the flawed Christ-like figure, sacrificing himself to save a bunch of sinners. And while the male characters were well drawn, the women lacked the same depth.There were some interesting observations, or Greeneisms as I call them:1) Writing is a cure for melancholy2) There is a Great Church beyond our time and place, not the one on earth3)God has good and evil inside Him, and so do we mortalsNow that I have read most of Greene's ""Catholic"" novels as opposed to his earlier ""entertainments"", I am convinced that he used his later writing to come to terms with his personal estrangement with the Catholic Church, to expose its failings, while affirming his belief that he could still be a good Catholic outside of his Church. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Nov 26, 2009","Nov 14, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/292455.The_Honorary_Consul

The classic story’s main scenes play out in sequence: in the opening Larry divides his farm between his progeny, he cuts out Carolyn, he changes his mind when he believes that Ginny and Rose do not love him and are out to hurt him, he runs out in a mad fury during a raging storm, Harry loses his eyes, Rose and Ginny lust after Harry’s prodigal son, Jess, Ginny poisons Rose - or tries to.The key difference between the two stories is that the villains in the Shakespearean version, Goneril and Regan, are victims in the Smiley version, for Larry sexually abuses his two older daughters. Ginny suppresses the memories but Rose forces them out, and in so doing brings down the farm and splits the family apart.Ginny is an unreliable and timid narrator, as she conceals information from us, given that she has suppressed so much of her own emotions. And her first-person narrative has difficulty in keeping up with such a wide cast of characters; some like Larry, Harry, and Jess make their final exits as footnotes.The men in this story are hardnosed, misogynistic and stubborn to the point of hurting themselves, while the women are stoic, enduring, and ready to counter-attack overtly or covertly. Given that the story sticks so closely to the Shakespearean version, I found the plot predictable at times.In the end, Rose emerges as the heroine, inheriting the farm and singlehandedly trying to run it while her body is under attack from the carcinogens in the land, the resentment she bears towards her father, and crippling debt. The end-result is a telling indictment on farm life under threat to falling revenues, industrialization and changing values. All that said, this is a slow-paced but powerful story that gathers in momentum like the storm that Larry rushes off into. It also proves to me the enduring quality of Shakespeare’s themes – as vividly applicable today as in Elizabethan times. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Oct 24, 2009","Oct 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41193.A_Thousand_Acres

The year is ironic - on the eve of the Great Depression, followed by WWII, after which everything changed forever.The novel reads like a memoir, with each chapter dedicated to the stories of various inhabitants of Green Town, Illinois. We open with the abundance of life gushing through the air and the vegetation and the habits of the town with the advent of summer, which is described in poetic prose ( I forgot that Bradbury was a poet and a science fiction writer - traits that intrude in this very different coming-of-age novel) Douglas and his brother Tom are the eye witnesses and record keepers. They break down their records into (a)ceremonies (rituals and habits) and (b)revelations (insights into human behaviour). The only false note I detected was that these two boys are pretty mature for 12 and 10 years respectively.The rituals are nostalgic: setting up the swing chair in the front porch, making lemonade, ice tea, late night movies, and the distilling of Dandelion wine - a metaphor for bottling up summer so that it can be savoured during the rest of the year. The revelations are equally quaint: old people were always old, conjuring happiness can only lead to sadness, and Douglas' moral of the piece - that you can't rely on things or people because they inevitably break down or die.Some of the scenes are heartwrenching: the dying Colonel Freeleigh calling Mexico and asking the person on the other side to hold the receiver out to the street so that he can relive his time in that country with its cacophonous traffic and teeming humanity, the elderly spinsters and their battery operated 2-seater car the ""Green Machine"" (a bit ahead of its time - may do well these days),Bill Forrester (31) falling in love with a picture of the 20-year old Helen Loomis only to discover that she is 95 years, The ""old-maid"" 32-year old spinster Lavinia Nebbs' terrifying midnight walk across the ravine in fear of being pursued by the Lonely One ( aka Death in the form of a stalker) who is quietly awaiting her at home, The junk man who bottles air and scents from different countries and times to cure our hero Douglas in his moment of extremis.

I have to grant the author credit for venturing into these contentious areas. In his words, he is ""burning down the house."" Some of the issues raised, points made, or just left to our judgement are:1) Plot driven vs. Epiphanic story - the author seems to argue that despite the majority of post WWII literature being epiphanic (50%-80% since 1940), and with most short stories falling into this category, epiphanic does not work for him because none of his epiphanies have come true.2) Outrage sells, the truth is boring. I can't disagree with him here - read a newspaper these days - where does the truth lie?3) Ever since Nixon said ""mistakes happened"", instead of ""I made a mistake,"" there are no defined heroes and villains any more. Talk show audiences are expected to ""vote"" on the villains of the piece, and villainy is a matter of taste.4) Setting should not mirror the mood of the character in it. Settings should have a life of their own. I therefore conjured up an image of the mass murderer out killing everyone in the park, while the sun shines, the butterflies fly from flower to flower, and the birds sing.5) Plot needs not form only by conflicting characters but by contrasting or counterpoint characters.6) Poets are like butterflies, while prose writers are dull worker bees. Poets prophesy backward, returning in a circular fashion to the deja vu. Prose writers are constantly observing every facet of you so that they can place you in their next fiction.7) Punishment and suffering are narratively more picturesque than pleasure, Paradise is what happens when the story is over.8) Melodrama is associated with plot. But melodrama engages and informs where mere words fail.9) Cynicism is hypocritical - it enjoys what it claims to despise. Hemingway was a cynic.Cynicism's second cousin is irony.10) The Unconscious vs the Sentimental Artist - to the former art is natural and uncompromised by self-analysis, to the latter (apparently all MFA's fall into this category) human emotion is analysed to death and placed on a scale similar to music, to be selected when appropriately required. I could imagine a sentimental writer, dipping into his arsenal of scaled human emotions and taking out a pinch of cynicism, a touch of bitterness, a slice of of anger and a hint of gloom to portray a character suffering from depression. Depressing! 11) Writing about happinness, stillness, and silence, where atmosphere transplants action, is the last frontier for the imagination.12) Defamiliarization - making the familiar strange and the strange familiar. These were engaging topics. However, at times I found the author straying off the central argument to cover several anecdotal examples before returning to make his point, and this made the reading difficult.Perhaps he falls into that category of Unconscious Artist, although I suspect he comes form the Sentimentalist school....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Oct 17, 2009","Sep 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/136349.Burning_Down_the_House

Given that Michael Collins is an Irish emigre who has written some splendid Irish literature, I wondered whether he was out of his depth here or has as yet earned the write to write from the inside about this milieu?Lawrence, the protagonist and narrator, is the most lost of the Lost Souls in this book, and the author takes a risk in having such a loser (with a heart) carry this story.A four-year old child is found dead on a sidewalk amidst a pile of fallen leaves during Halloween, and so begins the unravelling of the lives of key players in a small town: from mayor to police chief to police officers to star football player and his girlfriend to high school principal to the victims themselves. Lawrence himself is a broken man: the victim of a broken marriage, he is severely in debt, overworked, underslept and alternating between alcohol and caffeine. The child's death plunges him into a deep depression, part of which manifests in strange and sometimes violent behaviour that not only compromises the investigation, but lands him in some pretty hot water.I couldn't help but believe that if there was even a bunch of average cops handling this investigation, according to proper police procedure, there would have been no novel - the perpetrators would have been uncovered and the mystery solved by chapter 3, because the crime itself was not that elaborate. But we have instead our angst-ridden Lawrence leaving misleading trails and confusing even his lawyer, a vengeful and prejudiced investigator named Bains determined to take Lawrence down as a scapegoat for his own ommissions, and the town leaders trying to cover up the whole episode.Lawrence's aimless wanderings about town, and across the country, partially to escape his own demons, leads to a rambling and disjointed storyline; periodic introductions of new information also takes the investigation along different paths at different times. The pathos is overdrawn and happy people may find this book difficult to stomach.In the end, the mystery unravels, just about. But a whole lot of characters fade away into the ether - Bains, the police chief,Earl,and the dead girl's mother Lisa Kendall. Lawrence's fate is undetermined too given that he is finally left facing charges of fraud, covering up a criminal investigation, and blackmail. Even the Amish, who are used frequently as a backgdrop, do not fully enter or play a role in the narrative.As a detective story this book fails ( but I don't think Collins writes detective fiction),however as a tale of hopelessness with a glimmer of hope in the end, it succeeds. It also falls into the class of novel, just like with modern short stories, where everything does not get resolved and tied with a neat bow in the end.

Of the three female protagonists, the grandmother Lorna and mother Molly emerge, play their roles in centre stage, and exit rather suddenly and it is left to daughter Ruth to tie the loose ends and bring the novel to its circular close.The character's lives are probably echoed in many women who lived during this period, but it is in the telling that this story comes alive. Lorna loves beneath her social class, falls for the engraver Matt, spends a few idylic years with him in a farmhouse which Matt adorns with frescos celebrating their love life, and loses him to the battle for Crete. Molly has an affair with a benevolent boss and art collector, gives birth to Ruth, but never marries her lover, because she does not love him. Ruth marries and has two children but in an age when divorce has become easier, leaves her husband and her loveless marriage to live an independant life. All three women find love eventually with other men, but not without long periods of aloneness and a dawning of self-awareness in-between. There are parallels between the women too - all of them are attracted to men of the arts, all find work in and around the arts and all are surrounded from start to end by step-grandad Lukas and his aging printing press that becomes the fulcrum of their lives.The author's style is unconventional, as tenses are juxtaposed, second and third person narratives are mixied, dialogue is intellectual and loaded with social commentary, and passive voice is used frequently - all ""bad habits"" that writing schools tell us to avoid - but here it seems to work - which reminds me of the newer adage, ""If it works - use it!"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2009","Sep 24, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/202880.Consequences

Lippman skillfully paints the maternal instincts, the loneliness and the isolation of a sex worker who is fast coming to the end of her shelf-life.These stories should be read for pure entertainment and Lippman never fails to deliver in that department.

That said, the narratives have interesting insights into life lived between the Caribbean, Europe and Africa.The first part - Prologue to an Autobiography -reconciles Naipaul with his father. The elder Naipaul was also a writer, a journalist in Trinidad, who bound by circumstances, geography, a tiny and fragmented population,superstition, discrimination and all the other restrictions of a small colonial island, never realized his potential. His son achieved literary greatness (including the Nobel prize for literature) by leaving the nest and forever travelling the world thereafter to record his experiences and try to re-discover home. Some of Naipaul's interesting observations include: 1) The colonial writer lives in historical darkness 2) The colonial writer is spared knowledge, unlike his English and French counterparts. He writes to learn. Every prior book appears to heve been written with less knowledgeThe second narrative - The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro - takes place in the former French colony of Ivory Coast in Africa. The ruler builds roads to connect villages to the capital and transforms his own village, Yamoussoukro, into a palatial white elephant, replete with luxury hotel, royal palace, golf course and...a pond for live crocodiles who have to be fed several times a day, No one knows why the crocodiles are there, but several have theories - only the ruler knows! And therein lies Naipaul's dissection of the differences between the African and his colonial rulers:1)The cult of the personality works better than democracy in Africa2)Marriages are between families, not couples, and infidelity is acceptable3) When a man dies, his wives and servants must be buried with him4) The good life is on earth. The spirit world is a tough one with no money, no heat, no food and no clothes5)The European only inhabits the world of the day (work, earning a living, the pre-occupation with material things ) whereas the African inhabits both the world of the day and the world of the night (the world of spirits and magic)6) When an old man dies, a library burns downNaipaul is bold in recording and telling the stories of the people he meets on his travels, even exposing their prejudices and fears. I wonder whether his hosts would have been leery in inviting him for fear of their privacy. In this African sojourn, he associates with locals, expats and a number of West Indians who have come back to mother Africa via their common colonial parent country, England or France.I found the second narrative a good primer on the Ivory Coast, an area of the world I know so little about....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Sep 07, 2009","Aug 30, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54158.Finding_the_Center

I think the premise of this macabre parody of human endeavour is that we are in this life to suffer and die, that earth is only a processing plant for Paradise (or Venus, as it is portrayed in the book?).I think this premise is as old as the Bible, but what a way Plahniuk chooses to tell us this: replete with olfactory emissions, rotting bodies, barf,shit, blood (lots of it) dismembered body parts, sucked-out guts, cannibalism, mass emigration ( i.e. extermination) and every other rotten thing he can think of. I was reminded of the Marquis de Sade and Hitler in an orgy, trying to see who could outdo the other.A group of off-beat writers are lured into a writers retreat where they are locked up (or they lock themselves up, believing it will add to their mystique) for three months and asked to recount their stories. In between, their numbers start to decrease as their stories and their life at the retreat blur. Their behaviour becomes more bizzare and after awhile the format of narration-poem-story becomes repetitious. I skipped some of the stories because they all end in some form of bizarre entrapment.I continued reading the book because I was partly curious as to why a writer would choose these devices, why a publisher would publish this material, and most of all, why readers would read this stuff, making Palahniuk a best selling author - are we a bunch of closet coldhearted, bloodthirsty voyeurs? Is this what literature has to descend to in order to be read?The characters are wooden cardboard cut-outs, who feel no pain or sympathy for either themselves or for their fellow writers. They mutiliate themselves or their colleagues, starve, incarcerate and murder for celebrity and money. Most importantly, they do not seem to have any souls.I wondered how the survivors remained alive without food, heat, and having lost so much blood and so many body parts. Despite all this suffering, intended to resemble our stay on earth, I suppose, at the end of the book, the survivors remain trapped in their self-imposed prison, still waiting for their fame and fortune to arrive.The writing is jerky and indirect. I wondered if Palahniuk was trying to imitate an assortment of wannabe writers and their styles - a slippery slope, because one wonders if the author himself has gaps in his writing ability.There was just too much sickening and inhuman behaviour going on that after 250 pages, I had to skip to the final chapter.

Lobo flees the priesthood due to corruption in the Church, becomes an investigative journalist in Goa and Bombay, drinks, frequents prostitutes and tries desperately to stifle his bi-sexual instincts. He travels to Canada to cover Expo 67, falls in love during the flower power and free love era in North America but is drawn back to complete that “unfinished business’ back home. Through this tightly woven storyline, Antao brings us into the world of the tormented priest – one who is strong-willed in places, then weak, then lost, then damned, again revived and placed on the redemption trail, only to be brutally shoved back into a private hell for having abandoned God in the beginning. Much of the narrative takes place in Lobo’s head and he is isolated from people because every time he opens his mouth to have a discussion, he seems to be drawn back to his pre-occupation with God and the Church. I think that Antao is bold to take on the Catholic Church for their now publicly known sexual misdeeds; at the same time he hedges his bet in having his renegade priest get his comeuppance for having transgressed his holy vows.Writing about metaphysical manifestations in novels is okay as long as they are presented through the lenses of certain characters, I think. When Antao brings in those creepy crawly demons into straight narrative sections (prologue and epilogue) or when Sandra, Lobo’s Canadian girlfriend and an atheist, also wakes up to see Lobo’s nemesis, the God-light, illuminating their bedroom and hears the same ghostly voice that repeatedly tells Lobo “I love you”, I think we as readers are being forced into a belief frame that we may not all buy into. It shifted the focus for me from literary fiction into another genre that I find difficult to classify. I would rather Antao have kept the demons and God-voices with Lobo himself and not intruded with his own authorial, moralistic scene-painting.That said, Antao gives us nostalgic and vivid descriptions of Canada in the ‘60’s when prospective immigrants had to be coaxed to reside here rather than have to go through the act of “getting through the eye of the needle” that it is today, when sex had no stigma of AIDS, and when the Toronto Zoo was not in its present location. There are also detailed descriptions of the ordination process for priests, vivid images of Old Goa, and of Bombay when it had only four million residents. And of course, there is always the sex...The writing is fluid, the scenes move fast and I was able to read this book in a couple of sittings.

Eadie and Mrs. Golson too had once dressed up as a man and woman to go out to a part of town where single women were frowned upon, and this event is seared across Eudoxia’s memory.

In France, Mrs. Golson spots the youthful “Mrs. Vatatzes” from afar and lusts after her. Pelletier, the newspaper vendor by the beach spots Mrs. Vatatzes swiming nude and lusts after her. Even Mr. Golson has his eye on “her.” And poor aging Mr. Vatatzes, who was faithful to his first wife, now dead, fears that he will lose his youthful male lover. And Eudoxia is frustrated because Angelos cannot reciprocate his passion, because “Passion and lust are as necessary as a square meal.”That’s as far as I got. Why? Because the book seems to go around in a circle of confused gender, sexuality and identity. And masturbation is the only release for these self-indulgent and self-absorbed characters. The scenes are set pieces where someone is recollecting, spying on or visiting someone else.

Of course, none of what Bradbury predicted happened but this altered reality is a great place to visit as a reader.The '50's pre-occupation with the invasion of TV, its negative impacts on the reading of books, and the expansion of the Cold War drive the events in this novel.Montag is a fireman with a twist: one who starts fires, not put them out. He and his crew specializes in burning books and the dwellings that house them. A giant mechanical hound (modelled on the Hound of the Baskervilles) is programmed to wipe out miscreants - a.k.a. book readers - and nuclear wars begin and end quickly with devastating effects. Consequently suburban denizens are programmed to think only of having fun - like driving their cars maniacally along streets and killing pedestrians, or staring at the four walls of their parlours which project interactive TV, where even the viewers have roles in the programmes. The absolute emptiness of peoples' lives is brought home sharply when there are mobile stomach pumpers patrolling the streets to quickly evacuate stomachs of people who have overdosed on tranquilizers. Montag's observation, ""crying at the thought of not crying over the death of his wife"" indicates the utter alientation of people from each other, even spouses.And meanwhile, marginalized intellectuals (former professors and academics) hide out in forests and shanty-towns, having memorized the classic books of history and literature, waiting for when the nuclear wars decimate the bad guys and create a vaccume that can be filled again with books and knowledge. Montag decides to cross over to this side and faces the dire consequences of losing everything he has and being reduced to quarry of the dreaded Hound.The writing is frenetic and Bradbury gets you not only to feel the tension but to taste and smell it too. He also introduces great lines of wisdom:""Those who don't build must burn"" ""Happiness does not grow upon happiness. Flowers need the black earth to grow""""Good writers touch life often. Bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.""There are the usual plausibility issues, especially when we have lived an alternate reality these last 50 years and are now supposedly resident in the very time when the events in Fahrenheit 451 takes place. I had several questions:1) How did Montag learn to read when books had been outlawed before he was born?2) Why is his annual salary only $6,000 as a well paid fireman with a stay-at-home wife? Hadn't Bradbury figured on inflation? And had he concluded that women (without children) would continue to be content as housewives and not join the workforce?3) How come evenly matched nuclear powers actually hurled bombs at each other rather than use their weapons for deterrence?However, I was willing to forgive Bradbury the soothsayer, and embrace Bradbury the novelist - he has crafted a great novel and tour-de-force of imagination.

Her interest in place and architecture was the theme of that presentation. Place and architecture also seems to predominate in this book. It tells the story of a withdrawn middle-aged woman, Sylvia, married to a doctor who treats her more as an interesting patient than a wife, and of her supposed love affair with Andrew Woodman, who in an advanced stage of Alzheimers falls and dies in the freezing St.Lawrence River near her home. Given Sylvia's phobia of not wanting to be touched - her ""condition"" as explained by her husband - one wonders whether the love affair ever happened or whether it spung from Sylvia's imagination, as the good doctor claims. The writing leaves both options open to conjecture depending on how romantic or objective one is. Sylvia befriends the young artist Jerome, who discovered Andrew's body a year previous, and through a recounting and sharing, the two find a connection: Jerome sees his mother trying to escape the tyranny of his drunken father in Sylvia, while Sylvia finds a person to unburden her feelings that have been locked inside for many years.The long middle section of the novel is a history of Andrew's family (and not necessarily of Andrew), and it is here that I found the author straying into recording perhaps her own family's history in the area without too much concern for her readers and for the story of the novel - which I though was all about Sylvia and Andrew, with Jerome as catalyst. Being a resident of the area, I found the history behind the sinking hotel in the sand dunes of Sandbanks Provincial Park interesting, but I am not sure who else would have. There was also a lot of ""telling"" in this section with very little dialogue and character painting.The author repeatedly uses the technique of suddenly dropping in a character or event, and then peeling back the layers to reveal who these characters are, or how the event occured. It interrupts flow and takes getting used to.This is not Urguhart's strongest novel, although it's her most recent. Having enjoyed ""Stone Carvers"" and ""The Underpainter"" very much, I could not help but feel as I put this book down, that upon earning the distinction of becoming a national literary treasure in Canada, Urquhart was writing what she wanted to record, free of the scutiny and questioning of editors and publishers, and expecting her readers to come along for the ride whether they liked it or not....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 15, 2009","Aug 23, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/430850.A_Map_of_Glass

His science fiction anthology Dangerous Visions was often mentioned in the program. I could not get the book at the library by instead found ""Again, Dangerous Visions"" - the sequel ( I believe even a third anthology was compiled due to its popularity at the time). I read a dozen stories from the 46 presented in the sequel, and it gave me my dose of speculative, edgy fiction that was termed the ""new science fiction"" of the time.It was quaint reading SF written in the late sixties, where several of the predictions have now become ""science fact"" - including propositions that children would sue their parents for improper upbringing, the frustrations of navigating the labyrinthine confines of a super-department store in search of sexual aids (some of these aids haven't been invented yet, I believe), executing children after the maximum two-child limit had been reached (didn't many unoficial executions take place in parts of the world where ""one child"" was the limit, leaving us with the legacy today of a nation of spoilt children?)Many of the writers -juxtaposed between a few heavyweights like Ray Bradbury and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. - were newbies at the time, in their twenties and thirties, some being published for the first time in this anthology. Ellison is generous in giving each writer a personally written copious introduction (the most revealing parts of the book, I think) and lots of praise, and affording each writer an afterword at the end of his/her story. Some writers needed the afterword as their stories were'nt very coherent to me. One writer actually said that he set out to confuse and frustrate the reader! What happened to entertaining, educating and enlightening us?Nevertheless, in an era when the Internet was still a closely guarded military secret, and online forms of shameless self-promotion were not available to the writer, Ellison tirelessly goes out to beat the bushes on behalf of his authors, doing his bit to grow the next generation of SF writers, revealing frank stories about how he met his contributors, nutured them, browbeat them when required, and extracted their best work from them. One writer was so overcome that she wrote Harlan a note back saying ""F... you Harlan Ellison you don't know so goddam much"". She was still published and I'm sure that more than a few careers were made subsequently.What threw me off was the rough writing - inelegant prose in exchange for mind bending premises. It was hard to find a writer, perhaps Vonnegut was the exception, who combined clear prose with an intriguing premise.

Our western sensibilities would be outraged that such a bastard is the hero, but Adiga sends a searing statement that crime pays, that in order to be a successful businessman in India you need to be a crook, you need to pay bribes, you need to wipe out competitors uncrupulously and you need the cops in your pocket - and therefore Balram is your new Indian hero! And yet, Balram admits that he is sitting on a powder keg that can erupt at any time and topple the order of privilege, sending him back to the ""Darkness.""All this however, is told in a humourous epistolatory letter by Balram to none other than the premier of China (that other great Asian Tiger)on ""how to become an entrepreneur in 7 days"". It's a sit-down read, with Balram's chatty, cynical and colourful observations of life in India, constantly punctuating the action. The scenes come across from the servant's viewpoint, where he is not privy to everything in sequence, as he has to focus on his duties or his driving and has to later assemble the pieces together to make sense out of them. I strayed from giving this book a fifth star because I felt that some of the scenes and characters were exagerated, almost to caricature, to give us effect. I mean, drivers who do not know what a cell phone is, give me a break! I was in Sri Lanka last year ( a southern neighbour who is a bit more impoverished than India these days, because unlike India, S.L. had the ability to launch an internal civil war to try and right some of its wrongs) and even the trishaw drivers in that country had cell-phones - it was their way of being available 24/7.There are no redeeming features about India in this book, if there were, they were lost amidst the pile of inequities and injustices that seem to plague that country. Balram talks of ""revolution"" many times, but the country is so varied and fragmented that it's in complete stasis. Or perhaps, all the US and European countries who have made India their manufacturing plant, will launch a military attack (making Iraq and Afghanistan look like tea parties) to protect their assets and quell any unrest if it ever occurs.I wished that Adiga had balanced off his India with some of her redeeming features. To dismiss the mother ship as ""what a fucking joke"" was another reason for my witholding that remaining star. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 20, 2009","Aug 15, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1768603.The_White_Tiger

Davidson adheres to the requirements of agents and publishers of today: make your characters and your situations extreme, then make them even more extreme!All that said, The Gargoyle is an intriguing story of unrequited love spanning the ages, journeying through a version of Dante's Inferno as one of the lovers, Marianne, translates The Inferno into German, while her guy, the unnamed narrator, lives it. The two main story lines - the Engelthal story in the 14th century and the modern day one - weave in and out nicely, punctuated with four shorter stories to support them. The various historic periods and locations, from the Vikings of the ninth century to the Victorian era, and not forgetting the realities of today's burn victims, are well researched and drawn.Despite this being a love story, I found Marianne to be detached and dispassionate, especially when narrating her stories from the past - even her voice changed at those times. The narrator too ( I wish he had a name) looks upon his predicament with wry amusement and cynicism most of the time and the couple lacked passion together despite their 700 years of anticipation, and despite the guy missing some important body parts; they just seemed to go on tolerating each other's eccentic behaviour with the odd flash of temper.There was a sense of contrivance because Marianne acts as puppet master: she knows all the answers and knows how everything will end, while her burnt-out lover does not, and as a reader I felt strung along. It would have been more convincing if they were both discovering their past together (along with us readers) and uncovering love at its base. The make-up of the male lover (i.e The Gargoyle) is also an amalgam of convenience for the author: I had difficulty reconciling a coke sniffing porno actor with a frequenter of libraries and an anal-retentive student of matters scientific and medical. Now that I have got my beefs out, let me conclude by saying that this book is a page turner for those looking for a rollicking good yarn. At that level, I enjoyed it very much. I reserve judgment that this is a literary novel although the author shows potential that he could produce one. Perhaps winning the lottery with the huge advance for this novel (which comes up every time this book is discussed and seems to cause many writers distress - come on guys, give Andrew a break - he turned the tables on the publishers, for once!) will give him the time to focus on things literary for his next effort.I will look forward to reading his next book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 29, 2009","Jul 11, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2595138-the-gargoyle

Bidaoui's prescriptive book is realistic because he does not claim to be one of those people who used positive thinking, became a millionnaire overnight, and now peddles his magic formula to us plebes who do not get it. He is an immigrant who hit the wall more than a few times and continues to toil his way with insights learned the hard way.He also uses the scientific composition of the brain and its function to justify the actions he recommends us take in order to lead more successful lives.

Yet, Bidaoui's distilling of all this advice into digestible bits, rationalized by the brain and its workings, helps to understand the concepts rather easily.A few ideas that struck and stayed with me:1) Survival being the main motivator in our lives2) The three drivers of behaviour - money, safety and procreation (while I had been banking on Maslow's hierarchy of needs). I still think that self-actualization needs to be in there somewhere, otherwise why do writers write in order to reach immortality?3) Mankind's polarized struggle between Eternity and Extinction. The former leads to success, the latter leads to death4) The Unconscious Mind - a more powerful and capacious entity than the Conscious Mind. It made me compare a computer's hard disc and RAM with these two entities5) ""Change the direction of your imagination and it will change the direction of your life"" - very good advice. As a writer, I tend to travel through Dante's Inferno more often in search of material for my novels than travel up to his Paradiso where I could live a much happier life.I enjoyed this book, particularly as I am going through a rather rough patch at the moment - hitting that wall, as Bidaoui has done and circumnavigated so many times.I would recommend this book to anyone trying to figure out that ""next chapter,"" whether in their book or in their life.

Thus all the character’s have alter ego’s – Mala has her child personality Pohpoh, Otoh was once a girl and is now becoming a man but not quite, narrator Tyler discovers that he is gay and likes to cross-dress, Ambrose goes from a sleepy man to an energetic force after he is released from his guilt. The tale of incest, child abuse and manslaughter takes place in a town called Paradise on a fictitious Caribbean island named Lantanacamara (which I take is Trinidad). Even the colonial mother country, which seems to be England, gets a new moniker: Shivering Northern Wetlands – how original! But Canada is mentioned towards the end of the book– so I guess, Canada grounds this story in reality. Mala and her sister are abused by their father Chandin, a budding preacher, who in turn was cheated by his wife when she outed as a lesbian and took off to the Shivering Northern Wetlands with her lover and the daughter of Chandin’s boss. One argues who is the victim here: Chandin, or Mala who has to bear the burden of her mother’s absence?The violence is brutal when it happens, the sex is bold, and the descriptions of scents and tastes—both from nature and of humans—are heavy and palpable. The story unfolds in five segments, alternating between the present when Mala is consigned to an old age home, and the past when she was a child before her mother fled and sank the family into dysfunction. And yet we traverse a narrative arc that is dramatic and unrelenting. Mootoo uses a variety of devices: the town folk as a chorus to give us valuable back-story in places, the heavy Caribbean accents for verisimilitude, the cereus as a metaphor for the pursuit of redemption amidst the darkness surrounding Mala, rapidly shifting points of view to denote Mala’s split personality, especially as her dark secret is unearthed in the family home on Hill Side.There is redemption in the end, but the characters in the drama are forever scarred but left boldly enjoying what little they have left of their flawed lives.

The language is ""Southern"" and I am hoping that an English translation is issued one day - might make for easier reading for us not from down Deep-South.I also realised why driving a plot with sparse narrative is difficult. Faulkner's almost sole reliance on stream of consciousness introspection and dialogue makes for very slow progress of the story line, although the multiple narrators cause three-dimensional views of the same scene to play out.There are no nice people in this book, just dirt poor ones, conditioned by their harsh environment, and Faulkner is convincing in drawing out these characters.As a writer, I have often been asked by writing groups with whom I have workshopped my material, to change a word or two, or to clarify a sentence here and there to make it easier for them to understand. And I have meekly complied at times. I don't think Faulkner was ever exposed to this scrutiny, or even if he was, I can see him saying,""If ya don' git it, git a holt of another book.""

Good attempt, I thought - but not quite. The novel weaves from various first person accounts (mostly Bolden's and some unknown people), to third person accounts (also of Bolden and some of his buddies) of the two years before his mental breakdown while playing in a parade. His decline in the mental institution where he was subsequently incarcerated for almost 24 years receives only a few pages. And the chronology of the story hangs on medical records, interviews, photographs, and other loose family records of Bolden, all woven in at strategic points to give context to the scenes. Bolden's voice gets mixed up with the author's poetic voice at times, and I wondered whether this was deliberate or accidental.The traditionalists would argue whether this is a novel at all - it's too short for one thing, about 150 pages - and some pages are one liners. There is little character development beyond Bolden and Webb, and even there, they just fade away, unresolved. What about the five-stage structure, tense, POV, movement, balance yadda, yadda, yadda? On closer inspection, one could argue that there is a narrative arc, hidden in there somewhere, and that there are multiple points of view, with lots of movement, and there is also (most importantly) a tragic hero on his journey to extinction. And taking the liberty of the poet, Ondaatje plummets deep into emotion, using punctuation, words, and sentence structures like improvised jazz. I even thought of a new title as I read: ""Being Bold with Bolden.""So why do I say, ""not quite""? I wished Ondaatje had extended his book by 50 more pages and rounded off some of his characters and shown us their learning and transformation through the tragic life of Bolden, I wished he had blown up some scenes that were ripe with promise - Bolden's homecoming to Nora, for example, or his original attraction to Robin.

An enviable position to be in and not have to risk the inevitable rejection letter from a publisher who wanted more of the same that sold. At one point she even celebrates the unpublished or self-published writer by saying ""while fame impedes and constricts, obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded.""That said, Orlando is, in my mind, Woolf herself, taking a bold romp through history, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan to Edwardian times, free of the limitations of thinking in a particular sex, yet being bound by the conventions of his/her times depending on when Orlando was either a man or a woman - all the while letting us experience life in those particular times through the lenses of Orlando's thougths and through his/her biographer's descriptions and ruminations. Woolf's descriptioons of changing landscapes (London going from a clump of derelict buildings and muddy streets in Elizabethan England to a modern metropolis during the Restoration), political systems, customs (wearing a ring and being married became prominent during Victorian times), food ( crumpets and muffins were invented in the 19th century), women's sizes (""slim was in"" in Edwardian London),speech (evasive conversation was espoused in Victorian England) are told in rich flowing prose that does not stint in its use of dashes and semicolons. Time transitions take place during sleep, thinking or while on a long voyage at sea, where our hero(ine)remains unaged (albeit, at times sex changed) as the world changes around her.The pompous biographer that Woolf chooses as her device for rendering the story is also a free spirit, free to comment, jump from place to place, ruminate and sidebar - all needed in order to render a story of this vast time sweep.I wouldn't read this novel for entertainment, but rather as a study of what experimental fiction must have been in Woolf's day. My one regret is that with all this going for her ( no rejection slips, write whatever she wanted) our dear Virginia had to load herself up with stones and drown herself in a river. Oh, if she would only know the travails of the writer, let alone the experimental one, of today!

They are caring, sexless, non-mysoginistic, non-self destructive and anti-yuppie, who don't really provide us an alternative lifestyle that is compelling. They just drift and tell stories - benign throwbacks to Kerouac's beat generation.What catches attention is the intense language and the plethora of new words emanating from this generation. It is almost as if the author sat down and deliberately fused or combined words from our existing lexicon to produce new ones that mirrored the alienation of these people who had stopped the bus and got off: underdogging, paper rabies ( hypersensitivity to littering), nutritional slumming, Armanism ( derived from Georgio Armani), poorochondria (hyperchondria attached to not having medical insurance), lessness etc., are some in the huge catalog of new words that sustain the book.That said, telling stories is a tough way to show and not tell, and despite some of the narrators' lyrical styles and metaphotic imagery, this device wears thin after awhile.However, we see the emergence of a brave new writer here in Coupland who, in this book, has stretched the boundaries of the traditional novel.

Choy paints a rather grBeing an immigrant myself, who came to Canada in the '80's, I was interested in reading this book from a personal perspective. Choy paints a rather grim picture of Chinese immigrants in Canada in the 1930's: bachelor-men unable to bring their families across, deaths in labour camps built to construct the Canadian railway ""from sea to shining sea"", ""resident alien"" status with no hope of ultimate citizenship, second-class treatment during medical emergencies, immigrants relegated to ghettos (or Chinatowns - perhaps the segregation of immigrants is the genesis for a Chinatown and not the notion that Chinese like to hang out together).And yet by the 1980's, the mood for immigration was much more open and tolerant, and the new Chinese have enjoyed much success in this country. I am glad that Choy captured this moment in time to remind us how far we have progressed as a nation.The perspective of a child is always a clever device to employ, especially when the adult world is the focus. This view distorts our adult imperfections, it sees beauty behind physical infirmities (as in the case of seven-year old First Sister Jook Leong's attachment to the deformed Monkey King), it does not comprehend illogical adult actions (eight-year old Sek Lung's struggle to understand the secret adult whispers and the tragic result of Meying's romance with the taboo Japanese boy Kaz), and it fears the budding appetites in their emerging adult bodies (Second Brother Jung Sum's fearful discovery of his attraction to Frank, the young boxer, in the heat of a fight).We also see the impact of war on the young: First Brother Kiam wants to join the Canadian army even though he does not qualify as a resident alien; Sek Lung practises war games with his toys and is an expert on military strategy; and Japanese immigrant kids are suddenly considered ""the enemy"". Only Miss Doyle, the school teacher, treats all her students equally, perhaps a symbol of the Canada to come, even though she exerts military discipline in class, and reads aloud the letters of her dead brother who was blown up while trying to save lives. Also brought into sharp focus is the superstition and cruelty of the old world that is never quite left behind. Grandma Poh Poh was an abused child, is unable to display affection, openly proclaiming that girls are ""nothing"", until Third Brother Sek Lung (he with the sick lungs - a play of words here?) is born and becomes her “baby”; the bed-wetting Jung Sum discovers his birth mother murdered by his father in Kamloops, and finds his sensuality awakened only when he gets a beating at the hands of his mentor Frank; the ghosts that are supposed to roam the neighbourhood in China also inhabit Sek Lung when he sees his dead grandmother during various ""incidents"". And yet the children want to be Canadian while their parents tread the half-and half world of the immigrant and grandma Poh-Poh will always be Chinese.There is some predictability in the end, especially as this book is set in Vancouver. We Canadian's are unable to escape the collective guilt for incarcerating our Japanese immigrant community during the war, and much has been written on this subject. And sure enough, Choy zeroes on this event for his climax, in an otherwise episodic book. The interesting twist is that ""the Japanese incident"" is viewed from a Chinese perspective and, for a change, the Chinese, the Canadians and the Americans are allies, for they had all been invaded by ""those Japs"". The children seem to understand this part of adult logic, which frightens me, and makes me wonder if we adult Canadians were behaving like kids during the Japanese incarceration? Was this Choy's ultimate message that seems to get lost amidst all the other mini stories that make up this very easily readable and fluidly written book?...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 27, 2010","Mar 08, 2010","May 30, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/259562.The_Jade_Peony

And yet he was a formative influence on me as a writer. The book reinforced to me that ""dialogue is everything"", nobody wins, but everyone changes, punctuation needs to be used for rhythm, actions are harder to describe indirectly but are more powerful when done that way, word repetitions are okay if they create effect, passive voice for scene setting is okay, and sentences that run along like this one are great - all taboos with today's writing schools and editors. To his credit, Hemingway may have pleased the pundits with his technique, which is 99% show rather than tell.Many of the scenes in this collection centre around a bar or restaurant with plenty of alcohol to oil the wheels. The time shift in a scene set in a Swiss restaurant, a scene that seems to repeat itself over and over again, is only indicated by the changing of the room's decor. Normal people are contrasted with conflicted ones,the horrors of war are described in indirect but dramatic detail (the dead always have out-turned pockets and papers scattered abouth them, in addition to flies), teenagers have sex in the woods and the reader discovers this only in the dialogue occuring around the event. Hemingway is audacious by having the characters in a story set in Wyoming run through most of their dialogue in French - however the structure and content was such that this anglophone got it!He frequently uses a panoramic viewpoint, focussing on an entire scene before zooming down to a character's POV within it - very cinematic. And his characters sometimes do not have names, nor are we clear of their sex - all part of his minimalistic technique. But he is still able to create memorable atmoshere out of the most original situations: the shell-shocked soldier roaming the battlefront, the couple breaking-up in a Paris restaurant, the boy and his father hunting in the woods, the scavenging sailor seeking his pot of gold in a wreck just out of reach, the three whores in a railway station, the self-absorbed bullfighter, the gambler suffering from gangerene with a bullet in his belly, and the nun praying to God that her favourite baseball team wins.I felt liberated reading this book and wanted to raise a glass with Papa Hem (if he was still alive) saying, ""Damn those who try to teach us to write.

Several years later a fatter, younger bucher from Australia returns to England to claim his identity and property as the missing Sir Roger. What follows is a string of trials, civil and criminal, a people's movement called the Tichbornites, renewed interest in the Magna Carta, Oliver Cromwell and the proletariat, speciality newspapers, broadsides (songs written on single sheets and used mainly at public executions - the Victorian version of bestsellers!), bills in Parliament, the rise and fall of politicians and the Claimant's ( as the Autralian butcher claiming to be Sir Roger was called) steady decline into prison and death as a pauper.Pity there was no DNA testing available at the time or this case would have been much ado about nothing. All the authorities had to go on were ear lobe sizes, penis shapes, and body tattoos and even when they did not match, the testimony of the Dowager Tichborne ( Sir Rogers's French mother)who stubbornly insisted that the mystery man was her son, seemed to tilt the evidence in the Claimant's favour - pity she died before his trial ended, because the pendulum swung away from him with her passing, landing him finally in Newgate goal.McWilliam's research is thorough and exhausting and the book is ""told"" in two parts ( alas, this is a history book - so there is more ""telling"" than ""showing""): the first part is the chronological sequence of events surrounding the Tichborne case and the second a series of essays on the issues that surfaced in Victorian society as a consequence of the case. I learned that barristers could be child beaters and ex-criminals, and had to be seen having dinner in the Inns of Court in order to be ""called to the bar"" - sort of lends credence to that expression! Legal exams were only introduced in 1872 (around the time of the first Tichborne case) The Tichborne Claimant captured the state of the nation's discontent that lay hidden beneath Victorian calmness and order, and the author dives into several sub-plots that reveal all that was not well in Vicky's Brittania. The Claimant was a symbol of hope for the proletariat, the spur to radicalism, with working class people seeing their only chance of making a working class man (the butcher)into an aristocrat (Sir Roger).There is enough material in this book to write a dozen novels. I hope that McWilliam will do just that one day, now that the heavy lifting of research is over and documented. He could very well rival Dickens in the number of quirky stories this history could spawn.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 10, 2009","May 30, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1432134.The_Tichborne_Claimant

Many outcomes are also possible: the patient can die, the patient can survive, the marriage may crumble, new romances may flourish, wisdom may arrive, and everyone is changed - tools for the writer's arsenal of possible endings, and Endicott skillfully uses them all.That said, the reader has to wade through a neverendum of domesticity to get to the end: changing diapers, feeding the baby, bathing and clothing the children, cleaning the house, cooking meals, going to the supermarket, treating lice, getting the flu, avoiding child molesters, looking after the batty mother-in-law etc. etc. I found very little literature in all this. Is literature supposed to be an exact copy of real life? The author has the nerve to subject the reader to all this domestic detail (the stuff we want to get away from by burying our noses in a novel - but there is no relief in this book, I caution you!), all the while giving us snippets of a plot line that moves at the slow but steady pace of a tortoise. Endicott must enjoy the trust and confidence of a publisher who is willing to wait for the twist which is normally expected on page 1 (wannabe writers please note!) but in this case happens around page 300, when the consequences of all Clara's ""good actions"" come home to roost.There are a lot of ""good"" people in this book, ever willing to put their busy lives on hold to hover around a sick person and her family, and the bad guys are just poor, that's why they are bad. All these good and bad forces converge upon Clara who is selfishly trying to find fulfillment in her empty life and accepts the burden of instant single parenthood,guest invasion, home renovation, loss of both her cars, unemployment, becoming care giver to a cancer patient and the lover to a priest - all in a few swell swoops over a couple of months. Boy,does she know how to pack it in! Overworked single parents may find this book cathartic - their lives can't be any more hectic or worse than poor Clara's.Clara and Lorraine the cancer patient, are well drawn and contrasted against the ""baddies"" Clayton and his mother Mrs. Pell. Darlene (Dolly), Lorraine's daughter is the ever-watchful eye but does not morph into a rounded character - perhaps children in their formative years are not expected to. The other characters were shapeless voices to me and the poor pastor is definitely a wimp - if the author expected that outcome of Rev. Paul, she definitely achieved it. The constantly shifting POV was distracting at times and the prose did not flow well in the places when it was written to reflect inner thoughts of the characters.The ending however redeemed the novel when the final plot point dropped and made reading the book through to its conclusion worthwhile. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 06, 2009","May 25, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4681859-good-to-a-fault

Ottawa and Canadian politics are difficult animals to describe and the author was stuck in a lot of narrative, i.e. telling. The pacing was thus affected and only redeemed when Angus delivered one of his unpredictable but memorable performances. Perhaps a lot of this background information could have come out in the dialogue and action.

Shoe factories converted to hi-tech manufacturering plants with orders oversubscribed before opening day and the old shoemaking staff were transformed into hi-tech workers overnight - I wish the real world was that easy. But I guess this book is a comedy, so these transgressions are permitted.Angus' summing up of every chapter with a diary entry to his dead wife, though poignant and a gateway into his character, became repetitious, and I skipped a few of them towards the end of the book and did not miss much. And I was waiting for the predictable ending - after all Baddeck 1 had to make its dramatic appearance.

It is a digest of all the how-to’s of writing fiction propounded by masters of the craft over the last century, This book gets to the point, quickly. It is a digest of all the how-to’s of writing fiction propounded by masters of the craft over the last century, easily packaged into 26 concise chapters that run from A to Z. Munteanu practises one of her principles of “show, don’t tell” by having the lessons come from the experts themselves and avoids the preaching herself. She begins by using the building of a house as the metaphor for writing the novel and takes us step by step through the various stages of house construction—blueprint, excavation, foundation, framing, plumbing, heating, electricity, wallboard, plaster and paint—and relate these components to parallel processes in the creation of a novel. Munteanu also intersperses exercises throughout the book to make the lessons more interactive—I wish there had been more.Although aimed at the writing student, this is a handy book for the emerging or mature writer as well, as it is a great resource to refresh one’s memory on every aspect of the writing process. In particular, I found the sections on archetypes, metaphors, scenes and sequels, sensory detail and voice to be very useful.Some older maxims were reinforced in more refined or humorous terms as well:•	Write what you know inside•	Proof read backwards•	Live, then write, then live again•	The Beatles song “Paperback Writer” as a how-not-to write a query letter•	Add how many more books you have inside you, in the query letterI feel that the book, given its conciseness, sometimes strays into areas where it shouldn’t go, as the subject matter in those sections is vast and all Munteanu does is dip her foot in the water: grammar being one. Being a science fiction writer, she also draws examples heavily from that genre and I would like to see more balance with mainstream fiction.Despite letting her sources do most of the talking, Munteanu is most powerful when her own voice intrudes, in the section on the Muse for example, and when she opens herself to us to see her rejection letters—that takes courage and binds us poor scribblers in a symbiotic relationship with this author.And to crown it all off, in the last chapter, “The Zen of Passionate Writing”, Munteanu hands off to Auschwitz survivor Victor Frankl, who reminds us that, “Success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself...” What a noble observation to surround ourselves with as we ply our trade in solitude and isolation!

An investigative reporter checks into a private clinic to have a scar removed and is murdered - it sounded like a good premise to work from. I have to credit James, almost ninety, with continuing to write competent police procedural books which peep into the lives of her suspects, criminals and detectives. And yet, I found several aspects that grated on me: the intruding concern for plot summations at various points of the story (more for the writer it seeemed, than for the reader), dialogue that seemed to be introduced for the sole purpose of providing information to the reader, the endless parade of characters and their physical descriptions - some essential to the central story, others connected with the private lives of the police personnel.Sex seems a taboo subject for James, and hence several close relationships carry on without any indication that sex is part of the equation: Candace-Westhall and Annabel Skelton, Rhoda and Robin, Collinsby and Lucy,Chandler-Powell and Helena, even Commander Dalglish and his betrothed Emma. Decorum is also maintained in the descriptions of how people seat themselves before conducting any serious business, the taking of tea as a ritual that must be described even when a murder had just taken place, and the logistics of Dalglish's squad's operation during each member's personal down-time.The story veered off from a whodunit to a howdunit with an epilogue on how-it-was-possible-to-do-it. The coincidences (a murder victim meeting a witness in London during the terrorist bombings, the same day she was supposed to be in the country signing a will - how realistic is that?) and the last minute introduction of characters who made significant contributions to the plot, gave me the impression that James was struggling to conclude her plot and called in the cavalry.James is particularly keen to settle her squad in the end - marry them off, promote or retire them - perhaps, sending us a gentle hint that this is probably her last Dalglish book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 18, 2009","Apr 14, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4162673-the-private-patient

Obviously, I had been cocooned in the city I was intended to see, and would subsequently recommend to others as a tourist.Mezei's Prague has emerged from Communism into Capitalism and failed under both systems. The older characters harken back to the days of the proletariat and the younger ones are disenchanted with the corruption, and everyone is ticked off with the ""Americanization"" that now plagues the city. The author even takes us out into the future when Prague has separated from the rest of the Czech Republic and the latter has in turn separated from the (by-then) defunct EU - and the picture is bleaker still.His cast of characters is enormous: municipal workers, bar owners, journalists, diplomats, psychiatrists, athletes, office workers, returning emigres, the list goes on. This cast gives perspective not only internally but externally, for some of the characters are foreign residents in the city.The stories are short, easy to read, with sharp dialogue, but in their shortness also lie their shortcoming. Often, more than 80% of the story is back story (telling) and there is very little action. Many stories have a begining and an end but the middle (the why and the how) is left unexplained. Others are polemics, where the protagonist expresses his/her sharp condemnation of what is happening in the country - they are not stories. And throughout, the repeated words, cliches, the overuse of italics and bold type indicate the lot of the self-published author in need of editing assistance.The book's structural and technical shortcomings notwithstanding, Mezei has embarked on some bold subject matter and painted a fascinating picture of a timeless city going through yet another transformation.

He hated the world of business, despised his merchant father's brutal treatment of his employees,could never make-up his mind about marriage (he was engaged to the same woman twice and died a bachelor)or about his five novels-in-progress, all of which he handed to his friend Max Brod with instructions to destroy them after his death. In his constant moving of location, Kafka seemed to be escaping from the sounds of life around him: elevators creaking, furniture moving, footsteps overhead, voices of chatty neighbours. He wanted to enroll for WWI but was declared too essential by his firm the first time, and too ill the second. He sympathized with the German minority in Bohemia at the time and hoped that the Austro-Hungarian empire would prevail after the war. He also dreamt of living one day in Palestine, as he was a keen follower of the emerging Zionist movement.He must have been quite devastated being not only a minority Jew, but seeing his German fraternity discriminated against as the Czech majority rapidly took over his beloved city in the final years of the Hapsburg empire: changing German street names and landmarks over to Czech ones, voting German's out of political office and carving out the university along language lines. Although these events took place a hundred years ago - we still see this behaviour practised in parts of the world when long suppressed majorities are finally liberated and go heady and unsteady with power. Still, Kafka was spared the bitter pill of living through WWII, when the Germans he supported exterminated European Jews, including his three dear sisters.Kafka died of consumption in 1924 - preventable today with immunization - at the tender age of 40. His health, like his novels, succumbed to the fact that he was a man ahead of his time. We are so lucky that Max Brod ignored Kafka's instructions about destroying his novels and published them posthumously. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2009","Apr 13, 2009",,Perfect Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2013054.Franz_Kafka_und_Prag

And yet he was able to hold my attention with his snappy dialogue, with dramatic scenes such as Janice's alcoholic misadventure with her baby, and with dysfunctional characters such as Harry and Jack.

She ships out to Nova Scotia as part of the Loyalist evacuation (a place which in the book is portrayed as more inhospitable to blacks than New York) and finally ""adventures"" to Freetown, Sierra Leone in search of her true home.But it was at this point that the message came home to me, one I have wrestled with as well in my novels and as an immigrant. Aminata, despite many trials upon returning to Africa, does not reach her village home in the end. She winds up in England, front lining for the Abolishionists in their attempts to ban this heinous trade. Home for Aminata (and for all of us displaced ones) is in the present, wherever she is, for the home of the past has disappeared and can never be recovered- that is a very telling message that is perhaps obscured amidst Aminata's many adventures.The other strong message is that this is not about blacks vs. whites - both sides have some redeeming characters and some pretty nasty ones too. This story is about using might for profit and of its consequences – a message still valid today. One veteran slave trader says, ""There is no profit in benevolence."" And as for slavery, his comment is, ""Everybody is doing it - the British, the French, the Dutch, the Americans. Even the bloody Africans have been mixed up in the trade for an eternity. If we didn't take the slaves, the other Africans would kill them, butcher them live."" Given what has happened even in the last century, in places like Rwanda, I can't refute his cold-hearted logic. Hill re-affirms, that despite our colour, we are capable of good and evil in equal measure. Aminata's redemption is that through her suffering she is cleansed of whatever bad she may have been capable of doing in her life and is pointed towards securing the greater good of mankind. She truly is a soul finding her path to salvation by carrying her cross on earth.My only peeve was that as the author was covering over half a century of history, some sections were narrated over very quickly, particularly Aminata's later years in Nova Scotia and Freetown and this period was out of balance with her life story in the ""Thirteen Colonies"". Then again, in today's attention span deprived world, I am not sure who would have the patience to read a Book of Negroes I, II and III either (which is what this book could have extended to, given its rich source material) .An author who undertakes to document his racial origins is a bold individual, because implicit in that investigation is the possibility that not only the noble but the ignoble would be uncovered. And Hill has demonstrated that courage admirably and sensitively in this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2010","Mar 16, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/875436.The_Book_of_Negroes

There was sparse dialogue, and whenever it was presented, it came as part of a character's narrative - somewhat telling instead of showing.The claustrophobic, sexual tension of the initial kidnap scene gave way to more movement in the second half of the novel, when the characters moved out of the house and new characters were introduced and various ""plots within the the plot"" became evident.This helped pick up the pace and keep me gripped and reading until the end.A couple of items that did not work for me:(1) the multiple first-person narrative style was also the book's undoing - these four narrators included a heavily accented Oriental woman, a stammering teenager, a housewife and her pool equipment operator loser-husband. Had they been allowed to ""speak"", as opposed to narrate, their characters would have been better drawn; all four characters seemed to be narrating as one type - an educated adult - perhaps the voice of the author. Sometimes, the narrators went through their lines as if they were trying to clear up plot points for the reader. I wonder if a plain old fashioned, limited third person viewpoint would have not worked better here? In the end, Kenny (not one of the narrators,) came across as the best drawn character to me. Experimentation in style is fine as long as it extends and improves our appreciation of the work - I'm not sure it quite worked here (2) Setting was not clear. Words like telly, cricket bat, lift and petrol, led me to believe that this novel was set in Australia. But the pre-occupation with ""cowboys and injuns"", truck-stops and sombreros led me to conclude that it also could have been somewhere in the US Southwest. I'm not sure if ""place"" was deliberately muddied for commercial purposes, but a clear setting always grips me - even if it is in Timbuctoo. And having lived in Australia - I think it is a great country to set a story like this - it does not have to be masked.In the end, the author shows her faith and compassion in the human spirit in the way the characters come to terms with their roles in the crime(s). ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2009","Feb 16, 2009",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/3230015-a-decent-ransom

A stifling sibling or close friend is a frequent foil, accompanied by eccentric parents, grandparents and aunts with dark secrets of their own.The symbolism is good, even mystical - the chair and the Harris sparrow in particular, worked well.I would best describe these stories as character sketches, where the sequence of scenes jump back and forth in time,jerkily, sometimes leaving the reader as bewildered and searching for clues to character, just like the pratagonist(s). ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2009","Feb 16, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4579453-roads-unravelling

Misha, the narrator, is also obsessed with all kinds of bodily emissions and their olefactory consequences - need I elaborate?However, the story is a farcical rendition of the capitalist plays around oil, both from the multinational conglomerates converging on Absurdistan to the internal rulers who fuel ethnic conflicts for profit. It helped me look at the conflicts going on the world today from a different perspective.The most intriguing part of the book is how Steyngart pokes fun at well known brand names in today's business world without getting sued. Steyngart even creates a rather despicable fictional alter-ego of himself to take a pot-shot at. Perhaps there is a legal allowance for farce. Or Steyngart's depictions are taking place elsewhere in the world today that they cannot be denied in court.The narrative style is conversational, spontaneous and very humorous. In the end, big Misha, dolling out cash at random to those less fortunate than him, also demonstrates an overlarge heart and boundless generosity towards humanity - his redemption in Steyngart's screwed up world of Absurdistan. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2009","Jan 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70509.Absurdistan

Mr. Vertigo, the boy who could walk on air. WaltAn episodic story, ""told"" in strong narrative about the life and times of Walt the Wonder Kid, a.k.a. Mr. Vertigo, the boy who could walk on air. Walt, a young castaway, befriends the Master Yehudi who puts him through 33 trials of endurance - some pretty gruesome, like being buried alive for 24 hours - before Walt ultimately collapses in utter hopelessness, only to find his body rise above the floor and commence his startling career as a circus and stage performer, mobster, night club owner, war veteran, bum and finally laundromat owner. Every career reaches a zenith and plunges - just like his sky walking, teaching Walt that it is best to quit while ahead, leading him to even plan the murders of others who do not recognize that fact. As much as Auster is strong on narrative he is spare on dialogue and some lines were out of character for me. Nine year old Walt comments on Kansas ""This hole is so backward, the State went dry before they even heard of Prohibition in the rest of the country"" - rather profound for his age! Yet Auster creates unforgettable characters in Yehudi, and Mrs. Witherspoon the cigarette smoking scotch swilling sexpot with the Midas Touch, and of course, our boy hero. The violence and unexpected turns of life come home sharply when the KKK brutally and unceremoniously dispach Aesop the scholar and Mother Sioux - two of Walt's closest-to-family members. The ambush on the highway leading to Hollywood by Uncle Slim and his gang also comes out of left field and reduces Walt from riches to rags in minutes.Condensing a life into 200 plus pages is tough; there were large swaths of Walt's life that only received a few lines of narrative treatment: his army years, his 23 year marriage to Molly, and his 11 year relationship with Mrs. Witherspoon, to name a few. I wondered if the author would have been better off just giving us the major scenes in Walt's life and leaving out the rest, without trying to connect everything chronologically.The lessons in this book are clear: Talents are developed at great personal cost and have to be repaid, money drives everything (including Yehudi's munificence towards his protege), everything ends, and all of us can fly. Walt reveals the secret of his ability to levitate in the end with more profundity, ""You must let yourself evaporate""- go figure!

The narrative approach of having the citizens freely talk their stories ( and others' as well from their own biased viewpoints) to the faceless, rather bland, Yankee narrator - who himself seems to be everywhere anything is happening in Savannah - comes across as a bit contrived.The central conflict - the murder of a young man by an aging art dealer - dwindles down to a page by the time the last re-trial is heard and only helps to expose a phony justice system where only money talks.In the end, the most colourful character is Savannah itself, with its disfunctional citizens, dark secrets, voodoo, isolation and ability to survive despite being caught in a time warp and being bypassed by the march of civilization....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 21, 2009","Jan 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/386187.Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil
