I had to put this book down right in the middle of it (because of life), but when I picked it back up this morning, I did not want to stop. The story is a unique one. It’s about a mother, Jen, who sees her son, Todd, commit an unspeakable crime. In trying to figure out why Todd does this, Jen begins to wake up in the past. She lives her life uncontrollably in the past to piece together the future. The book is a fast read and gripping.

How do you respect family choice, culture and religion while still questioning and advocating for more for an individual? Arlo is a DeafBlind man in his twenties who has been sheltered and lied to by the people that are supposed to love him, protect him and teach him. When he finally meets Cyril, an interpreter, who plants the seeds for Arlo to ask questions, his world opens up.This book tells so much about the experience of a DeafBlind individual but does it through storytelling. The reader learns so much through the dialogue of characters with each other. The narrative never pulls the reader out to teach them. Blair Fell, weaves all the nuances of accessibility and advocacy into Arlo’s story. As someone who is familiar with the Deaf community, I loved this coming of age story that centers around a character that who doesn’t have their told often. It wasn’t a story trying to preach to its audience. Instead, it was a fun journey of love, friendship, and freedom. I think this one will stay with me for a long time.

This was more of the beach read that I was expecting. I really enjoyed this light, summer read about a hotel on Nantucket that was refurbished after many years. The story revolves around all the staff that comes to work at this new fabulous place. The staff is charming, a little gritty, and seeking renewal in their lives. The story takes place over one summer. It is full of folly and redemption. It is also full of a ghost that haunts the hotel. I enjoyed the novel and will continue to read more Hilderbrand books in the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 06, 2023","Mar 30, 2023","Aug 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59227941-the-hotel-nantucket
