The big scenes are off screen, the small moments of movement are expanded out, and then the rush begins. Fontane felt like a writer rushing through the remainder of his outline, to me, at the end, like a college undergrad hitting a workshop deadline. I really like Armand V, the Dag Solstad novel told in end notes to a novel that doesn't actually exist, a total shadow text, essentially. I feel this way here too. I felt a similar way about The Idiot, actually, the action was so ""off-screen"" that it all ended up feeling just a bit transgressive, despite itself. Depressing too.So strange how little most of it ends up mattering, in a way, no? The ghost, the accumulation of the first half, the slow build of the region - all of it abandoned.There was one other thing I liked though. I liked that no one really wanted the plot to happen, and they were compelled by what I might go so far as to call a system of treaties. Marriage treaty, affair treaty, reaction to affair treaty. These are pretty well-realized characters who behave as society would have them do. It reminded me of World War 1, a bit, or a clockwork play. Innenstein is on the edge of some sort of meta-awareness of the plot of his own novel. I like system books a lot when they can wink at themselves a bit. I can't say that this one does, but it's a bit closer than one might think.

I've seen him talk a couple of times since, and both times radically amazed me, though slightly less so than the ""Gooseberries"" lecture. There is something about those sparking experiences, perhaps, that led to me feeling a slight disconnect from this charming, smart writerly analysis of stories by Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gogol, and Turgenev, which are provided, and which make for wonderful reading. The Saunders analytic style, so quippy and likable, somehow works perfectly out loud, and slightly less so on the page - but here comes a second confession: I think people who have taken an MFA, or a college writing class, may find less here, just because many of the reveals will be familiar to them.
