Before the battlefield, we get soldiers off to war, at boot camp, attending functions, having adult fun and kid dilemmas. All eight or so characters are Charming (capital C) to say the least. The script is infused with funny dialogue--you can envision the beats caused by such cute, innocent, but tremendously clever lines. The animals going to the slaughter--grade A gallows humor.

Liking something popular (Disneyland and world) to something else thats popular (christianity) is pretty much a safe bet. And the pastor puts things together, does convey a few surprises, less than three, about Disneyworld and Walt DIsney factoids. That the park conveys heaven, our version of it certainly, is his thesis. But the abundancy of Bible verses versus the small amount of Disney-related bric-a-brac/detrius is very student-like. Like, I bet he got an A! There are dumb quotes too--from at least 4 Christian bands. Obviously this dude's version of white heaven is Christian but also capitalistic and facile. Yes, he is pretty lucky to frequent Disney parks and stuff--but buddy, this is saying NOTHING.Also, lets not forget that Star Wars was not Disney only a few years back. If so, why does he make an argument for the Star Wars bible-like stories, if not an original part of Walt's master design? True story, I found this book in a New Orleans bookstore for free.

Here I have realized why he paints El Paso and its inhabitants in the way that he does. Why are his boys so sensitive and on the cusp of tears, while the women must be painted always like the luchonas that they are? The two lovers are truly loved, not just by each other, but by each one's very Mexican American family. We are cradled, and that love is transmitted to other passions and people. Does love extend beyond the adorable couple and giving a light of grace upon families and friends? FUCK YEAH, seems to be an accurate answer. For are we not (El Pasoans, that is) just so elementally rich just for that reason: our families nurture us there in the desert and in love, and we travel safely away, knowing always that they are in good hands, this is a secret place, cradled there by the Franklin Mts, given blood and a certain lifeforce by Juarez, forgotten by many writers, but embraced by a person who insists that violence and death and sorrow may always be close by, but you won't face it alone with a shield that every El Pasoan is familiar of.

Some of his novels are like unfinished pieces of a larger novel--and they are. It all belongs to the same world of the Mexico DF writers, poets, bohemians. Here we again meet the main character of ""Amulet"" and the two young poets from ""The Savage Detectives."" Smack in the middle, the beautiful writer manages to put these beloved faux poets and writers in a little room in a comical way. Because! He! Can! (2666 is a novel claimed to be incomplete, and yet it is a whole other world from ""Detectives,"" ""Nazi Literature in the Americas,"" ""Secret of Evil"", ""Monsieur Pain"" and ""Amulet."" (The first and last title in this list, of the books I've read personally, are his masterworks, along with 2666... and this one.)It was jarring: the novel ends with a ""Mexican Manifesto"" and boy o boy can I relate to everything the writer says about Mexico, his adoptive country. No one before has gone to the streets of DF, Buenos Aires, Paris in this manner, or in this contemporary (albeit from the 50s) way. His voice is unique, his prose is exquisite. He writes of the artist in absolute perfection, giving us the madman and hero that a writer really is. Bolano died young and he dedicates his writing to greats who died young (fiction or real, it DOES NOT MATTER), or who were completely forgotten.

The Shape no longer needs the doctor. (330) There are threads of evil moving puppets about, the tableaux are horrific (cinematic, of course)...The literary lining is showing! There is an invisible force that talks to Michael as a kid (Halloween 2's 1981 novelization) who, as legend has it, went on to slaughter his older sister one Halloween night. Here, the doctor is likewise entranced by The Abyss.What impresses is the prism of variations taken from other tomes of the series (except for the non-Myers movie, the grotesque HIII--but including, surprisingly, some Rob Zombie staples). Don't believe me? Babysitters getting stalked (H1, H4); British podcasters making a documentary (H:Resurrection); Dr. Sartain=Samhain (H6) and a mysterious person/cult who cares for him clandestinely; there's cop shannanigans (H5) and a burning man (H2)... Rob Zombie's Loomis' is as crazed as Sartain (RZ H1, H2)... this Myers is as strong as RZ's!This is your fate...No more superstition...Life is cyclical, as is trauma and family legacies.

Coetzee may just be the only living contemporary writer that actually gets better & better with age. (An anomaly if there ever was one...). Against the very paradigms that cemented him as a worthy premiere multi-award recipient celebrity writer in the first place, Coetzee is an astonishing artist. Validation of the writer seems to be Coetzee's most recent and compelling theme. With ""Elizabeth Costello"" (his magnum opus in my view) we reached the heavens (!). In ""Summertime"" we delved into the inner realms of not all writers, just this singular one, Coetzee. But when coming upon the ""How Can I Possibly Contribute Something New to My Art"" Rubicon, what does Coetzee do? Tie up more loose ends that sums up his own poetics*, while making the reader's experience a refreshingly new one. The continuity of this top-notch intuition (which has made its way in the more recent books by the South African) transforms the writer's life into the body of work itself. That is, it lives on... with brilliance, with raw nerve.

The urge, the attempt, is clearly there. The main protagonist explains her world to us in such annoying detail. She's true green ingenue that I could certainly give less a damn about. The mother is a two dimensional person to hate--but I actually did just the opposite of that. (Despite the fact that everything out of her mouth is a brazen cliche.) It is outlandish.

My favorite horror novel, ever. Erm... short story collection. Technically.Wow, wow & WOW! Barker is undeniably unique, a few steps above Stephen King (at this point) in the whimsical world of the macabre. All fifteen of these tales are incredible-- & incredibly wicked--anecdotes, all wonderful drafts for damn-good horror flicks (bettering ""Hellraiser,"" surely) that could become classics as quintessential as Carrie, Pet Semetary or The Shining. Barker has indeed a romantic, and visceral, and uber-gross view of things, foremost a fantastic infatuation with the human body, and with the traffic of the spectral world with mortal sexuality... it's all very toxic, dabbling in the world of erotic masochism & clever even genius motifs of a collective dread.Indeed, I love the collection. It rivals the very best of King (perhaps only one of his collections hits the visceral nerve a bit more masterfully, albeit less fantastically, than ""The Books...""). My favorites are MUSTS (read, read, read!) for those who study the short story; what makes these little nuggets of gold so golden is a true mystery in itself: ""Sex, Death and Starshine"" cleverly paints a surrealistic picture, rivaling even Dali, of the intermingling of souls with the living (a masterpiece for sure); and ""In the Hills, the Cities"" has the most memorable ""monster"" to appear out of the dark subconscious in the longest time, I think, since Frankenstein's demon. This one, too, is a masterpiece, & the imagination for such a clever Voltairesque creation seems so alien and divine as to be madly envied. And in awe of. Lastly, I kinda really dug the monster-flick tale ""Rawhide Rex"" which should be turned into a script (just looked it up, it is), as the climax is better than mostly any I could think of for a monster story.

The main driving force for the reader is to traverse the plot like some intrepid trekker--here, that motivation is eradicated & what we are left with is one fat big juicy ""?"".The premise? That we live in a systematic place where components are controlled (by family, substances, life). The back and forth between the school and the rehab embody a game of tennis (emblematic ""system"" used to symbolize coming-of-age as well as the myriad needlepoint philosophies that go with it). No patterns arise! Yet the reader has (always) his wants. That you don't matter in the enterprise is what ultimately spoils this experience for me. The writer has very consciously tried to build a sturdy monolithic castle from individual grains of dry sand. An impossible endeavor, but it must be witnessed. The things that stick out are the sordid details: the head in the microwave, the shot in the face; the molestation of little boys, of invalids; a hanging fetus.If you say I.J. is the future of the novel, you definitely haven't read 1936's ""Gone with the Wind."" Almost a full century old, that tome really justifies its girth (like ""Lonesome Dove"" & ""The Stand"" do, like ""Don Quixote"" & ""Les Miserables"" eons ago). I understand the allure of this, really, I do, but HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS CAN YOU SAY THE EXACT SAME THING? Definitely not in 1088 pages! But maybe eighty-eight.Bottom line: this novel really gave me a serious case of the ""howling fantods.""...more",Notes are private!,0,337,1,"Apr 23, 2016","May 31, 2016","Apr 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest

Maddaddam contains a mixture of both (there is an immediate- and an epic-like quality to it). It is sad and, actually, very very funny. This is MARGARET ATWOOD'S ""FUNNIEST"" novel to date. She's constructed a world that resembles this one--all the main figures (avatars of Jesus and Adam & Eve, and Cain and Abel) have been represented well. They are emblematic.

Rhys' literary voice is so authentic and compelling. She is a stylist through & through--post-modern when the very word was but a fetish.

On par with ""Gone With the Wind,"" & other epics like ""Cold Mountain"" & ""The English Patient,"" it truly was, to this impressionable-though-selective reader, what is the equivalent of a wondrous trip to Adult Disneyland, where surprises loom ever-near, and whimsy runs amok.But what makes this utterly brilliant is the prose (on top of an unpredictable and thrilling plot). The writer is this supernova de Bernieres (all 4 of his novels at this point are in my Must-Read List). Here, you realize exactly WHY you read. WHY people bother to write--if you are Louis De Bernieres you simply cannot not keep producing. The gift is almost mythical, and you are compelled to feel that the auteur has had the TIME of his LIFE writing this, writing and falling head-over-heels in love with his creation which, indeed, depicts LOVE and is, itself, wholly a product of love--the love of beautiful prose.In ""Corelli"", the tricks and poetics already explored in the often-lauded Latin American trilogy, collaborate once more to make a solid work of art. As is customary, just as this tale takes one of its manifold dark turns, when times in the Greek island are dire, desperate and almost-hopeless, the titular character appears & drives the darkness away. This, as if a gift from the Greek gods themselves. Or the gift from a master to his drooling spectator.This, his fourth (amazing!!!) concoction, puts in evidence the fact that not ALL magic realism belongs to sir Garcia Marquez. Louis de Bernieres' brand is all his own: humorous, unpredictably playful and savagely biting. The effect lasts outside of the book; the novel is a rotund success. My favorite of Louis de Bernieres (so far).I devoured Corelli's Mandolin like some bon vivant living in the 20th century. Like a character in one of his novels, in fact.

That he is funny is his specialty; that he misreads & misinterprets his situation has all the coming-out story elements which have found a home in the past but in modernity are actually dull and mega uninteresting. Todd Glass like 12% of the population is blessed with being gay, but like those annoying members in that select group, he digs his heels to the floor in refusing to come out. Like, really, who cares. There are devastatingly little laughs in this, and no real drama. So, it's just middle of the road, with small insight and what seems like a cascade of excuses. This is the verdict: Glass had the job at 20 of opening for myriad awesome performers on Broadway; his busy schedule impeded any social or sexual interactions with members of the same sex. It is the price you must pay, but no one has ever told Glass this. Instead, we get the ""situation,"" a hybrid that doesn't quite gel, that's neither funny nor remotely interesting.

It is blessed with an aura of flawless, impeccable English perfection; the prose is exquisitely clean & concise, GODLY by most-- especially my own-- standards.

The reader won't let this one go from page 6.

But here we see him mimicking the talented Mr. Puig (the brilliant Argentinian) in his movie/zeitgeist insight, in his critical statements, all of which are incredibly beautifully put. He is also infatuated with prolonged lists (well, duh, just recall ""The Women"" section of ""2666,"" itself almost 266 pages long as a grisly chamber of too true terrors in a from that rivals the Marquis de Sade's) & the art-like criticism of music, art & literature.Herein gorgeous trains-of-thought which defy a general classification. Are they notes and sketches, or beginnings, middles and ends? The writer has established this device of nonentity, of non-resolution and an omnipresent sense of dread, which may infuriate readers, divide them; but ultimately defines the awful discovery of literary prophecy: the whole point of these snippets, their infinite value, is the fact that Bolaño was writing about his impending annihilation by coming close to his text, breathing into it and from it, then retreading devastatingly far, causing in the reader disbelief, sadness & awe.We find here the modern day Flannery O'Connor of Latin America. Bolaño's poetics include people and God being inherently cruel, the world a dangerous place. The fear of strangers pervades; and the voices coming from neighboring rooms is by now a motif representing a discovery that, I guess, just cannot be made, cannot occur. Basically, all of it is some sad, hidden defunct but beautiful possibility.It should be made clear that this is not a collection of short stories, much less a novel.

Perhaps 20 books of the 80 or so have been Phenomenal (thanks, 1001 Books to Read Before You Die List). Seriously, the majority of these are at least above average, some of them are true essentials that you mustmust MUST absolutely experience). In that vein, ""The Master"" reigns supreme. Novels about novel-writing are a hit because they embody the ""perfect package"": it's drama about drama, prose about prose, what the unfictitious writer had to do to ultimately get his fiction out there... even whole sets of poetics and stylistic inclinations have a TRUE (dare I add: educational) purpose in these exciting, intrepid endeavors. Yeah, Cunningham hit a home run with ""The Hours""--his trying to explain a writer's madness somehow allowed it transcendence of the boundaries of time and space. And in Joyce Carol Oates ""Blonde"" (my favorite novel all year), there is a sincere and Godly effort to portray the ARTIST in all her bright and dark dimensions. THE MASTER is a work about the restraint felt by the artist, in this case, the incomparable Henry James, and how every small moment is erected in his mind with hints of feeling and memory. He feels sadness for children--for their future lives that seem so distant and so full of possibility, including, of course, the possibility of demise. For his sister, for mortality; for the new form of novel which could (and in my very humble opinion DID) surpass his own brand of the same.Like Woolf, James is a victim of his age, his society--we all are. But Woolf was intrepid; James was insistent on the PROPER way to write a novel (see also, ""The Art of Fiction""). His ideas went into his refined and sophisticated art; indeed with so many tuggings and distractions, & clashes with historical events, acquaintances, social gatherings, etc., James became diverted from his clear literary tasks. He is a master of his element, in his element; a brilliant man of unexpected colors.This one, to me, is PERFECT. Yes, a book about the contemplative nature of one of the greatest writers in the English language is, not boring or dull, but magnificent in its courage to properly give the Master back his due.

And what, then, does that make us? Poop readers. This is bottom-line second rate King+. Also, let's say that the battle of forces (like ""The Stand""s) between freaks (like ""Salem's Lot""s) and telepaths (like ""Firestarter""s) is extremely uneven. The goodguys are the Spartans from 300, the baddies are the Little Giants. There is no competition. At.

Read novels, exemplary novels like this one, for a novel like ""Blonde"" kicks the ass of those tiny singular books... there is poetry in each and every page. Undertaking this journey is a huge endeavor for the reader. This humongous tale for the reader is a grotesque fairy tale through & through.Norma Jean's thoughts/actions occur in present tense, in actual time, & also in fatalistic retrospection. It is a topsy turvy house of horror.This is an expert fictionalization; momentous literature which must be absolutely devoured. The saga is sublime. The topic, the figurehead that is Marilyn Monroe, is and has been ultimately misinterpreted. But thanks to Joyce Carol Oates (give her a Nobel already [I mean, even Coetzee and Saramago have one!]) and her extensive research, the meat on the bones are as beautiful and enigmatic as the person herself (and by this, I mean Monroe AND J.C.O.: their collaboration is what dreams are made of. Their nightmare is our heaven).(Strange to figure how many modern actresses wish to emulate the gorgeous blond, they try time after time, and the great actress tried so much to be the character she was chosen to portray. She was even painfully paranoid of her fictional characterizations drifting into her real life like ghosts!)Consider Oates's Norma Jean as a 20th century Emma Bovary-- but with something to offer the outside world. And of this many great Hollywood men took notice, and the exploitation that ensues is demonic. The elusive father figure-- Norma Jean never met hers, and so what happens is a collection of men she disgustingly refers to as ""Daddy."" (see? Even porno stars want to be Marilyn!) She becomes addicted to Codeine tablets, super quick solutions to issues which stem all the way from infancy. There is a patina of infinite sadness, of devastation being covered up for the sake of illusion and the glimmering of the silver screen. The novel is filled with endings-- conceivably, almost every section in the story could be a possible way for Oates to finish her masterpiece-- the prolongment is absolutely masochistic and inspiring, if that makes any sense. The novel that starts off with dolls, star homes and star funerals is undoubtedly what awaits the girl (beautiful and young corpse) at the end. Everything: sad, with a foretaste of certain doom, of impending tragedy. The girl devoted to God and literature and meaty roles (as evidenced by her poems and musings which) beg the reader to feel defensive of her, of this child in a woman's body, The Woman's body. The cooly complex metaphysical stuff (this is a 21st century novel after all and all the Greats brought out all their tricks at this point) is infused with intelligence, and, yes, MAGIC. Marilyn is a woman who falls out of time. She recalls scripts that have never even existed before but compete with her actual life-- she's smart beyond recognition, she is not DUMB AT ALL. She juxtaposes art with life, and this is what all actresses, all good actresses, must feel for their art. She suffers for her art like any other artist worth his or her salt.It is pretty rare for literature to be so perfectly precise in emulating the theme and source it describes: like the person herself (R.I.P) the novel, for me, will remain unique and unforgettable....more",Notes are private!,0,358,1,"Apr 04, 2014","Apr 14, 2014","Apr 04, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15975.Blonde

Its the exquisite pairing of books at beaches, at hotel balconies, at restaurants that forever, at least in my own experience, binds the two together in a truly surreal/Dadaistic effort that's worthwhile.

Close to Anaheim, well, Glendale, to be exact, that's where the fictional Mrs. Pierce lived, decades ago. She begins her entrepreneurial adventure selling pies, and then progresses to chicken-only restaurants. Did I mention that this occurs in the years following the Great Depression? Her struggle is incredible-- it is her adulation for her diva daughter (oh, those divas-- they will undo art as much as they contribute to it!) that leads to her downfall.

MVL hooked himself another incredible biography this time to cement properly into itty, bitty literature for all of eternity.

This one is as magnificent as the other two-- as gripping and unputdownable. The story never dies: criminals of human degeneracy are never placed on trial; crimes are never atoned for. And in Casement we have the hero that is inherently human and whose destiny is therefore heart-wrenching. This, o readers, is the epitome of class(y), of majestic & lush prose-- a writer worth studying, and CLOSELY.I am an enormous fan of this man. His expertise ranges from the tiniest germinating seed to the sprawling cosmos. Indeed, he could write about ANYTHING, and make of it a BRILLIANT work of art. In this, MVL's fair distribution of the light and dark, of the humanity and evil tug-of-war that is everlasting is the main attraction.

""Beauty is such self-forgetting"" (47) indeed--and this is a brilliant and breathtaking family portrait, so very post-Victorian Jerry Springer filthiness! First off, the strongly redolent, very judgmental narrator (and weakling) Edmund becomes immediately attractive to any reader who often ventures out of a definite comfort zone to stray off into the world's dark undercarriage. And the plot: He finds himself in a mad dream inhabited by imps: by more doubles and doppelgangers any possible reader could possibly want. The protagonist, like the reader himself, is faced with too much information too soon to possibly fit all too neatly in his restricted view and awestruck mind... He must work out all the cogs in the machine before the orchestra fully unfurls before him. Lastly, the pace is ominous and foreboding--all of it frosting in an evenly-frosted delicious morsel. (Respect the gods of the almighty novella!) It arrives from the same stratosphere of the macabre as American Hawthorne's ""The Blithedale Romance.""There is a commendable and dire need to be anti-Victorian with the superb Murdoch.

Alas, there's a good reason why Entertainment Weekly once decreed that the film was a great comfort to all post-911 victims--a holistic healing to the nation as a whole.

The strands of dialogue themselves are in the spotlight... what is being said (the ideas unraveled, the conventions and hypocrisies deliciously deliberate and FUnnY) is what holds this tale of infidelity together.

Roth has the audacity to make so many statements about U.S. pre-911 that he could considerably be called a literary apostle.

For an overwritten hunk of cheese, there are more loose ends at the ends of this than anything by David Lynch. 1Q84 is risky (but NOT--it must be said--risqué) and the surreal details soon turn into a too intense focus on all things (Japan-circa-1984) mundane.

A fellow classmate said that this was as daunting, as time consuming, as reading El Quixote, but I would like to add that the epic convention from Cervantes which was for all future writers to follow is also an innovation mirrored with 2666—here is what new literature really means. & what this all means is a restlessness to render only certain themes, certain tableaux and neofables, no longer in neat, ordered, & restricted packages.

Bolaño is more like Virginia Woolf than Garcia Marquez (in case anyone is wondering)—& therefore utterly brilliant. A friend said that it is the epilogue of 2666 which explains its greatness, and this is far from the truth. I cannot really find the tragedy of Bolaño’s premature death all too prevalent in the book—2666 is about pretty much everything that does not deal with death, too. Also, Bolaño is the only writer to have ever, in my estimation, emulated the great Marquis de Sade in his infamous book within 2666 about the murders in Mexico and its crazed logic which no one can solve. It is absolutely organic and I love the fact that the titular number is mentioned ZERO times in the novel (although it is explained, somewhat, sorta, in “Amulet”). “Cloud Atlas” is neatly connected; 2666 only gets to connections by coincidence, just as in life— it is THAT organic. &, like in true, harrowing life, there are dreams & oracles, strangeness and beauty and ugliness, almost always the trio of these found in one.

Here is my paper comparing Voltaire with Bernard Shaw (I know! I know--it's a wee bit overstretching it...)Candida vs. Candide: Correlating Elements In the Works by Voltaire and ShawWhen Bernard Shaw decided to write his Candida—a very strong name for a very strong individual (indeed, he knew that this type of name would require much effort in part of the gifted playwright to back it up, to support it, to be worthy of so strong and evocative a title)—he knowingly took up the responsibility of fulfilling his audience’s great expectations. And how many of Shaw’s fans actually read literature? It must be an established truth that then—one hundred years ago—as it is now, both theater enthusiasts and readers of fiction overlap; someone taking up Candida for the first time (or having the privilege of experiencing it live on the stage) will undoubtedly make the connection between Bernard Shaw’s drama, subtitled “A Mystery,” and Voltaire’s masterwork, 1759’s Candide, or Optimism.Merely having any work of art baring the name of its heroine is often considered magnificent—a true auteur’s touch. The protagonist in a play or a novel becomes monolithic—the person’s entity is represented on different levels; it could even be said that the work is the embodiment, the demonstration, of a real corpus. The work itself represents one human soul—its complexities and poetry are on full display. One must not search long before great works of literature appear before the discerning, modern reader—novels like Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Elizabeth Bowen’s Eva Trout, Gore Vidal’s Myra Breckinridge, J. M. Coetzee’s Elizabeth Costello—all these are emblematic bodies of work which construct a character worthy of remaining a literary figure for all time. And in drama? There’s Evita, of course, and a slew of opera favorites such as Lucia di Lammermoor and Aida. But Candide and Candida represent one type of character—a sincere and thoughtful protagonist whose problems arise from the surrounding environment and not from any forms of self-doubt or guilt. Both figures are headstrong, intrepid—it is the madness of the world in which they reside that troubles them, that allows for the typical absurd-man-in-an-absurd-world archetype to be established in the work of fiction and reinterpreted. Both candid characters undergo superficial change, for inside they remain constant and true to themselves.  But the differences between them are (at first glance) staggering, and a quick recapitulation of what these are may be useful in finding exactly where the true main threads which unites both lie. Certainly, the two could be called almost-contradictory. A play is meant to be seen, a novel to be read, and the experiences offered by both are entirely unique. Candide perambulates the entire globe, from one location to another, downtrodden; all the while surveying all the kinds of injustices committed, with a distant, naïve, but hopeful demeanor; Candida, on the other hand, is restricted to her home in “1894 in the north east quarter of London” (3). For Voltaire, Candide marks his towering achievement (it is his Dorian Grey, his One Hundred Years of Solitude, his Pygmalion); while Candida remains “a favorite play with many who profess not to care for Shaw” (Williamson 115). As a result, Candide feels epic, despite its concise and easy-to-read prose, and Candida is very intimate—a portrayal of a single life, and not the explicit depiction of hordes and multitudes. And this play with scales and dimensions (a more precise example of this is to found in Voltaire’s short classic, 1752’s Micromegas), obviously, is not the sole deviation Shaw’s play takes from the French literary classic. Even the build-up of suspense—a must in most successful works of fiction—occurs very differently. As a play, Candida is a perfect vehicle to convey dramatic irony: the audience always knows more than the characters on the stage. But Voltaire does something quite radical: he actually eradicates most sense of suspense (since Candide’s adventures are the bulk of the story, the ingredient of unexpectedness is absolutely present, however, in the suddenness of events that transpire). The reader is in awe as, instead of covering up a fact (if just for several pages), Voltaire discloses what the drama is to relate in the actual titles of the chapters themselves. This convention, not completely dissimilar to that of other novels of the time, properly establishes exactly what is to be depicted following that small description. For instance, Chapter III of Candide ends when “he met a beggar,” and soon the mystery quickly dissipates when Chapter IV, entitled “How Candide Met His Old Philosophy Teacher, Doctor Pangloss, and What Happened” tells us who the mystery person is before delving into the text itself—very efficient storytelling which does not quite betray its narrative effect (22). On the other hand, Shaw is mysterious even in his stage direction. A Shavian trick is to introduce characters not by their proper names, but in mere brushstrokes. In this way, Candida is not introduced at first as herself, but merely as a WOMAN’S VOICE uttering the following command, characteristic of the woman of the house: “Say yes, James” (13). Candida tackles the subject of marriage , that societal institution which has plagued humanity forever—depicting what true modern love is all about (in other words, that comfort should be picked over adventure ). Both partners in the Morell marriage know exactly what the expectations are: what to expect from their spouse and what is expected of them. Morell treats his wife, it seems, the way she wishes to be treated (fulfilling effectively her role as nurturer). Basically, Morell is the man of the house (he knows his household and the members therein), and even Candida comes out, siding with this undeniable truth. She tells Marchbanks: “Stop! (He obeys.) Didn’t you hear James say he wished you to stay? James is master here. Don’t you know that (48)?” The marriage is strong since both partners understand their purpose in the union. Candide, portraying an entire world and entire populations which inhabit its belligerent, uneasy surface, also has enough time to comment on the union between two people (which means, basically, that marriage, to Voltaire, is as important and as life-altering as massacres, rape, famine, and death). Pangloss , mentor to Candide, is the first example of what Voltaire made of the topic: It is love that is the cause of Pangloss’ distress, and similarly to Candide he suffers for it. He slowly dies from venereal disease —so is this, then, a pro-marriage postulation? It certainly could be a sly nod to the enterprise. Alas, Cunégonde is lost to Candide sporadically throughout the tale; he keeps losing her, then regaining her (the theme of fate and the rare character trait of optimism are henceforth shown). She tells him about the bad treatment she’s had to endure, not to exclude the strange relationships that were forged in light of Candide’s absence. Again, fidelity seems to take the forefront—winning clearly over polygamy . Voltaire does not tell us about marriage in as explicit terms as Shaw, though it is very evident that his ideas on marriage have made a niche all their own in the all-encompassing epic. Candide’s socialist inclinations are precisely why, I venture to guess, the classic is no longer being read or studied at school. The messages relayed may be found dangerous by the modern status quo. Morell hints at the social obligation of caring for his fellow man, though this is but a hint of Shaw’s actual political proclivities. Basically, if an important man like Morell is happy, then all those belonging to his surroundings will benefit from his moods and mindsets. In the picaresque fantasy, Candide and his pals find Eldorado: “The travelers did not fail to pick up the gold, the rubies, and the emeralds. ‘Where are we?’ exclaimed Candide. ‘Kings’ children must be well brought up in this country, since they teach them to despise golden jewels’” (52). When Voltaire writes of Eldorado, a perpetual paradise on earth (which does not exist!), he writes what the perfect, idyllic world would be: “No doubt you have none of this country’s money, but it is not necessary to have any in order to dine here. All the hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid for by the government,” says a resident of the utopia (52).The interpersonal relationships in Candide and Candida are essential to the plot. Despite Candide’s immense stage—practically the entire globe is traversed —it is the relationships forged between the protagonist and recurring (and resurrecting) supporting characters which follows Voltaire’s everlasting themes of the everlasting nature of constant comforts, and free will versus fate. Likewise, in Candida, our protagonist is surrounded by demi-dunces—it is in the dialogue that the entire plot resides—and it is her interaction with these players (five in total, just as Candide ends his journey with five characters faithfully by his side : James Morell, Eugene Marchbanks, Mr. Burgess, Reverend Alexander Mill and Proserpine “Prossy” Garnett ) and the constant generation of ideas and beliefs is what moves the play to its fated conclusion. “[The struggle is] between Morell, who symbolizes Christian Socialist idealism, and is clear-sighted, bold, sure of himself, a man who takes short views; and Eugene, who symbolizes poetic idealism, and is lofty-spirited, a lover of beauty, but vague and confused in his mind” (Nickson 141). Character types: the dramatist must know these as intimately as he knows the language. Candide has to change because his surroundings demand it—he tries to survive and as a result kills two men . But he never does go against himself—his core remains the same. Shaw, however, in this instance of domestic claustrophobia—a full house where occupants are forced to interact (and not just escape, as Candide is so fond of doing)—orchestrates perfectly what the characters say, and what their overall role in the drama is. So, while Voltaire has an absolute blast playing with several character stereotypes, Shaw switches the roles of his characters enough to make the drama dramatic enough. Candida , just like her male counterpart (decades and decades older, of course), remains constant. What occurs around her, just as what surrounds Candide, is what the audience notices; her reactions to all this stimuli is what propels the play forward. And so, after some closer deliberation, it becomes clear that it is not Candida who Candide most resembles. In fact, he is doppelganger to the young poet Marchbanks, who embodies both optimism (laced with romance, of course) and naiveté. Candide is “a young man whom nature had endowed with the gentlest of characters. His face bespoke his soul. His judgment was rather sound and his mind of the simplest; this is the reason, I think, why he was named Candide. Therefore, we see that Marchbanks is the Candide in Candida—what he learns from the experience is what the audience/reader learn with him; it is commonly thought that Marchbanks is the actual protagonist of Candida. They are both green, ripe, and inexperienced. But whereas Marchbanks uses excuses and poetic flights of fancy and ultimately uses his youth as a safety shield, as some proud badge, Candide is moved into action—he kills men to escape his own demise; he is truthful and consistently reacts in both deed and word to the chaos of the outer world. He even becomes, in another exquisite twist from Voltaire, quite successful in the war field: “Candide, having served with the Bulgarians, performed the Bulgarian drill before the general of the little army with so much grace, celerity, skill, pride, and agility, that they gave him an infantry company to command” (34). Marchbanks is clearly a dud: he is open-minded, though, but still acts like a child in dire need of experience. Candide’s world is so different from Candida’s and Shaw’s—his situation is more “desperation” and less “costume drama.” But Shaw makes Marchbanks from the same clay that Voltaire himself used to form his up-and-coming main man. The archetype is so successful because the reader/audience member places himself in the actual (fictional) shoes of that youngster, who, as in true life, is simultaneously living and trying to make sense of that life. Candide and Candida both end exactly as they should; rather, each conclusion is reached at with an outstanding predictability—each storyteller has prepared his audience enough to reach the point where no other ending would do. Candide ends a few lines after this “postscript:” ”His wife (Cunégonde), becoming uglier every day, became shrewish and intolerable; the old woman was an invalid and even more bad humored than Cunégonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden and who went and sold vegetables at Constantinople, was worn out with work and cursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining at some university in Germany. As for Martin, he was firmly persuaded that a man is equally badly off anywhere; he 	took things patiently” (98). And because everything that came before it was completely horrifying—most vistas horribly blood-soaked and pandemonium running amok—we know that a lesson will be learned at the end (see footnote 13); that this was, all along, a fairy tale for adults in the vein of Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s Le Petit Prince; and that the outcome won’t be idyllic. In the same vein, when Candida gives herself to the “weaker of the two,” she is doing exactly what had been expected all along (50). “They embrace,” Candida ends. “But they do not know the secret in the poets heart” (52). Again, there is some residual feeling left over, just as the reader is not given his “…and they lived happily ever after” by the crafty Voltaire. Do we care that Candida and Morell are back in each other’s arms, as if nothing has occurred? Crisis was averted—so whatever happens next to the proven couple is not truly of our immediate interest. Do we care that Candide and Co. are still striving to get by, looking all an absolute fright attempting to do so? They are finally, at long last, together; so the answer, too, is no.A very substantial point of comparison lies with the progenitors of each distinct piece—our final element of correlation. When Voltaire penned his masterpiece, he was well-experienced and incredibly apt. George Bernard Shaw wrote 63 plays total, all of them after he was thirty (he wrote Candida in 1894, when he was 38). Voltaire, being the bohemian nonconformist that he was, lived to be 84 and Shaw died at the robust age of 94—their environments being so opposite, it is a wonder how, similarly, they outlived the natural life expectancy of their time to accomplish all they did. Indeed, both began their work only after having made several observations and established some theories of life. And transcending the natural barriers of age, it is also a commonly held fact that they were both, in their own way, über-reactionary: the purpose of their writing was to inform on the social circumstances of their age. For Voltaire, censorship was the main devil; Shaw, on the other hand, was often discontent with the global condition at large, but of Europe’s in general and England’s in particular. Both writers hold the same motor of rebellion and the overwhelming, perpetual desire for changes in an ever-constricted society. This is what moved them both—they share similar inspirations. “Voltaire was always a man of action,” says Frame. “Highly volatile, sensitive, ambitious, emotional, irascible and generous, vindictive and compassionate, he found his greatest satisfaction and release in work. But work, to satisfy him, must act on others” (xi). Shaw embodies this, too. And just as Shaw, Voltaire was so loose-tonged that “he once complained to Rosseau [that he] wrote for the sake of writing, while he himself wrote in the interest of action” (xi). Both writers were adamant socialists. To validate love, Voltaire adds the socialist angle to his book (says Candide: “I have saved your sister from the arms of a Jew and an Inquisitor; she has obligations toward me, she wants to marry me; Dr. Pangloss always told me that men are equal, and certainly I shall marry her” [48]); Shaw values love in a different way—it is the perfect mix between what you make of your role in society and how you actually feel about your significant other.  What is optimism? Candide defines it as “the mania of maintaining that all is well when we are miserable” (61)! We have, on the other hand, also “A Mystery”: What is at the core of human relationships? Candida’s charisma is so strong that her husband “mysteriously” puts her up on the auction block, only to prove that age-old adage of “When you love something, you set it free…” Candide’s brand of optimism also works to his advantage—in the end. Both works relay something about the sacrament of marriage (for Candida: that like a well-oiled machine the duo must work together, complimenting differences the entire way; for Candide: that it means nothing much—he urges you to simply remain by your girl’s side, despite any outward appearances, and to help out your fellow man) and gives us hints pointing toward the overall goodness of socialism. Character types and character relationships are also similar. Both finales are totally satisfying. And, the last uniting strand: both writers wrote for the same reason. They both wanted to move the world to action; they wanted to take on the evil of the zeitgeist, and rattle the entire world!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 03, 2012","Dec 11, 2012","Dec 03, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19387.Candide_Zadig_and_Selected_Stories

Her first invaluable gem of wisdom? “Young or beginning writers must be urged to read widely, ceaselessly, both classics and contemporaries, for without an immersion in the history of the craft, one is doomed to remain an amateur: an individual for whom enthusiasm is ninety-nine percent of the creative effort."" Which means that only readers become writers—already, this has been highlighted over and over ad nauseum by the likes of Stephen King, Francine Prose, Mario Vargas Llosa & plenty others. Of course, her “faith as a writer” is her personal poetics themselves—already on page one she has set down her beliefs; the core of her craft. “The individual voice,” she tells us, “is the communal voice. The regional voice is the universal voice.""Musing about the origin of your reading addiction is a pleasant and constant activity. JCO makes us all sigh in relief when she recalls her first memories with literature. Although I particularly abhor the Alice books, I do agree with JCO in her assessment that as a child, the allure of books contained the “voices of adult authenticity."" Wanting to grow up, indeed, goes hand in hand with constantly reading about adult themes and situations. When in elementary school, the avid reader, the smart kid, finds that there are riches beyond his wildest dreams in books by King, and Anne Rice, and anything that is strange and fascinating, and he finally leaves behind short adolescent novels by the likes of R. L. Stine, Stephanie Meyer, and Judy Blume.In “To a Young Writer” we are once more showered with damn good advice. A list: 1) “your struggle…your emotions…make possible hours, days, weeks, months and years of what will appear to others…as ‘work’.”2) Don’t lose courage or compare yourself to others (“if you want confirmation of your essential worthlessness, you can always find it, somewhere"").3) “Write for your own time, if not for your own generation exclusively.""4) “immerse” yourself in whatever strikes you—be as idealist, romantic, “yearning” as you wish, for this will come to your aid.5) And Write your heart out, she repeats and repeats, like some magic, poetic mantra. Again, a sigh of relief emanates from me, with JCO’s advice #3. I write contemporary stuff—so that’s clearly a plus—it certainly does inspire relief.One facet of the writer’s life no other writer has, to my knowledge, made mere mention of as of yet is that of failure. In “Notes on Failure” JCO wisely tells her readers that the writer is a bizarre creature (duh); some masochistically believe in the needlepoint philosophy of “Beware the danger in happiness!” even though they have an “addictive nature of incompletion and risk."" Also, I am glad that in “Inspiration!” there is an appropriate mention of the early Surrealists—perhaps ""Synesthetes"" is majorly affected by their haunting influence?—of which JCO writes: “[Their] images were, at the outset, purely ordinary images, decontextualized and made strange.” I think this is the modern condition of every single writer living today: with every single plot and character type already having been discovered, there is only one genuine chance of creating a masterpiece by picking out (“borrowing"") what works for that singular piece itself.  Perhaps the best reason to listen to JCO (What?! No recommended reading?!) is that, although she is incredibly prolific and has incredible range (novels, poetry, YA fiction, story collections, plays, essays…), she, too, knows a twinge about failure. I will admit that I’ve read gems of hers, novels such as Zombie and Black Water, but blatant crap like Oprah Book Club selection We Were the Mulvaneys is so totally disappointing, especially since she was already a literary behemoth by that time, that the legend of JCO becomes completely human—and that, at least, I can empathize with.

Vera Chytilova), that shameless classic of the Czech New Wave while reading OhraI could not help but think of the film ""Daisies"" (“Sedmikrasky,” dir. Vera Chytilova), that shameless classic of the Czech New Wave while reading Ohran Pamuk’s My Name is Red. That brilliant & psychedelic film of the 60’s portrays two incessant, silly girls who seem to want to emphasize their existence by playing pranks on other people and being undeniably obnoxious. They are terrified at the idea of being forgotten—of not existing. Similarly, in Pamuk’s epic novel of conspiring miniaturists, of love and death, the reader is confronted with the theme of existence. There is an unknown presence which strives to be part of the reader’s consciousness—which, like the two unremitting, adolescent & undeniably-alive individuals of the film, tries its hardest to appear, to become known & acknowledged.My Name is Red has a radical structure. As I read more and more books, it becomes increasingly clear that some writers take an enormous amount of effort in establishing a frame, a “cabinet of curiosities” (in the same tradition as MVL’s “Chinese boxes” and “communicating vessels) in which to properly display their creations. For example, A. S. Byatt, in her Booker-prize winning novel ""Possession,"" a novel that is more poetry book than a novel, creates several frames in which to place all the poetry which two poets keep exchanging as tokens of their love. Byatt obviously wants to make her poetry accessible, and gives it further clout by giving each poet his or her unique voice—by fully creating two different minds. Pamuk also uses the novel to display his craft, establishing a museum in which to showcase his “paintings”: his cabinet of curiosities includes, not poems, but individual vignettes, brush-stroke tableaus which represent but one facet of a full universe. The conglomeration of these makes up the bulk—gives the reader the voice, the theme & style—of the novel. “If I could only,” the nameless murderer tells Enishte Effendi, “see the last picture in its entirety” (158). Both the character’s expectations and the reader’s match—their journey is, therefore, genuinely entwined. The reader wants to know what all these different vignettes will culminate in. The wants of a fictional character and those of an actual live reader are the one and the same—this is the main catalyst which moves the narrative to its awesome conclusion. The reader is prepared to sift through the surplus of stories, images, and motifs to get to the bottom of this radical love story/murder mystery. Enishte Effendi admits: “They say we’ve committed an unforgivable sin by daring to draw, from the perspective of a mangy street dog, a horsefly and a mosque as if they were the same size” (158). Virginia Woolf’s literary sense of character democracy, of consciousness-equality, is pretty much Pamuk’s own. By depicting various POVs, by making them authentic and articulate, Pamuk seems to rationalize like many of the great writers that every tiny aspect of the plot is essential—only with all of these different takes on the same thing (the murder of Elegant and the love story of Black and Shekure) can the reader get a faithful interpretation of such enormous complexity and chaos. There is a consciousness which ties the characters together, and it is perhaps the force of life itself. The crazy girls perturb the status quo when they admit that they want to live (live!) in Daisies. The different entities (whether they be annoying Shekure or the talking picture of a dog, or literally, the color red) all possess life and they indulge the reader in their personal and unique elucidations on life in 16th-century Istanbul. The added element, that is, all the writer’s own beliefs in art (writing is aptly compared to painting) are present in Red, and the work transcends not only the rules of storytelling by having such incredibly different characters in it with such unique voices, but also because it dabbles with the postmodern idea of reading about art within a work of art.All that being said, there is a grave problem with the pacing of the book--it took me forever to complete this (and lets face it, Gone With the Wind this is not). Also, there is a ceaseless amount of repetition of events, a constant reassurance that seems extraneous-- a recompilation of different occurrences voiced by the different (though extremely intriguing) characters. The themes, rich in the context of the production of art, are very appropriate and very revolutionary. This is a postmodern work which of course still lingers on the romantic, and then plays around some with the detective novel genre....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,Oct 2012,"Oct 24, 2012","Oct 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2517.My_Name_Is_Red

(What unites a trilogy is, I would guess, the coming back to the origin tale, or part I, in the last part of the series.) What I love in de Bernieres' fantastic fantasias (""The English answer to Gabriel Garcia Marquez"" states its back book cover) is his dog gone playfulness--absolute & rather enviable. For instance, the central story is NOT the central story, or, rather, Cardinal Guzman's dilemma stemming from his ""offspring"" (which is bizarre and o-so-right--giving way to a religious, if not pretty unethical, conclusion which makes me smile with absolute satisfaction) reminds us that in this trilogy no one has the center stage at any given time...the convolusion thence creates intricate/comedic/dramatic stages fueled by wit and utmost originality. Louis de Bernieres loves to devastate his reader with tragedy piled upon tragedy, albeit all gloriously intercut by episodes of complete and utter hilarity. It is truly rollercoasteresque... the air leaves your lungs freely only to be the cause of your intense suffocation later on. Belonging next to, I am quite serious, Tolkien, this fake Latin American community belongs, where mere mortals and ghosts and even omnipresent gods convene and all have a merry, satirical, whimsical, and sometimes quite tremendously sad, time. I call it lovely, I call it wondrous--unlike all the Latin writers because it possesses authentic Britishistic flair.

This is authentic rambling & genuinely just one loooong continuous drivel. All of it: sound and fury signifying… nothing. It’s a true pity that the book is so inaccessible, unreadable; it invites for some spontaneous skimming to occur, something a book must never inspire in its reader. The setting is magnificent, but certainly not unalike Henry Miller with his snooze-inducing masterpiece impostor “Tropic of Cancer,” the uglification of Mexico is as abhorrent & ridiculous as the descriptions of rancid Paris in “Tropic.” There is not one single sentence clever enough, beautiful enough, even at all special or pretending to be special. Lowry decides to produce one of the only books that I can think of that is totally devoid at least ONE special, one poetic sentence. It's that horrible! “The eternal sorrow that never sleeps of great Mexico…”: this certainly is a promise left unfulfilled. We get nasty descriptions which repeat endlessly, all in a headache-inducing loop, just as the brain of a drunkard reels about. Aimlessness--murkiness, being inside the mind of a drunk without being drunk ourselves is a total bust. This is that overly-typical story of the crazy gringo (well, a displaced British Consul, actually) getting “tight” on a Mexican holiday, the unintentionally un-symbolic Day of the Dead, boozing on mescal and myriad other liquors which appear before him like mirages in the wild. Why are stories with roaring drunks in ‘em so critically lauded? I REALLY don’t get it…! Unlike Hunter S. Thompson’s “The Rum Diary,” or any of the innumerable American plays (by Arthur Miller, by Eugene O’Neill, by Edward Albee… you know exactly the tragic type) this one makes it hellish for the reader himself (poor poor guy) to really delve into the novel; into the awful sways and malicious deviations from a proper plot and proper character portrayals. It’s insipid, it‘s a novel which transpires one fateful day but feels like one l-o-n-g, sad weekend; actually, like an entire week of swimming in alcohol like a booze hound.

Mario Vargas Llosa (who took several years off of his busy novel-writing to write about his now-ex-pal Gabriel Garcia Marquez). But I suddenly forgot who the King was (no, I mean literally: I've not read him in years! High school being the prime time for Stephen King, & all): the guy has useful insight, no shit, because he is not only prolific & uber-successful (he got $400,000 for his first novel “Carrie”!), but because, let’s all admit it, he’s pretty damn good. Maybe prose is not the forte per se, but story sure is (think of how many times he has tapped the vein of the zeitgeist to produce visceral, emblematic and modern monsters). It's interesting to compare this with the only other non-fiction I’ve read of late, “The Perpetual Orgy” & “Letters to a Young Novelist” by the already mentioned Peruvian auteur. They both (Vargas Llosa and King) tell us to seriously commit to writing, to write, write, write, write, WRITE, but, even more splendidly, they endorse heavy reading (duh!). I love Stephen King quotes, like this little morsel of truth: “If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time or the tools to write.” Take that, non-reading punks verging-perilously-close-to-ignoramuses! !Let me recall some of the stuff I’ve learned (the rest has been absorbed as if by osmosis): 1) rewrite at least two times once the novel has been completed, 2) write & read for at least 5 hours every single day, 3) IMPORTANT: look for an editor (they are eager for new talent, King says), 4) VERY IMPORTANT: begin a serious submitting process (L. Williford has always emphasized the importance of this!), 5) write solely to your IR (Ideal Reader)… it's all super helpful. Perhaps the “Toolbox” section is its weakest part (inversely, MVL’s bag of tricks is on glorious display in “Letters” [though he never mentions the publishing process like King does])… going over rudimentary English is, I am forced to admit, quite lame. But King does seem enthusiastic throughout as only the best teachers are in the classroom—his tone is one of (slight) optimism for the developing novelist. He cheers you on (THE Stephen King!) !!!

The guy, Ballard, takes the stuff from your dreariest of dreams, from your most melancholic nightmares, and the novel transports you to a surreal place where the reader succumbs to a spell very few others can successfully contrive. This is one satanic “Titanic.” It’s an insidious “Poseidon Adventure.” Clever, scary, morbid, new: metaphorical. Truly, really, the most horrific thing in this world is a crowd with one uniting thought hovering over their heads, with a taste for blood on their lips (and doesn't Stephen King know this!). These people are the REAL zombies.Indeed, it’s a horror novel; and one of the best at that. I read it deep into the night, like only the best books deserve to be read.

The fierce literati kept the attendance so high that it was virtually as if Lady Gaga herself were to give a lecture on her impressive body of work. I was more interested in walking all around Chitown, anyway, but I really (sorta) regret not having nabbed a coveted seat. She was probably amazing: uberclever & brilliant.Without two minor (teeny) infractions, “Alias Grace” is pretty much a well-rounded, totalizing, COMPLETE novel—one which paints a full world with such realistic colors that the reader quickly forgets that the plot actually comes from the 1850’s Annals of Canadian Crime. Before I start extolling it madly, let me quickly state what those two “minor infractions” are: Grace’s 1st-person accounts are not completely authentic-sounding; they are far too articulate and intelligent—symbols become too clearly presented to the reader (who should feel slightly MORE confused, as psyches are often deep chasms) as the author’s own signature is made overly-clear in Grace’s own declarations (Atwood adds on her character’s openly-questionable credibility pretty early on, to her credit). Also, there is this feeling that without that added spice of changing POV’s and tenses, the plot would have been banal & tedious—the middle indeed sags, but the conclusion, the last 80 pages of it, is ultimately positively stellar. Luckily for us, the writer was hyperaware of how much of her own added element would befit this seemingly-simple story of homicide. Those symbols of femininity (the red peonies, the patchwork quilt, the washing & scrap-booking) have never been placed in such intense context before—I was genuinely enthralled, impressed like a rabid Atwood fanboy.

On the other hand, “The House of Mirth” describes the downward spiral of one, Miss Lily Bart, misunderstood by her social “set,” her particular New York niche. Her story is a tragedy as deep as Jude (the Obscure)’s—her plight is both melancholic & devastating—New York has always been a perfect place in which to achieve some sort of victimhood. Another attribute: the story is severely overwritten. I say attribute because that is precisely Mrs. Wharton’s style: you read beautiful sentences, many, to realize that all she really wanted to portray was a character sitting down on his ass, or she tries to show particular psyches without the more-modern, less-roundabout, most efficient manner of, say, Virginia Woolf (alas, if Mrs. Wharton had continued to write well into the 30's we may have seen a different, more radical literary style). The novel is trapped between novelty (modernity) & antiquity (a European America). Sure, this is an amazing study of turn-of-the-century American society, invaluable, one which seems as foreign as it seems familiar; I was not as impressed with this one as her Pulitzer darling (man, I DO LOVE ""Age of Innocence""!!), where the mood is less frigid & less tragic, but the theme pretty much stays the same: mainly, that society is very unforgiving, that “half the trouble in life is caused by pretending there isn’t any.”...more",Notes are private!,0,124,1,"May 16, 2012","May 22, 2012","May 16, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17728.The_House_of_Mirth

But reading Eugenides involves becoming hyper-aware of just how much pretentiousness exists in all other modern novels. Eugenides is the most unpretentious of the modern masters: he writes like a river that flows evenly, that contains only the purest of sentences--he's stylistically uncomplicated. This time around, leaving behind those manic depressive virgins and poignant hermaphrodites of yesteryear, Eugenides manages to find the poetry in the minutiae which writers like Dave Eggers or Jonathan Franzen could only dream about. Eugenides is both the literati’s best friend and the casual reader’s companion. Although it is a gamble to introduce yet another love triangle to the literary sphere, the Pulitzer winner obviously pulls it off—giving his audience pretty much what they’ve wanted for years (that is, something less heavy than his last two novels of adolescent despair, for one that’s more optimistic about modern love while still remaining authentically moving)....more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,"May 10, 2012","May 16, 2012","May 10, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot

But the second part, which DOES relate a romance between a Frenchwoman and (gasp!) a German soldier, makes the whole really, truly uneven (entitled ""Dolce,"" that second part was often found to be more ""Dull-ce""). Although I was truly stirred by the descriptions of the hot German soldier looking all masculine while still retaining the monster within, I kept asking myself: What happened to all the characters from the first part? That their fates were blurred away makes so much sense in a historical, even aesthetic, way. In all reality, many lives, like that of the writer herself, who died in a concentration camp a year or two later, were erased forever... just like that, many stories were left sadly unfinished.

What we have amid this convoluted mess are five interweaving story lines (that of Bonifacia, that of Lituma, that of Fushia, that of Anselmo and that of Jum), more than two dozen characters inhabiting a town where the laws of cause and effect are topsy-turvy in the most confusing way; where the rules of the usual 19th century novel are wholly discarded & new ones are implemented in their place. There reigns chaos, and following the rules of the modernist novel the characters have a limited set of possibilities for leading the lives that they truly covet. Their confusion invariably mirrors the reader’s plight through the hefty jungle of words and conglomeration of diverse literary styles. There is first, second, and third person narration here; there are skips through time and interesting plays of focalization. According to narrative theorists, “The Green House” contains more than four narrative modes, or frames (“the mythical narrator”, “straightforward narration”, “montage [combination of MVL’s Chinese boxes & communicating vessels]” and “compressed narration”), placing it in a unique niche all its own: as Vargas Llosa’s sophomore novel, it is always seeking complexity, almost to the point of overreaching for that magic that is so prevalent amongst his much-later novels (including, of course, “Feast of the Goat” &, earlier, “The Storyteller”). Sure, the effect of fragmentation and richness is truly captured here; the hard part is keeping in mind all the different conventions Llosa constructs and destroys, the hard part is not getting lost. One gets the sense that the reader will never get to the bottom of this, that he will never know the truth. Another of the book’s fortes (with a surplus of detracting elements, it should be emphasized, such as wild, crazy juxtapositions) is that it is left unsettling throughout, while it tackles racial, cultural and social misdeeds. The clash of the classes had never fallen victim to this kind of miscommunication and fragmentation before: like a true work of art the theme is therefore fully realized....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Mar 19, 2012","Mar 30, 2012","Mar 19, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53972.The_Green_House

Gee, that one seems so wholly different from Madame Bovary, the story of “unrequited passion” which is a perennial favorite among literati & book enthusiasts the world over. So, instead, tackle The Perpetual Orgy, perhaps the most extensive research paper ever written by an indisputable genius. Mario Vargas Llosa’s oeuvre is a valediction of Flaubert’s greatness. It is surely included in his extensive repertoire of novels (The War of the End of the World, Conversation in the Cathedral, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta…) because it carries the significant heft of a novel: it (like the autobiography Antes que anochezca, or the historical semi-fiction Schindler’s List and Vargas Llosa’s The Feast of the Goat, or the epic nonfiction The Labyrinth of Solitude by Octavio Paz) is as thrilling as a real novel; as relevant, & passionate, & as literary as any actual novel. Reading it was a pleasure; a pleasure I know only afforded those who have read the Flaubert classic, who have also cemented some type of relationship with it (everyone who’s read it to its tragic conclusion will have had formed some sort of relationship, or reaction, to it, definitely). In intrepid form, Vargas Llosa does what many could only dream of doing: he has answered that age old question I really know what I like—but why? He gives us an actual explanation as to his personal tastes—he manages to inspire the lover of literature to remain in awe at such pointed and astute adulation.“Emma was killing herself in order that I might live” Vargas Llosa ruminates, with tremendous guts & guile. (This seems to be the same logic behind Woolf’s decision to kill off the Septimus Warren Smith in that other interplay of contrasts, the classic Mrs.Dalloway.) I have discovered that the very reason one reads scenes of death or violence is because the action contrasts so severely with the reader’s own menial everyday. This is called living vicariously through literature. Because the reader doesn’t suffer, because the only thing he must overcome is the next page of text, & then the next, & the next—the scenes of calamity are particularly delicious. Vargas Llosa has the Flaubertian scholar completely down—this novel-sized novel-conscious nonfiction extends the possibilities of the classic novel, already more than 150 years old. The Perpetual Orgy is the most adequate, the most reverent, of companion pieces. Making Flaubert’s story the central work of this enterprise is what finally merges the poetics of the Latin American 20th century maestro with the French 19th century one. It was a real treat to go through Madame Bovary’s genesis. Her origin tale is enthralling, perhaps the topic of an entire separate work! It was a creation born of multiple sources, the sum of experiences that the writer had under his belt, pitted out into the world with the same austerity as a confessional.The novel, “the very exemplar of the closed work, of the book that is a perfect circle,” took a considerable time of “gestation”—for the chemical reaction to actually occur. When Vargas Llosa writes about the humility given objects by Flaubert, the reader realizes just how strong that bond between both literary giants is. “The human suffuses things & things the human."" There is an inherent tenderness, an overbearing respect for Madame Bovary that it really,truly becomes an indispensable text to accentuate the overall Flaubert experience....more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Feb 23, 2012","Feb 29, 2012","Feb 23, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53976.The_Perpetual_Orgy

It encompasses the brave enormous space taken by Franzen’s narrative about a (Dysfunctional? Emblematic? Typical?) family living in the new millennium: about dashed potentials and “mistakes that we(re) made.” There is here the always-pesky problem which plagued revered “Rabbit Armstrong”’s insipid existence (over 4 decades long): Who really cares for these revolting folks?

That one had a certain mechanism which let the reader become hooked to it till the bitter end. But this one is ambiguous in many respects, has no motorized heart, except in explicit sentences with complicated structures & paragraphs almost over-puffed with full-on pretentiousness. It is also a sad victim of the gross crime of “Overthinking It”: Did it really take almost 600 pages to tell the simple tale of infidelity & a family’s total dissatisfaction with modernity?

Ballard, has finally the guts to tackle this {sadly… pretty conservative view} of incredibly large populations of people taking over and their eventual {& uber-understandable!} depletion of the globe’s natural resources!]).I hated all people in this. Every single one had a fault that lead to my entire uninspired apathy. The husband is blinded by his incredibly-focused dreams of a better world. He lets the siblings have their freedoms and they, in turn, become rebellious. Obviously the main obstacle here is No Understanding, since everyone is definitely quite selfish. The mother is a woman who married the wrong guy and looks for the missing fulfillment: how did she never notice her mistake? (Wow- Madame Bovary—still relevant today, to everyone’s detriment.) & the son… well, he becomes a young Republican, makes a bundle of money for himself, so let that just speak for itself (on top of which: I really despised this brat… his idleness I find synonymous with the All-American Useless Straight Guy… a deplorable contemporary archetype in whose presence I refuse to be… Imagine me sitting through 200 plus pages of his infamous adventures, his altogether selfish persona... the reading truly becomes a chore).Here, the decade may have been personified to a tee, but I honestly KNOW that there is better fiction out there, one that does away with this new brand of American Coolness: too detailed and too psychotic, altogether tragic, sometimes dull and persistently l-o-o-OOOn-g.

Perplexing & ultimately mind-bending, Murakami helps his reader out by using prose that's as unpretentious as possible. He gives us clues as to how to get out of the labyrinth he's constructed in one piece by utilizing images & motifs, allegory and metaphor, constructing an entire world that seems to fit like a transparency over our own.

While ""Kafka"" continues with those previous ideas established by that other novel (mainly psychic awareness, secret hidden dimensions, metaphysics) it does manage to leave many loose ends, & the picture is not wholly complete; it is, alas, not a fully-rounded account of prophecies fulfilled as internal desires become manifested. Fish and eels dropping from the sky, talking with felines, interacting with spirits: all these are exciting elements to bring forth in a contemporary story.

I & II, Inglourious Basterds), then a writer who actually lived through it, through scenes of cold-blooded murder, can probably do much better. Joaquin Murieta, the Californian Hero, is, finally, an embodiment of the all-American rebel. The poster announces “FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD FOR JOAQUIN, DEAD OR ALIVE” & the bandit, in full public view, adds in pencil “I will give $10,000. Joaquin.” and this is what makes an antihero an antihero (68). James Dean had no cause, yet here in the wild frontier the opportunity is ripe for adventures and infamy. Joaquin takes it all: he takes full advantage of the situation, of the ridiculous enterprise of becoming filthy rich with gold dust from one day to the next. He steals from the rich, gives to the poor, & may or may not have lived.I cannot help but compare this extreme figure with that of murderous man Anton Chigurh, of No Country for Old Men. Cormac McCarthy is incredibly wise in retaining that ghostly figure of a man who represents soullessness and pure evil in his thrilling modern western tale. Joaquin definitely has a conscience; the character of Three-Fingered Jack is actually more of a psychological deviant than he. When Joaquin is ambushed by the Tejons (instead of the Americans!) and is stripped naked and thoroughly robbed, he is “grim for a while, but finally burst out into a loud laugh at his ridiculous position, and ever afterward endured his captivity with a quiet smile (38).” Resigning to one’s fate is often seen in these tales of the far west. Just as religious symbolism abounds in westerns, so does the motif of the passion of Jesus Christ. The hero resigns, takes it easy, plays it cool.

Yellowbird definitely knows how to tell a thrilling story: quick-paced, having scant poetic anecdotes and musings--an incredibly straight-forward account. Giving soliloquies to the rebels to the tune of “I love the smell of blood of a Chinaman. Besides, it’s such easy work to kill them. It’s a luxury to cut their throats” & you have yourself an absolutely merciless winner!

Considered to be intrepid & incredibly agile, they were the prototypical supermen who knew what was required to survive the fierce frontier. George Ruxton’s Life in the Far West introduces Killbuck, main trapper extraordinaire, as a man worthy of literary entitlement; the reader’s overriding cause in following closely the narrative. Here, the beginnings of the All-American Hero. And, I mean, how cool is it that “the trapper dressed in what is perhaps the only original American costume—the fringed buckskin suit.” Take that Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren! But really the story here is of La Bonte, a trapper whose maturity is gauged precisely as he survives Indian raids, scalps the enemy, takes on two wives (“as by mountain law allowed”), and coolly smokes his pipe instead of stressing out when his “property” is taken from him, “’at one fell swoop’.” According to Ruxton, trappers “possess a great advantage over the vacillating Indian, whose superstitious mind in a great degree paralyzes the physical energy of his active body; and in waiting for propitious signs and seasons before he undertakes an enterprise, he loses the opportunity which his white and more civilized enemy knows so well to profit by.” Again, tainted ever-so with racist commentary, Ruxton, like Lippard, uses the fantastic fountainhead that is the Far West in the 1850s for a perpetual playground, where “the Pawnees know, to their cost, that a mountaineer seldom pulls his trigger without sending a bullet to the mark.” The first chapter is fantastic, rife with excitement and adventure: campfire talk interrupted by hideous weather followed by an attack of “Injuns,” catapulting a daring rescue of the losses, death to the enemy, and a gracious visit to the Yutas (Utes). In Life in the Far West, again, “under the demoralizing influence of the liquor” Indians become savages. This, alcohol abuse, seems to be a trend with most of our readings. And then there are scenes of apocalypse (to contrast ever so perfectly with the deeds of the super mountaineers): a game of cards played for scalps, cannibalization (“…his horror to see the yet quivering body of one of the Indian squaws, with a large portion of flesh butchered from it, and part of which Forey was already greedily devouring."") and the cruel half-assed killing of Indians (“The savage, who received wounds sufficiently for twenty deaths, suddenly rose to a sitting posture, the fire shedding a glowing light upon the horrid spectacle. The face was a mass of clotted blood, which flowed from the lacerated and naked scalp, whilst gouts of blood streamed from eight gaping wounds in the naked breast.”) Then there’s more trivia to be acquired, for it isn’t true that it is dog’s meat which is more flavorful (Wah-to-Yah), but, rather, that of mountain lion. Also, horse blood can create “eyes bloodshot, and a giddy sickness,” “’Meat’s meat’”, & buffalo are tricky shots. These trappers are Viking-like. They get in fights and survive, or die. They trap and trade, and talk of trading. Superhero status is achieved, while the enemy is often butchered, and the reader is intrigued in the vivid travelogue of the frontier.Perhaps it's this which encapsulates Ruxton’s narrative, serving as a metaphor for the wild American frontier: “A cayeute, attracted by the scent of blood, drew near, unwitting of the canine feast in progress, and was likewise soon made dog of, and thrust into the boiling kettle with the rest.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 13, 2011","Oct 15, 2011","Oct 13, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2579530-life-in-the-far-west-american-exploration-and-travel-series

Her account has a disagreeable immediacy, no reflections nor personal retroaction give it any type of edginess or authority. The voice is dull and the reader must try hard to read between the lines, while Wah-to-Yah is thoroughly captivating throughout. His narrative begins in a different spirit altogether from the “Doña’s” haughty sense of entitlement: “In February, 1846, being then in my seventeenth year, I tossed away schoolbooks, and glided down the Mississippi river.” (Introduction) Mark Twain constructed his Huck Finn with exactly this type of joie de vivre; additionally, Garrard writes, “Any one, in the Far West, is romantically inclined.” (40)Similar experiences with prairie dogs, mirages, the “marriage ritual” (which unlike that in Black Hawk’s story exchanges the romantic flute playing to the girl with horse-tying to the girl’s father); buffalo chases, improvised beds for two male bodies against the harsh weather, Cheyenne kids with prematurely white hair… all these are never mentioned by the homebound Prairie princess. Garrard has a wider access to subjects such as the drunkenness of squaws and the taste of dogmeat. He tries to court a squaw, Smiling Moon, and fails. There is widespread talk of deaths that may or may not had transpired, and of an incredible jailbreak. The genuine camaraderie makes up for the tons of footnotes added on to Magoffin’s diary: Garrard met these men himself and talked with them and interacted amongst them, while Magoffin got most reports (to which she succums to in the last 50 or so pages of her journal) by--her husband.The effect of polishing this tale of the trail to turn it into an actual novel is a great improvement over the stumbling, half-finished, uneven lines produced by the housewife (“Travels in Mexico Commencing June 1846. El Diario de Dona Susanita Magoffin“), who more than observing with unyielding patience, only judges and pinpoints the (slight) disadvantages of being a stranger in a strange place--& to comply fully with the almighty Samuel Magoffin. Garrard knows his freedom (The object of the expedition, in which we were about to engage, was to travel as far as we could toward taos; kill and scalp every Mexican to be found, & collect all the animals belonging to the Company and the United States [138]) & writes about it: this account actually inspires the reader to fully formulate a grand picture of the grand old west.There is definitely a complete genuineness to Wah-to-yah: I expect this to be precisely its charm.

Their individual feats and destinies are told through over one hundred footnotes--all of which were not written by the principal author herself--though she is the very backbone to which all the (hi)stories are attached, like lichens unto a structure rife with even worst nuisances: a petite, awful whimsy & full-on girlish pettiness.The introduction is incorrect in saying that Magoffin had “unusual tolerance.” (xxxi) She's taken by the hand & shown only a discrete sample of frontier life by her successful husband, who she adulates every chance she can. The famous opening: “My journal tells a story tonight different from what it has ever done before. The curtain raises now with a new scene” (1) is evidence of what a production, most likely self-imposed, is put forth for the benefit of promoting ancient decrees of femininity. Like a lady, Magoffin blushes in front of the nude natives and has difficulty managing the servants. This woman--all she does--is play house at the frontier. She readies it and compares it to other, lesser, more unfortunate abodes in the neighborhood. She feels bad for not going to a church on the Sabbath day. If you wanted a thrilling tale, something perhaps as captivating as Black Hawk’s atrocious account, then this isn’t the book, though it does manage to contain a narrative: one devoid a personality other than that of a devoted-to-the-point-of-fanaticism wife (“The life of a wandering princess, mine.” [11]) whose limited point of view (“I picked numberless flowers with which the plains are covered, and… I threw them away to gather more”[7]) really prevents the text from becoming a particularly good one.I was decidedly more intrigued by the side notes which were at times like secret histories: tragedies that befell men shortly after Magoffin met them herself, men like Capt. Warner (killed 3 years later by Indians), and Mr. Robert Spears and J. Stewart (3 months later… ”their heads mashed with rocks” [109] by the Navajos). These editorial add-ons were far more shocking than Magoffin’s tale.

Historically, it represents an invaluable time capsule; the psychology of the Native American, an authentic chief no less, is, if not a more all-encompassing portrait of devastating war than The Diary of Anne Frank at least its equal--in its inherent sincerity and pathos. Never forgetting that the autobiography is actually a life story thrice filtered (from the Sac chief’s remembering tongue directly to the interpreter, then edited by yet a third man) it does contain a straightforward voice that vacillates easily between regret and grief, with a tone that is undeniably oppressed. The Sac chief’s main intention is “to vindicate [his] character from misinterpretation” (xxiii) but he does more than this: he gives us a grave full of atrocities committed by self-righteous, indolent fuckin white people. That, on top of musings, and questions open to discussion, and confessions, all accomplish what only the best of autobiographies can: to teach; usually, to warn against bad decisions that ruin lives, by transporting the reader directly to the writer’s specific place and time--& access to the pervading emotion of that pin-point.  By posing questions such as 	“All our country… was ceded to the united States for one thousand dollars a year! I will leave it to the people of the United States to say, whether our nation was properly represented in this treaty? Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by those four individuals?” (10) to the general audience, Black Hawk immediately makes us question too our very claim to land. The entire continent was eradicated of its people, and many injustices have been committed then and since. Giving us the particular decisions for his specific actions, explaining over and over why he desisted from moving his tribe out of danger or from going to war much earlier (“There was no reconverted plan to attack the whites at that time--but I am of the opinion now, had our party got into the fort, all the whites would have been killed” [11]). The messiness that characterizes books like “The Prairie” is felt here too, as alliances change at random, as enemies are made all too frequently between the people at the frontier. Finally, a disclosure on his tribe’s customs and deviations from Old World conventions are the nuggets of knowledge which contribute to its intrinsic patina of sadness. Allegiances to the Kickapoos, Ottawas, Pottowatomies and Winnebagoes gives proof of camaraderie, which the Americans and British often lacked. (Of the races, which is most human? the reader is inspired to wonder.) “The whites may do bad all their lives,” Black Hawk writes, “and then, if they were sorry for it when about to die, all is well!” (32) The knocking-down of religion, and of other institutions such as marriage (as the memorable crane dance [34-5] goes on to describe unions formed out of love, & not of duty) contrasts considerably with the absurd endorsement to General Scott for the presidency (77) and then his suggestion of clearing the country of “black skins.” (78) Black Hawk is prejudiced, himself. There is, alas, no hero in a man whose hand “had ever been raised against any but warriors”, though still remains intolerant of others. But one feels certain that this was more the doing of the two (white) men who adapted the true tale, than that of Black Hawk himself....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 14, 2011","Sep 17, 2011","Sep 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1443001.Life_of_Black_Hawk

While the actions of all the characters seem to occur in slow motion, dialogue is also the device used to slow down the pace of the narrative. The emigrants meet up with the over-the-hill character (Natty Bumppo, alias “the trapper”) from The Last of the Mohicans and they unite to stand against the Tetons. Natty Bumppo then becomes part of the human drama he has so evidently avoided in the past, paralleling his distaste for the sound of ax chopping wood. Does Fenimore Cooper say that woods-people, deer slayers, trappers, hunters, all easily assimilate to newly forming societies? Is it really that easy to speak to your own skin-type, when there’s absolutely nobody else around? There is a pervasive type of hesitation throughout the tale, in the manner the characters expose themselves, in the way the narrative is overabundant with words and extraneously extended descriptions.

This time around, ten years after the first Rabbit novel, Janice, Harry’s sad, insipid wife runs away, leaving Rabbit with the kid.

All the memorable scenes are there, & the spotlit romance is considerably widened in scope, as is the sturdy social studies lesson on the almighty American Civil War. I mean, everyone has the basic idea correct: the South took a tremendous thrashing. But having the loser’s POV take the forefront, even to the extent of exalting the KKK-- this, more than Scarlett O’Hara’s infamous bitchiness but overall fierceness as the antihero of this fantastic tale-- is what I fell in love with. The stars all aligned and for the first time in a long time the general reading audience had it correct. GWTW is a remarkable, unique reading experience.A reader simply isn’t one unless he or she has faced a behemoth like this one. This, ""The Odyssey,"" ""The 1001 Arabian Nights,"" ""Don Quixote,"" ""Lord of the Rings""... are all Musts. All epic & so awesome, THE primordial blockbusters of their time. You have enough time to live with the book, to form a relationship with it, to think about your future together... (It becomes an integral part of yourself…) Now, what do we get on this journey that is sadly missing in its technicolored, titanic doppelganger? The atrocities shown here of the war are not apt for a rated G film. The following questions are thoroughly answered... (mild SPOILER ALERT!) In what way did Gerald O'Hara gain ownership of Tara? What invisible connection exists between women and horses? How did the siege of Atlanta take place? Why Atlanta? What is Southern hospitality, really? (Priceless is the mentioning of several ostentatious Atlanta parties with only the Yankee army 22 miles away…! Priceless is the POV of the woman that stayed behind while all men are off to war…! Priceless the interconnections between folks [of course the world population was nil back then!]) And, How has the idea of masculinity changed from the 19th century? What is true sisterhood? What's Post-traumatic stress syndrome?The townships are fully described. GWTW has many protagonists, as they all add authenticity to the incredibly narrative. If there ever existed a valentine for a city in the elusive form of an epic historical romance, then it is this, for Atlanta! There are additional love stories which parallel Rhett’s and Scarlett’s & several romantic dates between the central lovers. Everyone, it seems, has fallen in love, which adds the hues of Romanticism to the epic Southern Myth. Too, there is sympathy for the devil, scorn for the overly dandified Yankees (They desecrated graves! Raped, and pillaged!), amazement at the aftereffects of the Civil War, including Reconstruction (which takes up many more pages than the war itself!). Missing from the silver screen? The characters of Wade and Ella, Scarlett’s first- and second-borns. They do nothing but highlight the main character’s flaws and selfishness. Frank Kennedy, also known as Mr. Scarlett O’Hara, the Second. And Will Benteen, the overseer at Tara would be one too many males within Scarlett’s (Vivien Leigh’s) periphery on film. Also: Scarlett almost getting attacked and raped; GWTW’s racy social commentary, all of the men partaking in early KKK activities. I will admit, GWTW is gee-wow! oh-so feminist... but also downright racist!Scarlett’s consciousness evolves. She turns from spoiled brat teen to fiery, materialistic bitch!! In her brain is the constant battle to get Ashley Wilkes, to get Tara. It is only here that I perceive similarities to “Twilight”: yearnings & adolescent ambivalence. These things, it seems, never change. Also, that Gotterdammerung, or, the dusk of the gods, the end of civilization, is apt to occur in our times, and soon: this is a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled…!  The British have “Wuthering Heights,” “Pride and Prejudice; We got “Gone With the Wind”, an epic so incredible, so full of wuthering heights and perplexing downfalls, so jam packed with southern pride and arrogance, of prejudice and passion, that it is simply sad that its sole detriment is (not its length, nor its melodrama, but) its racist edge. GWTW is the s**t in many respects, but it is the dialogue between the star-crossed lovers (positively Wilde in its cleverness, in its tongue-in-cheekness) which elevates it to a plane higher than its sturdy, more lauded colleagues.

A man whose fortune is reversed; a war-torn stage; a modern Holocaust; sadistic regimes. ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" is the Schindler legend reproduced: it evokes the same tension of living lives in a death camp, all the while keeping the First Person POV pulsating with life, afire, though always dwindling between morality and evil, between life & death.Not so strange that of ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" Graham Greene wrote ""A remarkable & original book."" His spectacular ""The Quiet American"", also a novella robust with pathos and adventure, is emulated here as the Magistrate, torn apart over his conscience and his duties to the Empire, finds solace in one of the enemy. Because the voice of the protagonist is so damn credible, full of contradictions and deep thoughts it is that verisimilitude is fully achieved. We get both a man in complete ""Hamlet"" gear (perhaps as ill equipped as Coetzee's Slow Man, or his doe-eyed, hare-lipped Michael K. to the ravishes of a deeply-apathetic world) & a lesson in (far-flung, private, hidden) history.It's pretty obvious to see why this deserves a very-coveted place in the canon, in literature.

Although the tale is quite specific, it must be mentioned that Roth masters that considerable challenge of making one man stand for the billion of others. The shared fate of death, the Unifyer, is what Roth, as an aging novelist, as an aging man, contemplates; with an ease & with a poetry as brutal as Tolstoy, Roth knows exactly how to earn his IMMORTALITY....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2011","Jun 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50695.Everyman

All four novels I've read (""Disgrace,"" ""Elizabeth Costello,"" ""Life and Times of Michael K.,"" this, & currently a fifth classic: ""Waiting for the Barbarians"") are distinctly different from each other, and this being his most current (perhaps there is a newer?) it has the figure of the lonely fallen man (""Disgrace"") making sense of a new way of life; in this instance it is a grown man, newly amputated, slow and immobile, who takes center stage. More so than ""Elizabeth Costello"" (that Nobel-prize-worthy novel, and my favorite of Coetzee's), the taking over of the protagonist's psyche is so complete that growing paranoid was never before perceived to be this much fun. The reader's sensibilities are likewise Paul's, & they both go mad together. Also taking contemporary issues (the social boiling pot that is South Africa; the differences in cultures, customs and lives) he does yet another masterful genre-splice: the tricky postmodern Murakami-meets-Saramago turn: Elizabeth Costello's (the writer's) strange presence in this (his next) novel...! Is it me or was the question set forth ""What happens when the character in a plot meets it's writer/creator?"" (Plenty of modern masters have tried to set a foot in Borges's metafictional terrain.)

Sure, many elements must converge to make a wee autobiography one outstanding read. Here's the jist: Eggers is an almost-household name writer who abuses his witty (ha-ha-ha) title and confounds the reader with an (incredibly dragged-out) insistence upon his own life story. Bookmarked by the dual tragedy of losing parents to cancer (within weeks of one another) are a bunch of vanilla events making up the bulk of the narrative: the guy knows just how vanilla it all is, and by using the tragedy as a platform to exalt HIMSELF (!) he can comfortably become the new superliterary Tyra Banks. Obviously by starting with the incident and by ending with it, the tugging at the heartstrings is seen as mechanical, a (if not THE) gimmick. It IS heartbreaking, though. Almost enough to (just like with my experience with 'Animal's People"") put it down for good, if not for the attempt to make this into an even MORE personal account, promising much, even having revised editions put out, with new additions, clarifications notes, etc. Oh, Eggers: We truly care about you (why else read 400+ pages of your life?)!!! Post-modernism is promised throughout, as if this novel device will leave the reader awe-struck, as if the work shall surely be ""staggering""! The only development here is the author's promises of a ""straightforward"" first half and a whimsical, self-absorbed postmodern second half. It's all a LIE (!!!) There is so much anger in this that it negatively affects the plot itself (how he is completely obsessed by his blond haired-blue eyed sibling, how he thinks bad things will happen any time, how he wants to fight the status quo he has no real problems with...).

There was an obvious difference between the Snowman put in charge of Crake’s children & Jimmy from the past, the naïve friend of Crake, lover of Oryx. In the second helping of the MaddAddam trilogy the same two-plot braid is undertaken by its creator, the inexhaustibly amazing Margaret Atwood. Two parallel stories, one of Ren in first person, the other of Toby in third, are interchanged like the Jimmy and Snowman story lines, no doubt to keep the reader’s spark lit. It's somewhat more confusing to keep track of both similar lives than it is to concentrate on solely one. The scope widens in part two of this trilogy of ""speculative fiction.""There is an addition to the story told in O and C here: it talks further about the MaddAddam network, of the players involved in the creation of the plague, brilliantly referred to as the “Waterless Flood.” The panorama is complex and very original. I will venture to say, however, that the endless appeal to these both, other than pertaining to an amazing trilogy which continues what began in Oryx and Crake and is further explored in The Year of the Flood, is the embedded wit inside the horror story.

There is obviously consciousness in the survivors (although: Why do they all meet up so neatly in the last sections, converging plot lines, when devastation has assured us that chaos, not order, will reign supreme?), and life still goes on. After the end of the world, people still love and hate, suffer and forgive. Chapter 55 is the chapter on Consciousness, God: “Glenn [Crake] used to say the reason you can’t really imagine yourself being dead was that as soon as you say, “I’ll be dead,” you’ve said the word I, and so you’re still alive inside the sentence… That’s how people got the idea of the immortality of the soul--it was the consequence of grammar… Grammar would be impossible without the FoxP2 gene; so God is a brain mutation.” (316) Atwood litters upon her futuristic landscape teensy kernels of (poetic) wisdom, as hers is a world populated not only by new creatures, but by brainiac scientists and average-Joes alike. There is so much authenticity in this modern writer; the confidence she exudes in making up so SO MUCH fiction is almost... tangible. Literally fantastic!

It is a theme that's already been implanted there, in the modern reader’s sophisticated brain, by Voltaire, and made new again by this generation’s collective and personal psyche, which is quite enormous/ambitious in scope. It’s no travesty to say that the society of 2011 is somewhat the intended dream of our future from way before the millennium--that is, we are living the 2011 version according to 1999, the very oracular year. There is an omnipresent ghost that hovers above it all, called Globalization, and this specter is felt everywhere: from the smallest villages of Thailand to the most industrialized cosmopolitan cities of the U.S. This current feeling had been hinted at way before it even got here. Alex Garland is a remarkable writer. He says that there is in life, in his novel, “something… you are not equipped to understand.” The Tesseract is ""[that] thing unraveled, but not the thing itself.” (249) This conclusion is reached only after having read the three distinct vignettes which finally come together in the impressive fourth act. Cohesiveness is found once all stories are put together, like a jigsaw puzzle. The three stories are completely different from one another in tone and style, though the writer’s voice is identifiable & easy to read (but it strays from the comprehensible by oftentimes entering the realm of the poetic). This writer has very little to hide: he is definitely more about exposing secrets than hiding them (as opposed to countless other great modern British novels, including Ishiguru’s Never Let Me Go, Hollinghurst’s The Line of Beauty or anything Julian Barnes).

Roberto Bolaño destroys the reader’s preexisting expectations, as what the reader sees is rarely what he gets. ""This story breaks away from its box."" Roberto Bolaño destroys the reader’s preexisting expectations, as what the reader sees is rarely what he gets. I’ve only previously read ""Los Detectives Salvajes"" before, and was immediately happy to see that this was an extension of that novel, or, more accurately, it works as a companion piece. I love this kind of stuff! Complimentary works are... extremely difficult to pull off, as one bad novel might pollute the other one. (Take for instance the Hannibal Lecter quadrilogy: Thomas Harris’ first Lecter tale was the superb Red Dragon, which then catapulted the villain to fame in The Silence of the Lambs-- but years later Hannibal fumbled, becoming a cataclysmic literary disaster, followed by the last gasp in those grey ashes, Hannibal Rising.) But in this case, both novels are as different in style as could be, though perhaps not different in theme. Bolaño chronicles an all-but-forgotten literary movement that occurred almost half a century ago at the epicenter of Mexico City. He describes a bohemian existence of poets and artists and Auxilio’s inner trek through memory and even through the to-be-lived future paints a vivid portrait of the members of this artistic wave. Surrealism has a better hold on Amulet than its companion novel. The Savage Detective is epic and wide-spanning--many voices are given chance to chronicle that bright but doomed time, but Amulet centers around Auxilio Laucouture. In Amulet you hear the narrative of a ghost. The heroine, mother to all Mexican poets, part Rapunzel, part deranged pariah (think of the woman from The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman), atop her terrible tower experiences a time warp, and vacillates in examining scenes from her past and her future. Experiences she is yet to have are seen, in true metaphysical oracle style. Her distance from all action occurring in the university and the city gives her the advantage to reach true inner contemplation, to such a degree (no doubt hunger being a driving force) that she admits: “I started thinking about my past as if I was thinking about my present, future and past, all mixed together and dormant in the one tepid egg, the enormous egg of some inner bird (an archaeopteryx?) nestled on a bed of smoking rubble.” The character is an obvious spectator (here is the connection to many other novels that deal with consciousness). Again, in doing nothing (“Stay here, Auxilio, you don’t have to be in that movie; if they want to make you play a role, they can damn well come & find you”) she becomes the perfect candidate to give a form to the narrative, though, like mentioned before, this “horror story” breaks from its set parameters. We are hearing the story directly from Auxilio herself. There is enough evidence of a mumbling, sad, imperfect human directing all of this, & it is because the magic (for instance: the surreal scene inside the antechamber of the King of the Rent Boys in Colonia Guerrero, or the two visionaries [Auxilio and Carlos Coffeen Serpas] coming face-to-face) is filtered through a poetic voice that the effects go unquestioned. Being in the “nun’s cell [Auxilio] never had” makes times, scenes, and emotions transitory: they bleed into each other. Whereas The Savage Detectives follows a clear (you can almost say predestined) path, Amulet promises things which are then delivered, albeit in ambiguous ways. I was expecting, for instance, a cinematic rescue from the bathroom stalls. A closure to the historic events of the army’s invasion of el DF in 1968. Instead, the “Mother of Mexican Poetry” gives us her prophecies which describes a fun flight of poetic fancy, but also includes her harrowing, apocalyptic vision of “the prettiest children of Latin America, the ill-fed and the well-fed children, those who had everything and those who had nothing, such a beautiful song it is, issuing from their lips, and how beautiful they were, such beauty, although they were marching deathward.""...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Mar 15, 2011","Mar 29, 2011","Mar 15, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63029.Amulet

Here then (for my CONSCIOUSNESS & FICTION grad class) an attempt at a Saramagian yarn: Montage	Lazaro has put on his contact lenses and is ready to get to work. Some saline solution still drips down the sides of his bright, bright eyes as he tidies up the bathroom a bit, dabbing the teeny puddles of water left on the rim of the faucet with the Kleenex he used previously to wipe the sides of his eyes, making perfect green vertical rectangles of the bath towels hanging on a chrome bar to his side, placing the half-empty bottle of solution, his eyeglasses which he won’t need anymore, and his contact case inside the mirror cabinet, then enters his room, his domain, his dark lair, sits still on his chair and exhales loudly. He hasn’t even looked at the posters which undoubtedly require, seek, his attention, which are the sole objects we must now devote our focus on. Let’s not look too much at this room, though there is a considerable plenty to contemplate here: books on the redwood shelf, A Confederacy of Dunces, The Corrections, White Teeth, The Secret History, The Rules of Attraction, The Blithedale Romance, all three Lord of the Rings plus The Hobbit, The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard, Bel Canto, Candide, The Shining, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord and additionally a huge array of colors, thin and almost invisible, in the form of individual DVD titles, Titanic, Cool Hand Luke, Mulholland Drive, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Halloween, Sleeping Beauty, Fellini’s La Dolce Vita, Pink Flamingoes, Lost in Translation, Before Sunrise plus some smaller slits of color nearby which conform exactly to the shapes of CDs the colors white, red, black, blue, magenta, with titles given them by the artists responsible, just as writers themselves must give names to their peculiar rowdy offspring made of ink and paper, but these music artists are more important than the forgettable titles of their work, songs played in supersonic repetition by the likes of Pink Floyd, E.L.O., Dr. Dre, NIN, Philip Glass, Black Flag, Maria Daniela y su Sonido Lasser and Britney Spears. All this is too much to see all at once but a mixture of all these catalysts and inspiring cores exists in some indiscernible form within the brain of our Lazaro. There is however a vast difference between all the inspiration found in these artistic forms of the modern age, their sheer attainability is surreal, all these masterpieces, all this plot, image and sound in a micro museum at our protagonist’s disposal, his points of reference, & the posters which are laid down like grey corpses, spread out the full length of the desk. These are definitely unfinished, unpublished, unseen by the masses, and they are precisely this way because at this point Lazaro is barely getting the courage to move his drawing pencil in concentric circles, rightward, downward, then back up again as the snake eats up its tail, as this surely will bring something out. Maybe the knife should gleam only slightly, he thinks then, at its tip, and maybe the victim’s mouth will be the circles, which can become as small or as large as the artist imagines. And words. There will be a cryptic feel to this poster, this attempt at art, attempt at permanence, just as those others are there now, looking down at him with ambiguity from their shelves, maybe even with some jealousy, and the feeling will be inspired by everything he’s ever come into contact with. He takes some certain image from a book, from a film, from the lyrics of songs and tries to do something of it, he takes it within himself to rearrange it, chip at it, add some meat to it, change its entire significance. He starts committing the pencil to the noisy endless paper, begins to think calmly, letting things displace themselves like autumn leaves from his cranium. The montage then is too much to bear, this happens when Lazaro thinks way too much on a single muchness, on one singular complexity, because everything everything has been done one or two or millions of times before and nothing is ever quite original, but only the montage will bring out something that he would have otherwise kept to himself, inside himself, entombed, and it hurts. He has, some hours later, a blueprint, an essence and sure existence, since now it is there for all to see, for there it is for Lazaro to finish off, and he is incredibly happy on many levels, one being that he has not wasted his time after all, one below that that this may actually turn out to be something, something good, and in the basement level which states that leaving things internal is just so wrong that it could lead to something bad, an overload, like cancer....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 03, 2011","Mar 13, 2011","Mar 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2542.The_History_Of_The_Siege_Of_Lisbon

All the research that went into the project finds a place in Book 2 (Book I deals with the poet’s tracing of ancestral roots): rough crazy quilt	I thought to loosen it all, to pull the thread/ let the rags fall [“In a Gaze” 56]) I found it odd that the narrative prose of this section was scant with adjectives and poetic descriptions--stripped away of those conventions, the anecdotes of ghost and U.F.O. sightings take on a journalistic style (indeed, the only traces of poetry include calling on of other “poets” to give their accounts [Is a poet much more likely to be clairvoyant?]) and also the inclusion of “ghost stories” which are actually not: of stalkers and cockroaches, of cadavers, meth addicts and monsters of urban legend lore all of this is intended to produce a scattered effect of found objects. The bridge between Book I and II, traces of history in Kentucky and Indiana and modern ghost/legend huntin’, and it begins with this surmounting sense of investigation. For that very reason the book is subtitled: Excavations and Explanations; too, the addition of photographs (“A Sequence of Events” 122) and of lists (“Some Nouns in My Possession” 138) and even a section of film script (“The Shed” 87) gives the reader a sense of the poet’s insistent permeability and the innate curiosity for remnants when everything else seems, like time, transitory: “Secondhand Stories” are mixed in with the reader’s (and poet’s) own sense of the paranormal. Many emblems of American history are dispersed throughout, mostly in Book I, to anchor the poet to her history. Yellow school bus (18), steam- and flatboats (20), abolitionist’s farm (25), Emancipation Proclamation (27), haystack…cotton fields (32) all have special significances in Americana. It is very fitting that the “history” part of the book comes first and the future comes later. (Is history, or the act of collecting historical artifacts, really an endeavor for the future? In this, her ""hope chest"", Brenda Coultas seems to think so.) There is guilt for being rooted so to the barbarism and holocaust of black slavery and the Civil War but also the poet’s obsession of looking for lost things. Coultas wants a reconciliation between the ghosts of the past and those of the present; in the introduction to Book II “A Lonely Cemetery”, the poet’s ego finally finds its way into this investigation: I asked the cards if my poem would be successful. The readers said, “Who is that man with the dark glasses and pot belly? Is there any reason why I should be seeing Allen Ginsberg over your shoulder?” (68) Taking into consideration the fact that Coultas is a poet who surrounds herself with fellow poets--all this adds gravity to the central query. I find the analogy of painters studying gamma rays similar. B. Coultas’ thesis? It's found snug and beautifully midway through the book: I dreamed of so many treasures buried in the earth or of just bones, all the bones buried by time, nature, or natives. Given eternity, we could find marvelous bones. (88)...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,Feb 2011,"Feb 02, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1281611.The_Marvelous_Bones_of_Time

Somewhere between naked consciousness and brutal incomprehension, the novel is nothing if not cerebral. The events occurring one Easter weekend at the end of the roaring 20's are sliced off at emotional markers & then mixed in with events from the sad, sad past. Beginning the labyrinth with Benjy's POV is like the set of rules proposed by the mad Faulkner. He more than asks, he DEMANDS one put everything away to partake in the Southern Gothic, the drama involved in the lives of the members of a doomed clan.There are occasional dips into 3 distinct psyches and it is interesting to see just how random or planned the trajectory of each one's personal destiny becomes. This is a reverse MRS. DALLOWAY: whereas that one treats one day as an emblem for the titular character, the different characters representing a whole, the Compsons, are made from the same source and yet time is mostly inconsequential as there are enormous spans of time in which the protagonists lingers, and deep gaps where the audience is left to wonder. The whole experience is one of near madness as the SOUND is described at full length by several sources of consciousness while the FURY is all the reader's own in piecing together all the strands.

This time around I found that the most difficult portion of Mrs. Dalloway is its middle section, after the Warren Smiths meet with the physician & Lady Bruton is introduced, & then there is this cavalcade of characters along with all of their inner musings. Sometimes Virginia Woolf uses “he” & “she,” & one knows not who on the stage she is precisely referring to. (It could be said that the emotion within each individual defies exactly who that character is. It is the emotion that’s important--the melancholic mood which at times may strike us all.) The all-knowing narrator in Mrs. Dalloway is like the great revolving eye which transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau often mention. It knows all, but it also rides the collective wave of thought and feeling itself (in Woolf that feeling often deals with growing older, dying). Difficult to put into words, it is clear what it was that (the overrated) IAN MCEWAN tried (& failed) to emulate: Woolf’s sense of impending devastation (In Saturday, another day-long narrative, an Englishman is surprised to see a fallen aeroplane alight in the morning sky… just as the denizens of England receive a fiery emblem: that of the Royal figure inside the coach in the streets of London) & in that grand English tradition: the utmost repression of the individual’s wants (in On Chesil Beach Mc Ewan’s thesis is not unlike the following: “Not for years have they spoken of it; which, he thought… is the greatest mistake in the world.

Nietzsche argues the Church goes against all intelligence, human instincts, creativity (indeed philosophy and medicine too)... which is to say all of life.

It is gaining notoriety even as this is being printed out, & second chances, perhaps the most optimistic of all humankind's events, is what the novel, a disinterred treasure, a message sent off in a bottle, is truly all about....more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Nov 23, 2010","Nov 24, 2010","Nov 23, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3168524-la-conjura-de-los-necios

I must say that the prose is so simple as to be deceitful and I was instantly aware, as I reached its final pages, that this novel was NO Atonement. (Indeed this is the stark opposite of that new classic: it is small where Atonement is enormous & epic, simple while Atonement is complex, & Atonement is a love story while On Chesil Beach is about the absence of that particular element and the end of romance.) But there is also no reason to believe that, while taking on that same theme of crystallization of a particular moment in a human’s life, On Chesil Beach is the trash that Saturday is. That heinous novel, about a pompous neurosurgeon who believes he has literary entitlement just because he can “predict events” in his neobourgeois life, simply by knowing how the human body works, and dissecting daily minutiae into scientific (therefore, deeply unpoetic) reasoning, playing “God”--I found it incredibly irritating. Stupid. Especially having had read Atonement and thinking that a writer like McEwan would never dare disappoint the Reader. But after the popularity of the book I keep mentioning, and will continue to mention for time to come (with a strange type of fanboy fervor)-- Atonement-- I guess the author felt it comfortable to come up with simpler stories, perhaps even complete foils of the book that put McEwan at the forefront. The play with time is what McEwan is all about, more than being a romantic, more than being a mod Londoner. And On Chesil Beach succeeds admirably in that aspect. Sure, I could care less about Florence and Edward, their being “victims of their time” seems at once cliched, even somewhat intolerable.

First off, it is somewhat incredible to concede the year that this was written, and that almost 2,400 years later we are still eager to explore poetics that are in this aged article so clearly defined. Aristotle exalts the poet and holds him in the highest esteem. Similarly, I have come to the conclusion that the novelist of literature is the truest of artists, imitating what he sees and ‘painting’ things as how they are, telling it as other people tell it and so is said to be, or constructing a world in its most ideal, illustrious state. This is but one of the many core concepts Aristotle pries open. Yes, as readers we have been conscious of the literary elements and the mixture of these comprise contemporary fiction, certainly, but here is a very significant work for the writer and not just the poet. Always pitting the Epic poem versus the Tragedy, Aristotle maintains that although a Tragedy has all the same elements as an Epic the Epic poem does not always include elements of Tragedy. Here is the contemporary distinction between epic novels (Gone with the Wind, The Thorn Birds) and tragic family dramas (see: Eugene O’Neill, Arthur Miller). But the spirit of drama must flow through both, though the parameters & scales differ. Indeed some of the dogmas have been explained over and over the years by countless English teachers. So it was a relief to find some of the writer’s personal touches in this informative essay, such as his constant distinction between philosophers and mere men, his fanboy affinity to Homer, his fondness for markedly-clear beginnings & endings, how Epic poetry is the “highest” art form (one would imagine that in the modern world Aristotle would have preferred ‘Titanic’ over ‘American Beauty’), and that poetry “is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history.” (Seemingly rudimentary, this is a must for novelists, even though Epic poems and stage Tragedies are long gone. Sadly the later chapters in Aristotle’s “Poetics” are like trips to elementary school English (letters àwords àsentences).

The book must be reread especially if it was first encountered when the reader’s life was still devoid of romance. Not until the second time around do the details linger, memorably, and the speedy plot that Part One promised is detained for the remaining Parts Two & Three which include photographically-intense colors and emotions felt (or, even not felt at all) by Emma Bovary. The plot is carefully-crafted; it is bookmarked by the lives of the secondary characters, as if Mme. Bovary is the (literal) center meanwhile her dilemma is a more private one: that lives go on before (the education and upbringing of the incompetent man that will be her husband) & after (the deaths of the members of the Bovary clan, the success of M. Homais) the actual core means that the world at large is indifferent to her & her tale is almost wholly forgotten, just swallowed up. Here for the reader’s consideration is a full life. Perhaps “robust” would not be a correct adjective to describe a life of desperation and woe. Emma Bovary is human because she is not all good nor all evil. She is materialistic but also idealistic. Wife and lover. Belonging nowhere, like a character born at the most inadequate of times. Like Oedipus with the Oracle, however, she is knowledgeable of the fate that is in store for adulteresses.The plot has plunges and heights, a spectrum that is available to anyone belonging to the human race. The pathos comes from all the chains Bovary must break to become free, and the further entanglement of her emotions complicate matters. Mme Bovary does not commit suicide with arsenic because of monetary problems. The title is perfect since it is itself a title: Madame Bovary. There are several Madame Bovarys in the book, including Charles’s first wife and his mother. She is called Emma when she is free, when her identity becomes her own & she is dehumanized no longer, especially not by the sympathetic reader. Who can escape their position in society, their gender, their duties, their fate? Rodolphe tells Emma: “if two poor souls should finally come together, everything is organized to prevent them from uniting. Still they try, they beat their wings, they call out to one another.” It's this attempt which makes Madame Bovary a classic, modern tragedy where a soul is doomed because she feels everything, yet is only able to express the most minimal. Emma Bovary is in love with the notion of love, the conventions are her ideals, & she is nevertheless brave to at least try....more",Notes are private!,0,103,1,"Aug 23, 2010","Aug 27, 2010","Aug 23, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2175.Madame_Bovary

Ballard"" is an often-recommended collection of 96 little capsules of SF, horror & fantasy. If you want to become a writer (one who usually starts off writing superb short stories), then Ballard is your main man.I thought of the cover page (of the American Edition) while trying to formulate a cohesive  (which I probably failed at already)--a monolith of a man staring straight at you and little dots floating around him, like atoms or molecules. No, I think they represent bubbles, as in EVERY SHORT STORY IS A BUBBLE THAT DEVIATES FROM THE FOUNTAIN-BRAIN-- some closely resemble reality, like mirrors, and some stray so far off that they seem galaxies away... but they all have an auteur's signature. Ballard, in each tale, immerses you into foreign (but not altogether alien) atmospheres where everything is authentic. All plots seem to be going on RIGHT NOW, somewhere else. His themes, well-tackled and fascinating, range from supremely male symbols: brand-name cars, airplanes, buildings, landscapes, motorcycles, mysterious femme fatales, overpopulation, rarely-sex and libido (strange for the man who wrote ""Crash""!!!) to other themes: deserts, beaches, dunes, sand. Ballard at times is a kid playing with a train set, though his settings are enormous in scale-- Gotham cities.

An autobiography of ten short stories that are exquisite maps into the writer's early life in the D.R. and in America. Junot Diaz is the latino equivalent of David Sedaris.

He endorses this mysogynistic attitude but he is more like a mirror in this way--extremely unapologetic and still personal.Highlight: the first tale is harsh and sad.

More discerning minds can tell me what that something is, and/or what specific effect it produces. The novel is also about: the indifference of society personified by crowds, the act of writing as a doppelganger for terrorism, and about ""messianic returns"" to humanity. The ego of the writer is totally implanted here, and though super PRETENTIOUS, I guess I did fall in love with DeLillo's comment on new lit versus old: before, everything new was explored and challenged while the newer years carry less original ideas so the modern writer uses news of the apocalypse for inspiration. (Yup, true.)DeLillo has his motifs. The limousine (from ""Cosmopolis"") is employed once again in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo. His affinity for using only first names for all characters is damn whimsical. Mass hysteria stands in for individual paranoia and fear and the monster never EVER shows his actual face in a work by DeLillo.Plot? thin threads but mostly about a writer and his assistants and how he is kind of a puppet (like the heroes (?) from the aforementioned ""Cosmopolis"" & the professor of ""White Noise"") but tries to redeem his terrorist acts of creating on the page by saving another lost writer.

I'm plagued with an image of a skeleton being dressed up with flesh and meat... like giving a body of fleshy substance to a ghost.What I didn't know about Oskar Schindler & the Schindler jews:1)Schindler's adolescence was unique (son of rich Roman Catholics) & charming (he was a fan of motorbike racing)2)the original proposal: all Jews were going to be relocated far far away--to Madagascar!3)some Jews approved of the ghetto at first since they thought that they would be free to worship and carry out their affairs with the enemies outside of the walls.4)if you were OD & failed to deliver a family to the SS, then yours would be forfeit (thus, the motivation for Jews to turn against each other)5)there were other Schindler-like saviors, millionaires who gave up everything to save lives, though their stories are told ELSEWHERE.6)the book gives more in-depth biographies of the survivors, like those of Poldek Pfefferberg and Amon's maid, Helen Hirsch.7)RESISTANCE- hinted at in the film; here, it is noted that something very similar to what occurs in Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" occurred in real life-- rebels did destroy the only SS-only cinema!8)the little girl in the red coat. For the film it is an emblem of hope, a very visual reminder. The book tells us that her name was Genia & it is because Schindler sees her from the hilltop, sees the determination in her and that invisible string that carries her to safety after the Aktion of the ghetto, that he gives up his life to the cause. Why does she survive? She's immune, like a Virgil that can accompany us down into the underworld unscathed. Because no one shields her from the horror of the massacre, because nobody cares for censorship or human dignity, because she is ALONE... it is that Schindler becomes Schindler.& lastly, I would add that the book is somewhat more digestible than the movie.

Like a riveting film, one of the best ones out there that you probably never got to see in the theater and sweetens the day considerably when you do sit down and invest & hour and a half, this one is worth it. Even the woodcuts added to the drama by the writer's father gives it extra spice.Alex Garland's ""The Coma"" is like Paul Auster's ""Timbuktu"": brief, told in a disembodied POV, a cool concept that you think might fail at any minute, might become pretentious or may end soon in nowheresville, but does NOT. Whereas Auster's work is plagued with obvious pathos, Mr. Garland chooses wisely to stray far and make beauty without the use of sentimentalism: a trait I find very attractive and undoubtedly speaks to the generation. Carl is us and his simple ambitions, whether it is to ""find a partner and have kids"" or just the physical act of waking up, are likewise ours.Man, you don't have to describe to me how sad things are spelled out so implicitly when, like the true master that Garland is (Just see my profile under FAVORITE AUTHORS), using both blankness and darkness, minutiae and profundity, you can bestow me with a portal that sees inside myself....more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"May 25, 2010","May 26, 2010","Mar 12, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1012743.The_Coma

That the heroes of the tale resemble those that they draw is a guise to imbue the fantastic world with the ever-so real. Film equivalents: ""The Aviator"" (2005), ""Citizen Kane.""In fact, it is the story of the baby-faced entrepreneur that K & C tries to emulate, & actually kinda surpasses it. It is about MANNY things, about history of course, but also about that pesky threesome that sometimes forms when great minds align. About the father-son relationship, the partnership between hero & sidekick, the building of something amazing, that lasts for future generations to enjoy or partake in. Is there any other emblem to tie all of this together than that monstrous tower a.k.a.

Hardly a long time ago, it was analyzed/embraced then as it is now for its hodgepodge of ghost story elements, & romance, and historical biography. Because slavery is such a muddy record in our books, it is certain documents like these, which help widen the scope significantly, to include various P.O.V.s & jumps in time, that are truly significant to American Literature. The book mirrors the psyche of a woman who chooses liberating death for her child, rather than the awful clutch of slavery. It decidedly marks a usually-undocumented moment when ex-slaves got something close to freedom-- and had to find out how to live, survive, or try to make way for the upcoming generation-- outside of slavery....more",Notes are private!,0,157,1,not set,"Dec 23, 2009","Dec 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6149.Beloved

Glad I am not alone in feeling a strong deep sad empathy for this book. The story is EXTREMELY well told. The story, about young ""revolutionaries"" who end up doing exactly the opposite of what they've set out to do, is quite simple but very epoch-rich. It has different P.O.V.s, which deviates from the outstanding film, & the ending is more shattering & bitter than the one presented on the silver screen.Academy-Award winning director Sam Mendes made a wise decision in giving April Wheeler a brighter limelight to contend with Frank's, the husband & sole protagonist of the novel. In the film, there is a constant wrestling match which is underlined by the fact that THESE ARE JACK AND ROSE from Titanic and we must instantly feel for them. Mendes is a genius, too, in the casting of his (ex)wife Kate Winslet, who is arguably the best actress of our generation. So while Mendes has the ability to play sly film director, almost-auteur, Richard Yates has much more to contend with. His meditation on the cost of real freedom is basically flawless. He plays with dialogue in the same awesome way that a dedicated playwright like Edward Albee did. He describes in simple ways just how awful the everyday can truly be for a bright, dedicated yet frail American in the 1950's. Makes a stark contrast with today's impediments on a marriage!

Tartt writes like any writer wanting to sell copies (masterfully)-- concisely, with a full-rounded voice and interesting historical insight along the way.

It is this theme I found most attractive this time around: what if it is all a figment of the narrator's imagination? (a-la ""One Flew Over a Cuckoos Nest?"") What if the college student learns ALONG the way, does not disclose his ACTUAL feelings, but like a maestro, makes them add up to something whole, like a musical piece. I remember me (also a Biology pariah then entering an English program) at that time: trying to embellish the small, & making the irrelevant relevant even. I felt this time that the plot's a wee bit thin (but NOT HOPELESS, like ""The Little Friend""). The characters might be interchangeable, and the secret history is all but hinted at and never actually fully disclosed. That's what I appreciate in this.

There is suggestion, which totally works for horror films, as well as these semi-horror tableaux. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a quick read, a very interesting exercise in symbolism and mood. It is absolutely a ROMANCE.

Because it is!The novel about novels (my favorite motif of all lit is lit within lit... storytelling...ya know...?) is actually a novel about love. The three voyages by Don Quixote are obvious metaphors for life and all the characters he meets along the road are romantically inclined, bored and in want of change. Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho Panza, provide ample entertainment for them and for us, the reader.This relationship lasted a month and I cannot recall a single detriment. It is structured like The Arabian Nights and The Canterbury Tales---that is, much is told of the character telling the story, and of his or her potential madness or sanity. This dualism is explored to the fullest & characterized by moments of sheer happiness & almost-delirium. There is a world established here, and did it actually occur? The characters fall into apocrypha and then into stark reality. It is no mistake that Cervantes foretold what the two adventurers realize at about page 900: they will be famous for all time and their images shall be ingrained everywhere. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are immortal in Spain and can be seen pretty much in every town traversed. The self-sppointed prophecy lives to this VERY DAY!!!! That fiction merges with history, that the book is self consious and post modern... all these things and more are part of the Quixote legend.I say the book is about love because everyone suffers from the disease: Don Quixote loves his tales of knight errantry, and his own views of chivalry clash with those of the folks he meets. He is progressively antiquarian. Sancho is in love with his master, has a very stable view on life (he attains the title of governor and insists, ten days later, to quit and continue his life with his knight) and talking in proverbs he displays, until Book II of course, a wisdom that has obviously evolved, like the story, like the character, like the reader.

Think of an Irish Charley from ""Flowers for Algernon.""Think too, ""A Clockwork Orange""! The ultraviolence & a masterful, invented dialogue is also present here. Francie is a psychopath (a-la ""American Psycho"", a-la ""Zombie"" by Joyce Carol Oates) who becomes the Butcher boy, or apprentice, killing with an underrated joy the pigs and piglets of the sty. Despite what is in his gray matter, his hands do things independently. Is he possessed? Is he the ""bi-product of his environment""? Maybe. Yes. He's truly insane, and to actually go deep into the abysmal terrors, like a marvelous case study, is what McCabe excels at. It is also poignant and funny. Like a twisted Huck Finn, a macabre Holden Caufield, an astute Oliver Twist.

This is the basis for what is perhaps the MOST UNDERRATED HORROR FILM OF ALL TIME: Bernard Rose's ""Candyman."" The story itself, 60 pages that really do chill the blood, I've penciled in on a list of the best short stories ever. It is melancholia wrapped in detective Noir, supernatural urban legend; a human investment into something larger than the self. Helen, the doomed protagonist, looks for an interesting thesis in walls exploded with urban symbols: graffiti. The residents of a dilapidated city complex are all in on a secret conspiracy. The killer mesmerizes, comes from the realms of hell, literally. The personification is so complete in this study on urban decay. The myth baring a hook is more effective than Pinhead! The last paragraph plagues the reader with worry: it seems so possible that evil exists, is indeed a human disease made up of interior and exterior traumas. I almost cried for Helen.I read ""The Forbidden"" and felt immediately that Horror is alive and well (true-this comes to us from the 80s... but one has the instinct to hope). Stephen King's constant praises for the British author are not without substantiation. Barker can write circles around King: he practices brevity, brings out strong sexual themes (which of course soon delve into absolute terror), has an outright, singular poetic penmanship. The other stories are pretty good, too. The story about the Candyman, a must read for all aspiring writers, was an A+. The rest involve a doorway to hell in a prison with no relatable characters (B), a sick gender-bending misadventure in a satanic spa (B-) & bizzarro geriatric oracles in Greece (C+)....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2009","Feb 25, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52643.In_the_Flesh

Instead of keeping with the ideas to elongate them into other full-length masterwork novels, Garcia Marquez seems, well, censored (?). Reading this in Spanish makes a HUGE difference, I believe, to the overall experience. The rhetoric is often times untranslateable, and I believe that the English transfer would probably be less rich in prose, as the author loves to sprinkle Spanish sayings and laugh-inducing wit into the melting pot.

King here is as he has never been since: metaphoric and concise. He usually adds fact upon useless fact that converts a 400 page work into something more gargantuan, and, therefore, less enthralling. King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why. His story is about the build up of tension, the ""shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans. The boiler burns, blows everything up just as Jack Torrence forgets his humanity & becomes an ego/id complex. His selfishness & his alcoholism (a hereditary illness... another theme about family ""curses,"" and weak threads) leads to savagery. The ghosts are the manifestations of a child's bruised home-life and the suffocation and claustrophobia have more to do with that tragic past than the hotel's eerie interior.I place this masterpiece next to 'The Exorcist', a tale that is more than just a simple tale of demonic possession.

""Dead Until Dark"" is a heavy middle finger to all those in deep love (& therefore those with questionable tastes) with the ""Twilight"" series.This book reminds me that not all fiction has to be poetry.

Sometimes the protagonist dreams of the past, relives events, becomes a part of someone else's consciousness while he can stick to another person's psyche (think a less technical ""Being J.

It rivals overrated Gatsby in its encapsulation of an antique age where characters breathed and plotted and lived. The description of the antique penny arcades and games on the pier, the cafes and mafiosos who linger there; the idiots and the innocent... its all too good to be true. The good guy (bad girl/experienced woman) fights the bad guy (innocence personified) by lingering around his digs & making things quite uncomfortable for him while preaching her pagan and carefree lifestyle. The Boy (as he is always referred to, almost in jest) thinks too too much, plots too many misdeeds and is selfish in his self-imposed Hell. He has a Catholic conscience & the woman does not. The woman wins! The message is clear; but even though the novel works on two distinct levels (the plot is something Hollywood would definitely produce, while the implications of Catholic guilt and immorality highlight what the actual theme of the tale is) it is fast-paced, brilliant & often sublime.

Epics have been forgotten & currently authors satisfy their readers (or not, as the case may be) with smaller stories & smaller lives.McCullough has the tenacity to include three generations in this sprawling saga, and as family portraits usually tell of differences between the generations PLUS the ties that bind them together & to a home, this one exactly does that in an extremely entertaining fashion.Fee marries her second choice, not the man of her dreams, and becomes pregnant with more or less the number of digits one has in both hands; she lives a quiet & ironically isolationist existence. Her daughter Meggie, the protagonist until her daughter takes the helm, also suffers her mother's character flaws... fate plus genes a maudling story make. Her priest Ralph, in what is the central love story, chooses God over his heart. The same is not repeated but is indeed echoed in the last generation as Justine, who finally breaks the curse, leaves the warmth and monotony of her family in Drogheda to actually take flight & follow her instincts which had failed the Cleary women in the past.There are only 19 chapters in this massive chronology and many events occur, mostly random and sometimes poetic, but they never fail to surprise. There are so many characters, & all of them, you feel, actually employ humanity, act like actual persons that may have lived. There are acts of stupidity and compassion. People repress many feelings, more for personal convictions than for social or familial obligations we seldom don't visit in books such as these!Ralph is an idiot for causing so much pain to both he and his love. What does that say about organized religion and the crimson-clothed of the almighty Vatican? The Clearys, though not intelligent mainly because of the collective ""Irish pauper"" mentality the patriarchal figure bestows upon his offspring (Papa Cleary and Ralph's proxy, Luke pretty much F*** things up for the rest). They are, however, extremely hard workers and this pays off well. There are many morals, many moments of euphoria, and even slight (by today's standards) snippets of hot erotica! You pretty much stand witness to one of the most complex yet endearing pieces of literature.Highlights: 1) the death of one of the Cleary boy's via warthog asphyxiation immediately following the death of his father via fiery ""holocaust."" 2) Ralph meeting his love at her retreat where she is in isolation is definately one of the most romantic notions I have ever read... it is written with the finest sense of what love really is. 3) learning what ""French Letters"" mean. 4) transition from New Zealand to Australia to Rome, Greece, London. Such sprawls indicate that life can expand from its moldy origins to experience infinite possiblities, arrive at distal ends.I recommend this book for someone not afraid to having a two-three week relationship with a soap opera that, unlike those on t.v., does not insult the audience with romantic cliches or expected ""disasters.""

He wrote ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", ""Apt Pupil"", ""The Body"" & ""The Breathing Method"" as unpublishable novellas right after the completion of one novel each ""with just enough gas left in the tank."" Wow.More than any pop culture writer, King is almost never a boring or dull read. I need to read him sporadically because after reading 20+* of his novels I know where to go to be entertained.

SLEEP) But I am no expert nor can I say I subscribe to the King Collective Mythology. Sometimes all his characters share the same voice, regardless of sex. It is all Stephen King.This time, these stories were all non-Horror 'cept one. ""Shawshank"" saw a better reincarnation as the Darabont film--the novella is short, gives a ""Cool Hand Luke"" vibe, is an impressive testament of life on the cell block (GREEN MILE is the epitome of these). ""Apt Pupil"" was very morbid, an ""American Psycho"" meets ""American Pastoral."" The film is also better because Ian McKellen doesn't ""come out of the closet"", so to speak: he does not admit being part of the Nazi party in a long ago past 'til much later. The movie hints at his monstrosity...King just shows it with as little censorship as humanely possible(duh). In the book he is a ruthless killer (expected for a Nazi) AND so is the kid, the apprentice (SHOCKER!). New Horror meets old school terror--very clever, almost poetic in its implications of suburban infiltrators that are not the boogeymen--they are the residents themselves. Also--the monster gene can resurface at any age with any generation.""The Body"", made famous by the ever-popular ""Stand By Me"" movie, is an idyllic tale that places the innocent naivete of childhood in the backwoods--where terror lurks. It is an obvious metaphor for growing up. Everything in childhood is fragile. The image of the dead boy, in sharp contrast to the robust lives of our four protagonists is quite intuitive for a fabulist like King.Lastly, ""The Breathing Method"" is THE unexpected treat. It is so morbid and macabre... I had not been that shocked in a really long time. It is the exposed finger beckoning from the plumbing in the sink in NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES: an image that stays with you for years and years. If you are tired/superfamiliar with the aforementioned films, read the last 60 pages of this novella collection: totally worth it!The four season motifs don't really fit the representative tales. ""Hope Springs Eternal"" for SHAWSHANK makes sense... you know this story will end well (after 27 years the dude escapes!). ""Summer of Corruption"" fits PUPIL except this story takes place over many DIFFERENT months, no particular season. ""Fall from Innocence""---BODY occurs at the end of the summer (I guess that's not too bad a fit). ""A Winter's Tale"" is the forgotten gem of the book...METHOD is a story within a story (clever device indeed for the masterful storyteller).King says ""It is the tale, not he who tells it."" This is incredibly true in this instance: the stories themselves, like the seasons, have unique flavors, have original themes; the stories are SO GOOD not even Stephen King could mess it up with his often-seen redundancy (none of that here!) or his mimicry of others' works (these are all 100% original).

Rachel is superficial... a ""Paris Hilton"" (ha) figure... a Princess with no kingdom and, alas, no King. Leah is the tomboy whose roots remain in Africa even after the ""Exodus."" Adah is the idiot savant whose keen observations place her in the position of poet. And little Ruth May is the anchor-- the treasure. The mother is a victim of an over-religious spouse who is ineffective both in the community and household. He is in the background, just like all the historical pinpoints of paramount significance (chief of which is Lumumba's assassination, the rise of the dictatorship and the segue to the countless genocides...), & the women (including the thoughts of an older mother Price on her deathbed) are where they belong, in the forefront. They are the heart and brains... & everything is displayed and named as though they were trying to assimilate us into their world, just like they had to evolve in harsh Africa. Whereas they had many hardships & moments of deep despair (were alone, except for ""The Eyes in the Trees""), we the reader have awesome tour guides in all these accounts of the five unique women....more",Notes are private!,0,137,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2008","Sep 04, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7244.The_Poisonwood_Bible
