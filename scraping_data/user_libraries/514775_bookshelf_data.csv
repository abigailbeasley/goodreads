Do you love witty prose and quirky characters and off-kilter love stories, not to mention family dilemmas that are unique in their very commonness? Do you love reading anything that has Anne Tyler’s name on it?If so, Redhead by the Side of the Road is for you. It was for me. I’m a long-time fan of the author and jumped when I saw she had a new book out. I downloaded the Audible edition the day it was published.The story is told from the POV of one Micah Mortimer, a good-natured forty-something oddball whose business, aptly named Tech Hermit, has him helping people with the simplest of computer chores. Micah is also the super of his apartment building, more quirky characters there.But Micah himself is the main voice, the one with whom we sympathize, even when we know that what he has just said or done will not bring the result that he wants. Poor guy, he doesn’t connect well with women, despite the best of intentions. His family knows him, loves him, and indulges his quirks. Women aren’t as forgiving.There’s humor here, and a family crisis, and a love story or two. But Tyler’s work shines brightest in characterization, and she remains in top form here.This book is charming, if short – actually, more novella than novel. So be forewarned. I wasn’t, which left me hungry at the end....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"May 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46014983-redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road

The more glowing s a book gets pre-pub, the higher the expectation. Disappearing Earth is the latesI’ve said it before, but it bears repeating. The more glowing s a book gets pre-pub, the higher the expectation. Disappearing Earth is the latest.Though this book is billed as a novel, I found it to be more a collection of short stories, with each chapter focused on a separate woman who may or may not know the others. All live on the Kamchatka Peninsula, a remote area in Northeastern Russia. The author, who is American, lived there for two years while she was researching and writing the book. Indeed, location is a character here, and Julia Phillips does a masterful job painting its picture for the reader.Chapters are titled by month. In the first, “August”, two sisters, ages 11 and 8, who have spent the day alone in a barren beach area while their mother works, accept a ride home from a man in a black car – and are never seen again. The disappearance of these two little girls is, in theory, the mystery that keeps the plot moving, the thread tying all of these stories together, in the style of, say, Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge.At least, that was one of the things the ers raved about. Oh, lovers of this book cry, but the girls’ disappearance deeply affects each of the other characters. I did not find that. I found the girls’ disappearance to be incidental to the predicaments of most of those others.Don’t get me wrong. There is brilliance here. Each of the stories stands alone. Taken together, they create a haunting picture of the perilous life of a woman living in Russia between the fall of Communism and the rise of Putin. It isn’t a pretty picture. This is a dark book, certainly not one I would have read mid-pandemic if my book group hadn’t been discussing it.The author is talented, and this is her first novel.

I can’t read it all the time, but when an interesting one comes along, I’m game. The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow is such a book.In a nutshell: Told in the first person by a young girl who is raised in a Vermont mansion by the older, wealthy man for whom her father works, January Scaller has no idea whether her mother is alive or dead, what her father actually does, or why the man who calls her his ward collects seemingly ancient relics to share with an oddly evil group of friends.When she finds a book hidden away in the attic, January reads what turns out to be her own story. In addition to telling who her parents really are, the book describes a large network of doors, strewn all over the world, leading to different times and places. Someone is trying to seal them off. When her father goes missing, January feels an increasingly personal connection with these doors and a compulsion to keep them open.Pros:There is a story, actually a story within a story. Both are fast-paced, suspenseful, and well-written, with beautiful descriptions and minimal repetition.The characters are eminently likable, from January to her dog Bad (Sinbad), to her friend and savior Samuel, to Jane, the mysteriously exotic companion her father has sent her.This book is meaty. No quick read, the plot is rich and full. You can sink your teeth into this one.The concept of doors is one I’ve read about in two other notable books – Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, and Erin Morgenstern’s The Starless Sea. This one holds its own.Cons:The plot moves back and forth between places and times. This may be a problem for some readers.Final word:I found The Ten Thousand Doors of January well worth the effort. It is engrossing and ultimately rewarding....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"May 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january

It’s a gem.In a nutshell: Antonia Vega, 66, is newly retired and newly widowed. Into the void of what-comes-next thuds a double whammy: a crisis with the oldest of her three sisters, and the challenge of an undocumented, pregnant teenager who arrives at a time of governmental paranoia. As Antonia struggles to find the right path, the different options that unfold reflect the many contradictions of our current world.Pros:Afterlife is well-paced, suspenseful in a grown-up way, and written with the exquisite skill of Julia Alvarez at her best.The book is set in Vermont, where the author lives. Without quite being a character in the book, the area is perfectly described.The main character’s memories of, sometimes obsession with her late husband are both positive and negative, rendering the marriage thoroughly realistic.“The Sisterhood.” I loved this theme. Antonia is one of four sisters, fondly known as “the sisterhood” in both their native Dominican Republic and now the US. Depictions of the four women and their interactions with each other are alternately hysterically funny, poignantly sad, and ultimately victorious.Though Antonia and her sisters came to the US from Dominica years before and are all acclimated citizens, they take pride in their origin. Through this lens, the plight of the undocumented immigrant is seen in subtle, realistic, and sympathetic ways.Afterlife is short, but as filled with thought and emotion as a novel twice as long.Cons:Are there any? If I were to nitpick, I might suggest that the title, while fitting the story, is quieter than titles are nowadays. But then, in its quiet too, it fits the book.Final word:Afterlife is a contemporary take on life, death, family, and hope. It’s a winner.

She keeps getting better and better – her latestGoing way back to her 1984 debut novel, Love Medicine, I’ve been an admirer of Louise Erdrich’s work. She keeps getting better and better – her latest, The Night Watchman, being a case in point.It is loosely based on the life of her own grandfather, who was chairman of the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians at a time (the mid-1950’s) when the United States government was attempting to reclaim land owned by, lived on, and guaranteed by treaty to Native Americans.In a nutshell: Thomas Wazhashk is tribal chair of the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa by day and, by night, a watchman at a jewel-bearing plant in rural North Dakota. His work is endless, particularly when a resolution is proposed in Congress that, if passed, would result in the destruction of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa as a cohesive people.Though Thomas leads the charge to fight it, many others of the band play instrumental roles in his carefully conceived, intelligently thorough, and quietly forceful campaign.Pros:The over-arching theme of the book is the plight of the Native American in a country that would see its various tribes assimilated into oblivion. Sub-themes, though, are universal – the age-old human search for acceptance, our need for friendship and family, and the role of tribal (small ‘t’) folklore as a source of strength.Erdrich is a master of prose that is descriptive, true to its speakers, and succinct. There is no self-consciousness here. She seamlessly blends Chippewa words and phrases into the dialogue. Likewise, she presents Native American customs in an understated, perfectly natural way.Erdrich is herself an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain band, and she knows of what she speaks – of her tribe, of other Native American tribes, and of the often unforgiving land on which they live.Each character is unique and likable in his or her own way. Erdrich juggles her cast as beautifully as she does the various plot threads.These threads come together in a powerful David-versus-Goliath event.Cons:My lone con is more of a heads-up. One does not skim The Night Watchman. It is a dense book, and it isn’t short. Reading carefully is a must.Final word:There is a quiet command to The Night Watchman, one character to the next, one scene to the next, one setting to the next. There is also a quiet resignation that seeped into me as I read, instilling an understanding of, and compassion for, the Native American plight that has been with me ever since. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"May 19, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/43721059-the-night-watchman

THE DEARLY BELOVED by Cara Wall is a brilliant character study of four people – two couples whose lives become entwined when the men, Presbyterian ministers, are hired to share a congregation in New York.This book is not about religion. It’s about faith – in ourselves, in each other, and, yes, in God. These are issues with which Charles and his wife Lily, and James and his wife Nan struggle. The time is the 60s, and social change is rampant. New York is the epicenter of the clash between old and new, and these four people are its embodiment.On one hand, there is Charles, who feels a direct connection to God, but is married to Lily, who doesn’t believe in God at all. Then there is James, who sees God as the drive in men to make the world better. James’s wife Nan, the daughter of a minister, is primed for the traditional role of the minister’s wife, but traditional is not what she gets.Reviewing such a … full … book is difficult. We’re talking love and friendship, tragedy and hope, belief and disbelief, grief, joy, and fulfillment.

The author sheds light on the plight of impoverished Kentucky miners, the phenomenon of packhorse librarians who carried books and magazines through remote mountains to patrons hungry for them, and the plight of the Blue People of Kentucky.Blue People? I’d never heard of them, so I googled to see if they were real. Oh, yes. They are. (For those interested, it’s called methemoglobinemia, which causes methemoglobin levels in the red blood cells to rise above 1 percent. It turns the skin blue, the lips purple, and the blood a chocolate brown.)There was – is – a hill family carrying a genetic trait that causes an enzyme deficiency, giving their skin a blue hue. The protagonist of THE BOOK WOMAN OF TROUBLESOME CREEK (an actual place) is a Blue. Through her eyes, we experience the sense of being inferior and the fear of discrimination that was as bad for Blues as for African Americans with whom they were equated by whites.This same woman, Cussy Mary Carter, age 19, is a packhorse librarian. She loves her job – loves books – loves seeing those she visits on her route as they begin to read. Despite the color of her skin, her patrons love her right back. So, there is a feel-good quality here.That said, the book is about dire poverty and the illness it causes. It’s about having to live with injustice. It’s about rural Kentucky life, with its folk medicine and quaint rituals. And it’s about the ultimate triumph of good over evil … somewhat.I listened to THE BOOK WOMAN OF TROUBLESOME CREEK, and there were times when I felt a piece of dialogue dragged on.

Such is the case with THMarie Benedict likens herself to an archaeologist digging up facts about women whose life achievements have been minimalized. Such is the case with THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE ROOM.Here, she tells the story of Hedy Lamarr, an actress born in Austria, coming into her own through the turbulent 1930s and ’40s there, then the ’40s and ’50s in America. I grew up knowing her name, but I never knew that she was Jewish. Much of the world did not, and by design. At that time (sadly, now too, in some places), Jewish was a dangerous thing to be. Even in Hollywood, far from Hitler’s reach, Jewish actors, actresses, and directors who had fled their homelands for the safety of America were secretive about their roots.Hedy Lamarr’s heritage and the extent to which her family went to keep her safe is only half of the heart of this book. The other half is the role women were relegated to playing in those days – from the trophy wife who was expected to be silent and smile to the on-screen actress whose face and body mattered far more than her lines.But what about her mind? Hedy Lamarr was an inventor, creating not only torpedo-related technology that would eventually be adopted by the US Navy but also technology that would become the basis of cell phone mechanics.Did you know that? Nope. Me, neither. I only knew Hedy Lamarr as a beautiful face. Marie Benedict corrects that misperception in this book. She also makes Ms. Lamarr’s achievements personal, redemptive for someone who felt that she hadn’t done enough for the millions of Jews in Austria who died at Nazi hands.I wasn’t wild about the reader of the Audible version. She did multiple roles well, but was overly dramatic, I thought. Also, there was a bit more internal dialogue (as in CARNEGIE’S MAID) than I thought warranted.Still, the feminist in me gives this book a high rating....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39971465-the-only-woman-in-the-room

This exhibit, called The Artist Is Present, actually happened in 2010, and the artist in question, Marina Abramovic, is quite real.Truly, the book – the exhibit – is about people communicating with each other in our increasingly-isolating world. The Artist is Present consists of the artist, Marina Abramovic, sitting in a chair facing an empty chair which is filled by one after another of the exhibit-goers, who wait in line for to take their turn to sit, and then hold the eye of the artist for as long as their own emotions can do it.What we see is wordless, soulful communication between two strangers. The book tells of the emotions of both the chair sitters and those who watch them sit.I have conflicted feelings about this book. The writing is exquisite, the subject matter beautiful but, occasionally, too dense to follow. It took me a long time to get the point of the whole thing.

The fact that its point eluded me during much of the reading may have been a weakness of the author. Or a weakness of me. Or it may have been the fact that I listened to the audiobook.I suspect that this is a book better read than heard.The farther away I move from this book, the better I like it.

This book is historical fiction about Christina Olson, who was for many years the friend and muse of Andrew Wyeth, and the model for his iconic work, “Christina’s World.” This Christina is inspirational – a handicapped woman who has no happy ending but finds meaning in someone else’s view of her. Given the relationship between artist and muse, it is even triumphant.This book is about life in rural Maine in the first half of the 1900’s – specifically, the life of this woman who, at the age of three, develops a syndrome that is yet to be named but that makes walking painful and precarious. Christina wants to be part of the rest of the world, but between her family’s need and her own handicap, she is unable to leave her home. This home is the house pictured, along with Christina, in Wyeth’s masterpiece.I found the author’s insight into life in rural Maine to be every bit as intriguing as her depiction of the creative process of an artist. We know Ms. Kline is a talented author; her ORPHAN TRAIN told us that.

It’s a delight!The story revolves around Fern Banks, a thirty-something woman whose passion is vintage clothing, which she sells from a stall in London’s Camden Market. She has rented said stall after being fired from her steady, regular-paying retail job. Why? Because she sold a dress from her private collection to an elderly client for whom nothing in the store was quite right but for whom her heart told her this particular dress was.And this isn’t the only “random act of kindness” in the book. There are several, none hokey or trite, and each with different and charming repercussions.Fern has a knack for sensing not only what people want, but what they need in their lives. As the story progresses, she gathers a coterie of unusual friends, all drawn to her because of her outspoken spunk and intrinsic goodness. This isn’t to say that her own life is perfect. Her love life is in shambles, her relationship with her mother is disastrous, and her business hangs by a thread. Literally.We’re talking about vintage fashion here. Most chapters start with descriptions of a piece of clothing that suits someone or thing in that chapter.A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS is modern, clever, and smart. It’s a story of self-realization, not only for Fern but for those closest to her as well. BTW, older characters play a prominent role in this novel, and they are hilarious.I loved this book.

Assuming the descriptions are accurate, I can’t begin to imagine the research that the author, Mark Haddon (or his assistant) did. And if they’re not accurate? Doesn’t matter. Those descriptions are as magnificent as the imagination behind them.That said, this book isn’t for everyone. It starts in the very real present, then morphs back to a more fantastically ancient Greece – and the morphing process is astonishing. Listening to the Audible version, I replayed three times the passage in which a simple modern-day skiff transforms into a large, mythological trading vessel – marveled at how the author transformed the modern Darius into the fabled Pericles.This ancient portion of the plot is loosely based on Pericles, Prince of Tyre, a play thought to have been written by Shakespeare in collaboration with George Wilkins, a minor playwright of the early 1600s. THE PORPOISE even includes a subplot starring Shakespeare and Wilkins themselves, though I’m still not sure what role this plays in the novel.But let me elaborate on my “I’m still not sure” statement. This was one of those books that I didn’t feel bright enough to totally understand. I may have missed parts of it. Still, once I set aside interpreting things and simply read for reading’s sake, I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you do not like reading about Greek mythology, THE PORPOISE isn’t for you. I do like reading about the ancients and loved those parts. I did find some of the time switches jarring.

Based on the publisher’s hype, I expected something plot-driven. As exquisite as this book is, it is not that.The official blurb describes an infant who is found under a bridge, deformed and abandoned, covered by a blanket of bees. This child has the ability to see the future and thereby save good people from illness, political scourge, and personal ruin. And there are good people in this book.We know, because we’re taken deep into the minds of many of them, as well as into the minds of an evil one or two. Characterization is one of the book’s strong suits.Another strong suit? The historical elements, including the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, the Mexican revolution and its agrarian land reform, which summarily stripped wealthy landowners of their property. This is all written with breathtaking detail and color – and the writing is, I believe, the very greatest strength of the book.There’s just too much of it. The story of the child and his bees gets lost in minute descriptions of characters, places, and events. If you read this book for a window on Mexican history, culture, and people at that time, it’s a five-star winner.

Though she does grow cacti on her windowsill, the title refers to her own prickly personality. She is blunt to the point of rudeness and cynical of the motives of nearly everyone she meets. She doesn’t have friends, doesn’t go for drinks with her coworkers, has never in her life been to a party on New Year’s Eve.Not surprisingly, Susan has never married. Rather, she has been involved in a long-term relationship with a man who is an art critic and wants a companion at the theater or art shows, but doesn’t want formal commitment any more than she does. They meet every Wednesday night in an arrangement so satisfying that those Wednesday nights evolve into late night sex.Despite preventative measures, Susan becomes pregnant. She is horrified – believes she’s too old, too pleased with her orderly life, too dogmatic and unemotional to love a child. Then, in quick succession, her own mother dies leaving a vexing will, her troublesome brother starts causing, well, trouble, and she cuts off communication with the father of the baby, lest he think she deliberately trapped him – or worse, that she wants or needs his help.The book follows her through the pregnancy, which has enough emotional ups and downs to become life-changing for her. Without quite planning to, she forms a solid friendship, unearths family secrets, and falls in love. Precisely because she hasn’t planned any of this, she grows beyond the rigid woman she was.Those readers who find Susan at the start are simply too impatient or unable to read between the lines. I found her totally worthy of my sympathies, especially as the book goes on. And I loved the people who eventually become her friend. Watching her grapple with change in her life is alternately heartwarming and hysterically funny.Given all of the above, and the fact that this book is not ultra-long, it’s a great weekend read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41860718-the-cactus

Through it all, though, their lives and fortunes are riddled with shameful secrets, deep-seated prejudice, and regret for paths not taken.The hype for this book was tremendous. How could I not buy it? I’m a Maine lover, and a huge presence in THE GUEST BOOK is Crockett’s Island, an idyllic spot off the coast that, over the course of the three generations we see, comes to embody the very identity of the family. As with so many upper-crust icons whose arrogance leads to ignorance, the Miltons want all things to remain forever the same. As the 1930s move toward the ’60s, then the ’80s and beyond, this puts them at odds with a changing world.THE GUEST BOOK is at once a most beautiful and frustrating novel. The writing is rich with period detail in time, place, and clothing, and the author goes into similar detail describing the characters’ feelings and thoughts. She touches on many weighty subjects, not the least being race relations and wartime politics. But the book didn’t come alive for me until she actually began to focus on one or another of her characters – so that I was able to focus in, myself.This book should have been shorter. The first 100+ pages, while beautifully written, could have been 50 pages. Too often, the author presented stretches of monologue that were intellectual before we had bonded with the book. Granted, the stretches do set the scene for what is to come. But I had trouble staying interested and, at times, had to force myself to continue.

I struggled to identify with the Native American experience that was reported to be brutally described in this book. Then I asked myself – do we need to identify with the characters in a book to make the book worthwhile? Of course not. I was being a coward not to immerse myself in this book right at the start.That said, better late than never. THERE THERE is a painful, if important read.The title comes from a Gertrude Stein quote in which she refers to her childhood home of Oakland, California, as being so changed in her later life that it is no longer the city she once knew – i.e., there is no there there. Oakland is the setting for THERE THERE as well, but the author, Tommy Orange, speaks of the Native American experience on a larger scale, where memory of the old ways, of what it means to be a Native American, has been wiped out by modern life.His solution? Telling stories about Native life so that it is never again forgotten. To this end, THERE THERE is comprised of stories within a story of individuals whose lives grow increasingly entwined as the plot unfolds. Orange’s prose is lyrical, perhaps too much so for some of his characters. But his plotting is careful and well planned, introducing one character after another, leading up to a climactic Powwow that is, in the end, riddled with bullets, realization, and reconciliation.What does it mean to be an Indian? How does it feel to be an Indian? This, the author says, is his focus. And the novel is dark. It depicts the urban Native American who suffers without an anchor. The Native American’s past has been erased nearly as completely as his lands have been taken.THERE THERE is powerful, tragic, but in odd ways hopeful.One caveat?

I’ve always been intrigued by the American Revolution. I’ve lived in Boston all my life, and the history of Boston is inextricably linked with the Revolution.THE FIRST CONSPIRACY by Brad Meltzer, most of which takes place in the 1770s, centers on a scheme to assassinate the leader of the Colonial army, a man revered and crucial to the morale of soldiers and populace alike, George Washington. That’s a flashy premise, certainly good for a title. But the real intrigue of the book is an outlining of the first spying, the first intelligence, and counterintelligence, the first corps of trained men – our Secret Service, Washington’s “bodyguards” – whose sole job was to protect the president.The strength of THE FIRST CONSPIRACY is in the details. Meticulously researched, they describe the men involved most intimately on both sides – where they came from, what their personalities were like, why they did the work they did. George Washington, for instance, is painted as a man who put honor and dignity above all. We see this in page after page describing his actions.Conversely, the plight of the Connecticut farmer whose wife died leaving six children at home, a man who turns traitor for money to help support his children and farm, is heartrending. The goodness of this man gradually reemerges; as a spy in the local prison, he gains intelligence crucial to the Patriot cause.And fake news? The authors give examples of this as well – in one instance, a letter put into important hands claiming that the intent of one of Washington’s most trusted generals to betray his commander. The letter was proven to be an out-and-out lie. Still, in this instance, and in others in the book, I found myself thinking how little things have changed.In the face of all this praise, why only a four-star rating, you ask? Several reasons:First, repetition. Editors have primed me to avoid repeating facts of the same incident when I change from one person’s POV to another’s. Apparently, these authors have not learned this. Either that or they didn’t trust the intelligence of their readers. Or they simply needed to fill space. The repetition does make this relatively short book longer.Second, every chapter ended with a dramatic cliffhanging statement that sometimes just didn’t follow through made me feel manipulated.Third, one of the authors himself gave the book a 5-star rating on Goodreads. OK. So maybe other authors do this. Maybe it’s a totally acceptable, even expected thing to do. Maybe it’s a male thing. I simply don’t know.Whatever, my four-star rating counters it. I give these authors kudos for research and detail and readability. And for enjoyment. But then, to risk repeating myself, I am an American history buff.

But if you suspect that the deck is stacked against us, and you want proof, give it a go.Is this book witty? Yes! Articulate? Yes! Intelligent and insightful? Yes!That said, I found it seriously flawed. It is far too long – particularly in light of the importance of the message and the endless time it took to get there. For the first half of the book, I felt that the author was enjoying her own cleverness. Did we really need so much of it and on so many topics? Okay. Maybe men do think about sex all the time, and maybe teenage daughters are morose, and maybe women are more like the worst of Big Little Lies than we want to believe.But it gets boring to read about after a while. I mean, we get the point. Too often the narrative felt like an essay for the New York Times Magazine, where the author is a staff writer.

All of this is meticulously researched and artfully written.As is the job of a historian (vs. an opinion writer), the author presents the facts and lets readers draw their own conclusions. For instance, one critic of THE PIONEERS takes McCullough to task for shortchanging the story of Native Americans as they were pushed farther and farther west. But he neither justifies nor condemns. He simply presents.Same with the issue of slavery. He states (as is fact) that the framers of the Northwest Ordinance that preceded exploration into the Northwest Territories as expressly forbidding slavery, and details the frustration of the original settlers with later ones who wanted this changed.

I bought it because the author has been hyped as one of the leading writers of her generation (she’s 28), and perhaps she is. I do believe that her psychological analyses are brilliant, and Lord knows, she is a competent writer. A riveting plotter? Not so much. But then, plotting is not the point of this book.Set in Ireland, the story is of Marianne and Connell – she from a wealthy but dysfunctional family, he from a poor, single parent one. His mother, barely 17 when Connell was born but loving, is hired to clean Maryanne’s family home, which is how the two meet. They become best friends as teens, carrying on the most laconic discussions imaginable in her family kitchen. This evolves, eventually, into the sweetest, most innocent and soulful sex in her bedroom. Their relationship Is a secret one; neither breathes word about it outside her house for reasons of pride and social standing.We follow them from high school, where Connell is the revered jock and Marianne is considered odd, to university. There the tables turn; Marianne is in her element while Connell is the awkward, social inferior. Though they meet others and experiment with friendship, sex, and drugs, they inevitably return to each other as if for a refueling to fortify them against the outside world.What did I love about NORMAL PEOPLE? Its quietness. The under-spoken nature of the story’s telling. The description of location, from rural county Sligo in west Ireland to Dublin, the country’s heart. Connell’s sweetness toward Marianne during sex. His mother’s spunk.What I didn’t I love? The slowness of these two characters’ realization that they do love each other. They seemed positively dense at times. Because the reader has to live through all their mistakes (made over and over, it seems), this book is dark.I did love the Irish brogue of the audiobook reader. But that wasn’t enough to keep my frustration at bay. I suspect I’d have been happier reading this book in print, where I might have sped it up a bit.That said, I do recommend NORMAL PEOPLE. It’s a love story in an age where people are at the same time more connected and farther apart – sad in a way, but perhaps a window on reality?...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Sep 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41057294-normal-people

I bought this one because I loved the cover and, okay, because the title and summary sounded sophisticated enough.There’s nothing sophisticated about WHERE THE FOREST MEETS THE STARS. As I listened, I began wondering if it was a YA novel or a straight-out children’s book. Oh, the writing is competent enough – good grammar, nice descriptions. The main character is an ornithologist, which is interesting. She has recently lost both her mother and her own breasts to cancer, so she is a sympathetic character in that. And the plot has potential – little girl shows up at the heroine’s cabin claiming that she is an alien from a far-off galaxy. I really did want to believe that.But there is something rote about this book. The potential for emotion is there, but the carry-through is not. Turns of the plot are simplistic, such as when the male lead, who allegedly suffers from depression and agoraphobia, recovers after a few heart-to-hearts. Dialogue is flat, adding to the cardboard feel of the characters.The author does do a good job in making me wonder whether the little girl is, indeed, an alien – such potential here – though the child is too often a bratty little whiner. Okay. I listened to this book, and that may have been the way the narrator read chose to read it. She also made the female lead too argumentative at times, perhaps in an effort to create drama. Male voices sound identical. Female voices are all ballsy, apparently to distinguish them from the resonance of the main character, whose voice was lovely.Bottom line?

I actually don’t think I realized it was a thriller when I bought it.But the synopsis appealed to me: Two successful artists are happily married when, one day, the wife brutally and emphatically shoots her husband to death for no apparent reason, then goes totally and utterly silent – simply stops speaking – not a single word while she is in police custody, not a single word during her trial, not a single word at the mental hospital to which she is committed.The why of that is what drives this book, and the author does a wonderful job of releasing hints piece by piece. The narrator of the audiobook may have been a little too obvious in this regard, perhaps giving away more in his tone than I would have heard had I been reading the print version.

On one hand, it haunts with magic and fantastical images of men who change into tigers and vice versa; on the other hand, it is gruesome and far-fetched.Set in 1930’s Malaya (Malaysia, today), it tells entwined stories of a young 11-year-old houseboy whose task is to return a severed finger to the grave of his newly deceased master, and a young woman who accidentally comes into possession of a severed finger. The same finger? I don’t know. Whatever, there is superstition involved for both.What worked for me in THE NIGHT TIGER? I found the main characters totally likeable; I truly cared what happened to them. I enjoyed learning about another culture. And the author, Yangsze Choo, read the audiobook herself and was incredible.That said, there was so much packed into this story that I had trouble following it. Was it magic? Realism? Culture? Lore? Fantasy? Romance? Murder mystery?In comparison to the rest of the book, the climactic event of the mystery seemed almost simplistic. Some readers criticized the love story between the young woman and her half-brother. But if they are not related by blood, is there a ‘yuk’ here? Not for me.

Not only is he thrust into a position he doesn’t want, but when he could have any woman in the world, he falls for the woman who cleans his house. She is an immigrant without a passport, trouble right there. She also can’t speak English well. So what is the basis of their relationship?

I even loved the sex, though, it is far tamer than that in any of the Fifty Shades books.What didn’t work for me? The constant introspection, something I hadn’t loved in the Fifty Shades books but that felt even more annoying here. The ending, which was simplistic. The kidnapping attempts, which felt far-fetched.THE MISTER was written the way romances were written thirty years ago. But others in that field have moved on. When they deal with subjects like sex trafficking, they do it right. This author did not. Genre writes give their characters depth. This author did not.

A young Irish woman lands in America in the 1860’s and improbably finds herself serving as lady’s maid to the mother of Andrew Carnegie. In the course of her duties, she catches the eye of the businessman himself, to the extent that he not only falls in love with her, but finds her a source of valuable advice in his business dealings.Realistic? No. Clara Kelley (a borrowed name, at that) is from a poor farming family and should have no clue how to be a lady’s maid, much less how to advise a huge industrialist on patent violations. That this Clara Kelley does both involves a willing suspension of disbelief. If one does that, CARNEGIE’S MAID is an enjoyable read.The author’s goal, according to the publisher’s blurb, is to suggest, fictitiously, the way in which a ruthless industrialist became one of America’s first philanthropists. It’s a noble cause, but a bit much for me.Still, as historical fiction goes, CARNEGIE’S MAID is a vividly detailed period piece.

I did a total turnaround regarding Sounds Like Titanic. Listening to it on Audible, at first I thought I’d die. Between the unusual writing style and the melodrama in the narrator’s tone, I considered returning it. Fortunately, I did not. Once into it, I found Sounds Like Titanic to be the most unusual, witty, on-the-mark meaningful, and downright enjoyable piece of both poignancy and social satire I’ve experienced in years.It is non-fiction, a memoir written by a violinist from Appalachia, who got into Columbia University on the merit of her music, only to find that she is the very worst one there. Still, she needs to make money to pay her tuition. So she starts working for “the composer,” a never-named guy who is nice enough and talented enough and smart enough to know what people want. They want music. He puts together a series of CDs of the music they want, basically take-offs of legit music (hence, the title, Sounds Like Titanic), and plays these CDs so loud at their venues (malls, school auditoriums, outdoor markets, and craft shows) that no one knows the musicians aren’t the ones actually making the sound.The beauty of this book is the Audible narrator. Once you accept that the melodrama is very much tongue-in-cheek, she is hysterical. It took me 30 minutes of listening before I was into the story enough to appreciate that. But then … well, I’ve been laughing out loud as I listen.Aside from style, the story tells of the author’s Appalachia childhood, her struggles in the big city (New York), her travels with “the composer,” and her observations through it all, some of which are so spot-on I found myself saying, “Yessss!” aloud in my car (between chuckles).

If not for that, I wouldn’t have known to pick it up. What a loss that would have been. It’s an amazing book.If you’ve followed me for a while, you know that my book group has been in existence for more than thirty years, that we pick our books at a dinner each June, and that I like our choices most of the time but not all. Admittedly, some people avoid joining book groups precisely because they don’t want to be forced to read a book they wouldn’t otherwise read. This is definitely one view. Reading time is finite, right? Often, though, I’ve been enriched reading books that I don’t personally choose. Waking Lions is a good example.Billed as a “literary thriller,” it tells of a young Israeli doctor named Eitan Green, who is the whistle-blower against corruption at the hospital where he works and is rewarded by banishment to a remote hospital in the desert. His wife, a police detective, gets a job in that desert town, and their two young sons struggle to adapt.Hating the desert and frustrated with his new hospital, Eitan is driving home on a deserted road late one night, pushing his four-wheel-drive to the limit, when he hits a man on the road. Immediately, he stops, but quickly realizes that the man will not survive. Should Eitan stay? Leave? Call the police? Spoiler alert: He leaves. Would you?This is the first of many moral dilemmas facing not only Eitan, but his detective wife, and the widow of the deceased man, plus others in both the police department and at the hospital.The author is in her mid-thirties, and I am in awe. Her writing is lyrical without being operatic, colorful in a succinct but powerful way. What most awed me about this book is its plotting.

Based on the s at the time, I feared it would be too serious, too Biblical, too long. Then, last December, my family spent a week in Israel, and after visiting Masada, around which this story revolves, I felt impelled to read it.Masada is a mountaintop, a mesa really, in the Judean Desert overlooking the Dead Sea. An entire city existed there once, replete with meat markets, bakeries, textile emporiums, temples and schools. In the year 73 CE, it was the last stronghold for more than 900 Jews who were standing their ground against the conquering Romans. When it became clear that their water and food was gone and that they were surrounded by the enemy and couldn’t possibly survive, they made the decision to kill themselves rather than be killed by the Romans or taken as slaves. When the Romans scaled their walls, they found bodies.The real-life story is one of determination, faith, and free choice. Hoffman’s fictitious account is no less stirring. She imagines that two of the women on Masada and a handful of children were exempted from the slaughter by the Jews themselves, for the express purpose of telling their story to the world. The Dovekeepers is that story.Actually, Hoffman tells the stories of four Masada women – their early lives in other places, how they came to Masada, their existence in the dove keep there, and their increasingly complex relationships with each other. She weaves a typical Hoffman-esque web around these women, with enough of the magical to satisfy lovers of Practical Magic.The Dovekeepers is historical fiction at its best. Talk about a community of women. Talk about mothers and daughters, daughters and fathers, lovers, political strife, even maternal instincts gone awry.

It’s the memoir of a woman living in poverty with her very young child, dependent on government assistance to survive — a woman who always wanted to be a writer and finally does earn a college degree in creative writing — a woman who, with this memoir, is now a published writer. To support herself and her child along the way — and to satisfy the prerequisite for receiving government aid — this single mother works as a maid.Interesting premise? Yes. Reviews referred to it as “an important memoir,” “an unapologetic account,” and “a beautiful, uplifting story of resilience and survival.”I wanted to feel some of that about Maid, but I struggled. By nature, I’m an optimist. I see the glass as half full. The author does not. For her, the glass is half empty. The studio apartment she rents for herself and her child has black mold. The clients who pay her to clean are gross. The caseworkers who see that she gets food stamps are insulting. Customers behind her in line at the supermarket are condescending.I’m not sure what I expected. But it wasn’t endless negativity. Despite the lengths to which the author went to describe her horrible life, I couldn’t feel sorry for her. She felt sorry enough for herself. Part of the problem for me was that I listened to the Audible version of this book, which the author herself read. So when I heard self-pity, I believed it.One last thought. I know women who clean homes. Yes, it’s a dirty job. And no, I wouldn’t want to do it. But the women I know who do it, like that they work mother’s hours, like that they make a mirror shine, like that they earn money.One more last thought. For the life of me, I can’t figure out why this author chose to keep working a job she so detested. It seemed to be one more bad choice in a life full of them (an issue she doesn’t explore). She worked as a maid earlier in her life, long before she was homeless, and knew what it entailed – not the least being that it often pays sub-minimum wage. And hey, I agree that even minimum wage is way too low. I regularly vote to raise it. But until that happens, I have to think that there are other jobs for minimum wage that this woman might like better. No?I feel like an unsympathetic curmudgeon posting this .

Something passes between them, an instant connection. She thinks of getting off; he thinks of getting on. Neither acts, and the moment is lost – but not forgotten. She spends the next year hunting for him; he spends the next year hunting for her. Then they finally see each other again in an untenable circumstance …But I can’t say more without giving away the story, and why do that? It is beautifully written, with twists and turns enough to keep emotions running high. Call it a romance if you want; I prefer to think of it as a smartly-written slice of modern life. Compared to other books I’ve recently read and ed, it’s nowhere near as heavy as Paris in the Present Tense, as timely as Home Fire, or as culturally relevant as Becoming. But, boy, is it a pleasure to read.Adding to the pleasure? Hugely? The readers of the Audible version, to which I listened. There were two, one female and one male. Both are truly skilled actors and give the story warmth and charm and flair. If you watch “Poldark” on PBS’s Masterpiece, you’ll recognize the female voice as that of Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays Demelza. She’s wonderful here.One Day in December is billed as a Christmas love story. And fine, if you don’t believe in love at first sight, this book may not be for you. But if you’re feeling fanciful, and you want something to sweep you up and take you away at any time of year, why not give it a try?...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38255337-one-day-in-december

I say that in all caps, right at the start, because this is not a partisan book, as in blue versus red. Michelle Obama’s Becoming is the story of a woman’s quest to find herself. It is universal and not to be missed.For starters, the writing is beautiful. Yes, the acknowledgment page names people who helped with the writing, but I can’t hold that against the author. She took creative writing courses at Princeton, nothing to sneeze at. And the ideas here, the content, is hers alone.Typically, when listening to an audiobook, I avoid those read by the author. Some authors seem driven by ego to think they can play different parts in a book as well as a professional reader. I’ve listened to a few author-read samples that are perfectly awful. Becoming is an exception for several reasons. First, being a memoir, the story’s voice is Mrs. Obama. Second, she knows the story and feels every line. Third, her voice is mellifluous, as in lyrical and pleasant to hear.I would have edited down some of the childhood detail at the start, but the pace soon picks up and is spot on. Mrs. Obama agonizes over the demands of a legal career, over the pull-and-tug of being a working woman raising children, over the angst of ceding her independence when her husband chose to run for higher office. Though I’m neither black nor the wife of a US President, I identified with her deeply.Last fall, when I posted a shot of Becoming in my TBR pile, several women commented that they refused to go anywhere near this book.

Because the synopsis starts with mention of a terrorist takeover at an A-list social event in South America, and I don’t do terrorism for pleasure. Since I read for pleasure, seeing the word “terrorist” was enough to turn me off.How. Stupid. Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors, and so many of my friends had loved BEL CANTO that I should have listened. Ach.

She had so many different voices to portray – Opera singer, two female terrorists, three Asian men, three Latin generals, a Russian, a Frenchman – that a lesser reader would have failed. This one spoke perfectly in all these different voices.The real gem, though, is Ann Patchett. She isn’t full of herself. Her writing is smooth and vivid, if spare. She imbues each of these characters with unique qualities, all of which blend to make her story an exquisite tapestry.“Bel Canto” translates to “beautiful singing,” and yes, opera plays a part in the book. Not being an opera buff, I wasn’t so much intrigued by this, though, as by the emotional growth of the characters as days of siege become weeks, then months. Some ers point to Stockholm Syndrome to account for the connections that form between captives and captors, but I think there’s more. What we see in BEL CANTO is the removal of people from their prescribed lives enough to be able to see themselves and their strengths in very different ways.BEL CANTO has zoomed to the top of my all-time-favorites list.

The main voice is that of George Washington Black, born a slave on a sugar plantation in Barbados in the 1830’s. From the outset, I was immersed in the mind of that very young boy, understanding the fear of being singled out and punished, the drive for survival, the choice between obedience and death that marks the life of a slave under a brutal master. I lived through Wash’s movement into a different life, one that involves reading and writing, drawing, and the growth of self-respect and calm.But is there ever calm in the life of a black man of that (or any) time? This is one of the questions I believe the author was asking. She gave Washington Black a disfiguring facial burn, which only accentuated his visibility as he moved off the plantation into a wider world that is, itself, cruel to blacks.Honestly?

The instant I finished its explosive ending, I wanted to write a  saying this, but decided to let my feelings simmer. Time changed nothing. Several weeks later, I’m as appreciative as ever. Home Fire is one of the most powerful books I’ve read in a long, long time.With overtones of a Greek tragedy, Home Fire tells of the three children of a dead jihadist – the emotional burdens they bear at British Pakistanis, and the extremes to which they go for the love of their father and for each other. Entwined with their stories is that of the son of a British Home Secretary, a lapsed Muslim whose approach to jihadists and their kin is rigid.I was drawn in at the very opening of the book, when the oldest of those three children, heading for a post-graduate program of study in America, is detained in the airport and questioned so long that she misses her flight. Her mindset during the interrogation, what she puts up with as she holds her tongue, is heartrending.Home Fire is not first and foremost a political book. Mostly it is about family – about fathers and sons, about narrow-mindedness.The author is unbelievably skilled, her writing lyrical without being obtrusive. And the narrator of the Audible edition to which I listened? Perfect. She captured each of the characters as I would have imagined that character to be.My book group is discussing Home Fire at our next meeting. Of the many discussion points, there is the intersection of politics and family, the responsibility of a parent, and the making of a terrorist. I hope we discuss question like how much sympathy we should or should not have for the child of a terrorist. What are the pros and cons of a zero tolerance policy? What kind of people are we if we turn away from those who cry for help after making a mistake? Is it possible to rehabilitate a jihadist?Finally, there’s this: Should the leader of country be flexible and recognize when his personal animus is affecting his policy? This question is front and center in Home Fire, just as it resonates between the lines of newspapers in America today....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Sep 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33621427-home-fire

Growing up in southern Georgia, she was taught love of everything wild by her mother, who sent her out to explore the forests, saying, “Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.” Where the Crawdads Sing is set in the marshland of the North Caroline coast, but it captures that same love of things wild.Not the least of those things wild is Ms. Owens protagonist, Kya Clark, the fabled “Marsh Girl,” whose family members leave their marsh home, one by one, to escape an abusive father. When he leaves also, Kya raises herself. Her family is the creatures of the marsh, who know her well. Unschooled, she is extraordinarily bright, and while she does make makes human friends with great care, she remains always that little bit different and apart.A murder mystery keeps the plot moving, but it is the beauty of the writing, the portrayal of Kya and the marsh she loves, that gives this book breathtaking life...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Sep 09, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing

The premise is of a marriage that is rocked when the male half is sent to prison – for a long time – for a crime he didn’t commit. The fact that this man is African-American, that the victim saw black without features, that the judge was more concerned with wrapping up the trial than finding a just verdict, adds light to NFL players taking a knee in protest of a faulty criminal justice system.But this book isn’t about politics. It is about love and the things that test its strength. Yes, it’s about injustice. But is it quintessentially black? No. I kept thinking that the events and emotions described could as easily have had to do with any minority as with a black one, and while wrongful imprisonment is a major theme, economic disparity is another.I wish I had read this book in print. If so, I might have given it five stars, rather than four. The audiobook had two readers, female and male for those different POVs, but neither one gave the main character, Celestial, the strength I felt she warranted.

Cuba has always fascinated me – so close and yet so far. If I had a bucket list, visiting Cuba would be on it. That said, despite the recent loosening of travel restrictions, it still isn’t an easy place to visit.This is one of the themes of this book – feeling the restrictions of life as a Cuban and dreaming that it will change – albeit for very different reasons. The two voices of the book are the Elisa of 1959, living in Cuba with her wealthy family in the lead-up to the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, and Marisol, her journalist granddaughter, who grew up in Florida after her grandparents fled Cuba and who now returns as a visitor to spread her grandmother’s ashes there.The plot switches between past and present, between Elisa and Marisol. In the smoothest of transitions, we learn about Elisa’s life and loves, all the while Marisol, who was raised on her family’s stories of Cuba, is living them for herself. I came to love both women. I came to love their revolutionaries. I came to rush into each new chapter to find out what would happen.This book is at the same time a war story, a love story, and a family saga. It is also an education into the history of Cuba, with keen insight into her people, both sixty years ago and now. From what I’ve read, Chanel Cleeton grew up with the same stories as her Marisol. Each one drew me in. Yes, there were times when the plight of Cubans, first under Batista, then under the Castros, was vaguely repetitive and might have been shortened. By the end of the book, though, I felt deeply for the cause in part because of the passion of these characters.A final word.

From the get-go we know who committed the murder, but the question that kept me reading is why. This is never answered. Likewise a child who went missing when the murder occurred. She is not the murderer; we know that. But waiting for her to show up kept me reading as well. She never does.Honestly? I felt used.And yet the prose in this book is beautiful. The author is clearly skilled. She has an MFA in creative writing, currently teaches it, and has been associated with renowned writing programs. Her skill is apparent in descriptions of the setting, the minds of the central characters, the minds of the minor characters, even the mind of a bloodhound that is used to track the missing child.Did I need to know about the bloodhound? No! Did it add to the plot? No! It was a major intrusion in the flow of said plot, included, I assume, simply to highlight the author’s gift of description.So Ruskovich is a skilled wordsmith. She is not as skilled a novelist. Time-wise, she flips back and forth in ways that detract from the plot. She touches on an issue like memory that then, like the mysteries, goes nowhere.I’ve vacillated in rating this book, three stars to two and back. I finally left it at three because of the prose.

Clock Dance was comforting. But comforting can also be slow. Willa Drake, Tyler’s protagonist, is oddly simplistic in the way she thinks, talks, and acts. This adds to a lack of urgency in the book. There are flashbacks at the start, lots of filling in about the heroine’s past, with Willa going along, going along, going along. It was only when the present kicked in that I came to feel that Willa was someone to admire.The premise is simple. Woman leads a pleasant enough life, but one that lacks fulfillment, until she makes a spur-of-the-moment decision to fly cross country to care for a woman her son used to date. That woman has a daughter, a dog, and a neighborhood of warm, caring friends with whom Willa bonds – all the while juggling the needs of her increasingly disgruntled second husband.I love reading about a good-hearted person, and Willa Drake is that. Attuned to satisfying the needs of other, she too often ignores her own needs. Sound familiar? It did to me. Aren’t many women like this? In time, she has a gentle awakening, at which point I pushed a slow fist in the air.There is nothing suspenseful or riveting or edge-of-the-chair tense about this book.

Before my group picked it last June, my impression One of the downsides of belonging to a book group is having to read books you wouldn’t choose yourself. was that the author was brilliant but intense, and dealt with subject matter beyond my scope.I came to love this book. I say “came to” because it took a while. Oh, the characters were described with a detail and flavor that awed my writer’s mind. But much of the early dialogue contained either biblical references or political discussion of the times in which the book was set (the decade following the formation of the state of Israel) and went right over my head. Listening to the audiobook in my car, there were many times when I wondered where the story was headed, why I was listening, why I cared. I zoned out more than once.The man who read Judas was talented, capturing different voices with skill, if with a certain lulling quality. Add that lulling quality to the philosophical dialogue, and yes, my mind wandered. I was in the midst of one little zone-out, when the main character began describing Judas Iscariot – yup, that Judas, the one who allegedly betrayed Jesus. Something caught me then. I actually pulled to the side of the road, stopped the car, and clicked back several minutes, then resumed driving and listened closely.The dialogue described a Judas I had never known – a man who was hired to infiltrate Jesus’s followers, discover what his appeal was, and find reason to take him out – a man who then fell in love with the man and his message, and who came to be his most ardent follower. Judas was put forth as the most devout of the disciples, the one on whom Jesus depended most, the one who convinced Jesus to go to Jerusalem not out of betrayal, but out of avid conviction that as the true son of God, once crucified, he would descend from the cross alive and prove his divinity to the others. When the divine failed to happen, he was crushed, blamed himself for Jesus’s death, and committed suicide.The book came alive for me after that. Not only did Judas and Jesus become real people, but the four main characters did as well. The latter have all been damaged either by family circumstance, politics, or war. But they are sympathetic characters. I did come to care for them. Several days after finishing this book, I am still thinking of the meaning of betrayal and who was the real traitor among these characters in the book.FYI, my book group found Judas too difficult to get into and voted to discuss another book instead. I’m sorry for that. Contrary to their fears, you don’t need knowledge of history or of the Bible to appreciate this book. Based on characterization alone, it made me think, which is one of the reasons I read.I’ve given this book four stars, rather than five, simply because I believe that the author rambled at the start, that if he (or his editor) had suggested cutting a bit, more people would read it. Judas is definitely an exercise. But it’s an important book....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27403373-judas

I’ve heard interviews with him, and we agree on so many things to do with writing that I like to think he’d be a friend.The first book of his that I ever read was The Charm School, and a little more recently Gold Coast. I drifted away from his work for a while, because the intrigue-and-action genre isn’t entirely my thing. But The Cuban Affair came out this fall, and any book that flies from book carton to top of bestseller lists is one I need to read, if only to see what’s so special about it. That said, I’m also intrigued by Cuba. Had Obama been able to open more doors before his eight years expired, I’d have been rushing through. I’m not sure that door is open as wide now, so second best is reading about modern day Cuba.Humor, adventure, location, sex, mystery, action – this book has it all. But honestly? What clinched it for me was the reader. I’m in love with Scott Brick. He has one of the sexiest voices I’ve heard in a while. Okay, okay, DeMille created a guy who was pret-ty cool. But Scott Brick gave him life.Would I have enjoyed The Cuban Affair as much if I’d read it in print? Maybe, maybe not. I’d probably have skimmed parts of it, certainly the action sequences – which would actually have been a shame. The choreography of those scenes was amazing – who shot whom where, how fast and in what direction the good guy’s boat had to go to outrun the two boats in pursuit, which ways his boat had to veer to avoid being hit. DeMille, a Vietnam War veteran, is a master at that. He is also a master at intricate plot twists and turns, of which there are plenty in The Cuban Affair. He put enough wit into the dialogue to keep me chuckling, which I’d likely have done reading the book in print as well. He also wove in a love story. Okay, okay, as love stories go, it may not have had the depth of love stories several female authors I know write, but it worked in his book. As the protagonist says in the very last line, “Corny, I know. But what the hell.” Spoken in Scott Brick’s sexy voice?

I even wondered if The Story of Arthur Truluv should be called a novella, though, by definition of novella (I just Googled it), this story is a little too long.

The eponymous Arthur’s thoughts, especially, had me laughing out loud at times.I would not call the prose literary, which is a good thing. It’s more stream of consciousness in a way that gets us into the minds of the characters, both the two I’ve mentioned and a third, a lonely woman, also in her eighties, who jumps at the chance for a new adventure. Nope. We’re not talking a love story in the traditional sense, though a deep, heart-warming love does develop between the characters.The story is simple, perhaps too much so.

Tuesdays are when new books hit the stands – did you know? A publisher once told me that the practice was rooted in giving a book a full seven days of sales before stores had to report sales figures on Wednesday mornings to the New York Times. With so many other bestseller lists now, including hour-by-hour ones all over the place, I think this is starting to change. For me, though, old habits die hard. Some Monday nights I’m chomping at the bit, wondering what books will show up the next day.I didn’t have to wonder about Sing, Unburied, Sing. It had been talked about for weeks, generating buzz among the literati, lots and lots of raving s.So that Tuesday, I went straight to this book. I read the synopsis, read the first few pages, thought, “Important, but heavy,” and got cold feet. Several weeks later, I came close again, lost my nerve again. Before long, Sing, Unburied, Sing had won the National Book Award. It was named Time Magazine Best Novel of the Year and a New York Times top 10 of 2017. I told myself that I had to read it, but I knew it I had to pick the right time.That time came shortly after Thanksgiving. Feeling upbeat and strong, I downloaded Sing, Buried, Sing and began listening. There were three readers, one of whom was Rutina Wesley, who had played Tara in HBO’s True Blood. I had loved her on the show and was looking forward to hearing her voice.And it was wonderful, her voice was. So were the other voices. I got carried away from the start with the beauty of the prose, the lyricism, the rhythm. Listening to Sing, Unburied, Sing was like listening to an exquisitely-composed song. The prose was absolutely magnificent, not only at the opening, but through the entire book.Too much so. That’s the only reason I can find why I didn’t love this book. The story was painful but beautiful, and the mystical elements worked for me. But the prose went on and on, one image more gritty and deep and symphonic than the next. It was vivid. I saw. I felt. Did I fully understand all of the imagery? Absolutely not.I do recommend this book. As I said above, it’s important. But Sing, Unburied, Sing is two complete things – one, a work of art, the other a novel. I had trouble combining the two, perhaps my problem, but there it is. This is one book I might have been better reading than hearing. Then I would have experienced this gorgeous prose in a different pace and tone. I might have had an easier time hearing the story. I might have reread and reread again those images that didn’t entirely make sense.Then again, it may be that the prose is the story here. Can a symphony also be a successful, accessible drama?

Apparently, others shared that humble opinion, since the book was recently awarded the 2017 National Book Award for YA Fiction.I believe it deserves it for many reasons, but let me say a word first about Young Adult novels. I do love them. I find them fresh and interesting. I love that they have vivid analogies, but lack the pretension of literary fiction. I love that their plots are timely. I love that those plots move. I’m speaking in generalities, of course. Some YA fiction is too young, too fast-paced, or too slangy for me, and a poorly-written book is a poorly-written book regardless of genre.Far From The Tree has the best of the best and none of the worst. It tells of three teenagers, all living with different families and unaware of each other until, in a twist of fate, they discover they share a biological mother. Connecting with each other is new, exciting, and at times terrifying for each of them at the most complicated time of their lives. The thrust of the story is how their relationship with each other develops and how it helps them deal with all of those other complications their lives have brought.The siblings, Grace, Maya, and Joaquin, are beautifully drawn, very different from each other as people, yet alike in some of the most elemental ways. Their voices rang true, as did their emotions and their behavior. Each was sympathetic, each grew as the story progressed. Was the ending wrapped up a little too sweetly? Maybe. But I liked it.Far From the Tree is about family – how you define it, blood-bound or not. It’s about the deepest emotions that tie people together, how those emotions can bring paralysis or progress.

Most recently, I read “The Japanese Lover,” and given the quiet, warm, cohesive feeling it gave me, was really looking forward to reading “In The Midst of Winter,” well, in the midst of winter.This one didn’t do it for me like “The Japanese Lover” did. In theory, it should have. The ingredients are all there. There are three major characters in “In the Midst of Winter. Two are immigrants, one from Guatemala, one from Chile, and Allende tells their stories in heart-wrenching detail. Goddaughter of former Chilean president, Salvadore Allende, she clearly knows of what she speaks. That part fascinated me. And each of these two characters’ relationships with the third character, a rather neurotic professor at NYU, come together cleverly.My problem was with the last third of the book, when description of third-world country life falls aside and plot takes over. At this point, my credulity was strained.There are just too many holes, starting – for this cat lover (i.e., me) – with a pet cat that is accidentally poisoned; his owner is initially panicked, then just seems to forget about the cat completely. The emotions fail here. Same with the handicapped boy for whom one of the characters is the caretaker; she cares deeply about him one day and barely thinks about him the next. As for larger pivotal twists, much of the last third of the book consists of the main characters covering up a crime in a manner than any modern law enforcement officer would sniff out in a heartbeat. Likewise, a woman goes missing – and stays missing, i.e., dead – without much notice. Two cars are involved in a trek that should have invoked suspicion but does not. The book’s ending involves a too-rapid sum-up of events. The stilted love story is too chatty, too out of nowhere, simply not complete. That’s it. This book felt incomplete.Even the title. Its meaning isn’t terribly deep. Yet despite prominent display at the book’s opening of the quote from which it comes, Allende felt a need to have one of her characters credit it at the end.

A good editor might have pared these down.Mostly, I wanted more on relationships. We have four separate stories here, one for each of the children who learns his fate. Only at the end do we learn, in hindsight, how each of the siblings think of each other. And the ending is marginally redeeming. Still, the siblings’ connection felt remote to me. Granted, I’m not wild about magic or moneys. But that’s me, and I am not the author of this book.Chloe Benjamin is 28. Was she simply too young to handle the emotional potential of this story?

But the story, which alternated between 1944 and 1973, was lighter than many of those other WWII books on the market right now.THE TUSCAN CHILD has likable characters, beautiful scenery, good food, a little murder, a little romance, a little history — all brought together in a nice bundle. I took off a star for the occasional contrivance, and for those moments that read a bit like a travelogue. But my need for Tuscany and for green were well met.One caveat. The narrators of this audiobook were so good that they may have added something that isn’t there in print.

I remember enjoying it – feeling a pleasant intimacy in the process.That was partly why I picked up this author’s new one, The Ninth Hour. The other part was that it was short – and yeah, that sometimes matters, given my listening options. Eight hours of Audible listening is eminently do-able.I had read the blurb telling what The Ninth Hour is about, but I’m not sure it was entirely accurate. I found the brilliance of this book not to be in the mother and daughter mentioned first in the blurb, but in the nuns we get to know, their work in a deeply Catholic enclave of Brooklyn in the 1900’s, their dedication to the ill and the poor, and the rules they break to do what they feel is right.Oh, Annie and Sally (the mother and daughter mentioned above) were interesting characters, as were others on the periphery. But the book came alive for me in the vivid portrayal of the nuns – Sister St. Savior, Sister Jeanne, Sister Lucy and Sister Illuminata. Each had her own personality, her own history, her own strengths and faults.I kept waiting for the plot to sweep me up and whisk me along, but that isn’t what Alice McDermott does. She captures the intricacies of life, sometimes briefly, other times in full force. One of the most brilliant scenes I have ever read in a book was that of Sally’s overnight train ride from New York to Chicago. I was right there in the grittiness with the sounds, smells, tastes, and sights. The personalities of the characters were exact, the portrayal of human frailty painted with a rawness that prickles my skin even now. This, I believe, is Alice McDermott at her best. For this scene alone, The Ninth Hour is worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Oct 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33931059-the-ninth-hour

Then it raced on. After a slow opening, and engrossing middle, the ending actually felt too fast.I did like the characters – not love, but like – except for one. I did not, could not understand the behavior of the mother toward her youngest child. Her snappishness allowed the other three siblings to be unkind, exacerbating a problem in a teenager whose behavior was pivotal to the plot.

Elin Hilderbrand has made a name for herself penning novels set on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. Several years ago, I read one of hers, Summerland, and, while it was scenic, it was also thought-provoking.I enjoyed The Rumor, but more for fun than thought. It is filled with sympathetic characters – teens, parents, friends – who make bad choices until they get caught, at which point they atone. Tying it all together, more as a gimmick than a consequence, are rumors. Nantucket is, after all, an island. Its communities are insular, and Hilderbrand, a local, knows them well.This book gives island flavor. It gives you the angst of a writer trying to find a blockbuster next-book idea, twinship temporarily gone awry, beautiful gardens, and drama reminiscent of a mid-day soap opera. It was a little heavy with repetition, as in gossip spreading the same stories from character to character. And the ending was perhaps too speedy for the slower pace of the rest. But The Rumor is well written. Nothing deep here. Just enjoyment.I give it four stars because of that enjoyment factor.

I was also interested in this particular book because, though I hadn’t read it myself, the author’s previous book, The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry , was raved about by many of my friends. Reading Young Jane Young would be my redemption.Redemption should always be as enjoyable!I wasn’t sure it would be, at first. The pivotal character is a young woman who has an affair with a married Congressman in whose office she works. Having lived through the Monica Lewinsky scandal, I wasn’t sure I wanted to do it again.But this book is beautifully nuanced and skillfully drawn. The Congressman was actually a friend of the protagonist’s family, and there were few details about the affair itself, other than one pertinent fact that has meaning at the end. So if you’re looking for sleeze, you won’t find it here. Rather, Young Jane Young is a graphic study of gender differences, or perhaps power differences. After the scandal breaks, the Congressman makes his tearful apology and goes back to his work unscathed, while our heroine’s life is ruined. The Congressman knows this will happen. In a poignant moment, just before everything falls apart, he apologizes for putting her through what she will have to go through.The way she pulls herself up – how she does it, whether she succeeds, what kind of person she becomes – is the heart of the book. Ms. Zevin does a masterful job, mercifully understated and non-melodramatic, of portraying the emotional damage the affair caused and the bravery that resulted. And it isn’t just the voice of the woman involved. We see her mother’s view, her young daughter’s view, even the view of the Congressman’s wife.With perfect pacing and just enough plot twisting, Young Jane Young humanizes a very difficult situation.

How many stars do you give a book that may be written passably but that you hate? Yes, hate is a strong word. But that’s how I felt about Mrs. Fletcher. I found the characters unlikeable from the start – found them self-absorbed, spoiled, self-pitying – and the multiple narrators of the audiobook didn’t help, particularly the voice of the 18-year-old. Nor did it help that the author is a media darling and male. Sorry, but I have to say that. It’s the only thing that explains critics tripping over themselves to give him a good . Those s built my expectation far higher than the author was able to go.Mrs. Fletcher is clever. The slang is hip. It gets in all the hot-button topics: online dating, online porn, gender dysphoria, bullying. It presents a side of modern life that may be prevalent today. Or not.The book is billed as a glimpse into the world of a divorcée whose only son goes off to college, leaving her alone with her unfulfilled sexual dreams. Perhaps the message here is more about the internal life of a woman as she ages – or in this instance, of a woman who fights aging.I fight aging. I work out, play tennis, dress as young as I dare without being inappropriate. I think about sex a lot, as those of you who read my books can guess. Still, Mrs. Fletcher left a really bad taste in my mouth – and it wasn’t only because of the portrayal of these particular characters. The author’s opinion of people over 60 is stereotyped and sad, which is odd, since he is 56 himself. But there were two hackneyed references to age, one to a couple that had been married fifty years, another to a woman in her early 70’s. I fall into both of those categories, and have a ton of friends who do, as well, but none of us are as old as the picture the author paints. Does Mr. Perrotta not realize that 70 is the new 55?I listened through Mrs. Fletcher to the very end, hoping that as critically-acclaimed and commercially-successful an author would redeem himself at some point. He did not. The ending was very sweet, perhaps a little too much so, but he failed to justify these particular characters reaching this point.Mrs. Fletcher is a glib, self-indulgent novel. I shudder to think how the movie will be. But then, I’ll never know. Oh, there will be one; Mr. Perrotta’s credentials assure that.

I actually stopped reading when I was three-quarters of the way through, simply didn’t feel the characters to be riveting, and when an earlier book of hers, The Emperor’s Children, was reissued, I passed on it. Then, last week, along came her new one, The Burning Girl. Since it was well-ed, I gave it a shot.The promotional material alluded to the bond of best friends, two girls who clicked in nursery school and shared everything until adolescence tore them apart. But I ran into trouble right at the start, because I never quite understood the connection between these two girls. I get that they were opposites – good girl versus bad girl, conservative girl versus daring girl, yin and yang perhaps. But I never bought into their attraction to each other. Yes, they both had blue eyes, and yes, they talked of being secret sisters, but I still don’t understand why. Their drifting apart in adolescence made far more sense to me than their attraction.Oh, there were nice moments, like when the author described another girl in their class, an evil one, as looking out of the corner of her eye like Sophia Vergara watching in a show that only she could see. Or the moment when Missud describes a man whose clothes looked like they’d been clipped on, like clothes on a paper doll, always slightly askew.But moments here and there were all I got here. The whole of the book didn’t work for me. As a chronicle of the agony of growing up, there was nothing new. Lots of other writers have done the same in a manner every bit as skilled. Yes, Ms. Messud’s prose is straight forward, clean, and easy to read (or listen to, as was the case). But brilliant? I didn’t see that.I felt particularly let down by the ending. What was intended to be a dramatic plot twist wasn’t dramatic at all, and what happened afterward was even more of a letdown. Worst, I felt that the author spent the last pages trying to add meaning to something whose meaning was negligible.As with Tom Perrotta in Mrs. Fletcher, an author this highly acclaimed suffers from inflated expectations.

And I use the word ‘marvelous’ not because I would normally use it myself, but because I can just hear the narrator using it in the British-accented voice of Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov. The setting is the Metropol Hotel in Moscow, in the 1920’s, 30’s, 40’s, and 50’s, chronicling the more than thirty years that our Count is held there under house arrest. The writer in me found this a fascinating twist – an entire, rich novel unfolding in a single confined place. The writing is brilliant. I may be biased, since the author graduated (albeit several years before) from the same high school as one of my sons. I’m not sure if Mr. Towles was an English major, a history or government major, or something else entirely, but his knowledge of Russia is remarkable. Likewise, his knowledge of classical music and literature – and, of course, words – actually, mostly words.A Gentleman in Moscow is a celebration of the elegance of words.

His dry wit, cleverness, knowledge, and sheer indomitable spirit truly make the book.A Gentleman in Moscow is not an action book or a thriller, but there is enough of each at opportune times to propel the plot forward.I would say that this book is about the process, rather than the journey.

Nine at the time, she went from one foster home to another before finally being adopted by a couple who hadn’t expected to have a child of their own.

Then, because I loved that earlier one and was looking for something with charm to listen to driving to and from the lake this summer, I bought this one.Good move, Barbara. Yes, it was heavy at the opening, as I feared from the synopsis. But once I got into it, I got INTO it.The Little French Bistro is a love story, not only one of romantic love but even more of self-love. The central character is a woman who feels unloved by everything in the world, first and foremost by the man to whom she’s been married for forty years. Her despair is so great that she throws herself into the Seine, intent on drowning. After a good Samaritan thwarts that plan, she stumbles from one experience to the next until she lands on the northwest coast of Brittany, where, little by little she discovers a side of herself that she never imagined. Of course, there is still the husband to contend with, though the woman she has become is very different from the one who disappeared in Paris.There are a lot of characters in The Little French Bistro, but they are wonderful and diverse. They are good people. And there is humor. The setting is every bit as flavorful as that in Ms. George's earlier book. As the protagonist comes to appreciate the sounds and smells of the coast, as she connects with the water, so do we. There is a tiny element of the supernatural here, but it is done so lightly and works so well with the prose, that even die-hard realists won’t mind.One late-plot twist involving the protagonist's husband bothered me. I’m not sure I’d have written the story quite this way. But then, this wasn’t my book to write.Another tiny element bothered me, and if any of you reading this  have thoughts on it, I could use your help. The title is The Little French Bistro. But is there an actual bistro in this book? I listened to the audiobook. Perhaps in a print edition the ""restaurant"" is occasionally called the ""bistro."" Yes? No? I understand the author and/or publisher wanting to capitalize on the popularity of the first book by picking a comparable title, and ""bistro"" has more charm than the plain old ""restaurant."" But as marketing ploys went, I felt this was too much.Is The Little French Bistro too predictable, as some critics complained? I didn't think so. The end had twists I did not expect. Still, if this book is viewed as a woman's personal journey, yes, she does find herself. Does a happy ending make a book predictable? Or, conversely, do we need a tragic ending in order to be considered innovative?Did I like The Little French Bistro as much as I liked The Little Paris Bookshop? Hard to judge. The two are different.

Set in the aftermath of the Civil War, it tells of a man in his 70’s who makes his living traveling through northern Texas bringing news of the world, through live newspaper readings, to people who are hungry for escape. Early in the book, he agrees to take a 10-year-old orphan girl from Wichita Falls to relatives in San Antonio. The girl has lived the last four years as a Kiowa captive before being recovered by the US Cavalry. She knows nothing of her earlier existence, but thinks, talks, and acts like a Kiowa child.Man and girl travel together over 400 miles of rough terrain, with many a danger, no common language but much angst. Little by little, though, they bond – which is all I’ll say, lest I give away too much of the plot.To call NEWS OF THE WORLD a period piece is to short-change it.

This is important to say at the start, because the audiobook reader definitely added a dimension to the book. I assume that Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is wonderful to read in print alone. But hearing Eleanor’s voice, hearing her intonation and expressiveness, hearing the Scottish twist to many of the voices of her compatriots, was extraordinary.Eleanor Oliphant is a thirty-year-old social misfit for reasons we come to understand as the story unfolds. She is exceedingly bright but quirky, a creature of habit, a young woman very much alone and apart in a world of normal people. Though clearly damaged, Eleanor is so sweet, so innocent, so positively hilarious in her analysis of the world around her, that I came to adore her. Yes, it took a chapter or two for me to grasp what her voice was about, but once that happened, I was addicted. There were times when I smiled affectionately at her analyses, other times when I laughed aloud at the hilarity of them. In her utter ignorance of social mores, she often hits reality spot on. In that sense, we aren’t laughing at her, but with her. And it feels good.Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is about personal growth. Without quite realizing it’s happening – certainly without planning it – Eleanor tiptoes toward the mainstream with regard to things like her clothing, hair style, makeup, even employment. And her relationships with others? Raymond Gibbons, who has a huge bucket of his own quirks, comes to be the most honest, caring, loveable friend. And he’s but the foremost of many strong secondary characters in this book.In that the story is told in the first person, the writing is as straightforward and unfiltered as Eleanor’s mind. But that mind is far from simple. Life’s experiences have stunted Eleanor, that’s all. As the long-repressed truths of her life emerge, I was awed by her strength.I wanted this book to go on forever, I was that immersed in Eleanor’s journey. That it did not – that it stopped short of the melodramatic – is yet another tribute to the author.I’ve never been big on re-reading books. There are too many books I want to read for the first time, and too little time to read them. But this one – wow, this one I may have to reread, if for sheer uplift. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is that satisfying a read....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,not set,"Jun 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine

Seeming across the board, it was touted as unique and creative, brilliant and ground-breaking. The entire literary intelligentsia wanted to jump on the bandwagon, it seemed. Was this a classic case of the emperor’s new clothes, whereby ers were primed to rave lest they be considered less smart?Yes and no, I think. But first, the premise. Lincoln in the Bardo takes place in the course of a single night – the night after Abraham Lincoln’s 11-year-old son Willie, who died of typhoid one year into the Civil War, was buried. The setting is the cemetery where he was buried. The voices in the book include real life historians whose writings on Lincoln and the war are quoted, and voices of many of the fictional characters who are buried in that cemetery. These fictional characters with voices are “in the Bardo”, a Buddhist term for the in-between of earth and the hereafter, where souls wait to see if they go to heaven or hell.My opinion? The form is truly unique, creative, clever – all the adjectives the ers use. The mix of historical fact, which was thoroughly researched, and author imagination is awesome. The content? Less awesome. I loved the parts about Lincoln. They were real and heart-wrenching. But I’m not quite sure of the purpose of the rest. Maybe I just didn’t get it? Maybe, in fact, I am not intellectually astute enough to read more deeply into those other stories.In naming it a Best Book of February 2017, Amazon editors claim this book “will upend your expectations of what a novel should be.” The “should” in this sentence bothers me. Yes, this Lincoln in the Bardo breaks rules. But does it succeed in a way that satisfies the reader? Not necessarily. There were times when I felt that the author got swept up in his game at the expense of the reader, who may want to be enveloped by an emotionally cohesive story.Do I recommend this to my book group? Yes. The discussion of its form alone will be interesting. And I do think that we readers need to push ourselves at times.That said, I’m giving this book three stars until I read it again and perhaps feel more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,May 2017,"May 25, 2017","Jun 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

Maybe it was seeing it included in a new genre called Prophetic Dystopian Literature, and being curious.

I would love her for her descriptions of time and place, for her impeccable timing of events, and for the rhythm of her prose – even if I didn’t also love her for her subject matter, which I do. My first book of hers was STATE OF WONDER. It was one of the first audiobooks I listened to, and the reader was amazing. The same reader, Hope Davis, reads COMMONWEALTH, and adds a skillful dimension to this book.COMMONWEALTH is about family and the many shapes and forms it takes. It is a dense novel – lots of characters, lots of things going on, lots of issues. But it is absorbing, which was exactly what I needed as a distraction from politics. The story follows the lives of four adults and six children, from the 1960’s to the present, moving forward and back and forward again in time, in a way that should be confusing but isn’t. As a writer myself, I am in awe of Patchett’s skill in this. She paints characters who are fully realized and memorable, and layers them into a gripping story that needs no villain. The page-turning element comes from the twist and turns in the lives of these characters, about whom I came to care deeply.My only annoyance? The publisher’s hype refers to a kiss at a christening party between one man’s wife and another woman’s husband, that sets “into motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.” I kept waiting through that first scene for a sudden upheaval caused by the kiss, but it never came. The kiss was only one of many precursors of the story too come. The hype-quote is a marketing line, but it gives short shrift to the depth in the book.Training its sights on blended families and why we do what we do when life throws us a curve, COMMONWEALTH captures today’s world.

Non-fiction not being my thing, I was less that gracious as I read it, wondering the whole while what in the world my group would discuss. I worried that once we got past the horror of life in North Korea and the remarkable strength of downtrodden women, there wasn’t much to keep the evening going.I was very wrong. For starters, we had appetizers. The meeting’s host bought snack food at a Korean grocery, and the discussion leader brought Korean pears. The pears, which play a part in the story, seemed more an apple-pear hybrid, and were truly delicious. The snack food didn’t go over quite as well, largely because of its smell. But it spawned fun talk before we got down to the book itself.This book is a marvel. The title, NOTHING TO ENVY, comes from a propaganda phrase habitually drummed into North Koreans: “We have nothing to envy in the world.” The book tells the stories of six North Koreans who, each in his or her own way, escaped the country and were able to tell what life there is like.Barbara Demick became interested in this subject when she was a reporter for the L.A. Times, stationed in South Korea. She interviewed more than 100 people, that many in part to corroborate facts in the stories of the six she chose to profile. She visited North Korea eight times in all, each time shadowed by not one North Korean handler, but two – the second to make sure that the first remained tight-lipped. She wasn’t allowed to interview North Koreans in North Korea; the shutdown of communications was total. So she talked with defectors.Of this book’s strengths, even beyond the heart in the stories told, is the manner of the telling. The author moves back and forth between her subjects with a skill rivaling that of a master novelist. I can’t begin to imagine juggling so many facts and then putting them together in such a consummately readable way, all the while remaining objective.NOTHING TO ENVY is not a long book. Nor, though, is it an easy read. But it is riveting. Like THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, it is an important book. Prior to reading it, I knew few details about life for the average North Korean. Now I do. These details remain vivid in my mind even now. I fear this will help me understand more of what may be currently about to erupt between North Korea and the rest of the world....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2017","Apr 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6178648-nothing-to-envy

Then the style, the sensitivity, the sheer goodness of its characters took over and held me rapt.The meaning of the title is spelled out early on – that parenting involves making decisions without ever fully knowing whether what you’re doing is right. It’s trying to do what is best for your child with a roadmap that is murky and often shifting. “You never know,” the dad says during one soulful discussion with the mom. “You only guess. This is how it always is.” Is there anything more true?This Is How It Always Is explores an issue that is as current as any. My grandchildren are in three different states and twice as many different classrooms, but in each of those classrooms, there is at least one child with gender dysphoria. This Is How It Always Is tells of one such child and the efforts of his parents, his four brothers, and grandmother to accommodate his need to be a she. The story is at times painful, at times joyful, but always presented with such knowledge, such wit, such classiness and spunk that I found myself smiling in admiration time and again.The author, Laurie Frankel, swears this is a work of fiction, though she acknowledges that she has a child who used to be a boy and is now a girl. I read this in the Author’s Note, only when I was done reading the book, and while I do believe that she and her child are not these specific characters, her personal experience surely informs the emotions presented. Hand in hand with that, though, goes exquisite writing. Frankel’s style is witty and sweet, honest and crisp, thoughtful and thought-provoking.I often write about reaching forks in the road and having to turn left or right. This Is How It Always Is suggests that there are times when neither right nor left works and, instead, you have to go straight ahead, through the great unknown of the middle. Think about it.This Is How It Always Is is one of the best books I’ve read in months. It is a story with an ending that isn’t really an ending, simply a point en route to something more.

Whether writing or reading, I love being caught up in the intricate details of the lives of characters in a novel, but I have less patience with real life characters in works of non-fiction. If there’s a lesson to be learned from someone’s life, just tell me what it is.The introduction to Hillbilly Elegy does that. The author’s basic premise, stated up front, is that it’s their social culture, not the economy, that holds many poor people back. Vance, a self-avowed hillbilly who grew up in Appalachia, gives examples of friends and family who had good jobs and even better reason to keep them, but were simply too bored, too lazy, or too limited emotionally to show up for work every day. He argues that with no learned work ethic, they get jobs, lose jobs, stop looking for jobs, then blame others for their woes. Worse, they have the support of friends and family in this.I nearly stopped there. Here was the book’s message. I’d gotten it.Then came the rest of the book – the personal story of the author, who managed to escape thanks to strong grandparents, the marines, and mentor teachers.So I read on, and some of it was slow. I skimmed a little. But there were gems – like the idea that the problem isn’t the schools, but the lives children live before and after school – that role models are too few – that things like social networking, crucial to upward mobility, are foreign to these cultures. And I did come to care, personally, for J.D. Vance.Hillbilly Elegy could have been shorter (i.e., edited). But it presents a picture of life in depressed areas, a picture so un-PC that the media is too frightened to depict it. It’s about taking personal responsibility, taking ownership for one’s life.One last thought. J.D. Vance did a stint in the Marines that was a turning point in his life.

On one hand, I was drawn to it, because my own book-in-progress deals with grief, and I wanted to see how Hoffman handled hers. On the other hand, while my book is about creating a new, relatively happy life, only to discover that the past can’t be left behind, FAITHFUL sounded heavy. I wasn’t sure I could take heavy, what with the presidential election still dragging me down.But Alice Hoffman is, well, Alice Hoffman, meaning that it is worth the journey even when things along the way are bleak. And bleak they were at times. Increasingly, though, a light shone through, drawing me, breathless, to the very last page. FAITHFUL is a gut-wrenching story with refreshingly honest characters, refreshingly honest dialogue, and a refreshingly honest happy ending.A final thought. I had mixed feelings about Hoffman’s previous book, THE MARRIAGE OF OPPOSITES. I felt like a spectator to that one, rather than a participant. I suspect enough people told Hoffman the same thing – too much telling the reader what was happening and not enough letting the reader experience it first-hand through the characters – so that she did an about-face in FAITHFUL.

This book was at once one of the hardest I’ve read and one of the hardest to put down. Set in the years before the Civil War and told in the voice of a young slave girl with an indomitable spirit, it is simple and deep, stark and rich.I won’t retell the story; others have done that. Looking back on the whole of the novel, though, five things struck me.First, the innocence of the main voice. Cora thinks and speaks with a directness, perhaps a childish simplicity that some have criticized but that I thought appropriate. Having been born into slavery, she accepts and describes as unembellished fact the details of what she feels and sees.Second, her determination. It turns out that Cora’s quiet acceptance isn’t acceptance at all, but mere submission for the sake of a greater goal – escape.Third, the fate of those who helped blacks escape. I had no idea that collaborators were as suddenly and cruelly put to death in the way described here.Fourth, the doggedness of the slave catcher, Ridgeway. Whitehead gives him enough of a background to make him a full character, almost sympathetic at times, but not quite. I was quite happy to witness his numerous failures.Fifth, Cora’s enduring love-hate bond with her mother, who abandoned her to make good her own escape when Cora was ten. Do things ever change? Across the historical spectrum, the racial spectrum, the economic spectrum, girls are shaped by their mothers in lifelong ways. My only criticism of The Underground Railroad is the railroad itself, which Whitehead presents as a real one that ran underground through tunnels dug by escaping blacks. We know this never happened. Its presence in the book, made me wonder whether other descriptions of the events of that time are similarly fictitious. To some, that will detract from the power of this book.I’m not a fan of Oprah books. As a writer, I resent her influence in the world of publishing. Naturally, this is sour grapes. If she had ever picked one of my books (Family Tree, for instance, which presents a true-to-life racial dilemma in a predominantly white world), I would be singing her praises.

I deliberately open here with this statement to warn you. I did love this book – emotionally, intellectually, wholeheartedly – once I got to know the characters and the tension built. But it’s a quiet book, capturing the constraints of the society of the time.I don’t love war fiction. Strike that. I hate war fiction. But this was more about small town life and love, all exquisitely written. Moreover, being written by a woman in the voice of early-twentieth-century England, even the final descriptions of the war’s front lines were elegant. But powerful! Oh so powerful! Small town life rife with pettiness, gossip, and spite, hasn’t changed much from the early 1900’s to now. What has changed is a woman’s power to choose. The women in “The Summer Before the War” recognize what they have and where they want to go, and it’s great fun to watch them at work. I nodded in agreement through some parts, smiled through others, outright laughed at yet more.If you’re willing to simply sit back and enjoy the process until the scene is fully laid, your patience will pay off. You’ll love Beatrice and Agatha, Hugh and Daniel. Each has a depth hidden behind surface politeness.

It worked better for me than ""Olive Kitteridge,"" for which the author won a Pulitzer Prize. I suspect I missed some of its deepest elements, but I did enjoy the reading. It’s a short book. The prose is spare, every word carefully chosen. The author doesn’t waste my time. And the characters are likeable, rich but flawed, as in real life.The major theme, as I saw it, was how our lives are irrevocably shaped by our childhood, how our need for love comes from the love we did or did not have growing up, how our self-esteem (or lack thereof) is a direct result of these early experiences. For me, therefore, this was a book about love of both family and self. It is also about poverty and abuse, as defining experiences that make us who we are. This is certainly true of Lucy Barton, the book’s main voice, as well as of her mother, father, siblings, and childhood acqaintances. We’re talking about PTSD, whether resulting from war, family trauma, poverty, or abuse. Communication is key here – the ways in which we do or do not communicate. It’s certainly not a new subject. I’ve written of it many times myself. But I’m no Elizabeth Strout. Her handling is masterful, both in conception and execution.Lucy Barton is a lonely, haunted woman who badly needs love.  She is also bright, a writer, a thinker. For those reasons, she does move beyond her parents’ limitations. She makes her marriage work for a time, certainly better than her parents did theirs, and she clearly adores her children.  That said, history does repeat itself in small but niggling ways. Emotional baggage is hard to ignore.Perhaps, therefore, the book is a journey for Lucy, showing the movement toward understand of who she is and what she can do. Perhaps, in that sense, the title is the conclusion Lucy reaches? At book’s end, I hear her saying, this is my name, it’s who I am.I hope my book group discusses this book.

Each woman is dysfunctional in her way, bogged down by elements of loss, confusion, paralysis, or grief. Their individual stories are interesting, as is what happens when their paths cross.

And, indeed, through my reading of it, the plot riveted me. The author didn't pave new ground; I was all too familiar with the atrocities committed by Hitler's Third Reich. What fascinated me in this book was the growth of the main character from a reluctant participant in efforts to save Jews to a more willing, even eager one. His motives were far from pure; for each hideout he designed, he received a larger, more public commission, at a time when work for architects was scarce. But he did put his own life at risk, time and time again, especially in taking in one very special young boy.What bothered me about this book was the writing style.

On one hand, I found it beautifully written, filled with eloquent, often innovative prose. The descriptions are amazingly vibrant. Time and again, I was drawn intimately into time and place, could picture every scene in graphic detail. Likewise, the characters’ emotions are presented in great depth and with the ring of truth.My problem? Those emotions are dark. The characters are self-absorbed, egotistical people often driven to do bad things. The husband’s story is so slow at times that I might have given up if other ers hadn’t advised of good things to come with the wife’s story. And there are some interesting twists in “he said, she said” moments that are revealed to the reader only when the wife’s story unfolds. Toward the end of the book, something actually happened that I hadn’t seen coming. I gasped aloud, drawing the attention of others in the waiting room where I sat. That moment was the most fun I had listening to what was otherwise a painfully sad book.“Fates and Furies” was an Indie Next pick for October, so I’m glad I read it. As a writer, I was definitely inspired by the prose. Do I feel uplifted as a reader? No. That said, the farther from the book and its agonizingly lengthy detail I get, the more interesting I find the story.This raises a question. “Fates and Furies” lost a star in my mind because I felt that it went on and on for no purpose but the author’s literary indulgence.

The woman she chose to chronicle this time around, Beryl Markham, was the first woman ever to fly solo from England to North America, though this is a surprisingly small part of the book. The bulk of it details her childhood in what would become Kenya, her growing up years as a fiercely independent woman in a male-dominated world, and her endless bid for freedom.“Circling the Sun” is one of the most lyrically descriptive books I’ve read lately, which is one of the reasons I was desperate to adore it. But I didn’t. Much as I loved the style, I was increasingly frustrated with the pacing, organization, and essential point of the book.The main character was prone to making poor decisions, impulsive decisions. She was scattered in matters of the heart – loving one thing, then another and another, perhaps all in compensation for her mother’s desertion when she was four. By the time she got to flying, I felt she was simply running away. Yes, through the book she seeks freedom, which flying embodies. But with so little here about her actually experience in a plane, flying seemed like just another distraction.The author certainly couldn’t change Beryl Markham’s life. But I wish she had been more focused in her retelling of it. And then there’s the title. Does it mean that Beryl is always in orbit, as in, on the move? Or that she is destined to always revolve around bigger and brighter things? Or does it relate to flight (though her solo flight was portrayed as being wholly in the dark)? This was unclear. At the end, like Beryl, I felt unfulfilled.

The book's voice is that of a 14-year-old girl, who is oh-so-close to her uncle, who subsequently dies of AIDS, so we see the toll taken not only on those who contract it, but those who do not but who deeply love them.Not all of my group liked this book as I did.
