It wasn't until the final sentence of the novel - which I won't spoil here - that it came to me via the author's own words. The story feels like a kaleidoscope - confettied, fractured, yet also circling in surprising patterns, at the center of which is Lucy (the girl who died).I always caution my writing students when they consider alternating first person perspectives: it's tricky to pull off. But Grabowski skillfully and clearly delineates each of these characters. And from those at the periphery of Lucy's story to her own grieving mother, we circle closer and closer to Lucy and to understanding what happened to her.The one byproduct of so many points of view (and none of them repeated or returned to) is that the reader's time with each character was limited to a single chapter, making it difficult to invest in any of them. But ultimately, the cumulative effect is the vivid portrait of a town, of a community, and of a single lost girl.Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the opportunity to take an early peek at WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 08, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Dec 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123006769-women-and-children-first

LAUREN IN THE LIMELIGHT follows three middle-school aged dancers navigating not only the ballet world but grief, identity struggles, and a variety of family issues. Because of this, I think this novel will appeal not only to young dancers but all young readers.Each point of view character is given a distinct voice and a distinct journey. And while I loved all three arcs, I felt my heartstrings pulled the most deeply by Bryan, a young male dancer whose dream is to dance en pointe.

(Thank you to Netgalley, the publishers, and the author.)I hesitate to call BLACKOUTS a novel, simply because it defies so many novelistic conventions, It is equal parts history lesson (tracing the history of early lesbian activist Jan Gay), auto-fiction, imagined history, pictorial and poetic collage, and fictional fever dream.There were times when I found the writing to be fully immersive, and other times when it felt a bit academic. I also feel like the ebook was not fully conducive to the book's non-textual elements (photos, illustrations, and the namesake blacked out passages from the ""Sex Variants"" textbook). I plan to purchase the physical book to remedy this.I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this book, and I will read whatever Torres writes next....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 10, 2023","Oct 13, 2023","Apr 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215321-blackouts

Initially, I felt a bit as though I'd been dropped into the middle of a story that began long before the opening page. For the first half of the book, I longed for the backstory to help me understand her situation. I wanted more about her childhood, the family that failed her, the nuances of her failed romantic relationships. I also wanted more of her passion for writing and how this carried her through such dark times. It felt a bit like a puzzle with missing pieces, making the entire picture difficult to comprehend. However, the second half of MAID shines -- especially when Land's self-awareness (in a particularly vivid passage about the privilege of hope) becomes clear. And it is this hope and steadfastness that, by the end, had me cheering her along. She depicts the struggles of single-motherhood in poverty with authenticity and honesty. I suspect this story will resonate with many readers who have found the rug pulled out from under them, and particularly with single mothers of young children. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Jan 2019,Jan 2019,"Jan 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39218350-maid

This is not, however, a book about a dancer. It is a book about a patient in a fight for her life -- a battle being waged by a woman against herself. The beauty of this book is its raw and unapologetic depiction of anorexia. It gives the reader access to the thought processes of someone consumed by their illness in a sort of stream of consciousness rumination as she navigates her way through treatment. It reveals the inner workings of the mind of someone suffering from an eating disorder, all the twisted logic and despair. (I also appreciated that Anna came from a loving family and had, for all intents and purposes, a perfect marriage. This disease does not discriminate.)I do wish there had been more about her dancing. Ballet is what sparks this fire. And it is also what she ultimately sacrifices. But there is very little about her life outside of her disease (beyond her relationship with her husband).A compelling and quick read.(Note: this book is not for anyone who might be triggered by the use of specific weight and BMI measurements.)...more",Notes are private!,0,11,2,"not setJan 25, 2019",not setnot set,"Dec 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39324901-the-girls-at-17-swann-street

We also speI had the pleasure of meeting Gina Frangello last month at the Tucson Festival of Books, where we spoke on three separate panels together. We also spent a lot of time between panels chatting in the authors' green room, and so I heard a lot about this book (as well as about her process of writing the book) prior to finally sitting down to read it. Gina was an engaging speaker, as well as a fascinating person, and so I was eager to dive in.A LIFE IN MEN, is a sweeping story of a woman named Mary Grace who, at seventeen, is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (a life-shortening pulmonary disease typically diagnosed in early childhood). And so just as her life is about to begin, her life expectancy is suddenly abbreviated to an unfathomable six years. The novel is not about illness, however. Nor is it about dying. It is, instead, about living. About embracing life, embracing the world, and all of the people in it.There is an urgency to everything about this book, despite its epic scope. We travel with Mary from Greece to London, Africa to Mexico, Amsterdam to Morocco. We watch as she struggles to compress a lifetime of experience into these few precious years, to ignore her illness even as it incites this manic sort of approach to living. Book-ended by two tragedies: the Lockerbie disaster and 9/11, Mary's life becomes a sort of luminous, shimmery thing in between. The story is told to us in a sort of meandering omniscience, her character revealed via the various men in her life (as well as by her vibrant best friend, whose death sets the story into motion). The cumulative effect of this is the understanding that an individual's life is not a solitary thing, but something which has far-reaching trajectories. It also suggests that perception and truth are not mutually exclusive: ""There is never only one Truth,"" Frangello writes. ""There is only one truth at a time.""I really loved this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 22, 2014","Apr 03, 2014","Jan 06, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17871515-a-life-in-men

First, I want to acknowledge the guts behind taking on this subject matter. Nutting is fearless. Second, Nutting's writing is accomplished. And I actually would be more than willing to read something else she's written. However...I think my main issue with this book was that I couldn't tell if Nutting was being satirical or truly trying to capture the mind of a sociopathic pedophile. In either case, I fear the book falls short. As satire, or dark comedy even, it lacks the requisite social commentary and humor. If it is meant to be a realistic depiction of a female pedophile, the failure is even more pronounced. This character, unlike Humbert Humbert, is flat. She is not only driven by her sexual proclivities, but defined by them. I know nothing about this woman beyond her lust. Humbert Humbert's intelligence and charisma make for a compelling character. But Tampa's heroin feels contrived. Like the vibrator in her cup holder -- a mechanical substitute for the real thing....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2013","Jul 01, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17225311-tampa

I really loved this book which follows a young secretary in 1930's New York as she and her roommate befriend the elusive and wealthy Tinker Grey. The mood is evocative of the jazz age, and everything in this novel (even the dialogue) sparkles. I was captivated by the setting and the characters. I just wanted to crawl inside of this world and stay there.I read this book for my book club, on the heels of The Great Gatsby, a fact which certainly colors this . My only criticism is that sometimes there is a fine line between homage and imitation, and this line is very blurry here. I couldn't tell whether some of the imagery and similarities in theme and character were simply cheeky nods to Gatsby or an outright assimilation. No matter, it's a great read either way.

This story is heart-breaking, particularly knowing it was inspired by Thorne's own life. Elizabeth's mother is married to a convicted sex offender. Her father is a drunk. And when forced to choose between her husband and her daughters, she chooses him. The girls are separated. Jaime goes to live with their father, leaving Elizabeth in a constant state of fear over her sister's well-being. And Liz is sent to Utah to live with her aunt who shows her a world she has never had access to before. I fell in love with her aunt Tammy. (For once, a wonderful character named Tammy!) And I ached for Liz as she struggled between the opportunity this new life offered and her sense of obligation and loyalty to her sister and mother.Elizabeth is a fabulous narrator: precocious, smart, protective, but still a child.

It seems like every time I pick up one of Amy's books, I am reluctant to put it down without finishing, and there are few books I can say this about.

But when she meets Victor (who has two children of his own), she reluctantly accepts the position of part-time step-mother. However, when Victor's ex dies suddenly and mysteriously, she is thrust into the very role she never wanted to fill. The novel is told in alternating chapters between Grace, Ava (Victor's 13 year old daughter), and Kelli (the ex). There's a nice mystery at the heart of the story which keeps the pages turning. I found myself sympathetic to all three characters due to the sensitivity with which they were treated by their author.Really looking forward to her next one as well (there's a sneak peek at the back of this book)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2013","Apr 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15802442-heart-like-mine

But LaCour's handling of it is deft. The novel is wonderfully raw and authentic, without ever becoming maudlin. After Ingrid kills herself, her best friend, Caitlin, is left with a few precious (and dangerous) artifacts: a diary, and the photos that Ingrid, an aspiring photographer, left behind. And by studying these entries and images, Caitlin comes to understand everything she didn't know (and perhaps couldn't know) about her friend when she was alive. Over the course of the following year, Caitlin struggles to make sense of what has happened and to redefine herself in Ingrid's absence. The other characters in the book are complex, and their responses to Caitlin (and her nearly debilitating grief) are credible and heart-breaking. There is both photography and a tree house, which is pretty much all it takes for me to love a book, but this is a good one. And I would recommend it to both teens and adults alike, particularly to anyone who has lost someone to suicide....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 23, 2013","Mar 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6373717-hold-still

I'm beginning to think I am just a sucker for an unreliable narrator. This book, like SCHRODER (Amity Gage) and DEFENDING JACOB (William Landay), unfolds via a first person narrator who first establishes our sympathy and then systematically undoes every bit of this trust.The premise is clever (though, perhaps, a bit too clever): two couples, both parents of a fifteen year old boy, meet for dinner at an upscale Amsterdam restaurant. The two men are brothers, and one of the brothers (not the narrator), is in the running to become the next Prime Minister. However, they have come together this night to discuss something their two boys have done. I won't spoil this by going into detail, but rather leave the grisly discovery to you.I loved the way the mystery unfolded, and all the little twists and turns along the way. I do think there were some significant plausibility problems: would someone of Serge Lohman's stature choose such a public venue for this discussion? Would Claire really, really do this?

This expansive novel follows Cameron Post, a gay teenage girl, on a long journey of self-discovery after the death of her parents. Raised in Montana by her grandmother and her well-meaning evangelical aunt Ruth, her sexuality is a dangerous secret. It is also something that her family seems to think can be remedied.Exiled to a school which promises to ""bring her back to God"" (by ""curing"" her of her deviance), Cameron struggles with her identity, with her place in her family and community, and with the loss of her parents.The ending chapter is simply gorgeous.

For anyone who has read LolitaThis novel opens in a familiar way, ""What follows is a record of where Meadow and I have been since our disappearance."" For anyone who has read Lolita, the parallels (between this ""confession,"" between these characters -- Humbert Humbert and Erik Schroder, between the two kidnappings) are obvious. However, Schroder is not a pedophile, but a desperate father who has abducted his own daughter. He is also a liar. His entire life a fiction. The novel, written in the epistolary form to his ex-wife, Laura, slowly unravels the elaborate construct of his life.There was so much I loved about this novel. I think that Gaige has done an incredible job with the unreliable narrator. I found myself both captivated and disturbed by him. I longed to trust him, only to have that trust undermined. The writing is gorgeous, and the scenes vivid.Shroder's ""research"" on pausology (or the power and nature of pauses and silence) was interesting, but I wonder if it might have resonated more near the end of the novel. (I kept waiting for his research to somehow come to fruition...but it didn't, for me anyway.)As a native Vermonter, I would be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of glitches. 1. There are no billboards in Vermont. 2. The depiction of the ""public academy"" in St. Johnsbury (and the depiction of the bedraggled parents waiting to pick up their children) rang false. St. Johnsbury Academy is a private high school, with a huge population of dorm students, and I couldn't understand why parents of teens would a) be picking them up from school, this presumes the parents are not working b)so many pregnant mothers...really? Women with teenage kids? Anyway...probably only fellow Vermonters would take issue with this.I also wonder (and hoping someone might chime in here) about the shift from the epistolary form of the novel to a second person near the end (where Schroder appears to be speaking to himself)...and then the several pages of what seems to be an apology (I let you down.) Because of the earlier shift in who ""you"" is, I didn't know whether to read this as directed toward Laura or toward himself...or perhaps, this is intentional. Regardless, it was the only moment (other than the two moments mentioned above) where I felt pulled away from the fictional dream. I definitely recommend this book.

We follow William as his village suffers through a famine and later, as he educates himself using only borrowed library books, and ultimately as he builds a functional windmill which attracts the attention of the media and creates educational opportunities he had never dreamed possible.

Though while the story was an interesting one (a child searching for his lost brother becomes involved with a troupe of performing goblins), I found it to be, in some ways inaccessible to the nine year old set (and sometimes, even to me). I never felt I had a full grasp on the rules of this world. It seemed I was always trying to process some new and strange detail about the fictional Zombay and its inhabitants (creatures made of gears, masks that replicate rivers and cities, pigeons inhabited by the cruel matriarch from whom Rownie has escaped). This took away from the genuine thrill of Rownie's search for his brother.I don't typically read fantasy novels, so please take these comments with that in mind.

If I were rating this novel exclusively on its prose, I would give it five stars. the language is hypnotic at times, evocative of the city whose stories it tells. However, I found myself frustrated a bit with some of the novel's larger elements.The novel opens with a glimpse of the streets below as a tight-rope walker traverses a line stretched between the Twin Towers. It is 1974. The novel then offers chapters dedicated to a myriad of characters who all, in some way, had a connection to the city during this momentous event. While I thought McCann did a marvelous job capturing the voices of each of these characters, I did not find myself connecting in any significant way with any of them. (As soon as I began to feel a connection with a character, another character was introduced.) I understand that this episodic set-up is likely designed to give us glimpses into many lives. If so, I think a collection of short stories would have been more satisfying. As soon as the connections between the characters started to be made, I was simultaneously relieved and irritated. I was relieved, because suddenly there was structure where it seemed there was none. But I was irritated because some of these ties were simply too coincidental; it felt contrived. (I am thinking primarily of Gloria and Claire...and the judge and Tillie.)McCann writes, ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" Here is the secret of this story...the metaphor that McCann is striving for...exemplified by the tightrope walker.I wanted to love this book, but ultimately appreciated the author's efforts more than the story itself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 19, 2013","Jan 26, 2013","Jan 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

I've been reading a lot of books about rich people lately. And I must admit that rich people's problems, around which this story revolves, simultaneously fascinate and infuriate me. With that out of the way, there was much about this book that I did enjoy.This is the story of an affair and its devastating effects on a marriage and on a friendship. When Harry and Maddy Winslow meet young, vibrant Claire, they are both captivated. But only Harry cannot stop there. The two are soon engaged in a love affair which ultimately, and inevitably, has repercussions neither could imagine.My primary gripe is with the narrator. The entire novel is narrated by Maddy's childhood friend, Walter, a lonely bachelor who has pined away for Maddy his entire life. I think Dubow's going for Nick Carroway feeling here, but while Nick provides a somewhat removed (even unbiased) perspective on Gatsby and Daisy, by the end of this novel, Walter comes off as a voyeur of sorts, obsessive to the point of creepy. I also had a difficult time with what felt like a device as Walter narrates the intimate scenes between Claire and Harry. I know, I know, he explains how he has access to this information via Harry himself and his writing (Harry is a National Book Award winning novelist). However, it felt (at times) contrived. My other complaint has to do with a chapter near the end of the book. I don't want to spoil anything...but in case you're sensitive to that, STOP HERE. But it has that Freshman English ""and it was all a dream"" quality that I just can't tolerate. I actually both anticipated it and then grimaced when it happened. I get what he was trying to do...but blah.My last complaint is not about the book per se, but rather about Harry himself. I hated Harry. I just did. He had everything and still wanted more. I know this is the point of the story, but I feel like he got his just desserts. And because I didn't care much for Maddy either, I wasn't sure where my sympathies should lie? With Walter? Maybe with Claire....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 17, 2013","Jun 25, 2013","Jan 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15719899-indiscretion

This book has gotten so much buzz; I decided to select it for my book club. We haven't met yet to discuss, and already there's been a lot of complaining. However, in general I liked it. I think the premise is interesting (a US soldier comes home with his platoon after a successful battle in Iraq and they are paraded around in a tour of the country to drum up support for the war...the entire novel takes place during a Thanksgiving Dallas Cowboys game during which they are to appear alongside Destiny's Child during the half-time show). The writing is wonderful, hypnotic even. The main character, Billy Lynn, is a likeable 19 year old kid. And it is an illuminating commentary on ""patriotism"" and commercialism (there is a producer at their side vying for the film deal) and even on war. But, as my book club friends have complained, it kind of drags. I have tremendous patience when it comes to slow-moving books, but I found myself fine with setting this one down each night. I also found most of the characters, besides, Billy to be somewhat flat, more caricature than character. Still a worthwhile read.

I think I would have really enjoyed this book as a young teen. The voice of Charlie, the ninth grade narrator, is authentic and sweet. His self-awareness and naivete make for a truly endearing character. He is a ""troubled"" kid who is seeing a psychiatrist for some fairly ambiguous problems, a loner who finds friendship and acceptance in a small group of older teens. There were a lot of complex issues explored (domestic violence as it pertains to teens, sexual abuse, homosexuality, and suicide), but it didn't ever feel over-the-top.With all that said, I didn't feel as attached to his friends, Patrick and Sam, as I wanted to be. I think I would have felt the intensity of his feelings if the entire triumvirate were more fully fleshed out. The other issue I found problematic was the epistolary device. The novel is told in a series of letters to an unidentified character.

Who would have thought that a book set during the country's descent into The Great Recession could be laugh-out-loud funny? I was pretty skeptical. Matt (our hero) is a former business reporter who gave up his job to pursue his dream of creating a website dedicated to business news given in poetic form (poetfolio.com). However, the website never got off the ground, and after returning to his job, the economy bottomed out and he was laid off. The housing market also crashed, and jobless, he was talked into filing for forbearance. We meet Matt, our hero, six days before he will lose his house if he is unable to come up with a $31,000 balloon payment (and with $9,400 to his name). In addition to these dire financial straits, his wife has begun an online flirtation with an old flame. On the precipice of homelessness, financial ruin, and losing his wife to a guy named Chuck, Matt goes out to the 7-11 one night for milk and meets his destiny...in the form of two drug dealers.I'll let you experience the rest of this one on your own.

The Age of MiI picked up this novel primarily because of the buzz but also because it is set in San Diego where Walker grew up(and where I now live). The Age of Miracles follows Julia, a young girl on the cusp of adolescence in a world on the cusp of collapse. Julia's San Diego looks a lot like mine except for the one small detail that her earth has suddenly started to turn more slowly: days swelling by minutes at first and then by hours, circadian rhythms interrupted by pervasive daylight and, alternately, agonizingly long stretches of darkness. The premise of time somehow slowing has tremendous literary potential...from the obvious plot possibilities to metaphor, and I believe the best moments in this novel are when Julia ponders the larger and more esoteric implications of ""the slowing"": ""From then on, we all had little more time to decide what not to do. And who knows how fast a second-guess can travel. Who has ever measured the exact speed of regret?""It is, by turns a coming of age story, a love story, and the story of a family, all set against an incredibly innovative dystopian backdrop. My only complaint is that the set-up makes the end nearly impossible to pull off without tremendous tragedy or an improbable solution. Walker does a fine job, but not perfect, and I felt just the tiniest bit disappointed.(Though I honestly have no idea how she could have made it any better.)

Set alternately in 1962 Italy, current-day Hollywood, Idaho and Edinburgh, and following the lives of an Italian inn keeper, an American actress, a Hollywood producer, an aspiring screenwriter, and a has-been (maybe a never-was) musician, Beautiful Ruins is just that...the story of gorgeous ruined lives. In 1962, Pasquale Tursi is twenty-two, having returned to his village to run his father's hotel. While he dreams of enticing American tourists to this remote cove, the tiny village is in reality the destination of no one. Until one day when Dee Moray, a beautiful American actress arrives. She is in Italy filming ""Cleopatra"" with Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, but has fallen ill.What unfolds from this opening chapter is an intricate study of choice and fate, and of how desire informs both. ""This is a love story...But really what isn't?"" The characters Walter has created are hungry, desirous, wanting creatures (as are we all). And this book languishes in this human yearning.

I found myself feeling tremendously sympathetic toward both characters as they navigate the murky waters of their relationship. Robert is searching desperately for the love his father never gave him, and Andrew is really still finding and defining who is as a gay man. (I did need to remind myself that Andrew is only 24, which made some of his behaviors -- which I would have found reprehensible in an older man -- understandable.)It's a coming of age story (for both characters) as well as a story of forbidden love.

After Will's mother dies, and Will Sr. remarries, his new step-sister, Lu-Lu, enters his life and suddenly gives him a true sense of purpose.However, over time Lu-Lu begins to change, pulling farther and farther away from Will.

There is nothing quite as exciting as hearing a literary voice for the first time, particularly if it is fresh and vibrant and new. Of course there are the inevitable one-hit wonder books that seem to suck everything the author has from them.

We watch these events unfold through Jess's eyes, as well as via the town midwife and sheriff. The writing is pure and sweet, the story is one I haven't read before, and the characters were vivid and memorable. There were some issues with pacing and focus, I think, but overall there was something terrifically exciting about this novel. And I suspect that Wiley Cash will be back again with more.Excellent storytelling, and just so much promise here....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 24, 2012","May 28, 2012","Apr 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12408149-a-land-more-kind-than-home

An orphan who has made a life for herself in Wichita, she is seeking answers to the questions of her parentage and early years and embraces an opportunity to return to New York City as a chaperone to a fifteen year old Louise Brooks who has been invited to study dance there for the summer.I thoroughly enjoyed the story of the summer these two very different women spent together -- Cora seeking her past, and Louise chasing her future. Moriarty does a fabulous job of rendering these two characters and painting New York City in the twenties; I was absolutely captivated by both the characters and the setting.However, I felt like narrative didn't have anywhere to go after this pivotal summer, and Moriarty winds up leading us through the subsequent years in these women's lives at breakneck speed, summarizing the consequences of this turning point in each of their lives in a way that made me feel distanced from each of them. I think Moriarty strives to make this a story about Cora's search for identity, but ultimately the ending feels too pat, and a bit contrived.Still, the prose is lovely and the characters and setting are magical at times.

The wonderful thing about first time novelists is their fearlessness. This book is wonderfully brave: not because of its subject matter (which is dark -- poverty, molestation, etc...) but because of the way in which this subject matter is revealed to the reader. The structure of this novel was just as compelling as the story, and the two together were gently explosive. (I actually think that this book does exactly what A Visit from the Goon Squad tried to do, but better.)In this novel, we are given the story of Rory Hendrix, self-proclaimed ""feeble-minded daughter of a feeble-minded daughter"" who grows up in ""The Calle,"" the Calle de las Flores trailer park outside of Reno. Hers is a hard scrabble life, a world ruled by the women in it (her Grandma and mother, a bartender) and made horrifying by the men. (It reminded me at times of Bastard Out of Carolina.) Rory is a charming little girl, and not at all feeble-minded as she suggests. She is obsessed with the Girl Scouts, though hers is a troop of one. She finds solace in the library, where she checks out the Girl Scout Handbook over and over again, finding comfort in its promises. She is bright but not hopeful. Smart but aware of dangers of her own intelligence. The brilliance of this novel, again, is how the story is told. Rory's first person narrative is interspersed with welfare social worker reports, tests (""show your work"") -- one in particular which asks you to use the Pythagorean theorem to solve the puzzle of what happened to her when she was supposedly being taken care of by the Hardware Man (given one side of a triangle being as ""tall as a shadow of a man"" and the little girl is ""half the height of the shadow of the man"" to determine ""what is happening inside the triangle"") floored me. In this way, her story is revealed in slivers (blacked out text, Girl Scout badges -- ""Proficiency Badge: Puberty""). While this could easily become gimmicky, Hassman's writing is incredibly lyrical and beautiful, and the structure is not self-conscious or hokey.I loved this book, and I think Tupelo Hassman's future is very, very bright. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2012","Feb 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12160934-girlchild

Their marriage is crippled by the loss, and it is their hope that this solitude will bring them back together. In a rare moment of intimacy, they build a child out of snow one night. But in the morning the child is gone, along with the mittens and scarf they adorned it with. Not long after, they each begin to sight a feral little girl in the woods wearing the mittens and scarf. Meanwhile, Mabel recalls a childhood fairy tale of a snow child, a fairy tale that does not end happily. The tension of the novel is derived from the prevailing fear that Jack and Mabel's story will parallel that of this sad myth. I am still processing this book, I think.

I typically don't read crime novels, but this one's premise really engaged me. Defending Jacob is about a prosecutor whose thirteen-year old son is accused of murdering a classmate who has been bullying him. (Several people who have read GRACE recommended this novel to me for this reason.) As I said before, this was a page-turner. Landay masterfully keeps the reader guessing throughout the novel. I must admit that it was the plot more than the characters that engaged me. I found the narrator to be somewhat removed from the people most important to him (particularly Jacob). I would have loved to feel more sympathy for Jacob as well. I actually felt most sympathy for his mother, who sadly got very little air-time in the book.The major issue I had was a technical one near the end, which, frankly, spoiled the twist for me. I just can't seem to forgive the oversight. Ugh. Anybody who finds it, please message me so that I can see if I'm crazy or not. It was glaring.Anyway...I raced through this novel in two days.

As a result, I felt somehow disconnected from their sorrow and regret. I would have appreciated the novel more had it been Alice's story (a woman who uses her art to explore and exorcise her guilt). And I really, really did not like the last scene. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 03, 2012","Jun 17, 2012","Jan 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12174975-carry-the-one

It was our senior year, and while the rest of us were preparing for the beginning of our lives, Casey was forced to face the possible end of his own. The entire summer after graduation, I spent every afternoon when I got home from the summer job my dad got me at a local bank at his house. I can barely remember what we did or said to each other anymore. But it is with terrific fondness and sadness that I remember that time of my life. We weren't boyfriend/girlfriend, but there was a tremendous intimacy that developed between us on those summer afternoons.This novel captures all of that and so much more. Hazel and Augustus are precocious and funny and sick. Green manages, somehow, to avoid sentimentality in a book about dying. (Hazel might say, ""Sentimentality is a side effect of dying."") As Hazel and Augustus fell in love with each other, I fell in love with both of them. In the fall, Casey and I went off to the same college. Casey was in remission, but our friendship, like so many high school friendships faded into a blurry remnant of our respective pasts. And then two years after I had moved across the country for graduate school, my best friend called to tell me that he had died. I remember feeling like someone had punched me in the throat.This book left me with the same feeling: a vivid choking reminder to cherish your life....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2012","Jan 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars

She is, in fact, one of the reasons I became a writer: one of the most influential people in my own development as a novelist. But what I have felt with the last two of her novels (or novellas, rather) is a certain distillation,. When I think back to my readings of Song of Solomon and Beloved and Jazz, I recollect not only the stories but the actual experience of reading them. And I recall those experiences as a sort of immersion. They transported me. Like all still bodies of water they had a terrifying depth, a bottomless quality. Staying afloat inside those novels took skill. Diving into them took courage. But A Mercy and now Home have offered two very different reading experiences. The writing is still just as powerful and lovely and visceral. (I will be haunted by that Korean child's single rotten orange for years.) But reading this novel felt like skipping a stone across a the surface of a lake. The highlights are touched upon and then quickly left behind. the reader senses that beneath the surface lurks the same murky depth, but it is simply not on the page. Ms. Morrison has left all of what lies and lives beneath for the reader to infer.This is a novel(la) about Frank Money and his sister, Cee. Frank is home from Korea where he saw and did unspeakable things. Cee has been the subject of a sadistic eugenics doctor's experiments. It could have been an epic novel, a terrifying and beautiful exploration of the horrors of war, the abuse of power, and the bonds between brother and sister. About the meaning of home. But it is, in the end, 150 pages long, with some peripheral characters who add very little to the story taking up a lot of that small space.I will continue to read everything she writes, but I lament those missing words.

And my answer always (always!) enthusiastically includes John Irving. A Prayer for Owen Meany and The World According to Garp rank high on my Top Ten of All Time Favorites list. And so it is with a heavy heart that I write this .In One Person has all the ingredients of a classic Irving novel: ""sexual suspects,"" boarding schools, wrestlers, an absent father, Irving's acrobatic prose and impeccable comedic timing, the Dickensian span of the narrator's life. (There are even some ""bears"" near the end of the novel...you'll see when you read it.) But somehow, for me, the ingredients do not make a satisfying meal in the end. It's a souffle that should taste great, but isn't cooked all the way through and falls, hopelessly flat in the dish.Here is the problem; I have read almost every John Irving novel. I know his tricks. And I could anticipate every single one in this novel. Nothing in this book surprised me. Not one thing. Owen Meany's success is grounded in the potency of the disparate elements coming together in the end. All that basketball practice! It was brilliant. But it ruins the wrestling maneuver in In One Person I know exactly how important that duck-hold will be in the end. This happens repeatedly throughout the novel: foreshadowing that calls such attention to itself (for readers of Irving's previous work anyway), that you can't help but to anticipate that which it foreshadows. I felt like one magician watching another magician perform. John Irving's own novels ruined this novel for me.I also felt like the characters lacked realistic emotional responses. The book is about sex, for God's sake. About relationships. But even the AIDS epidemic's appearance late in the novel failed to elicit much of anything from our narrator. I wanted to feel the heartache that I felt when Garp loses his son. I wanted to be thrilled in the way I was at the end of Owen Meany. I wanted that Irving magic. But instead, I saw through all the smoke and mirrors, and it just made me feel sad. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 14, 2012","May 23, 2012","Dec 07, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12758317-in-one-person

This is, on the surface, a time travel novel about a man who is presented with the opportunity to prevent the assassination of JFK.

The novel tells the story of performance artists, Camille and Caleb Fang, as well their two children, Buster and Annie. The novel is divided into chapters which highlight their various artistic ""events"" through the years, juxtaposed against alternating chapters about Annie and Buster as adults. The main storyline follows Annie and Buster after they have hit their respective bottoms and returned home to live with their parents. But not long after their return, Camille and Caleb disappear, leaving Annie and Buster to determine whether to believe they have been murdered (as suggested by the clues left behind) or are simply engaged in another art event. I was riveted by this boy-who-cried wolf scenario, and wondered right up until the end what really happened to the Fangs. This book is laugh-out-loud funny and smart and sad. It examines where the lines between art and exploitation blur, while also exploring the idea of what a family is and what a parents' responsibilities to their children are. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 05, 2012","Nov 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10149142-the-family-fang

I was familiar with these powerful photographs, and unfortunately I think it colored my reading of this novel. The risk you run when you seek to tell a story with words that has already been depicted in pictures is that you have to add something new, some aspect of the story that the photos do not tell. Rowell attempted to take these photos further by depicting several of the characters' imagined lives, and though I found the individual narratives interesting, they simply did not have the same impact on me that the photos did. This may have been in part to the lack of any sort of narrative arc to each character's narrative. The stories actually felt simply like written snapshots, and my expectation of a novel is that it will do what a photo cannot -- that is to tell a story over time (rather than freezing time and leaving me to intuit the story). While the photographs seared themselves into my memory, this novel did not.Rowell is a fine writer, however, and I would certainly read more of his work.

The prose is lovely, and the exploration of how we define madness was really fascinating. The main issue for me was the author's insistence upon examining how the story of his grandfather's mental illness relates to his own life (the book is based upon his grandparents' story). Perhaps if he had taken this further, inserted himself more into the narrative, then those parallels would have been sharper. Otherwise, he could have simply allowed the story to stand on its own. (Other than a vague reference to a post-adolescent bout with insomnia and a subsequent diagnosis of manic-depression, we actually know very little about the author by the end of the novel.) I felt similarly about the chapters dedicated to the chief psychiatrist as well as the other patients.

Be prepared though...it's the kind of book that wrecks you.3/19/12 I feel like I want to write a love letter to this author. This book just earned a spot on my list of all-time favorites.It is the story of fourteen year old Esch and her family who live in the Bois Sauvage in rural Mississippi. It takes place over the ten days leading up to Hurricane Katrina. Esch's mother is dead, her father is a drunk, and she is pregnant. They live on ""The Pit,"" a destitute and wild place, as almost feral children.I fell in love with Esch and her brothers, particularly Skeetah, who is driven nearly mad in his attempt to keep his beloved fighting pit-bull, China, alive after she gives birth to puppies. I found myself aching for each of them as they sought the simplest of things: attention, love, survival.I have never read something so beautiful about subject matter that is so difficult: dog-fighting, rural poverty, and teenage sex. It is also about family and loyalty, about survival and the cruelty of nature.

For twenty-five years, Nik has compulsively manufactured and documented the artifacts (including the music -- bootlegs, liner notes, album covers, etc...)of a fictional music career. The reality of his life, however, is that he is a recluse who has not performed his music in public for decades. The narrative of Nik's life is given to us through his sister, Denise's, own first person ""Chronicles"" (which are the purported ""truth""). We also see Denise through the more objective lens of a third person narrator. I've been reading a lot of this (post?) post-modern stuff lately (Girl ChildA Visit from the Goon Squad)...and while its narrative form certainly adds layers to the story, I was actually more entranced by the ruminations on memory and art.Denise is losing her memory (or fears she is anyway), and so her recollections are both precious and faulty. Conversely, Nik has spent his entire life documenting an imagined life...creating an alternate history out of thin air. Lastly, Denise's daughter, Ada, a film maker, becomes obsessed with documenting her eccentric uncle's actual life.During an interview between Ada and Nik, Ada asks Nik, ""Who is your audience?"" The assumption here is that art requires an intended audience. That without an audience, there is no such thing as art (the whole tree falling in the forest business). Nik answers, ""Myself. Other than that, I don't have one, I suppose. Some family and friends."" Yet Nik is an artist: he creates, he is passionate, he is consumed. And he is talented. And the most riveting aspect of his character is the absence of resentment or regret. Even without an audience, he has led an artful life.Initially I resisted Denise as narrator. I didn't care enough about her; she was dull in comparison to Nik. However, I think this was a conscious and critical decision on Spiotta's part. It serves to elevate Nik's character and his work. I highly recommend this novel. Really, really brilliant work....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2012","Jul 09, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10647326-stone-arabia

The story of a WWII era ""Home for Peculiar Children"" on a remote Welsh island was inspired by a series of photos which are featured in this absolutely gorgeous book. The narrator, an American teenage boy, is the grandchild of one of the former residents of the home, and he is on a mission to uncover his grandfather's secrets. The idea is absolutely terrific. The story is engaging, the narrator likable, and I loved the juxtaposition of the photography (though, I did tend to anticipate the insertion of a photo sometimes...and it felt just the teensiest bit contrived). But, regardless, bravo to Riggs for such a clever, clever idea.However, the book, ultimately was a YA fantasy/time travel novel. It had all the requisite teen angst and romance and adventure. But I felt just a little bit disappointed. I'm not sure what I expected, and how exactly it failed to fulfill these expectations. I've been finding a lot of books lately that are YA and masquerading as something else. I suspect this is due to publishers' desires to reach as broad an audience as possible. But I think a younger audience would be more fully captivated and entranced.Worth the read however, especially if this genre appeals to you.

I was a freshman at the University of Vermont that year, living in Burlington. It's clear the author did her homework...except, perhaps, for the minor glitch at the outset with having a university football game on New Year's Eve. I suppose it could happen, but I doubt it. (Have you been in Burlington in December/January?) I also worry about Jude surviving a whole night outside in this weather. Anyway...that's nit-picky, and I'll stop now. It's fiction, right?*** Teensy Spoiler **** This is the story of two families: both fairly messed up. It is also about how families are made. Jude, the ""hero"" of the story is a heart-breaking kid. As he navigates his way from teenage drug use and abuse to a straight-edge punk rock life with his dead friend's brother and the future mother of his dead friend's baby, I felt nothing but compassion and concern for him. I struggled with the lack of a strong parent figure in the novel, however. Every single parent in this book fails in some huge way, and many had no redeeming qualities at all. This may have contributed to my sympathy for the kids in the book, but it also seemed just the hardest bit to believe.The novel's biggest weakness though, for me, is the sketchiness with which Teddy's character is depicted. He disappears off the page after the opening chapter, and while the story centers around this loss, I never felt like I had a full enough sense of why the hole he left was so big.However, the book is terrific on so many levels.

It reads like a dream -- atmospheric and impressionistic. The story is simple...a twenty year old letter arrives at Lucy's address, and she becomes obsessed with learning the story behind the photo. We follow her in her journey for a truth that has nothing to do with her, or possibly everything to do with her. Lucy, the protagonist, keeps people (including the reader) at a distance. The result is that her quest and longing become even more palpable and, ultimately, heart-breaking. I was just the tiniest bit disappointed with the ending, though I believe it has the desired effect.

I actually had never read ""The Body"" before, but I have seen ""Stand by Me"" (the movie adaptation) a half dozen times. I was looking for something atmospheric. Something nostalgic. And for as much flack as Stephen King gets, there is a certain brilliance to much of his work; he is an incredible storyteller. I loved this story about four boys who set out in the summer of 1960 to find the dead body of another missing boy in their rural Maine town.

The book is, as promised, magical in its imaginative premise: a circus that arrives without warning and is only open at night, two magicians pitted against each other in a competition with enormous stakes. The world of this novel is meticulously and beautifully rendered (a cloud labyrinth, jars full of memories, chocolate mice!), but... Alas. Ultimately it proves to be less ""real magic"" and more illusion. A whole lot of smoke and mirrors. Beneath the fantastical descriptions, the plot is sluggish. The characters are flat.

The two male leads (Mitchell and Leonard) were terrifically drawn and I found the depiction of Leonard's manic depression (and his girlfriend's response to it) to be authentic, and Leonard a truly sympathetic character as a result. Mitchell, too, in his religious pilgrimage was finely drawn. However, I had difficulty understanding Madeleine. She felt shadowy to me, and even more so through the eyes of her two suitors. This felt, in many ways, like a Jonathan Franzen novel without the Franzen disdain for his characters. Sort of Franzen with a heart.

I rarely, if ever, read historical fiction and actually find myself actively avoiding anything to do with the Civil War (books, movies, documentaries, etc...). I had also never read Little Women, which I feared would put me at a disadvantage in reading this book. But I am now so pleased that I did. This story of the missing father from Little Women, March explores the year that this abolitionist acts as a Union army chaplain during the war. What I enjoyed the most were the moral complexities that were illustrated through March's character. I felt that it provided such an authentic and troubling depiction of what we typically consider a ""just"" war. My only real complaint was that the switch to Marmee's point of view near the end of the novel made me feel less compassionate toward March. He actually started to really irritate me when seen through Marmee's eyes; his convictions began to seem less honorable and more selfish. The voice of these chapters also were not clearly enough differentiated from March's voice, which pulled me from the novel's dream a bit.

(I distinctly recall making a tissue paper wolf collage after completing it.) But despite any initial resistance I had genre-wise, there was something very engaging about this story. The language was at times absolutely lyrical (""At crossroads a ground set with dolmen stones where the spoken bones of oracles lay moldering"" -- wow!), and the descriptions visceral, but it was actually the simple and subtle portrait of a father and son's relationship that most captivated me. The unnamed father and son of The Road spend the entire novel in a futile journey across a post-apocalyptic landscape. Survival is the prevailing goal, leaving little room for much else. The son has no recollection of the world before its demise, and the father must navigate a future-less world with a young child at his side. The terse dialogue reveals beautifully (and with tremendous subtlety) the nuances of their relationship. I was actually reminded throughout the novel of one of my favorites of last year: Roomby Emma Donoghue. In that novel, a mother and her young son are confined to a small room (a room in which they are being held captive). Like the boy in The Road, Jack has no knowledge of the world outside the room. What struck me was how differently each of these parents deal with their children. While ""the man"" in The Road discourages dreams (fearful that they are a sign of surrender), the mother in Room relies on them to create a magical place for her small child. I can't help but wonder what would have happened if she'd been the one to survive the apocalypse instead -- if she and Jack were the ones making their way through this frozen, ashen world. Perhaps what differentiated the two parents was the simple prospect of a future: hope the one thing that eludes the father in The Road.I did find myself worrying throughout the novel about how McCarthy would handle the end. And while it was satisfying, it also felt a little too tidy, a little too happy (despite the larger tragedy at hand). It didn't detract from my overall experience of the novel, however.

Imagine moving them across a lily pond. If each lily pad is beautifully, carefully written, the reader will stay with you as you move toward the other side of the pond, needing only the barest of connections -- such as rhythm, tone, or mood (Bird by Bird, 59). This is a lily pad novel. The writing is lovely, elegiac in tone, and meticulous. This may very well be enough for some readers. However, I am not sure these beautifully constructed lily pads were quite enough for me. Perhaps the pond beneath was too murky. This novel purports to be the story of George Washington Crosby, a clock repairman, as he lies on his deathbed. However, the novel's locus soon shifts to George's father, Howard, an epileptic traveling salesman who abandons his family when his wife decides to have him committed. We also see glimpses of Howard's father, a failed preacher. The book shifts back and forth among these characters, revealing the tenuous relationships that exist between these fathers and sons. While very little actually happens in the novel by way of plot, its scope is fairly grand, examining themes of fatherhood and absence and inheritance.But what I found most frustrating about this novel was not that so little happened, but that those events that were dramatized felt (at times) arbitrary. I wanted Harding to achieve what Tobias Wolf manages in ""Bullet in the Brain"". But while Wolf captures (in three pages) an entire life in that moment before death, I felt like I had only the most impressionistic sense of George's life after nearly 200 pages in Harding's novel. This coupled with the also seemingly arbitrary shifts in point of view and lack of any cohesive structure left me frustrated and eager for the novel to end.I champion the quiet novel, and there was much to be admired in Harding's ambition and prose. But there are other novels and stories that have done it better; Evening by Susan Minot is one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Apr 28, 2011",May 2011,"Apr 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4957350-tinkers

After reading ""Last Night at the Lobster,"" I knew I would read anything he wrote. Warning: this is a big fat book in which almost nothing happens. A lot of readers will put it down when it becomes clear that the plot is little more than what happens when a family convenes at a summer cabin for one final week before it is sold. For some readers, the details will be cumbersome, the pace sluggish, the characters frustrating. But for me, I just didn't want to end. The details were intricate, illuminating, meticulous. The pace was like the leisurely pace of summer itself. And the characters were absolutely vivid and authentic. Flawed and terrific. I was happy to hang out with them for this week...and I plan to read Emily, Alone so that I can follow Emily into her twilight years.I think that this novel is, quite simply, a rumination on finality. There is an inevitability felt throughout the 580 some odd pages. The cabin has been sold, there is nothing that can be done to change that. This is the end of this piece of the characters' history. It parallels Emily's widowhood as well. And that, coupled with the beautiful writing and complex characters and a setting that was so close to home for me, enough to make for a seriously pleasurable read. This book really contributed to an ongoing question I've been pondering, and that is: what is the point of fiction? What is the storyteller's obligation? I used to be able to answer that question quite assuredly. But now I'm not so sure. As a writer, I am constantly grappling with what my responsibilities are to the reader. What sort of contractual obligations must I fulfill? Does the lack of an arc (in plot or character) break that contract? Is a book allowed to simply ponder ideas without coming to some sort of climax? I don't know.

I was, as always, drawn into the story, but in this novel, I felt like the plot was just a little bit clunkier and convoluted than some of her other work.

The unnamed narrator was one of the funniest and most endearing I've encountered in a while. I woke my husband up at least a half dozen times laughing out loud in bed -- forcing him to listen to passages.The only reason why I didn't give the novel 4 stars is that the plot is a bit on the skinny side. It is, quite simply, the story of a fourteen year old girl growing up in the mid-west in the 1970's with a drunk dad and a frustrated mother. It is also the story of her friendship with Felicia (Flea) as they navigate the murky waters at the edge of adolescence. It reads a bit like a YA novel, and it is exactly the kind of book I would have loved when I was a young adult. But as a grown-up, I wanted just a little bit more than it offered.

I remember as a kid loving the dusty old biographies and memoirs that filled the shelves at our summer cabin in Vermont. There was something so thrilling about the photo inserts: the portraits and snapshots and letters reproduced to supplement to the reading experience. This is something I have been lamenting since I started reading so many books on my Kindle. Tiger, Tiger seems like the kind of book that would beg for such supplements (photos of Fragoso as a child, black and white scallop-edged snapshots of her mother, shadowy and blurred images of Peter). Alas, neither the hardcover nor the e-version provide these longed for addendums. There is only the author photo, and I must admit that part of the reason I purchased this book was because of this singular image. In the photo, the young Ms. Fragoso sits in profile, a hopeful tilt of the head. A modest blouse. A child's face. She seems a girl arrested. And so too, does this memoir feel somehow unfinished, interrupted. The story of a fourteen year relationship between a young girl and her molester, Tiger, Tiger is undeniably courageous, unapologetic, and terrifyingly honest. It reads like an incantation, an exorcism. It was absolutely riveting, catering to that voyeuristic tendency I suspect all readers of memoir (myself included) possess. I felt tremendous compassion and rage for this child who while so consistently failed by the adults in her life, still blames no one for her victimization. However, while the intricacies and complexities of this relationship are vividly and viscerally depicted, I feel like I wanted so much more from this story.I guess it boils down to defining the function of a memoir. Why do we tell our own (sometimes lurid) stories? Is this meant as a cautionary tale? If so, it feels as though there is something missing here. The life after Peter's death -- her survival and ability to flourish as both a student (and, it is hinted...a wife and mother) are merely mentioned in passing. I just kept thinking of that author photo, wondering what happened after. Who is she now? If that girl in the photo would turn and speak, what would she say?...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Mar 19, 2011","Mar 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8979038-tiger-tiger

It reminded me a little of Chris Bohjalian's ""Secrets of Eden"" (in structure) and Jennifer MacMahon's novels (in style and dark subject matter). It literally held me by the throat for the first two-thirds of the book. However, as soon as I figured out the mystery, I started noticing the book's weaknesses (which I imagine all that terrific suspense must have previously overshadowed). The biggest flaw, I think, is the development of Alice's character. She remains elusive to me even now that I have finished the book. I simply could not figure her out, and so much of the plot felt inauthentic, demanding tremendous suspension of disbelief. And there were so many terrific opportunities to flesh her out, to make the impact of everything that happens in terms of plot resonate. I would certainly give this author another chance.

I was curious about the first person plural point of view. Unfortunately, it seems like Pittard really lifted quite a bit from this book...and reading them back to back probably colored my opinion of both novels.Anyway...this novel is fabulous in so many ways. It reads a bit like satire, and is darkly comic. The writing is lyrical and the details create an almost cinematic effect. The upper class neighborhood was rendered so vividly, I could practically smell it. I suspect this is a novel that will stand out in my memory for a long time. However, the main gripe I have about this novel is that I felt tremendously distanced from the characters. The Lisbon girls, while clearly tragic heroines, never garnered the sympathy they should have from me. And the first person plural actually made me feel disconnected from the narrator (something that I did not feel while reading Pittard's book). Instead of having the effect of speaking for an entire collective group of boys, it felt like a voice connected to nothing...voyeuristic maybe, but with no true impact or import.I'll probably be mulling over these two novels for awhile......more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 03, 2011","Mar 14, 2011","Feb 26, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10956.The_Virgin_Suicides

The complexity of the abductor/abductee relationship is one I truly hadn't considered before, and Hart skillfully elucidates the humanity of this novel's ""villain"" while carefully and meticulously developing the narrator's conflicted feelings toward him. However, there were also many things that bothered me about this book. First, without spoiling anything, the initial decision Gilly makes (which sets the plot into motion) really rang ridiculous to me. And trust me...I have felt exactly as she did in that opening scene (harried frazzled mother at the end of her rope)...but I truly do not know a single mother who would have made the same rash decision that she did. I also felt like some of the metaphors (the roses, the roses) were overwrought. But most importantly, I had a fundamental issue with the narrator. By the end of the novel, I found Todd (the abductor) a thousand times more likable and sympathetic and (most importantly) authentic than Gilly. It is for this reason that the ending was not only incongruous to the rest of the story but abrupt and unearned as well. I am torn about this novel.

Hannah Pittard's magical little book breaks all sorts of creative writing teacher's rules, but somehow, in spite of (or perhaps because of) this blatant disregard for literary convention, the book works. I found myself captivated by the narrator who speaks for a collective group of teenage boys (and later men) as they engage in the seemingly endless and futile task of imagining what might have happened to their friend, Nora, who disappeared one Halloween night. The language is lyrical, the characters are engaging, the scope is sweeping, and I found myself wishing, more than once, that I'd dared to be so brazenly defiant as a writer. The only complaint I had was that the end left me feeling just the slightest bit hollow. No matter. Bravo, Ms. Pittard.

The novelThe Weird Sisters is the story of the three Andreas sisters -- Rosalind, Bianca, and Cordelia (daughters of a Shakespearean scholar father). The novel opens with each sister facing the shared crisis of their mother's diagnosis of breast cancer and their own respective predicaments as well. The eldest, Rose, is torn between following her fiance to England or staying home to care for her mother. Bean has lost her job in New York for embezzling from her employer. And Cordy, the wayward gypsy of the family, is pregnant (not a spoiler...this news comes early). And so the three sisters find themselves living together again at their parents' home in Barnwell, OH. But rather than finding easy comfort and solace there, they are instead forced to face their fears, their demons, and their uncertain futures. Told in the first person plural, it reminded me a bit of Eugenides' The Virgin Suicides, but this narrator is somehow (and strangely) the voice of all three sisters, and, as a result, the voice of none of them at all. At first, I had difficulty because this narrative stance defied all those rules of point of view that have been hammered into my head over the years. Initially, it felt a bit self-conscious, but after I grew accustomed to it, it was less distracting. I must admit, I kept waiting for each of them to gain their own voice (as in a first person narration) by the end of the novel, but the collective narrator remains.Regardless. There are so many wonderful things about this novel:First, there is Barnwell itself. It's a perfect little town; it reminded me in so many ways of my own hometown (as well as my own fictional Quimby and Two Rivers). I could live there. This is also a book for book lovers. Their father is a fountain spouting Shakespearean quotes. The library, the library! And a three book-toting girls. (Of the three sisters, I do think I liked Cordelia best, and found myself most invested in her, but the other sisters were both beautifully flawed and somehow still likeable.)

And, indeed, it is a raw examination of a woman in crisis, an honest and aching portrait of an addict who almost loses everything when her life spirals out of control. However, what makes this novel entirely original, is its fearless exploration of the place where addiction and motherhood intersect. What made me love Cadence was not her struggle with alcohol, but her fierce love for her child. This novel is a testament to the power of a mother’s love.

First of all, I think that FSo I don't just sound like another passenger on the Franzen Hater Train, let me start with what I liked about this novel. First of all, I think that Franzen is a skilled wordsmith. He's got an enormous vocabulary and, on the sentence by sentence level, his writing is marvelous (except for using the word ""fungible"" twice -- fungible, really?!). I also think he touches some very raw nerves in this book; it is topical with a capital T. It's a time capsule sort of novel which quite self-consciously captures a typical 21st century American family, preserving them nicely for future generations of readers. It's a mish-mash of politics and pop culture and social commentary. Okay. So Franzen the Author is one thing. I could go on and on about my difficulties with the golden boy status he's somehow been catapulted to. For me, he's sort of the Mel Gibson of the literary world: self-righteous, pompous, always saying the wrong thing and yet still, EVERYWHERE. However, I am not ing Franzen. I am ing Freedom. With that said, here are my complaints. 1. The Characters.I cannot stand these characters. There was not a single character with whom I could relate or connect. The men were self-righteous and pompous (hmmm). And the women were pathetic. I am shocked that the ers who are touting this book as The Great American Novel have not touched upon Franzen's treatment of his female characters. Not one of them has any ambition beyond acquiring and keeping their male companion. We know nothing of Patty outside of her relationships with Richard and Walter. Connie is such a sad, sorry character, I found Joey's passages about her almost excruciating. Even Lalitha whose career ambitions seem lofty, becomes a silly school girl in Walter's presence. All the fawning and agonizing these women did made me sick. And Patty, who we are TOLD, is a good and passionate mother, never reveals herself as such. Franzen seems to skim across the waters of the years in which Patty was raising her children, never allowing us to see who she was as a mother. This alone would have been redemptive to me, but Franzen, for some reason, never allows us access into this place. 2. The proselytizing. There is nothing that irks me more than a ""novel"" which really is just an author's thinly veiled political agenda. At times, the veil wears so thin that the novel stops even being a story but rather a tirade. This is due in part to the...3. Point of ViewFreedom's point of view is an odd one. It presents itself as limited...alternating between the main players, allowing us access to their respective inner thoughts and feelings. There are also ""autobiographical"" passages which purport to be Patty writing in the third person about herself (which is weird, right?). However, what I heard was Franzen. I heard the author's voice in every passage (particularly in Patty's autobiography). The voice is really consistently omniscient and subjective. And I got the sense throughout the novel that this narrator really didn't like these people either. This unfortunate POV choice also creates a situation in which we are constantly being told how characters feel without the characters themselves truly feeling.4. PacingThis is a long book. A very long book. And not a hell of a lot happens. And because the characters were so insufferable, I found myself setting it down and not really wanting to pick it up again. It could have been edited down easily by a third.5. Self-consciousnessThe word Freedom appears 36 times (thank you, Kindle) in this novel. It's hard not to feel beaten over the head with the theme here.Ultimately, I think that Freedom's appeal may be narcissistic...that is, Franzen's audience sees itself in his pages. Even Franzen seems to be aware of this...when Richard reads Patty's autobiography he finds himself much more riveted by those parts that include him: ""...it confirmed his long-standing suspicion that people ultimately only want to read about themselves."" So should we read this novel as Franzen's clever little way of seducing us via our own need to feel worthy? Maybe, but if that's the case, then I feel manipulated rather than enlightened.Overall, I think there are other authors doing what Franzen is trying to do more effectively. The first who comes to mind is Tom Perotta. And I think that as far as time capsules go, I'd rather my shovel hit ""Little Children"" than ""Freedom.""...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2010","Oct 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7905092-freedom

Ever since I discovered ""Endless Love"" (not the movie -- which is terrible, but the book -- which is breathtaking), I have looked forward to reading every single thing this author writes. I can count the number of authors I feel this way about on one (well, maybe two) hands. And ""Man in the Woods"" does not disappoint. Spencer has an incredible way of making you fall in love with his characters. They are perfectly flawed...authentic, passionate, and mostly good. He does, in this novel, what I hoped to do in ""Two Rivers""...that is, to make the reader understand how a good man can come to do a horrific thing. And he succeeds.

Regrettably, this character and her plight simply did not resonate with me. The premise seemed promising: a widow travels to Turkey after her husband's death to recapture the joy she experienced there on their honeymoon. (Vida did do a wonderful job in her depiction of this exotic setting.) Yvonne, the widow, also plans to join her son and troubled daughter for a cruise. In the meantime, she befriends a young Turkish boy and a number of other local characters. Bad things happen, and she spirals into despair. However, I never felt the true impact of her husband's death on Yvonne. Her grief was simply not palpable enough for me. This may be in part due to the fact that I had almost no sense of who her husband was. He was absolutely flat as a character. As a result, I couldn't understand the longing for connection that she seemed to have with Ahmet (the young Turkish boy). And ultimately, the most important ""relationship""...that between Yvonne and her daughter...is revealed exclusively through Yvonne's ruminations (rather than via flashback scenes)and unfortunately does not become a focal point for the story until near the end. And the end, God the end.

And ultimately, either the irritation or the curiosity prevails, and I either buy the book or dismiss it. Case in point: I haven't read ""Twilight,"" but I've read ""Room."" And I think I made the right decision in both instances.This book (in approach if not subject matter) is entirely unique. The premise itself is not innovative: the ripped from the headlines stories of women held captive in fortresses crafted by sickos is the stuff of literary endeavors both past and recent. (Fowles' riveting ""The Collector"" comes to mind, as does the recently released - though much less compelling - ""Still Missing."") But this novel takes something tabloid and turns it on its head. The point of view (of 5 year old Jack who has been held captive the entirety of his little life) is ambitious, and Donoghue pulls it off. I loved Jack. I felt absolutely sympathetic and captivated by him. Literally held captive by his charm...in Room as he and his mother attempt to not only survive but to thrive.The weakness of this book, I fear, lies in the second half...without spoiling anything, the narrative urgency simply dissolves about half-way through the book. I found myself growing bored with Jack as the magic of his world is revealed to be no more than his charismatic and creative mother's sleight of hand. This should not keep you from reading this novel, however. It really, really enjoyed it. Even if the author got a reported seven figure advance for it. Even if it garnered her a place on the long-list for the Booker Prize. Even if it's the IndieBound Indie Next selection of the month and I have to see that cool cover every time I turn around :)Happy reading....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 16, 2010","May 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7937843-room

There's a beautiful metaphor at the heart of the story, and the writing is lovely. However, while the parts of the novel that explore these two characters as adolescents made me ache with sympathy, I felt much less compassion for the grown-up versions of Mattia and Alice. There is a certain stasis, a paralysis, upon which the story hinges, but which also created tremendous frustration for this reader. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 20, 2010","Apr 06, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6613956-the-solitude-of-prime-numbers

In this novel, we follow Miles in his quest to find his lost twin, Hayden. It is a story about identity theft and identity loss. The story is labyrinthine, but the narrative maze Chaon creates is one in which none of the walls are fixed, and there is no real way out. Chaon is one of the few contemporary novelists who truly manages to both challenge his readers on an intellectual level and simultaneously provide a fulfilling (even heart-thumping) story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 12, 2010","Mar 15, 2010","Mar 12, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6251222-await-your-reply

It is an ambitious novel tackling large issues (of race, sexuality, and family) with a certain subtle grace. I loved the use of multiple voices, and felt (for the most part) that each of these voices was authentic and resonant. Some of the language is simply lovely...and I was absolutely captivated by the chapters in which we hear Rachel as a child. I think the chapters in which Rachel is an adolescent, however, were a little less credible in terms of voice. There were a few clunky spots in terms of plot...but I was happy to forgive them because the book, overall, was both charming and intelligent. The novel was, at times, reminiscent of early Toni Morrison (not only in subject matter, but also in style) -- no small feat for a young novelist. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 22, 2010","Feb 23, 2010","Feb 22, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6449290-the-girl-who-fell-from-the-sky

I think that Bohjalian's careful rendering of each character involved (via four separate first person accounts), contributed not only to the element of suspense but also to the notion that perceptions are fallible and ""truth"" malleable. I was particularly impressed by the authenticity of each of these voices (three of which were female). It wasn't until very near the end that I finally put the pieces together.
