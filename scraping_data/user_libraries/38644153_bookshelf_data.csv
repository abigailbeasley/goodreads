I’ve made a feeble effort to  this one (anything I write hereon is just an iota of opinion as compared to the colossal body of s, articles, analysis and research done on this seminal work of Kafka). One feels that any amount of ing this multi-layered text is an exercise in productive futility. However….. Joseph K. on his thirtieth birthday finds himself accused of a crime whose details he is not allowed to know or ask. Thus, begins his spinning on a hamster wheel of a useless pursuit to emancipate himself from this quagmire-ish legal system; entailing pointless engagement with the advocate, fellow defendant, middle men, a relative, an artist and so on. ‘…..and sometimes one could not imagine that an average lifetimes experience would be enough to learn how to achieve anything.’The Court Chambers are situated in the attic of an impoverished tenement located in the poorest milieu of the city; this impenetrable and massive legal body well fed on the idea of guilt- with its endless hierarchy, vengeful disposition and its complete lack of understanding of human relationships has fortified itself with severe vigilance where court proceedings are not only kept secret from the public but also from the defendant. Any minor upheaval/chink in the armor of the system is brought back to its general equilibrium with some adjustment in its larger scheme of things that remain unchanged due to its maze like inter-relations. It is a legal system where the final acquittal is just a myth.‘No file gets lost; the court does not forget.’Joseph K’s impulsive rush to bring things to a conclusion leads him to commit a series of faux pas which eventually drag him to his doom. THE TRIAL is an astonishing reflection of any post-war/catastrophe experienced society which has a well guarded system functioning invincibly and unquestionably devoid of any internal mutiny. Any form of rebellion rising is fated to be nipped in its bud; for the system to claim its uncontested supremacy. This book will go in my stack of personal favorites! I will be referencing from this book a lot in future.

However, the novel intends ‘to stir’ the cauldron of innate human desires while un-anchoring the moored world.David, Baldwin’s protagonist camouflages his latent desires by maintaining a façade of a straight guy with a fiancée on a well charted road to nuptials and fathering children.‘I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed or frighten me.’David’s straight-jacketed course of life meanders in a different alley when he engages in a passionate relationship with a young barman, Giovanni, while Hella, his fiancée is off to her sojourn in Spain. David’s closeted life fans out to its fullest in Giovanni’s cubby hole of a room- ‘Life in that room seemed to be occurring under water and it is certain that I underwent a sea-change there.’ David’s reluctance to come to terms with his sexual orientation renders Giovanni broken beyond repair. (Would refrain from disclosing Giovanni’s aftermath)Baldwin also bites unsparingly at the privileged American gaze of indifference when travelling abroad- ‘beneath these faces, these clothes, accents, rudeness was power and sorrow, both unadmitted, unrealized, the power of inventors and the sorrow of the disconnected’. He also takes an acerbic dig at the uniform-assembly line-department store purchased luggage-life-like presence of Americans when abroad vis-a-vis the extremely emotive/dramatic European demeanor.Paris as a backdrop with its poverty juxtaposed in such a hand-in-glove with its grandeur of the vintage world; highlights this tragic tale of passion and aids the narrative with the apt hues of love-lost, melancholy and despair.This one tugs at the heartstrings!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 26, 2020",Apr 2020,"Mar 10, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/828503.Giovanni_s_Room

Likewise Evaristo, through the mind-closet of her twelve women characters (colored, non-binaries, teenage mothers, teachers, artists) displays multi-faceted shade-cards of feminism. These twelve vignettes set in Britain follow the interconnected lives of women (mostly black) as they take the reins of their lives and decision making process; reshaping feminism and activism (Transwarriors-mapping their journey from a tomboy to a non-binary through ‘lobbying and adding their outraged voice to protests).The stories deconstruct our fixed notion of gender (‘What does effeminate actually mean when you break it down?’), race, sexuality, class and privilege (that is contextual and relative; bringing to focus a new disquisition on inequality). These women characters of color make an inward journey to shape-shift their lives and shed the skin of societal expectations, a transformation that is subjective in its nature and not representing the whole.One of the characters even questions the very idea of ‘black representation’:‘White people are only required to represent themselves, not an entire race.’Any attempt to encapsulate these stories will be an injustice to this beautiful book as I feel every character has her (‘they’ for those who are non-binaries) life lived in its full word-flesh for me to use my er-ly economy.A well deserved Booker 2019 for the tectonic times we live in!

(Shriver explores the thoughtlessness behind the chowing down of the last morsel and looking forward to the next one (read: food), through fiction.)The book mulls over the concept of food and egregious obesity, an outcome of our lack of attention to ‘salivation, mastication and peristalsis’. Pandora, the brain behind the company churning the now-a-status item- pull-string dolls (‘ridicule paired with affection’) and her brother Edison, once-a-hot-deal-but-now-out-and-fading jazz pianist (once reedy thin now weighing over 386 pounds- he literally ate his piano- I mean, the money he got from selling off his piano-he ate that money off-polishing one chocolate mud cake after another) are the progeny of the had-been prime time TV star Travis Appaloosa of a hammy ‘cult show’ Joint Custody fame; now befuddled by popularity of the non-conventional crop of slick shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, he consoles himself on his lost stardom by being acerbic towards these series.The dynamics of kinship is deeply explored and tailspinned when the newly destitute and obese Edison comes to stay with her sister and Fletcher (Edison’s bête noir), her one-of-a-kind-affordable-furniture crafting husband (a compulsive quinoa and boiled broccoli eating cyclist). The Brother-Sister duo’s herculean mission of weight loss began on a bleak note where inhaling the wafting aromas of french fries felt like ‘window shopping without wallet’. Surviving on just four packets of protein powder liquid diet a day for six long months Edison (‘a human parade float’) not only loses weight but also learns to embrace a low-key life to a high profile limelight grabbing farce. Shriver does (as usual) provide a shocker of a last chapter both ambiguous and thought provoking.The book, for me, is an oxymoronic discourse on shattering the notions about fat pride while mocking the self-starved nutritional Nazis.Is size relative?

The phantasmagorical sequence of events –episodic in nature encompass the contemporary times that stand divided between B.G (Before Google) and A.G (After Google)-a potpourri of junk culture, delusional love pursuits, dented father-son bonding, Brother-Sister love-hate sprinkled sentimentality, post-9/11 white-intolerance and hostility toward brown immigrants, red necks transforming into mastodons reflecting the process of dehumanization and the existentialist’s obsession over The End of The World.The story florid with satire and ‘pastiche’ gives an insight into the American opioid endemic (read: painkillers). Dr. Smile (Quichotte’s cousin cum employer) a self-styled pharmaceutical magnet trying to funnel his sinister drug down that sub-section of the world glazed with celebrity glitter dust. Rushdie also takes an acerbic dig at environmental alarmists (the entropic cosmos has always captured the human fancy! )- The billionaire Dr. Evel Cent (Elon Musk’s fictional doppelganger) selling the idea of neighbor Earth-a portal to travel through ‘inter-dimensional space’-is a gibe at our inability to comprehend the complexities of human existence.

The narrative feels like the peeling of one’s own sense of loss and bereavement layer by layer; we all have stories/truncated missing pieces of the past that we find ways to recycle-repatch and share them time and again for it to be embedded in our collective memory of the bygone times like an embroidered motif on an inherited handkerchief that one feels the compulsive need to keep on touching to assure its fading presence –‘taking apart the past with a flea comb.’‘Do houses ever die of grief?’The Dutch House- the pivot of its central characters’ collective emotional past-present life is a work of art in the neo-classical/Mediterranean/French architecture, a magnificent mansion of Maeve and Danny’s childhood and an emblem of their banishment with the advent of their stepmother. It is said that writers have the craft of spinning the same story every time with different weaves and patterns hitherto, Patchett revamps the myth of the evil stepmother throwing the brother-sister duo out in the woods, with a touching story of the shatterproof sibling connection spanning decades- ‘We had made a fetish out of our misfortune….’This book can be judged by its piercing and striking cover….The character of Maeve is so impeccably written and finely detailed that made me stare its cover every time Danny revives the memory of his sister when she was a 10 year old-red-coat wearing Maeve, with a world full of possibilities laid out in front of her…A very fulfilling reading experience!

This voluminous novel is captivatingly spun around the double murders committed by a student marinating in groveling poverty-in a hangdog fashion in a dingy cubby hole of a room shunning the worldly oppression/obligations of putting up a societal face in front of family and friends. The fertile yet deranged mind of Rakolnikov, the protagonist (read: anti-hero), pendulates between the self-styled morality of committing a crime and questioning the whole system-the law givers that define the act of transgressors as crime. The conundrums of feather-ruffling law-breakers who defy everything that the system obeying –ever multiplying conservatives are highlighted when Raskolnikov says:“I killed not a human but a principle!”Raskolnikov’s act of crime is rooted in his theory which questions the legality of a crime so committed wherein he positions a category of people (the genius) who are permitted everything. He bought into the whole student-arrogance-laced fancy where it’s not enough to just exist but to always believe in a sense of entitlement-ship where one feels one deserves more/better than the other person. This propounds his indifference or no remorse state after he kills the pawnbroker and her sister. The book talks deeply about ‘existential nihilism’ through its mouthpiece-Raskolnikov; especially when he rejects the virtue of “love your neighbor” and stresses on loving oneself first, conducting one’s own affairs which on the whole will result in general economic advancement. Sadism is another term that looms large in the book: reflected in vignettes of the unruly-drunk crowd beating an old mare to death; and in another instance when an affluent man boasts and normalizes domestic violence-“In all our seven years of marriage I used the whip only twice.”The book also mocks the empty “pride of the poor” who splurge their life’s hard earned income on the obligatory societal rites and rituals, simply ‘to make as good a showing as their neighbors and not be “criticized by them’.The novel reaches its crescendo when love becomes the veritable redeemer of Raskolnikov and the zest to live takes the place of ‘logic’- a heart troubled by theories. The book still remains a relevant one as it continues to rouse the minds of thinkers and readers alike on the polarized views of the left-wing and the right-wing on ‘self-interest’ and ‘criminality’; through the centering of the contemporary Russian society in its administrative heart- St. Petersburg- a town of ‘half-crazy people’.

The book maps her creative endeavor to break free from the habit of being unhappy. Writing in her friend’s rented outhouse shed becomes her tool for psychological repair and a process to handle the anxiety of uncertainty…..Levy’s transformational arc from enduring ‘general disintegration’ due to a woman’s compulsive disposition of seeking approval to a ‘new composition’ facilitating her to take complete ‘authorial control’ of her books.Her eloquent analysis of the caterpillar with two ‘vibrant’ heads to beguile the predators is also symbolic of her ‘divided self’- being in a constant state of two-mindedness. Levy’s prose flows effortlessly from her refusal to be a minor character in her life and to reconstruct her life combating everyday DIY battles and mastering the archaeology of plumbing. She inadvertently upsets the apple cart of social hierarchy by not swimming back to the proverbial marital boat even though it provided her ‘symbolic protection’. Riding her e-bike, dealing with a toxic neighbor, emptying wine bottles till the wee hours with her best friend, entertaining her daughter’s friends, reading Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing and James Baldwin, buying lemon ice lollies for her dead and dying mother, obsessing over birds and anchoring her belief in Freud’s “motivated forgetting”- Levy finds a new way of living.(Having read her critically over-hyped work of fiction ‘Hot Milk’, I’d rather recommend her working autobiography in three parts with double the reader-ly zeal over it.)“I believe in people who are nervous and whose hands shake a little.” [The entire book is quote-worthy!]...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 07, 2019","Oct 12, 2019","Apr 15, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40099413-the-cost-of-living

The book explores the colossal agencies of ‘bondage’- the times when the merciless mechanism of cotton plantations devoured African bodies...when the slave coffles were sold as the quintessential American ‘quirk’ for things-a prized livestock.‘Know your value and you know your place in the order.’The book arc-lights the epochal times of bonded-colored labor and plays with the very idea of ‘freedom’. The shifty notions of emancipation infested every slave’s mind that worked the cotton fields, that built the houses and parks and also labored in scaffolding the very stage that orchestrated their lynching and the ultimate manifestation of the ‘Freedom Trail’-the trail of corpses-a testament of moral instructions to the shackled subaltern to shiver at the very thought of escaping the south.Cora and Caesar, farm-hands at Randall plantations, flee one full-moon night braving the deep-murky Georgian swamps with the aid of covert escape routes-the Underground Railroad. They are ruthlessly hunted by Ridgeway-the slave catcher; the hawk-eyed legend of slave bounty hunters with a sole mission of driving ‘the river of slaves’ ensconced in their ‘hidey-holes’ for ‘the white man’s proper accounting’.‘Women and animals, you only have to break them once….they stay broke.’Cora’s relentless journey to North also maps the labyrinthine workings of the Underground Railroad and the ones who constructed it, the ones who gave refuge to the runaways and died for their cause.

High on style-not one lazy sentence (the stories are peppered with many quote worthy, four word sentences-that are so popular with book Awards juries). Eleven stories-eleven powerful voices- a woman’s nightly walks become a dreaded voyeuristic compulsion as her neighbors’ lives reveal themselves to her through their lamplit windows- a pair of little girls/sisters deserted on an island by their single mother, eating cherry-flavored lipstick to beat hunger pangs-a homeless youth living off rotten food from dumpsters- wine drinking researcher mapping the biography of Guy de Maupassant in France with her two painfully bored American children-In the thick of Florida wilderness, a woman with a bleeding head hallucinating, whilst conscious of a panther on the prowl- of a woman always cloaked by the shadowy awareness of rapists haunting dark alleys and streets……Like Anna Burns, Groff’s themes are fat on women’s anxiety, motherhood and abandoned-by-man induced loneliness.Groff writes as if the reader is already aware of the complex webby world of her characters without equipping one with its stencil strength.

To untangle this Gordian knot, a young Dr. Simon Jordan helps Grace to recall and revisit the minute details of the crime (flashbacks); which she proclaims herself of lacking any remembrance of committing with her co-worker and alleged beau James McDermott.The book also doubles as a master class in the then much feted 20th century psychoanalysis; it gives a historical perspective on the theories, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. Grace Marks is branded a ‘true amnesiac’- being ‘the somnambulistic type’ or in a reader’s hindsight a ‘cunning imposture’. It makes for a very radium textured discourse.Atwood, the uncrowned (or crowned) queen of Dystopian fiction, centers her preferred genre in the public institutions- Toronto’s Kingston Penitentiary and Asylum, which are given a zoo like setup, with Grace Marks being the star attraction. However the Lunatic Asylum also serves as a refuge to women to escape from the drink infused fury of their husbands and also to get a warm place in their state of unemployment.Atwood dabbles in an interesting mix of writing styles- segueing from the first person (confessional) to epistolary bits to a third person-objective-clinical view of its titular character. Atwood’s prose breaths a fly on the wall like omniscience; wording every vicious/ugly thought of her characters less for its alarming effect than for the guilty pleasure of the reader....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 04, 2019","Mar 17, 2019","Feb 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/72579.Alias_Grace

Larry Darrell, served as an aviator in WWI and scared by the horrors of war, wants to ‘loaf’ around exploring his existential crisis which takes him to Paris, Germany and India: ‘I want to find out why evil exists. I want to know whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it’s the end.’ Isabel, his former fiancée, chooses to be snow- globed into a conventional society approved life cushioned by wealth, marries Gray Maturin, a stock-market scion. Orbiting around the tumultuous lives of these characters is Elliott Templeton, a well-favored society magnet- “a party was the breath of his nostrils”. With his ‘bandbox’ elegance and ‘periwigged formality’ he becomes the quintessential charmer at elite dos and gatherings. The spectrum of the plot-story unfolds through the perspicacious communication channel of the writer himself (read: Maugham is the first person narrator and a character so catalystic in the novel).Larry’s search for enlightenment ends in India where he becomes enamored of a sage, Shri Ganesha who sees the world as ‘the expression of the Absolute” brimming with perfection. The overtones of Indian philosophy and spirituality: of the world being an illusion, the principle of Karma and everything echoing of impermanence- make an indelible mark on him. However, Larry further extends his reasoning to this didactic learning and tries to form his own coming-to-terms answers by analyzing the archetypal binary opposition-Good and Evil. Thus, devices for him a life of peace and bliss tailored with selflessness and renunciation in pursuit of ‘the life of the spirit’. A master story telling at play!

Naipaul’s The Indian Trilogy)A litany of the ‘inexhaustible’ India…..A land of symbols, inaction and speechesWriter’s block and ennui beguiled Naipaul to visit India in 1962 for a year; like a beast of prey in pursuit of its quarry, Naipaul pens a savage diatribe on India who had failed to live up to its billing. The travelogue reads like a severe scrutiny and critique of India as a fading and decaying mythical land, a land that still romances and ‘rhapsodizes’ the glories of its ancient past. Like a cantankerous old relative he grumpily lands in Bombay where he performs a herculean task of getting a liquor transfer permit (read: prohibition-dry Bombay) from the paper-work obsessed offices. His short stay in Kashmir and Amarnath Yatra further enhances the acerbity of his narrative on India. ‘Eid- for the Kashmiri, the year’s solitary day of cleanliness, a penitential debauch of soap and water and itching new cloth.’Naipaul views the cultural hybridization of India and England of the Raj as ‘a violation’, a hilarious mixture of costumes and the flawed use of the misunderstood English language. This land of ruins is further tagged as a colonial country that was mainly harvesting politicians and speeches. Unlike E.M Forster’s and Kipling’s India, viewed with a more forgiving lens, Naipaul’s India remained the land of his childhood, an area of darkness which he was unable to ‘penetrate’. Naipaul, an impatient traveler, raises his word-whip on India-a behemoth of squalor and human decay. (I am obsessed with non-fiction reads on India and fancy the kaleidoscopic field of vision on India. Naipaul is a master of his craft and his take-down on India can be viewed in a more constructive fashion than taking a staunch jingoistic defense of denial of his remarks. )...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 03, 2018","Dec 19, 2018","Dec 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5854.An_Area_of_Darkness

The cocoon-ish world of the two protagonists Marianne and Connell (an extension of rich girl meets a poor boy cliché…more like a spin-off) wraps tight with the contemporary times. Marianne’s fetish for sexual masochism is so by the Freudian textbook (upper-middle class: check…..Well-educated: check….self-destructive disposition: check).  Coming to the parts I liked- Rooney’s mocking measurement of students at prestigious colleges (Macbook bolstered undergrads with identical accents breaking into passionate debates on politics, books and topics; lacking in textual details of the books left unread). In the times spawned by social media where everyone feels outcaste-ish, different, a minority and crazy (a word so misused to the extent that having ice-cream with friends is considered/tagged/hash tagged CRAZZYYY!) the word NORMAL gets a few takers. So when these two people who are caught in the emotional labyrinth called relationship they end up serving the predictable fare called NOT-NORMAL.  This book is a one-dayer and will get a lot of head-nods from its readers (mostly 20 something who’d like a relate-able book on the go).

I shall forge forth noneMy entire reflection on this edifying piece of literary classic would produce but a poor reportage of my effort to  it. I shall forge forth nonetheless….Enter the dismal setting: Cocketown is a smoke fuming dragon of an industrial borough-‘an ugly citadel” of toxic airs and gases, houses its multitude of downtrodden operatives- generically tagged as “The Hands”. Dickens very theatrically portrays the rough and tumble of the mundane miseries of the injured pith and marrow of Coketown. The reader first meets the mind of Mr. Thomas Gradgrind, personified cannon ‘loaded to muzzle with facts’ and a knower of all the ‘Watersheds of the World’. Gradgrind, a man devoted to the faculty of reason, sits himself at Stone Lodge, a common landmark on the face of the country; where he holds his children hostage into bleak lecture rooms and statistical dens of facts away from the light of fancy. The parental roof becomes a “Jaundiced Jail”- a piece of machinery cutoff from all the fantastical interference.If this did not steer the delicate nerves of a bibliophile than enter: Mr. Josiah Bounderby (Gradgrind’s mental looking glass), the keeper of the Coketown, the detected ‘Bully of Humility’ and a never miss-er of chance to proclaim his old poverty. He reminds me of our elderly folks who never fail an opportunity to elaborate on the never-ending saga of their rise to fortune from their pits of humble beginnings. The third specimen: Slackbridge (read: a fugleman, a local union leader of the millers), with his Brutus-like oracular authority never fails to uplift the morale of the multitudes crushed under the despotic iron-foot of their industrial tyrants.The lone voice-Stephen Blackpool-refuses to shake hands with both the parties: the master and the union- thereby indicating the alarming side-effects of industrialization that questions the moral integrity of both the parties.The labyrinthine narrative further dismantles the fortified beliefs of these key characters and brings to surface the peripheral characters- Sissy Jupe (the daughter of a circus jester who disowns her due to his failing attempts to amuse his audience)and Jane (Gradgrind’s daughter who questions his father’s latent motives behind getting her married to Bounderby, thirty years his senior) . The book had an effect like -the blood-iron taste/smell that one feels/smells after holding an iron bar for a long time-on me. This work of fiction is relevant now more than ever-in the times of hammered uniform thinking, the times governed by single minded-staunch-one dimensional leaders and their ‘yes-men’. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 27, 2018","Jan 08, 2019","Nov 01, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5344.Hard_Times

She unveils the mind writing under great duress:‘Who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet’s heart when caught and tangled in a woman’s body?’Woolf was herself once barred from entering the library at Oxbridge because ladies were only allowed to enter its premise if consorted by a fellow of the college or equipped with a letter of introduction. This humiliation compels her to make a comparative inquiry into the well buttered educational institutions churning male scholars funded liberally by capitalists juxtaposed with impoverished women colleges lacking in basic amenities.Woolf also brings to light a colossal body of masculine musings on the inability of women to explore their intellectual faculties. “The history of man’s opposition to women’s emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.”Woolf impresses upon the importance of women having and making money- the ultimate emancipator of the mind to afford the luxury of thinking about the ways of the world as they are. It puts an end to hatred, the servile need for lowly couchings and flattering their male providers. A secure financial existence demystifies the bottomless creative possibilities for women that were earlier exclusively the domain of their male counterpart –a thoroughbred exercising his power and influence; ever eager to establish a superior seal while darkening the shine of his marginalized other. She urges women writers to have a liberated, well-nourished mind that is free to stretch itself by its own volition; and for women to acquire this mind and support their creative ambition they need to well bolster themselves with money and have a room ‘with a lock on the door’ to themselves. This iconic modernist writer makes a case for androgynous-collaborative creative mind that is made fit to see things as they are, embracing differences and a mind fertile to express in ‘perfect fullness’. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 08, 2020","Mar 16, 2020","Oct 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40254141-a-room-of-one-s-own

It talks of a dystopian regime whose second nature is to adhere to its tribal signifiers of “us and them”, “those darker of the darker days”, where political correctness or “vocabulary watchdogs” or sense of individuality were unheard of.The unnamed narrator is a social oddball-a beyond-the- pale, adamantine, unyielding girl, “a walking-while-reading” misfit (who prefers nineteen century novels over others). She falls prey to the predatory maneuverings of the MILKMAN (a renouncer-an armchair supporter of rebels). Romance hostilities (read: stalk-talk) consumes her entire being; however in this “I’m a male and you’re a female territory she becomes the “female wayward, a species insolent and far too sure of herself.” The book reigns big of Women-Talk (read: feminism)- - The mocking of the Feminist group- “issue-women”, being branded as “Intellectuals, simpletons, academe’ juxtaposed with the day to day rigmaroles of the “traditional women”. - Depiction of a puritanical mindset of the totalitarian district where “menstruation” and “pregnancy” are seen as an offence to being a person. - Also comments heavily on the flawed institution of marriage where mandatoriness of fitting into the conventional mold makes women marry in doubt, fear, guilt and self-sacrifice.A suffocating sprinkling of other elements and characters like – the maybeness of relationships, The Chef (the homosexuality facet), the ballroom dancing star-couple inspiring the girls to have their fairytale-ish time, dancing, Ma (my favorite bit in the book) reminding me of the woman in Sylvia Plath’s poem Mirror, the Blower Bently (the bone of contention/nation defining emblem) and the other MILKMAN, the man who doesn’t love anybody- the veritable rebel, the protester of weapons in the times when “life…simply has to be lived and died in extremes.”A book like this also aids one to define the times that one is living in and also helps one gain complete precociousness for ensuring that such kowtowing era never relapses. Super! “What’s the point? There is no point.”...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Nov 09, 2018","Dec 02, 2018","Oct 17, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36047860-milkman

This Booker Shortlisted read had me transfixed right from page one with its milieu of mesh-reinforced windows, the smell of lice killer-Lindane Lotion and a safe haven for the hustlers roughing it up on the streets (how they seem to organically graduate from Child Protection Services and Youth Authority to end up in their final destination-PRISON-such institutional livings have well equipped them with the requisite skills to survive in the prisons!). Kushner’s fiction problematises the clichéd use of the ‘generic’ term ‘violence’- linked to the primeval instinct of bodily harm and pokes her author-ly prowess at the depravity of employment and education of their committers instead.The story orbits around Romy Hall, a stripper at the titular night club The Mars Room, headed for a life in ‘a concrete slot’ of two consecutive life sentences for murdering her stalker [a disabled Vietnam War Veteran-her bad!]. But the parts that piqued me the most were the little vignettes about other women prisoners-transgender prisoners, pregnant teenager, serial killers, baby killers and women on death row sewing sandbags. This is one of a kind read that can stir conversations and discourses at a Book Club Meet…….heat up a debate on the state of criminal minds ‘jammed’ through the system. [If, like me, you are a jotter of smart/sharp quote worthy lines-you’ll be intrigued by this one.]“Where is Iraq?”“Event the educated people in jail didn’t know.

Out of this junkyard laboring-metal scrapping-purlins hauling-feral horse breaking- brood, emerges a feisty girl who is a misfit, “whose rhythm is off, whose meter is set to the wrong tune”.WHAT WE WHISPERED AND WHAT WE SCREAMED FAITH BEFORE SAFETY: “We had been bruised and gashed and concussed, had our legs set on fire and our heads cut open. We lived in a state of alert, a kind of constant terror…..”The memoir reads to me more like Tara’s path of awareness-“I had discerned the ways in which we had been sculpted by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition to which we were either willfully or accidently ignorant”. An incredible tour de force by a girl of seventeen who swore not to remain a foot-soldier in her hostile family conflicts but to carve her own road to education and enlightenment. [Holocaust, Racial Discrimination, Martin Luther King Jr, Hegemony, Secondwave…..were some of the terms which were incomprehensible to her earlier when grasped in its complete intensity overwhelmed her and made her question her own myopic outlook.]While researching on Historians she gets hold of her own sense of purpose-“How the gatekeepers of history had come to terms with their own ignorance and partiality….from the ashes of their dispute I could construct a world to live in. In knowing the ground was not ground at all, I hoped I could stand on it.” The memoir documents her metamorphosis from a girl who knew nothing beyond junkyard and her mountains, her classroom: a heap of junk, her textbooks : slates of scrap…..into a thinking individual with a mounting conviction to defy the norms of her patriarchal construct- her triumphant journey from Brigham Young University to earning a Ph.D from Cambridge (also a short academic stint at Harvard). “You can call this selfhood…Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal.I call it an education.”A mesmeric memoir!...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 26, 2018","Oct 07, 2018","Sep 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133922-educated

Their nightly Dionysiac Rituals of screaming, dancing, singing barefoot in the woods in the dead of the night, shattering the codes of their mortal selves, the students submit themselves to this religious ecstasy leading to irreversible catastrophes (read: murders). Tartt explores the elusiveness and complexity of an act of murder - like a chronological sorting of grotesque memorabilia. The book also sheds light on the swarm like nature of the hysteria linked to madness. A very interesting campus mystery marred by repetitive scenes of drunken charades and deep philosophical musings. (I recommend you read Tartt’s The Little Friend instead or read both for the sheer self-indulgence of the author. The bonus for reading this one is that you get to learn some cool Greek expressions.)

Pandora, the brain behind the company churning the now-a-status item- pull-string dolls (‘ridicule paired with affection’) and her brother Edison, once-a-hot-deal-but-now-out-and-fading jazz pianist (once reedy thin now weighing over 386 pounds- he literally ate his piano- I mean, the money he got from selling off his piano-he ate that money off-polishing one chocolate mud cake after another) are the progeny of the has-been prime time TV star Travis Appaloosa of a hammy ‘cult show’ Joint Custody fame; now befuddled by popularity of the non-conventional crop of slick shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, he consoles himself on his lost stardom by being acerbic towards these series.The dynamics of kinship is deeply explored and tailspinned when the newly destitute and obese Edison comes to stay with her sister and Fletcher (Edison’s bête noir), her one-of-a-kind-unaffordable-furniture crafting husband (a compulsive quinoa and boiled broccoli eating cyclist). The Brother-Sister duo’s herculean mission of weight loss began on a bleak note where inhaling the wafting aromas of french fries felt like ‘window shopping without wallet’. Surviving on just four packets of protein powder liquid diet a day for six long months Edison (‘a human parade float’) not only loses weight but also learns to embrace a low-key life to a high profile limelight grabbing farce. Shriver does (as usual) provide a shocker of a last chapter both ambiguous and thought provoking.The book, for me, is an oxymoronic discourse on shattering the notions about fat pride while mocking the self-starved nutritional Nazis.Is size relative?

Ka“Hope” indeed is “the thing with feathers” for the country (read: India) that houses one-third of poverty, and one quarter of hunger, of the world. Katherine Boo without being didactic (not carrying the pretentious white man’s/woman’s burden to enlighten the savages from their own sewage of ignorance) documents the trials and tribulations of Annawadians (Annawadi, a slum with its cheek-by-jowl Mumbai Airport and luxury hotels). Boo juxtaposes this bedlam of inequality by recording the inhabitants of Annawadi Slums-rag pickers, garbage sorters, scrap dealers, double-dealing policemen, unscrupulous (gold-chain wearing) area corporators - women and mostly children- “The children stepping obliviously from the roadsides into traffic, as if they didn’t know the value of their lives.”“At Annawadi, everyone had a wrong he wanted righted: the water shortage…..; the squashing of voter applications at the election office; the worthlessness of government schools; the fly-by-night subcontractors who ran off with their laborers’ pay….”The book is an intense testimony of the city’s least powerful citizens raising uncomfortable questions about “justice and opportunity”. – “…..as the capital rushes around the planet and the idea of permanent work becomes grinding down individual promise.”The growing inflation and global market meltdowns pushing the slum dwellers deeper into the abysmal pit of misery- pacified by “exuberant distractions”- bands, amps and twinkling lights- “The annual flirtfest, the Navratri festival, was about to begin”…………………….An unnerving read- as one more westerner zooms her lenses into India’s one of the countless rat-filled garbage sheds to comprehend “the pursuit of opportunity in an unequal, globalized world.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 08, 2018","Oct 14, 2018","Sep 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11869272-behind-the-beautiful-forevers

A brilliant participatory fiction stirring up the cauldron of the flawed broth of passion-A passion that “lurks within interstices. It is grouting rather than bricks”.
