Bellissimo! I wasn't a fan of Mcquiston's previous books (I only managed to finish Red, White & Royal BluIt's-a me, Luce, and-a welcome to my ! Bellissimo! I wasn't a fan of Mcquiston's previous books (I only managed to finish Red, White & Royal Blue, which was childish, even by romcom standards) but I decided to give their latest novel a chance. However, within just a few pages, I found myself cringing at their humor (dildos...ah-ah) and their portrayal of places outside of America (that whole pub scene in London...why?)...it's giving Emily in Paris. Mcquiston writing once again delivers some serious wattpad vibes, or the kind of character interactions and scenarios that would not be out of place in a romance movie of the netflix original variety. The introduction of the Italian tour guide sealed my dislike for this book. His welcome: ""Ah! The last two! Meraviglioso!"" It's the same tired caricature of an Anglo-American's perception of an Italian, which is an amalgamation of clichés based on men from Rome or Naples (who are often portrayed as loud, boisterous, charming, handsy even). Imagine someone from Veneto, working with or for a British company, greeting clients with a 'meraviglioso!'. Ridiculous, right? He also says ""Ciao bella"" to Theo because of course he fucking does. And don't get me started on the cheek-kissing... Americans have misunderstood this whole kissing cheeks greeting. Depending on where you are in Italy, you might do it with family, friends, and depending on the setting, with friends of friends or when your friends are introducing you to someone or whatever. The Italians who work in Britain or with a British/non-Italian clientele wouldn't pull this.It's frustrating how this Fabrizio character, despite his fluency in English, can't seem to resist sprinkling in Italian phrases/words like 'meraviglioso,' 'ciao,' 'grazie mille,' etc. It feels lazy and perpetuates a shallow stereotype. Frankly, it comes across as puerile, so much so that I doubt whether I'll bother finishing this book. Unless it's revealed later on that Fabrizio isn't actually Italian or is just playing up to the expectations of non-Italians (performing his own Italianness, so to speak), this portrayal is just lazy.I don't care if you want to make fun of Italy and Italians, go for it. All I ask, is that you be clever, witty even, about it. Don't resort to such tired clichés, which are so unimaginative & unfunny that they could have been generated by AI. Anyway, YMMV, so if you are the kind of reader who likes Emily in Paris chances are this book will be up your street....more",Notes are private!,2,36,0,not set,not set,"Mar 15, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/199440249-the-pairing

Its bold new cover, featuring praise from Louise Erdrich, caught my attention. The Originally published in 2002 Perma Red has recently been reissued. Its bold new cover, featuring praise from Louise Erdrich, caught my attention. The opening pages were intriguing enough but the more I read, the more puzzled I became by the story’s unfolding events. While I enjoy novels that challenge conventions, Perma Red left me bewildered by its mishandling of its central character, Louise, who is stripped of both a personality and agency.  Set predominantly on the Flathead Indian Reservation in the 1940s, the novel orbits around Louise, a Native girl who, following her mother's death, is raised by her grandmother. Time and again Louise has run from the Ursuline schools, only to be taken away from her home and placed into another one. She’s seen as trouble, especially by Charlie Kicking Woman, a tribal officer who is fixated on Louise. Baptiste Yellow Knife, his younger cousin, is also determined to pursue Louise, employing tactics that frequently verge on violence, whether through physical force or preternatural means.But before I talk about what went wrong (for me) with Perma Red, here are a couple of things that I liked about it. It’s very much a vibe-driven novel, and it succeeds in establishing the harsh realities of Louise’s life. The novel’s stark atmosphere reminded me of Daniel Woodrell’s Winter’s Bone, Una Mannion’s A Crooked Tree, and A Prayer for Travelers by Ruchika Tomar (all of which center around girls living in rural or otherwise remote areas, with absent/dead parents, and have dealings with dubious men). In theory, I also appreciated the ambiguity permeating the narrative and that the characters, their motives and desires, remain somewhat inaccessible. I liked the imagery, which contributed to the novel’s evocative atmosphere and I did appreciate that the author, through Louise's experiences, sheds light on the violence faced by Indigenous women. However, my enthusiasm waned as Louise's narrative veered away from her development. Instead, it fixates on the men around her, neglecting her agency and reducing her to a vessel for their desires. Must a story exploring how women are objectified, objectify its central female character? Louise's potential for growth is stymied by the overwhelming presence and focus on the story’s male characters and of ‘what’ Louise is to each of them ( the white men appear to fetishize her, Charlie resents and desires her and Baptiste..i don’t know what the fuck is going on with that dude. He wants to ‘mark’ her as his…?). There are a couple of scenes where Louise is alone, that hold possibility, especially those scenes taking place outdoors. But these are cut short, her thoughts circling back to bloody Baptiste or the other losers.Louise’s grandmother and sister are given barely any time on the page (they have one or two lines of dialogue…) which is a pity as this novel was in dire need of some female solidarity or at least time dedicated to exploring relationships that do not hinge on the male gaze (that is underlined by the men's weird & obsessive thoughts and actions towards Louise). I could not for the life of me understand what was going on with the characters. I’m all for keeping things enigmatic, but here the characters are made almost entirely inaccessible, which isn’t great when said characters exhibit only trashy behaviors. Sure, I appreciated that the author doesn’t resort to lazy good/bad dichotomies, especially with the character of Charlie Kicking Woman, but the narrative fails to really consider just how creepy and predatory he is. Baptiste…I really thought that the narrative had established as an obstacle, a threat even, to Louise’s happiness and self-fulfilment…but turns out they are in love...? I did not get the memo. He is appalling, he is shown to be horrendous to Louise, the kind of 'love interest' I’d expect to encounter in Colleen Hoover's fiction. The narrative fails to explore just how damaged or damaging he is, making it so that he ends up being a very thinly rendered character, one who, by the end of the novel, we are meant to feel something for, but this payoff feels unearned. Louise is ping-ponged between men who are different levels of shitty, all of whom, except Baptiste, are way too old for her.And why are they fascinated by her? I can’t say. The narrative seems to reduce Louise to what these men view her as, that is an object whose only value lies in her body, in her appearance. Charlie Kicking Woman was giving me some serious Humbert Humbert vibes, and I was exhausted by just how much time he was given.The novel's conclusion attempts to grant Louise agency but falls short, redeeming unsavoury male characters without addressing the harm they've caused. Charlie’s predatory nature goes unexamined, while Baptiste's abusive behavior is unjustly romanticized. Louise's supposed love for Baptiste feels forced and undermines the narrative's earlier tension and intention. I’m meant to be happy that Louise is once more reunited with the man who has taken pleasure in tormenting and neglecting her? Sure, early on, that frisson of danger could have felt like desire, love even, to a young Louise, but later on it just made no sense. Rather than making Baptiste into a fleshed-out character, the narrative and Louise condone him just through the possibility that he has come to harm.Their love story didn’t need to be cutie-patootie or easy (i'm all for the exploration of toxic dynamics), but here I swear for the whole novel I thought of Batpsite as a one-note abusive asshole who stood in the way of Louise’s freedom…but it turns out that no, she loves him and he too loves her…(?). Maybe the characters are so inaccessible as to make them rather far-fetched. There were several instances where a character would randomly come up with a realization about someone or themselves that to me made no sense and felt very out of nowhere (like sure, whatever floats).I also was disappointed by the novel not exploring Louise’s grief or her family dynamics…it just made her character hollow. Perma Red offers glimpses of promise with its evocative atmosphere and exploration of Indigenous experiences, but its disjointed narrative, vague characterization, and its preference for the male voices ultimately diminish the impact of Louise's story. If Perma Red is on your radar, I recommend giving it a shot, despite my mostly negative . Perhaps you'll be able to make sense of the characters and storyline in a way that I wasn't able to.

The audiobook edition of Butter spans over 17 hours, yet its narrative could have been condensed inti was excepting something with a bit more bite... The audiobook edition of Butter spans over 17 hours, yet its narrative could have been condensed into a fraction of that time. The story feels weighed down by excessive filler content, and while its intended themes hold potential they are belabored to the point of being ham-fisted. The characters, particularly the protagonist Rika and her friend Reiko, are often made to behave moronically for seemingly no reason other than to create conflict, but these misunderstandings and instances of idiocy diminished the coherence of the narrative.The novel revolves around Rika Machida, a journalist in her 30s with a very poor work/life balance. Seeking a hit story, Rika reaches out to Manako Kajii who is currently serving time in the Tokyo Detention Centre after being convicted of the serial murders of businessmen she allegedly lured with her cooking skills. Kaji refuses to see her until Rika, at the suggestion of her friend Reiko, takes a different approach. Rather than asking Kaji about the murders, she asks for her beef stew recipe. As they interact, their exchanges focus more on food and Kaji’s ideas of ‘etiquette’ than murder, prompting not only a personal introspection for Rika but a culinary awakening. Rika’s newfound appetite results in her gaining weight, and we see how that affects the way she is seen by the people in her life. Her boyfriend, who is just as work-oriented as she is, critiques her for it, seeing it as a sign of her ‘letting herself go’, and believes that women should be especially careful of their appearance. Rika’s closest friend, Reiko, also, despite once being outspoken on matters of sexism, expresses ‘concern’ over Rika’s weight, but her remarks may have to do less with Rika’s body than Reiko feeling jealous of Rika’s fixation with Kaji. Inspired by true events, Asako Yuzuki's Butter explores themes of misogyny, obsession, beauty standards and culinary pleasures in contemporary Japan.The cover and blurb for Butter are somewhat misleading, as the novel proves to be less unsettling than they suggest. While the book does feature vivid sensory descriptions, particularly regarding food—its preparation, aroma, and taste—Yuzuki’s storytelling relied too much on repetitive depictions of glistening lips and sweaty bodies to elicit discomfort. There was an intensity ascribed to these descriptions that made many scenes feel unintentionally over the top (i was reminded of the business card scene from American Psycho…but in Butter these instances lack the former’s self-awareness and are delivered seemingly with seriousness).Butter aligns more closely with contemporary social critiques like Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, Diary of a Void, Breast & Eggs, Boy Parts, Ripe, The Glow, and Natural Beauty, books that explore themes of women challenging or questioning gender norms and navigating misogyny and beauty standards within various societal contexts. Throughout Butter, every scene appears to reinforce these thematic points. It delves into the double standards around aging and the pressures faced by women to conform to traditional gender roles, especially within cultures with more conservative values. The novel extensively interrogates ideas surrounding femininity and the expectations placed upon women, particularly the impossible standards of the 'ideal' Japanese woman. While I appreciate narratives featuring diverse portrayals of female characters and exploring complex female friendships, Butter falls short in this regard.Rika, the protagonist, comes across as painfully uninteresting and exists seemingly only to convey certain messages. Her experiences, such as gaining weight and rejecting societal pressures regarding relationships, feel didactic rather than authentic. Despite Yuzuki’s attempts to depict complexity and contradiction in her female characters, their behaviors often feel contrived and surface-level, emerging only to serve the narrative's thematic agenda. I wouldn't have minded as much if said themes had been explored in-depth, but I found the story's treatment and portrayal of misogyny somewhat superficial. There are several scenes in which Rika reflects on societal expectations regarding women's appearance and behavior (and comes to the conclusion that no, women should not have live their lives in accordance with what men find sexually attractive) and that show her professional integrity being questioned by a male colleague (who assumes that she couldn't possibly have a male friend and that she is exploiting said man to gain information for scoops). And the novel also touches upon the cultural expectations placed on married women to prioritize their husband's well-being, including taking care of household chores and cooking for him.. But I just wanted more, especially given the novel's 'run-time'. But Yuzuki never delves into the more insidious aspects of sexism and misogyny. If anything, I found her takes somewhat naive. For instance, portraying a woman who emerges unscathed after spending time with a dubious man who is certainly a creep and could have also been involved in a murder. The lack of consequences felt overly idealistic to me. The supposed tension between Rika and Kaji, the central dynamic of the novel, lacked oomph. Kaji's influence on others, including Rika, feels unconvincing given her grating demeanor and, for all her portending to be an expert in culinary matters, her ‘hot takes’ weren’t all that hot. While Rika eventually sees through Kaji's facade, her prolonged influence on Rika's perspective on food and possibly life seems disproportionate to her actual impact. Kaji's character, at first presented in an enigmatic manner akin to Hannibal Lecter had neither the charisma nor depth necessary to maintain my interest.If Butter had delved deeper into Rika’s experiences at her workplace and prioritized the development of her friendship with Reiko, perhaps I wouldn’t have felt so exasperated at this story. I found the narrative to be full of unnecessary dramatic moments (including Reiko impulsively playing detective to prove…something? What was going through her head? And then what…she just gives up like that?, Reiko is traumatized by her parents' open relationship and by the fact that her husband, like her father, also finds physical intimacy between spouses wrong—using her father’s words almost verbatim—Rika’s own trauma around her father’s death and cooking, the whole stuffed turkey thing at the end). Several plot points are introduced that seem promising enough but ultimately lead nowhere. The characterization of Kaji remains shallow, failing to evolve beyond her initial portrayal, making me wonder to what extent Rika truly understood her ‘twisted’ psyche. The novel’s conclusion was jarringly cheesy, as Rika and the people around her advocate for self-acceptance (a trite ""found family"" trope is shoehorned for good measure), which felt contrived and lacking in depth.Rika's inadequacies as a journalist are... noticeable. She’s a shit journalist. She claims to want to write an article on Kaji but her tactics to get Kaji to open up are incoherent (she does what Kaji wants her to do, but then asks very stupid questions or makes tone-deaf remarks—she tactlessly complains about her weight gain—that are bound to alienate someone as demanding and misanthropic as Kaji). Also, why didn’t it occur to Rika, like it did for Reiko, to find the man Kaji was staying with prior to her arrest?The exploration of Kaji's family and past feels cursory, presenting a cliched portrait of a Daddy’s Girl without offering meaningful insight.The narrative dangles several intriguing threads—such as the implication of a character's predatory tendencies and Kaji's alleged crimes—yet Yuzuki fails to follow these up satisfactorily. Despite being referred to as a serial killer, Kaji's actions and motivations receive only a surface-level examination and consequently Rika's view of Kaji is rather simplistic and her newfound understanding of her feels unearned (Kaji’s vices are emphasized throughout the narrative—her body too is described in a way that left much to be desired as if to emphasize just how ‘uncontrollable’ and defiant to norms she is— but then at the end we are meant to find her pathetic and kind of a victim—of her internalized misogyny, of the public’s gaze, of her need for male validation). Kaji's real life counterpart was also convicted on murder charges despite the lack of evidence, and Japan does have an incredibly high conviction rate...so why did not have Rika question whether Kaji deserved to be convicted? Or seen and spoken of a serial killer...? Kaji is antisocial, narcissistic, callous, manipulative and she doesn't seem to feel any remorse over the fact that she targeted/defrauded men…but then again their relationship seemed to me very much transactional…so why does Rika so readily accepts that Kaji is this 'serial killer'? Overall, Butter fell short of delivering the darker, psychologically gripping narrative I had hoped for. Rika's journey towards uncovering the ‘truth’ feels aimless, and the murder aspect of the story is glossed over in favor of these overly dramatic moments that fail to provide a meaningful exploration of the novel’s thematic elements. I had expected the novel to explore Rika's (supposed) 'corruption', but it never happened (unless you count gaining weight and learning to love food again as 'bad'). As a result, her own anxiety and Reiko's concern about her growing too close to Kaji seemed somewhat uncalled for. Like, chill. Not like Kaji is urging Rika to kill men. To give the author the benefit of the doubt, one could argue that she deliberately crafted a narrative of smoke and mirrors, teasing depths and thrills without fully delivering on them.I just was hoping for something darker, something more on the lines of a psychological cat-and-mouse game. Maybe on the lines of The Silence of the Lambs, or something in the realms of Barbara Vine or even My Sister, the Serial Killer. And, sure, maybe I thought that this book would deal with, shall we say, more monstrous appetites (i do love a cannibal story). Was this novel terrible? No. Was it frustrating? Sure. But, as I said before, it was so annoying as to be almost amusing. The type of book that makes you want to rant to someone about how unbelievably stupid the characters are or how ridiculous the story is.I wanted to genuinely like this novel as I am fond of the woman-being-weird-about-another-woman subgenre, but Butter missed the mark. Yuzuki's attempt to balance seriousness, realism, and drama didn't quite coalesce into something cohesive, resulting in a narrative that tone-wise felt very uneven. Even her exploration of misogyny, though earnest, lacked depth and wasn't all that thought-provoking. There seemed to be potential in delving deeper into Reiko's experiences as a stay-at-home wife, but her perspective only receives brief attention towards the end of the novel. Similarly, the portrayal of Rika's challenges in a male-dominated industry could have been more compelling, especially considering the doubts cast upon her professional abilities (then again she is a shite journalist so...).I've read plenty of books that tackle the themes this novel sets out but fails to explore them deeply. And if I were to view it as a slice-of-life narrative about the experiences of women in the workplace, in marriage, and so on, Butter wasn't as compelling as most female-centered dramas out there.If this novel is on your radar, I recommend you check out more positive s or give it a try. Who knows, you might find something in it that resonates with you in a way that it didn't for me.Also, credit goes to the narrator of the audiobook, Hanako Footman. I really enjoyed her performance and I doubt I would have managed to finish this book if not for her narration....more",Notes are private!,2,20,1,"Mar 03, 2024","Mar 10, 2024","Feb 22, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/205546985-butter

Fortunately, this time around, it was the latter. Having given Coco Mellors’ debut a hard pass, I was weary of reading more by her, yet, the premise for Blue Sisters sounded a lot less insipid than the one for C&F. While certainly not flawless, Blue Sisters makes for a tender, if occasionally too sentimental, exploration of sisterhood, grief, and self-sabotage. It should definitely appeal to fans of the people-fucking-up genre (examples being films like: The Worst Person in the World, Passages, Return to Seoul, Frances Ha and series like The Bisexual) or readers who enjoy complex sibling dynamics (such as in Yolk, Sunset, Butter Honey Pig Bread, The Arsonists' City) or female-centered books like Writers & Lovers, We Play Ourselves, and Self-Portrait with Boy.“Their family had always been good at hellos and goodbyes, moments ending even as they began. It was easy to love someone in the beginnings and endings; it was all the time in between that was so hard.”The characters are messy and there is a lot of friction among the sisters, so yes, we get a lot of arguments. With the exception of perhaps one or two cases, these come across as very authentic, sometimes overwhelmingly so. Hurtful words are hurled, sometimes with the intention to hurt, sometimes not. Things escalate, but not always. Mellors’ approach to these scenes felt cinematic yet intimate, and I appreciated how she is able to convey the conflicting feelings of her characters. The sisters are often unable to escape the dynamics of their childhood, with Bonnie acting as a pacifier, Avery as the mother, and Lucky as the rebellious youngest one. Avery and Lucky are assholes a lot of the time, something the narrative knows and doesn’t shy away from. Yet that doesn’t make them any less rounded or sympathetic. While Mellors doesn’t use their loss or childhood to excuse their actions, she allows those things to inform our understanding of her characters. I found her very empathetic, and loved many of the reflections around love (be it sisterly or romantic), insecurity, loneliness, and grief.“She was home, the only one she knew, not because she always lived in it, but because it always lived in her.”Through alternating chapters, the novel follows three of the Blue sisters, Avery, Bonnie, and Lucky, a year after the death of the fourth sister, Nicky. At the beginning of the novel, the Blue sisters are in different parts of the globe, but they are all similarly not coping, if not downright freefalling. Bonnie, once a boxer, is now working as a bouncer in LA. She does find herself making her way back to NY, where she is forced to confront her grief, the shame over her last match, and the feelings she’s been long harboring for her former mentor, Pavel. Avery works as a lawyer in London where she is married to Chiti, an older woman who was once her therapist. Chiti wants a child but Avery isn’t ready, in fact, ever since Nicky’s death she has been withdrawing from her marriage. Chiti has noticed but mostly relies on therapyspeak to remind Avery that she too has lost Nicky (as if being reminded of that would help avery…). Avery finds escape in rigorously attending AA meetings. There she meets a younger man, a poet, and their attraction is mutual and has disastrous consequences for Avery’s marriage. Lucky is a model who has spent most of her adulthood in relishing a carefree partier lifestyle. But Nicky’s death has changed things, and now Lucky is not so much as partying because it’s fun, but because as a means of oblivion. After screwing up her latest gig in Paris, she travels to London. Her and Avery’s relationship is more frayed than ever and the two sisters end up driving a further wedge in their bond. Lucky sees Avery as sanctimonious, smothering, and a hypocrite, whereas Avery is exasperated by Lucky’s careless attitude to others and herself. Eventually the three sisters reunite in NY, but their reunion is far from smooth.The prologue serves as a character introduction, one that, through the use of literary devices such as alliteration, succeeded in lending this tale of the Blue sisters the rhythms of a fairy tale. Despite the novel taking place over a fairly contained period of time, the characters have a lot of history with each other and a lot of personal baggage, yet, these forays into the past never weighed down the narrative, and if anything they made the characters more rounded. We come to understand why they act the way they do, the origin of some of their insecurities and anxieties, and why some of them try to escape their grief by avoiding what they once loved, sabotaging their relationships, and opting for self-destructive ‘coping mechanisms’. Bonnie is the more grounded of the sisters, and her arc is not a downward spiral, as it is for Avery or Lucky’s. Still, Bonnie feels responsible for Nicky’s death, and is unsure whether she can box like she used to. Avery has a tendency to shut out other people, something that makes her a hard character to get into. Yet, we can see how hard she has tried to make up for her parents, to look out for her sisters in all the ways they didn’t. She also believes that she was the one to have let down Nicky, but is not fully able to admit this, so she lets her hurt and guilt fester. She misdirects her anger towards Lucky, who is also as lost as she is. I thought that the novel was very self-assured, and that for the most part, it sticks the landing. Sure, one could say that Mellors was trying to cram in too much into the novel. Take the Blue sisters jobs…they are giving ‘try out different careers with Barbie’ (lawyer, model, boxer). They are also too beautiful and not-like-other people at times (Avery and her tattoos…sure, cool aesthetics, but it didn’t seem in line with her character). Even their mother, a character whose presence is mostly relegated to the outskirts of the narrative is subjected to this beautification: “at the time, she had silky auburn hair down to her waist and a beautiful, tulip-shaped face”. While I understood Lucky being beautiful, and her having a troubled relationship with her beauty (she takes it for granted, especially when it comes to what she can get away with, for instance, her beauty glamorizes how unpleasant, rude, and selfish she can be; she is also burdened by it, with other people unwilling to truly see her, or becoming obsessed with her because of her looks, or thinking she is a dumb shallow blonde) when it came to the other characters…these descriptions weakened the novel. They were syrupy and somewhat affected.Avery was the type of lesbian character that feels that has been written by a non lesbian, as in, the writer, in their attempts to avoid clichés about lesbians, ends up writing the straightest lesbian character ever. I did not understand why Avery is made into a lesbian character, given that the person she has an ‘affair’ with is a man…one thing is someone who is still for whatever internal or external reasons unable to identify and/or live as a lesbian, but Avery has been in a relationship with a woman for a long time, she describes herself as a lesbian who is interested in being with women…so why have her cheat with a man? A man she is insanely attracted to. It was a Choice™, one that seemed to me to exist only for dramatic effect (not only she cheats, but she cheats with a man!). Their sex scene also consolidated my perception of her as a very straight character. I just wish the author could have made her bi, queer, or pan. I also find the whole image of the (outwardly) strait-laced lesbian a bit of a bore, but thankfully Mellors does manage to make Avery into a flawed yet complex character. I didn’t like how the cheating plotline is handled,(view spoiler)[ especially when it comes to her being ‘found out’, I found Chiti finding the ‘evidence’ too much of a convenience, and had a hard time believing that Lucky wouldn’t cover for Avery, despite all their issues (hide spoiler)].Lucky also skates close to being a bit of a cliché, but thankfully the narrative doesn’t romanticize her self-destructive ways. I did found that musician subplot very cheesy—it felt like something straight out of Hollywood—and I thought it was an unnecessary add-on. Similarly, the epilogue, despite the author's heartfelt acknowledgments, felt more corny than touching.However, these aspects didn't significantly detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel. I still loved it (which just goes to show how good mellors can be). The characters and their dynamics were compelling, and I particularly admired Mellors' prose style and ability to establish atmosphere. Mellors also adeptly balanced action and introspection, ensuring that the story never felt either rushed or slow-paced. Additionally, I appreciated that certain elements remained unresolved, such as the sisters’ complex relationship with their mother, adding depth to the narrative. Mellors' portrayal of grief is heartfelt and authentic. Through the lens of the surviving sisters' memories and flashbacks, she paints a vivid picture of Nicky, allowing readers not only to empathise with her but to miss her presence. Mellors' depiction of addiction and the journey to recovery feels genuine and relatable. She captures the struggles and setbacks with honesty, which in addition to making for a candid portrayal of addiction, also made the sisters' experiences all the more compelling and real.I can definitely see myself re-reading this as I found it to be a captivating tale. It had dramatic moments and plenty of emotional beats. Evocative and thoughtful, Blue Sisters made for a compelling read, full of imperfect people and fraught relationships, all underscored by an undeniable heart. I think readers who are less averse to sentimentality than I am will likely adore it even more than I did. I look forward to Mellors' next novel, hoping that it will align more closely with the style and depth of Blue Sisters than C&F.I'm grateful for this arc and (depending on my funds) will purchase a copy of my own once it is released....more",Notes are private!,1,38,1,"Feb 13, 2024","Feb 19, 2024","Feb 13, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63888248-blue-sisters

Cormac McCarthy’s prose is uncompromising: much of the narrative consists of dialogues: rambling conversations, mystifying backwards and forwards, sharp repartees, and unremitting monologues that could easily rival Dostoyevsky’s ones. The characters are preoccupied with their past, the meaning of life, human nature, war, history, particularly America’s, morality, death, with madness. Many of them are pessimistic and bitter, jaded by age and/or experience, weighted by guilt, and haunted by past choices and loves. They recount anecdotes, confess their fears and desires, and lose themselves in speculations and diatribes of a philosophical nature. Much of the book focuses on the encounters and conversations that our aptly named protagonist, Western, a shadow of a man working as a salvage diver, makes as he traverses the Southern States and later on as he drives toward the Northwest. These talks he has, be it with strangers or old friends, are presented as if from a transcript. We are made to feel as if we were actually there, witnessing these people talk. McCarthy certainly succeeds in conveying the cadences of their speech and the kind of vocabulary they would use. Western, a good listener, often lets the other person initiate and dictate the direction of their conversation. His motives and thoughts remain somewhat of a mystery, but we can often tell what is important to him or what he feels about something by the questions or statements he chooses to dodge or elide. During his various exchanges with people he meets in bars and restaurants ​​in New Orleans and later when he has hit the road, we learn that he was in love with his sister and that his father collaborated with Oppenheimer and contributed to the atomic bomb. Haunted by his guilt, his sister’s death, and his father’s legacy, Western exists dimly.Interested with Western’s story, are short italicized chapters in which his sister, a promising mathematician, is being belittled by her hallucinations, in particular by the one referred to as ‘the Kid’. His rambling yet frenzied voice dominates these sections, and much of what he says and does is of an absurd, nonsensical nature, on the lines of Alice in Wonderland. The sister’s voice remains absent, but whereas we ultimately come to know Western, as someone who is lonely and bereft, yet willing to let people open up about their thoughts & feelings, the sister remains an impression of a beautiful yet ‘broken’ young woman. We know she wants to die, that she is tired, that her hallucinations are a source of torment and exhaustion…but I couldn’t get a grasp on her the way I did Western. Had her chapters allowed us to hear more of her, for instance, in regards to her feelings towards her self, her family and Western, maybe then she would have come across as a more believable character.Although there are women here and there, the novel mostly consists of the voices of men: men who feel forgotten, who are spiralling into addiction, and who view the world through grimey lenses. They share a preoccupation with questions of a philosophical nature, history, and science. They speak of war, of death, of politics. Yet, despite the depressing and often dismal mood permeating Western’s physical and metaphysical meanderings, there were many moments of wit, some really good banter, and a lot of cleverly delivered lines. There are only echoes of Western and his sister’s relationship, as we are given brief glimpses and fragments into the forbidden feelings they felt for one another. Because of Western’s avoidance of his past, his sister is more of a quietly haunting presence.I would be lying if I said that I understood the novel, as many passages and exchanges flew over my head. Yet, I found the writing compelling, especially McCarthy’s ear for language. The novel is certainly very atmospheric, even if the landscape we are being presented with feels desolate, an America from a bygone era. This is very much of a slow-burn of a novel, with subtle moments of introspection. Despite Western being followed by these men for unclear reasons, The Passengeris not a thriller, but rather an analytical psychodrama, where characters dispense historical, mathematical, and scientific facts left and right, all the while our central character is struck in a limbo of sorts. However, there is an obliqueness, an ambivalence, to the events that have and are transpiring that does add tension to Western's story and his past.The narrative is quite self-aware: from a reference to Joyce, to Western's nicknames, to the idea of playing the role of the tragic hero in the story of your life. Despite the story's gritty ambience there were many moments that I found moving, endearing even. The story's exploration of grief and alienation were certainly thought-provoking and evocative. This was my first foray into McCarthy's ouevre and I am definitely planning on making my way through his backlist.some quotes:“You believe that the loss of those you loved has absolved you of all else.”“Grief is the stuff of life.

Cormac McCarthy’s prose is uncompromising: much of the narrative consists of dialogues: rambling conversations, mystifying backwards and forwards, sharp repartees, and unremitting monologues that could easily rival Dostoyevsky’s ones. The characters are preoccupied with their past, the meaning of life, human nature, war, history, particularly America’s, morality, death, with madness. Many of them are pessimistic and bitter, jaded by age and/or experience, weighted by guilt, and haunted by past choices and loves. They recount anecdotes, confess their fears and desires, and lose themselves in speculations and diatribes of a philosophical nature. Much of the book focuses on the encounters and conversations that our aptly named protagonist, Western, a shadow of a man working as a salvage diver, makes as he traverses the Southern States and later on as he drives toward the Northwest. These talks he has, be it with strangers or old friends, are presented as if from a transcript. We are made to feel as if we were actually there, witnessing these people talk. McCarthy certainly succeeds in conveying the cadences of their speech and the kind of vocabulary they would use. Western, a good listener, often lets the other person initiate and dictate the direction of their conversation. His motives and thoughts remain somewhat of a mystery, but we can often tell what is important to him or what he feels about something by the questions or statements he chooses to dodge or elide. During his various exchanges with people he meets in bars and restaurants ​​in New Orleans and later when he has hit the road, we learn that he was in love with his sister and that his father collaborated with Oppenheimer and contributed to the atomic bomb. Haunted by his guilt, his sister’s death, and his father’s legacy, Western exists dimly.Interested with West...more",Notes are private!,2,51,2,"Dec 26, 2022not set","Dec 28, 2022not set","Feb 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60581087-the-passenger

Set against the backdrop of the 50s and 60s, these stories explore race and racism during Jim Crow America. The seemingly humdrum settings in many of these stories belie their disconcerting nature. Several stories are quietly sinister, evoking an unease reminiscent of the work of Shirley Jackson and Nella Larsen. Given their subject matter, these stories are often harrowing. Yet, Oliver maintains a distance almost that allows her to delve into the unsettling undercurrents of humanity. The title story, ‘Neighbor’, stands out as the most emotionally engaging piece in the collection. It takes place over the course of a single night, one filled with apprehension and danger for a Black family whose son is set to be one of the first Black students at a newly integrated school. Faced with threats from white nationalists, the parents grapple with guilt for potentially endangering their son or subjecting him to violence.The following story explores a similar scenario, except this time it revolves around a Black college student. ‘Mint Juleps Not Served Here’ very much brought to mind Jackson’s work, as it is a perfectly unnerving story following the lengths to which a Black couple is willing to go to protect their son and themselves from the white gaze. While the story is characterized from the get-go by an uneasy atmosphere, the crescendo of disquiet accompanying the back-and-forth between the mother and a white stranger proved strikingly effective. In ‘Banago Kalt’ three American girls travel to Switzerland, and here the Black girl finds herself the object of curiosity, and feels both extremely alienated by the locals yet strangely hypnotized by their bizarre questions and behaviors. This story’s exploration of racism outside of America very much reminded me of Larson’s Quicksand. any stories also delve into the banality of marriage, focusing on women resentful or exhausted by the monotony of domestic life. From petty jealousies to outright hatred, Oliver doesn’t shy away from portraying the full spectrum of human emotions. Quite a few stories feature adults who are not in the least bit keen on children, and their coldness brought to mind the short stories by Taeko Kono (which, to be fair, are far more overt). Anxieties around being known, boxed in, preoccupy many of the characters, and I appreciated Oliver’s varied approach to this theme to be compelling. I also thought that unlike many other authors, Oliver is able to depict children who sound like actual children. There were however a couple of stories that failed to register their presence, lessening the impact of the other stories in the collection. One story in particular, came across as little other than an exercise in style. I found it to be annoying and repetitive, its experimental nature a gimmick. Still, this makes for a gripping collection, one that is permeated by ambivalence. Oliver’s social commentary is incisive, her storytelling simultaneously subtle and frank....more",Notes are private!,1,25,1,"Feb 15, 2024","Feb 20, 2024","Feb 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/128713517-neighbors-and-other-stories

Sure, the futuristic concepts it plays around with have since been thoroughly explored elsewhere (be it literature or other forms of media). Yet Chi Ta-wei's world-building retains a refreshing and innovative quality. However, this potential is ultimately sabotaged by vast amounts of exposition. The delivery of said exposition made these exposition dumps all the more obtrusive. The narrative adopts a scholarly tone, which, though suitable for speculative fiction, here rendered the storytelling didactic and disconnected. Rather than feeling immersed in Momo's story, the exposition interrupted the action of the story and turned her into more of a case study than a character I am to believe in and or care for. The exposition interrupted the momentum of the story, at times coming across as an intrusive prolonged intermission (“All right. At last this complicated backstory has reached a turning point. Here’s where things get interesting.”). The novel's conceit was intriguing, no doubt, but its execution necessitated more of a sleight of hand. A more subtle, nebulous approach (reminiscent of authors such as kazuo ishiguro and emily st. john mandel) would have lent Ta-wei’s 'what if' scenario a deeper resonance and complexity.The novel is set in the late 21st century, when, to escape climate change, humanity has been forced to relocate to the bottom of the sea. In the ‘underwater’ T City Momo works as a dermal care technician, and despite being pretty renowned in her field, she keeps a low profile. This is partly due to her estranged mother being a powerful, famous even, figure. Momo hasn’t seen her since she was a child, and the two are now strangers. We learn that as a child Momo was sick and of the childhood friend she made during that time. Things however don’t quite add up, and the narrative explores that mismatch between Momo’s experiences and her memories, between her mind and her body. As I said, the novel, brief as it is, was overshadowed by exposition, which is delivered in such a stiff way as to come across as awkward. The language here, and I’m not sure if this is due to it being a translation, came across often as that of an academic paper. This was most likely intentional, nevertheless, it just took away focus from Momo and her environment. There is a lot of navel-gazing, which is not quite as revealing as actually exploring Momo’s psyche. The narrative spends too much time going over these Freudian scenarios, in which Momo desires to be touched as her mother seems to be touched by her ‘friend’. The childish language in these scenes made the novel’s exploration of Momo’s sexuality and gender somewhat simplistic and not as provocative or challenging as it needed to be.Still, I recognize that my disappointment may stem from my having come across this concept elsewhere and from being the type of reader who finds exposition-heavy narratives to be a huge turn-off. I do appreciate Ta-wei's exploration of queerness, and recognize that The Membranes resonated with plenty of other readers...so, if this novel happens to be on your radar I recommend you give it a try....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Feb 22, 2024","Feb 27, 2024","Jan 09, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55825321-the-membranes

Forging forward with the answer you have – stumbling along the way and picking yourself up – only to one day realise that the answer you’ve held on to for a long time is not the right one . When that happens, it’s time to look for the next answer. That’s how ordinary folks, like herself, live. Over our life span, the right answer will keep changing.”  A balm for the soul, Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop makes for the perfect comfort-read. Hwang Bo-reum’s storytelling was a delight, and I found myself wholly won over by how thoughtful and humane her novel is. A healing slice-of-life, Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop around the Hyunam-dong Bookshop, located in a small residential neighborhood outside Seoul. We meet the owner, Yeongju, a woman who by her late 30s feels burnt-out, both by her professional life and her personal one. After divorcing her husband and quitting her job, Yeongju decides to fulfil her dream and opens a bookshop. But setting up a successful business is no easy feat, and in the first few months, Yeongju is still feeling emotionally drained. So she spends most of her days crying, or looking gloomy, which does little in terms of attracting new customers. She does have a regular, an older woman who is quite frank in pointing out Yeongju’s flaws when it comes to managing the bookshop. Yeongju ends up hiring a barista, Minjun, who is also dealing with doubts about his future (starting a ‘real’ career, and so on). We then meet new regulars, some of whom end up working at the bookshops, while others end up participating in its reading clubs and or attending its various events.“Running an independent bookshop was like roaming a stretch of land without roads. There was no tried-and-tested business model. Bookshop owners live day by day, hesitant to plan too far ahead .”We gain insight into their lives, their everyday worries, their thoughts on happiness and love, and their differentiating values (should you pursue a respectable high-paying career? Should you stay in an environment that is detrimental to your mental health? How do you cope with parental pressure? If you choose to follow your dreams, does that make you selfish?). I loved how despite their differences in age and personality, they are all trying to heal, to be a little less lost, a little less lonely.“A curious feeling swept over her. The feeling of being accepted.”We are given almost a documentary-like insight into the behind-the-scenes of running a bookshop. Yeongju has to come up with ways to attract more customers, she has to weigh whether she wants to stock books that are bound to sell (because they are written by a well-known author or were mentioned by someone famous) or whether she should treat all books the same way, regardless of the likelihood that they will be bought. And what to do when someone asks for a recommendation? As a bibliophile, I was utterly absorbed by this verisimilitude approach to the publishing and book-selling scenes. Not only is the book full of literary references but we also get to read about the characters’ different opinions of the same books, debate what is and what isn’t good writing, and so on.“Because it’s our first life, worries are aplenty, and anxiety, too. Because it’s our first life, it’s precious. Because it’s our first life, nobody knows what’ll happen even in five minutes.”I loved seeing the way they connect and support one another, and I found the pace of their blossoming friendships to be really believable. There are also some bittersweet moments. We have characters confronting painful memories, thinking back to past disappointments, and or struggling to see a more fulfilling future. The author allows her characters to question themselves, their past behaviors, and their present-day feelings. The way these characters change and or consider things felt very organic, and I was almost lulled by the realistic rhythm of their thoughts and their conversations. Throughout the novel, I found myself growing fond of the Hyunam-dong Bookshop and its people. “All of you should find something you enjoy doing, something that makes you excited. Instead of pursuing what is recognised and valued by society, do what you like. If you can find it, you’ll not waver easily, no matter what others think. Be brave.”Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop is such a charming novel. Its heartwarming slice-of-life atmosphere wholly complemented Hwang's meditative and slightly melancholic storytelling. The characters, from their everyday worries to their longstanding regrets, felt like real people, and I was completely invested in their journeys. I can’t wait to read this again as I already miss Yeongju & co!...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jan 08, 2024","Jan 11, 2024","Jan 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/133938826-welcome-to-the-hyunam-dong-bookshop

Right from the outset, the book's attempts at self-awareness about the tropes of its genre (""anyone who has ever watched a film with time-travel, or read a book with time-travel […] will know that the moment you start to think about the physics of it, you are in a crock of shit. How does it work? How can it work?"") backfire, as we are offered a generic explanation of time-travel along the lines of ""[D]on't worry about it. All you need to know is that in your near future, the British government developed the means to travel through time"".what made absolutely 0 sense to me was not so much the time-travelling and the lack of explanation around it, but the identity of these 'expats' (would they really 'rescue' someone who was in the midst of a war? surely they would consider them unsuitable, or too much of a risk, given that they are bound to have some form of ptsd and might believe that they have been captured by the 'enemy), and their 'bridges'.we're led to believe that their bridges undergo careful selection and multiple interviews, yet our protagonist seems entirely ill-suited for the task at hand. it would have been more logical for someone with an understanding of the expat's era to care for them. moreover, the notion that these time expats wouldn't be institutionalized but instead released to live with their bridges seems implausible.  and would they really place them in London? surely it would have made more sense to find safehouses in the countryside, as opposed to smackbam in the middle of modernity.despite the considerable resources invested in extracting them, they're entrusted to a single individual who promptly forgets their surveillance duties, allowing them to wander the city alone?it's nonsensical. while i'm willing to suspend disbelief regarding time travel, if i'm to buy into this 'ministry', it should feel less slapdash.i skimmed ahead and saw how the romance subplot would unfold...if anything the romance made the story all the banal. why can't we have significant non-romantic relationships between male and female main characters? must it inevitably result in a romance, even here? the optics were dubious, akin to a therapist and their patient embarking on a romantic relationship.given all the buzz around this novel, i recognise that i am an outlier and chances are that it will be a hit for most readers (i just happen not be one of them). i recommend giving this novel a shot and forming your own opinion.

And sure, while there are books Broughtupsy, despite its compelling first few pages, proved to be the type of novel that favors style over substance. And sure, while there are books that can pull this off, the 'style' presented by Broughtupsy is both affected and shallow. Striving for a blend of lyricism and immediacy, Christina Cooke’s writing style is not far removed from that of Tumblr poetry. Cooke's excessive reliance on repetition and onomatopoeias comes across as gimmicky and posey. It's unfortunate, given what the novel could have accomplished. I know it's a somewhat overused ‘put-down’, but Broughtupsy did have potential. The novel centers on Akúa who left Jamaica for Canada as a child, not long after her mother’s death. Now twenty, Akúa is once again grieving, this time the death of her younger brother, Bryson. Seeking to reconnect with her estranged older sister, Tamika, Akúa makes the impulsive decision to spend two weeks in Kingston. While I’m all for flawed, or even unlikeable, characters, I found Akúa to be both insufferable and not particularly believable. I had a hard time buying into how naive she is and continues to be throughout the novel. Her inability to comprehend diverse perspectives, to accept that people feel different things and or respond differently to the same situations, felt far-fetched. Upon arriving in Kingston, her actions, particularly regarding their brother's ashes, contribute to tensions with Tamika, yet Akúa often perceives others as unreasonable, displaying a self-centered and self-victimizing attitude. Time and time again I wanted to ask her: what did you expect? What possessed you? ...you did this for what?Despite claiming a desire to reconnect to Tamika, Akúa demonstrates little genuine interest in Tamika, let alone her experiences. Funnily enough, I disliked Akúa so much that, by contrast, even Tamika, someone who is homophobic and seemingly pro-British, appealed to me. The narrative introduces a forced sexual awakening subplot, diverting attention from the sisters' dynamic and Bryson's character, who ultimately serves as a plot device and the catalyst for Akúa's journey. Akúa's love interest is portrayed in a rather objectifying way, and I wish that she had not been so quickly reduced to serve the role of ‘escape’ for Akúa.The dialogues follow a repetitive pattern, with Character A, usually Akúa, initiating uncomfortable discussions, and Character B refusing to engage in said discussion, so they flat-out ignore A's line of questioning (usually it's the one question being repeated ad nauseam) and talk about something else, but A keeps on prodding, so B is shouting over A, and A just doesn't get why B doesn't want to talk about 'real' things, leading to verbal and sometimes physical altercations.And of course, we also get flashbacks chapters, where we are introduced to two characters devoid of clear personalities (beyond being racist). Akúa meets them on the first day of school, and, wouldn’t you know, they end up becoming BFFs. The inclusion of a half-heartedly portrayed girlfriend character adds little to the narrative. These flashbacks felt like missed opportunities to delve into Akúa's home life and her relationships with her father and brother.Cooke’s repetitive writing style was almost as aggravating as Akúa’s character. Repetition can be effective, but here it felt ‘right’ only in one or two instances (i’m thinking of that scene where Akúa is at the airport, or the one taking place in the market). In almost every other instance, Cooke’s use of repetition felt distracting, gimmicky even. I will say that Cooke’s attempts at creating a cinematic atmosphere are for the most part successful, and the novel’s biggest strength lies in its strong sense of place. Also, while I was clearly not a fan of the novel's execution, I did appreciate the themes that the story had set out to explore (from akúa’s alienation and dislocation to her frustration towards traditional & heteronormative notions of femininity and propriety).I can think of several titles that that delve into the complex dynamics between sisters—Yolk by Mary H.K. Choi, Sunset by Jessie Cave, Caucasia by Danzy Senna, The Star Side of Bird Hill by Naomi Jackson, Butter Honey Pig Bread by Francesca Ekwuyasi—or that feature characters journeying someplace in the hopes of reconciling themselves with their pasts—All the Water I’ve Seen Is Running by Elias Rodriques—or perhaps as a means of escape—The Human Zoo by Sabina Murray—and I'm afraid that compared to those, Broughtupsy just did not make the cut.The  above is very much subjective, so if you are interested in this novel, I suggest you check out some more positive s out....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Jan 30, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/138378668-broughtupsy

The novel’s tense atmosphere quickly gave way to a sentimentality that felt unearned and out-of-place, disappointingly milquetoast (better suited to a generic period-drama if you ask me).In the summer of 1961 in the quiet Dutch province of Overijssel, Isabel, living alone in her late mother's country home, finds her daily routine disrupted by the unwelcome arrival of Eva, her brother Louis’ latest girlfriend. Despite her protestations, Louis, the ‘official’ owner of the house, forces his decision onto Isabel before setting off. Eva is very much an unwanted guest and behaves in a way that sets Isabel’s teeth on edge. Isabel, already prone to paranoia and possessing a rather sanctimonious outlook, abhors Eva. She seems to believe that Eva’s girlish, laid-back nature is a front and soon suspects her of stealing when several items go missing. Now and again they spend time with Isabel’s other brother, who to her disapproval is living with a close male ‘friend’ of his. Nothing much happens beyond a series of domestic scenes in which Isabel is depicted as a repressed, slightly neurotic woman who, like many repressed fictional characters before her, lets out her frustration and anger by stuffing her face into a towel or a pillow or whatnot and screaming. Or giving Bateman-spiraling-over-a-business-card energy. I’m not against conceal don’t feel type of characters, (eg. the lucys authored by Brontë and Kincaid or one of Shirley Jackson’s girlies), or ones who become fixated or obsessed with someone they are also suspicious of (These Violent Delights by Micah Nemerever, Apartment by Teddy Wayne), but Isabel, who is neither complex nor intriguing enough for me to feel any sort of way towards her, fails to evolve beyond a one-dimensional character. Her contradictions and inner conflicts lack depth and come across as contrived and uninspiring. The promised exploration of her 'forbidden' attraction feels forced and fails to make her a compelling or fleshed-out character. Eva, the object of Isabel’s desire, was even less interesting. Her character consists of a series of thin impressions, making her into a barely-there sort of presence. This is surprising given that she is meant to be the catalyst to Isabel, the reason behind the ‘unravelling’ of her studied outer self. We are probably meant to find Eva to be the more approachable character, but I found her for the most part to be forgettable, although occasionally she did strike me as irritating. Her hidden agenda felt disappointingly moviesque, especially the way her backstory is presented to us…it was very giving historical melodrama, which may work for many, but does zilch for me.The novel initially promises to be something more in the realm of psychological suspense, a story where we follow the type of character that is rather off-putting. Isabel is unyielding, rather misanthropic, and believes herself to be the subject of many slights. I was fine with her being this type of character, after all, two of my favorite novels are Giovanni’s Room and Madame Bovary, both of which focus on morally reprehensible characters…but then along the way Isabel’s arc ends up being surprisingly sentimental. There were so many scenes in The Safekeep that should have made me feel a certain degree of something but I just didn’t buy into them. Supposedly charged moments and tense discussions didn’t land, often because they seemed overly dramatic in a way that felt unearned, forced even. I didn’t buy into Isabel’s obsession with Eva, mostly because Eva is for the most part portrayed as very wishy-washy. I’m not against narratives where one character is projecting their feelings onto another character, or letting their paranoia tinge their understanding of another person (their personality, their ‘true’ motivations), or where the central relationship is very much push/pull, but here...the supposed tension, or chemistry, between these two women felt simultaneously rushed and overdone. I would have preferred more of a slow burner, but they go from nothing to 100% in a way that took away from the novel’s initial atmosphere of ambivalence. I was surprised by how banal the plot was. The main characters were dramatic in a way that brought to mind The World Cannot Give by Tara Isabella Burton, a novel I don’t care for in the slightest. The side characters were very one-note, and Isabel’s brother's story was presented to us in a way that made me think of so many period dramas (in other words, cliched).It’s frustrating because van der Wouden’s writing is top-notch and those first chapters were very absorbing. Her descriptions of the house and its contents, as well as the way she describes the characters’ expressions and body language, were very well done. Her writing style exudes a cool, polished quality reminiscent of Barbara Vine, Sarah Waters, and Magda Szabó. On paper, The Safekeep explores compelling themes. Against the backdrop of the 1960s, the narrative has the opportunity to unveil the societal expectations and constraints placed on women. Isabel's adherence to conservative values leads her to perceive her burgeoning attraction to Eva as morally 'wrong.' Additionally, her prejudices extend to those outside her racial, cultural, and class spheres. The novel does allow us to see how Isabel's narrow mindset becomes a self-imposed trap, hindering her from experiencing true fulfillment, living in the shadow of her mother and resentful of her brothers' freedom. The central themes of inherited guilt and reparations are also pivotal to the narrative. However, the way these issues are handled struck me as somewhat schematic, leaning towards a simplistic and moralizing tone.Alas, the novel’s initial tense atmosphere just...fizzles out. I’m all for books where fraught character dynamics are at the centre stage, but here Isabel and Eva lacked substance, consequently, their friction and their developing relationship left me feeling very uninvolved. Maybe the reason I was so unbothered by this novel is that I read it not long after reading Winter Love, an overlooked lesbian classic narrated by someone not that dissimilar from Isabel herself (Han Suyin's narrator is aloof, unpleasant even) who embarks into a love affair with a married woman. Or I just have come across this type of dynamic and atmosphere in several other novels (Sweet Days of Discipline by Fleur Jaeggy, The Inseparables by Simone de Beauvoir, and Passing by Nella Larsen, Belladonna by Anbara Salam, books by Danzy Senna, Patricia Highsmith). van der Wouden's is a clearly talented writer, it's a pity that her novel falls victim to a lacklustre execution.Still, in spite of my negative , I encourage prospective readers to give van der Wouden's debut a shot. I may have simply been unable to enjoy it due to my overexposure to this type of genre. If you liked Claire Fuller's Bitter Orange or Ian McEwan's Atonement, or if you happen to enjoy the historical fiction penned by authors like Rose Tremain, there's a good chance you will find van der Wouden's debut to be a satisfying reading experience....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 29, 2024","Jan 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/199798201-the-safekeep

Blessings is a debut novel delving into emotionally resonant themes. HoweverHow ridiculous, how callous and absurd to expect perfection from a child. Blessings is a debut novel delving into emotionally resonant themes. However, it falters on a ‘technical’ level. The result is a novel that lacks cohesion and is hampered by major pacing issues. While the author’s prose occasionally achieves a delicate balance between restraint and intimacy, it often stumbles over clunky sentences and stilted dialogues. Nevertheless, given that this is a debut, it is by no means a poor effort.Set in Nigeria, from the late 2000s to the early 2010s, Blessings recounts the lonely and brutal coming of age of a gay young man, first at a Christian boarding school and later as a university student. Most of the novel details his experiences at the boarding school, honing in on the unforgiving hierarchies operating within it, where senior students wield power through physical and psychological intimidation. We first encounter Obiefuna, our protagonist, before his ‘exile’, when he’s still in Port Harcourt where he lives with Anozie, his disapproving father, Uzoamaka, his supportive mother, and Ekene, his younger brother, who, unlike Obiefuna, seems to effortlessly blend in with other boys, embodying ‘masculinity’ with ease. To avoid his father’s anger, Obiefuna has already begun to deprive himself of doing what he likes, for instance, he no longer dances, something he once loved doing. Yet, the arrival of Aboy, a boy around Obiefuna’s age who becomes his father’s apprentice, makes known, to both son and father, what had until then been a ‘suspicion’. As punishment, Anozie sends him to a boarding school, and Obiefuna has no choice but to acquiesce. Uzoamaka is left in the dark, and although she is told that Obiefuna is leaving home willingly, she knows that not to be true.At the boarding school, Obiefuna struggles further with his sexuality, unsure of his feelings but aware of the shame and potential danger it poses. During his first year there he finds himself growing attached to a senior student, someone with a sadistic streak, capable of both affection and humiliating punishments. Under this guidance, Obiefuna learns to perform an accepted masculinity, straying further from his sensitive nature. Although Obiefuna eventually finds himself entangled with other boys, the furtive nature of their sexual encounters deepens Obiefuna's internalized homophobia. Authoritative figures at his school, like the chaplain, compound this notion of sexual pleasure as sinful, particularly when it deviates from the accepted heteronormative norms.Intercutting Obiefuna’s grueling experiences at the school, we have chapters centered around his mother, Uzoamaka. She knows that her husband is not telling her the truth about the circumstances leading to her son’s enrolment in a boarding school, but Anozie refuses to tell her the truth. Their marriage is tumultuous, yet, although Uzoamaka chafes against Anozie's domineering nature, and stands up for her sons, she doesn’t have a lot of options besides to remain with him.Several aspects of the novel's narrative structure could be improved. The ‘dual’ storylines, for instance, felt mishandled. If Uzoamaka’s chapters had focused on the early years of her marriage, and Obiefuna’s childhood, this would have made both her character and her marriage more well-rounded. Her bond with her son also could have had more room to shine. A focus on the past would have given the characters much-needed history, given that a lot of the time they come across as somewhat one-dimensional. It would have also added a layer of tension, and unease, given that, like Obiefuna, who is stuck at a boarding school, we wouldn’t know what was going on back home, and we would have experienced several reveals alongside him. Instead, we get these present-day chapters that are very repetitive in what they reveal about Uzoamaka. There is a plot point here that is portrayed in a way that lacks the emotional punch it should have had. If this had happened off-page, so that we only learn about them once Obiefuna is finally allowed back home, it would have been more emotionally resonant.Obiefuna’s chapters themselves are repetitive, focusing on friction with other students – one abusive, another using him, and one betrayed by him. Although realistic, there was something slightly predictable about the way that he is shown to participate in the bullying of a fellow student. Sure, we can understand that to ensure his own self-preservation he takes part in this violent episode, but, the way the narrative depicts this and later on expounds on this scene, felt overstated, and adhered to a rather moralistic, lessons learnt, understanding of human nature. Besides that, these chapters revealed little about Obiefuna himself. The initial chapters set in the school give us an insight into the ruthless social hierarchies of the place, foreshadowing Obiefuna's need to protect himself from being 'known' in the upcoming years. And yet, the following chapters reiterate this to an excessive degree. Not only that, but the depiction of Obiefuna’s experiences at the school felt strangely myopic. In chronicling Obiefuna’s boarding school years, these chapters fall short as they neither provide a detailed portrait nor offer a comprehensive overview of this period of his life. Instead, they present a limited zoom-in, narrowing on a specific aspect of his experiences during that time. We learn little of his studies, of his teachers, and of his friendship with two other students, who remain little more than names on a page.The final segment of the novel feels like it belongs to a different novel altogether, bringing to mind The Human Zoo by Sabina Murray(whereas the earlier chapters felt closer to An Ordinary Wonder by Buki Papillon). A time-skip prevents us from seeing Obiefuna's character development firsthand, making this 'new' version of him feel like a different person. Yet, it is here that the novel presents us with more interesting character dynamics, as Obiefuna becomes part of a group of old friends, presenting him and us with different perspectives of queerness and love in conservative Nigeria. The contrast in tone between their early get-togethers—where they talk politics as well as chat about their past and present relationships—and the aftermath of a law criminalizing homosexuality (banning gay unions, lgbtq+ gatherings), is sobering. I wish this section hadn't been condensed into such a brief span, as there that proved far more compelling and nuanced than the somewhat dry, schematic chapters giving a partial account of Obiefuna’s school years. This part of the novel, featuring an adult Obiefuna, could have easily been expanded. Doing so would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of Obiefuna's relationship with his father and brother. Despite tackling compelling themes, Blessings makes for an uneven reading experience. The pacing consistently fluctuated between being sluggish and hurried, the mother-son dynamic was overshadowed by repetitive scenes that contributed little nuance to either the characters or their storylines, and the writing occasionally felt unsteady.Nevertheless, the narrative does portray the far-reaching consequences of bullying on both victims and bystanders. It also delves into the loneliness, alienation, and dangers of homophobia, be it in personal relationships or on a broader societal scale....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Feb 03, 2024","Feb 11, 2024","Jan 02, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/159269939-blessings

Despite its potential, Martyr! struck me as a novel that wKaveh Akbar’s Martyr!, one of my most anticipated 2024 releases, fell short of its premise. Despite its potential, Martyr! struck me as a novel that was taken out of the publishing oven far too early. The result is a rather half-baked novel that failed to truly elicit any strong emotion on my part. Despite the novel’s polyphonic structure, the various perspectives in Martyr! sounded less like a choir and more like a monotonous voice, one that inadvertently pulled me out of the reading experience. I found myself acutely aware of its constructed nature, and I felt frustrated by the book’s singular tone. To be sure, there were a couple of reflections here and there that felt perceptive, nuanced, and certainly relatable (especially when it comes to expressing the experiences/mind-set of someone who is depressed, suicidal, and/or addicted). But that was sort of it. We have this main character who despite being in possession of various ‘quirks’ (from his childhood habits to his rather ‘unique’ job at the hospital that sadly made me think of c, a film i fucking hated), is ultimately a springboard for various discourses. The novel is most effective in the “sessions” between Cyrus, our protagonist, a newly sober Iranian-American queer man approaching 30, and Orkideh, a terminally ill performance artist who in a very Marina Abramović move is living out her final days in the Brooklyn Museum. These sections made me think back to María Gainza’s Optic Nerve, and so during these interactions, I found the artspeak and academic references to be apt, whereas, in the remainder of the novel, these felt either didactic or out-of-place.  Cyrus’ chapters are intercut by chapters from his family members: his father, who died while Cyrus was in college, his mother, whose death is in many ways the catalyst for Cyrus’ fixation on martyrdom, and his uncle, traumatized by his experiences in the Iranian battlefields where dressed as the Angel of death, he comforted his dying countrymen. I almost immediately questioned the author’s choice to adopt a 1st pov in their chapters, whereas Cyrus’ are told through a 3rd pov. Their voices, sounded like what Cyrus would think they would sound like. I wished that the author could have been a bit more unconventional when it came to the structure of his novel. The storytelling could have been more experimental, for instance, something along the lines of Mary-Alice Daniel's A Coastline Is an Immeasurable Thing (a memoir that manages to balance an intimate coming-of-age with various historical accounts), Namwali Serpelll’s labyrinthine  (which presents readers with different versions of the same events/episodes), or Kim Thúy’s fragmented forays into the past. A more atypical structure would have complemented Cyrus’ troubled nature to his childhood and family history, as well as his sense of dislocation. For example, we could have had Cyrus either imagining and writing about the experiences of his parents and uncle or providing secondhand accounts of their lives. After all, he is a writer, a poet, who is writing a work on martyrs that is heavily influenced by his own experiences of death and grief. Or it could have gone for a story-within-story type of framework, a la Elizabeth Kostova, or committed more fully to being a family saga, after all, that type of narrative doesn't prevent one from exploring more ‘literary’ topics or providing thought-provoking reading material (eg. Elif Shafak, Louise Erdrich, Hala Alyan, Margaret Wilkerson Sexton). But Martyr! never quite finds its footing. The use of multiple perspectives is done by rote. And I wouldn’t have minded as much if these various voices had depth, but they struck me as self-referential, mere exercises in style. The author tries to jazz things up by including sections where Cyrus imagines conversations between real-life people, like his mother, and fictional characters, like Lisa Simpson. Not only is this idea not particularly original (exploring a character’s psyche by having them engage in imaginary dialogues with famous figures). Maybe if the author had captured the essence of these fictional figures, I would have been more willing to overlook the contrived nature of these sections, but as it was Lisa Simpson is recognizable as such only because of her pearls and a possible reference to music. These chapters were distractingly gimmicky and further solidified my disinterest in the overall story. As I said early on, the novel did have potential, especially when it came to its topics & themes: martyrdom, death, grief, contemporary American politics, Western military interference in the Middle East, Iranian history, misperceptions of Islam, generational trauma and silence, the relationship between one’s identity and one’s art as well as the difficulty in challenging dualistic either/or way perspectives of one’s identity (when it comes to race, nationality, faith, and sexuality). In many instances dialogues or segments surrounding humanities subject areas rang hollow, at times even performative, as these added little to important issues, or advanced no new perspectives or argument, for instance when it came to using a postcolonial lens to reevaluate the Western canon. Like, we have this bit where two characters, who almost always sound like the same guy, talk about how racist The Bell Jar is, mentioning this one episode from that novel (the novel has several overt instances of racism). They then mention other controversial figures, like Susan Sontag, but the discussion there.. felt truncated, mere name-dropping. One character concludes childishly that everyone should do as he does. I wanted more from a scene like this, and certainly, I wanted this scene to feel like a realistic back-and-forward between two people.If you follow my s here on GR, you know by now that most of my favorite novels are centered around alienated, self-sabotaging, navel-gazing characters (eg. Are You Happy Now by Hanna Jameson, Yolk by Mary H.K. Choi, You Exist Too Much by Zaina Arafat and The Arena of the Unwell by Liam Konemann). And I also have a high tolerance when it comes to rambling internal monologues, or very academic novels (for instance Elif Batuman’s duology). But with Martyr! I did not feel that I was reading a compelling or in-depth character study. Cyrus was a means through which the author could initiate and discuss various topics. Cyrus’ internal monologue struck me as slightly formulaic, affected even. The ideas and images we found there were often overly wordy, in a way that took me out of the reading experience. It made me think of a certain type of very self-conscious academic writing, the kind of writing where something ‘simple’ is worded in such an unnecessarily convoluted way as to lose sight of its original meaning/purpose and can come across as just plain pretentious. While the novel does touch upon interesting issues, certain dialogues, especially the ones between Cyrus and his best friend, or Cyrus and his sponsor, seemed, schematic, and slightly dry. There is this plot reveal that struck me as sentimental and out-of-place, the type of plot point that would have been more suited to a more book-clubby book, or something from Hollywood.The author's depiction of his female characters left me with the impression that he was playing it 'safe'. Their personalities seemed to blend together, and while they were allowed some flaws, the author held back from making them as chaotic or lively as their male counterparts.As I said above, the novel would have benefited from having a more ambiguous type of storytelling, as it would have suited the novel’s themes: Cyrus' tendency to mythologize his past and family history, the uncertain nature of the act of retrospection, and so on. I have just read several books exploring these themes and, compared to those, Martyr! comes across as rather derivative and generic. Which is a pity, especially for a novel that includes a quote by Clarice Lispector...There were instances, often on a sentence level (""hairless in a way that makes my skull louder, the angles of my jaw""...i understand wanting to emphasize the uncle's, shall we say, fragmented psyche but his chapters were, predictably, full of these clunky stylized sentences), that needed more thorough editing (did we really need Cyrus to tell us how a wikipedia page is usually subdivided? And, at the risk of being pedantic: it's Venice Biennale, not Venice Biennal). A lot of descriptions were just...trying too hard (exhibit a: ""his face all chin and jaw, cavernous dark eyes like weeping poppies""; exhibit b: ""the narrowing angles of her jaw and neck like a diving crystal dangling from an invisible string"").  It was by no means a bad read but it was a forgettable one. I was too aware of the author’s presence to feel invested in the story or its characters. The snippets of poetry that we get (written by Cyrus for his book) didn’t feel as striking as they were meant to be. All in all, Martyr was a bit of a misfire. Cyrus is the type of alienated and obsessive young(ish) man going through what could be broadly described as an existential crisis that I have come across before in literature (Hari Kunzru's Red Pill, David Santos Donaldson's Greenlanad, David Hoon Kim's Paris Is a Party, Paris Is a Ghost) and despite his experiences throughout the novel he ultimately ends up adhering to a predictable story arc (featuring convenient coincidences, moments of truth, and so on) that struck me as disappointingly vanilla. I don’t think that I’d read more by Akbar, but you never know. If this book is on your radar I recommend you give it a try despite my negative  or at least check out more positive s if you are making your mind up about it....more",Notes are private!,6,56,1,"Jan 02, 2024","Jan 08, 2024","Jan 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/139400713-martyr

Consisting of three short stories (“Realizing Fun Things Through Water”, “Bath Towel Visuals”, “Hello, Thank You I’m Okay”) and the title novella, “People Who Talk to Stuffed Animals Are Nice”, this collection struck me for its empathy, and for its focus on characters who are (for whatever reasons) made to feel different. Throughout these stories, Ao Omae explores the experiences of characters who feel constrained by patriarchal norms of gender and sexuality. Omae is in particular critical of strict gender roles, heteronormative notions of dating and marriage, and traditional ideas of masculinity. In “People Who Talk to Stuffed Animals Are Nice” we follow Nanamori, a college student who is disenchanted by other men’s braggadocio attitudes towards women, from their crass banter to the way they objectify women and belittle men who are to whatever degree ‘atypical’. Nanamori longs for a more genderless society, and he finds solace in one of his college clubs, a judgment-free place where students talk to plushies for emotional support. Nanamori continues to feel guilty by association when it comes to his peer’s sexist and/or homophobic behavior, and he struggles with his own desire to ‘fit’ in. Throughout the novella, the narrative also explores his confusion when it comes to separating friendship from romance. In “Hello, Thank You I’m Okay” a shut-in young man delights his family when he announces that he is planning to invite his new friends over to his birthday party. When the time comes, his mother and sister realize that his friends are not exactly part of the ‘material’ world. Yet, not wanting to hurt his feelings, they play along and soon find themselves believing in their existence. The other two stories in this collection are more forgettable, not quite as funny or touching as the titular novella or “Hello, Thank You I’m Okay”. Still, it was an insightful collection that gives readers a glimpse into contemporary Japan and the different perspectives of young(ish) people questioning and pushing back against tradition. The translation was good, but some scenes/descriptions could have benefited from some added clarity. For instance, we have this scene where a character comes up with a fake name, “Kotori”, after seeing a bird outside the window, but unless you know that bird is “tori” in Japanese her name seems very random. Nevertheless, the unadorned writing style is very easy to read. I liked this collection well enough. The stories, while slightly humorous, are grounded in everyday reality. The characters are not particularly fleshed out but we gain an understanding of their perspectives. The narratives are focused on exploring certain issues and they succeed in doing that. I appreciated the author’s sensitivity and that he allows characters to change their mind and/or question their own opinions and beliefs. I would definitely check out more of his work. If you are looking for an easy yet thoughtful read, look no further....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 06, 2024","Jan 08, 2024","Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61102604-people-who-talk-to-stuffed-animals-are-nice

I hate to dnf a book so far in, but I can tell that my feelings for Memory Piece won't change. I'm not drawn to the writing, which is passive, heavily reliant on telling rather than showing, and at times impersonal (not restrained in the way Jhumpa Lahiri's is, but more generic).The first section of the novel follows Giselle, who aspires to become a performance artist. While the novel appears to articulate why she wants to do this, it doesn't convincingly or deeply explore her motivations, let alone why she chooses to express her creativity through these performance pieces. We're presented with shallow artspeak that could easily have been lifted from artybollocks. Ko's portrayal of New York and its artsy milieu lacks the bite, or even substance, of say Ottessa Moshfegh or Rachel Lyon. One of Giselle’s pieces had the potential for further exploration, but the narrative summarises it in a couple of dull paragraphs.There's a lot of this: periods of Giselle's life are condensed to a few sentences, or at most a couple of paragraphs. While this may allow the author to cover longer periods of time concisely, it comes at the expense of establishing Giselle's character, her arc, her relationships, and her various environments. It seemed to me as if Ko was cramming too much into too little space.The novel also heavily relies on 80s/90s nostalgia, which is fine, but not when we learn more about certain trends than about the impact of AIDS, which is reduced to an afterthought in a paragraph mentioning that the 'hippie-grunge thing was over'. This felt glib to me. The few episodes we are actually 'shown' seem to exist solely to make a point, such as when a woman asks Giselle to walk with her, leading Giselle to make a banal observation on the matter (which felt wholly unnecessary given the novel’s target audience…).Not only were Giselle’s pieces pretentious, but they also served to consolidate my negative impression of performance art. Her art seemed to lack depth, as if she was merely selecting the most extra thing to do without much thought behind her choices (as profound as ai art). Yet, I am supposed to find her and her art intriguing? Sure…There is nothing subtle about Ko's storytelling, and I mostly felt detached, if occasionally irritated by the content of her story. I wish I could have liked this novel, but it wasn't meant to be. If you enjoy book-clubby books, this might be right up your street. Or, if you were a fan of Zevin's bestseller, do not give this one a miss....more",Notes are private!,0,12,0,not set,not set,"Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/193759650-memory-piece

Takako, our central character, is no longer able to keep working at her company after her supposed boyfriend informs her, very casually, that he is actually going to marry someone else. She's thrown off kilter and soon finds it impossible to keep on working. More depressed than ever, Takako's days of listlessness are interrupted by a call from her eccentric uncle, whom she hadn't kept in contact with. He offers her a place to stay, rent-free, in exchange for helping out at his second-hand bookshop. She reluctantly agrees, but to begin with, has no interest in the place or its contents. Eventually, she learns to love literature and the bookshop, breaking free of her post-breakup apathy. Turns out her uncle is a nice guy and so is that cantankerous regular customer! Good times ensue and Takako not only gets better but learns valuable life lessons along the way. And I guess this could have just been a Hallmark-y, inoffensive, vanilla book about learning to love books and unexpected friendships and not judging people based on first impressions but we get a whole storyline involving Takako's aunt that veered straight into the mawkish. Worst, her story is moralistic, and punitive even, as (view spoiler)[we learn that the aunt left Takako's uncle because they are unable to conceive, a fact that the narrative implies to be a consequence of her having had an abortion. So now of course she blames herself...but 'confessing' this to Takako helps her to begin forgiving herself... (hide spoiler)]. I'm afraid that the way this issue is handled, as well as the platitudes that come to the surface during the conversations between the aunt & Takako, came across as clichéd, icky even. Needless to say, I was unsurprised to see that this book had been written by a man. As with any other  of mine, I feel the need to remind whoever is reading this that what they have just read is entirely subjective and that my not liking a book should not stop you from giving it a try....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Dec 14, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Dec 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62047992-days-at-the-morisaki-bookshop

Sure, in the long run, A Love SongA Love Song for Ricki Wilde is an entertaining novel that will definitely appeal to fans of the fated lovers trope. Sure, in the long run, A Love Song for Ricki Wilde proved to be a tad too cheesy and smutty for my taste, but I still had a good time reading it. Tia Williams’ sense of humor shines front and center here as the story has plenty of funny one-liners (“you sentient Buddha statue from Urban Outfitters”), witty banter, clever descriptions, one-liners and comical scenarios and side-characters. At times the humour element did feel a bit too entrenched in internet humor, and some of the references felt already ‘dated’. The novel’s opening has a modern fairy tale feel to it as we are introduced to the Wilde family, who own a funeral enterprise. The youngest daughter Ricki is not particularly interested in her family’s business, nor does she want to emulate her older sisters’ socialite lifestyle. She’s a free spirit who is far more artistic and less materialistic than the rest of her family. Ricki decides to follow her dreams and sets up her own flower shop in a brownstone in Harlem. There she connects with the owner of the brownstone, widowed nonagenarian Ms. Della, who is busy fluffing her own bucket list. Ricki also makes her first real friend, Tuesday, a former child-actor who is in many ways her kindred spirit. As Ricki struggles to find the right business model for her shop, she happens to come across a mysterious musician who, despite their clear chemistry, is not keen on getting to know her, going as far as to ask her to leave Harlem. We also get chapters transporting us back to the Harlem Renaissance, in which follow a young man who shares a lot in common with Ricki’s mystery man. The book is certainly self-aware in its approach to certain tropes. And in some ways, it succeeds in poking fun at the whole supernatural romance that is has going on…but then the storyline takes way too long to reveal something that most readers will have already figured out from the very start. Why else would we get chapters transporting us back to the roaring 20s? The shift in tone was jarring, as we go from Ricki’s fairly humorous escapades to a character who has endured so much trauma. And I guess I ultimately did not buy into this guy. The story does try to provide a rationale for his inconsistent knowledge of the modern world, but it wasn’t enough to make me believe in this guy. The more you think about his reaction and behavior upon seeing Ricki, the more you realize that, in spite of having ample time to prepare or devise a strategy to escape his fate, the guy decides to say the type of things that would inevitably backfire. Saying mysterious things, acting weird around the FL, and so on. It was giving Robert Pattinson, and in the year 2024, that kind of shit comes across as a huge red flag. Ricki’s bestie Tuesday seems the only ‘sane’ one, but then proceeds to be conveniently won over by him once the whole supernatural thing is explained to her. Ironically enough, for a novel with the words ""Love Song"" in it, that does primarily focuses on romance, romance was the thing that worked the least (for me obviously). It was just too cheesy: “And, God help her, there it was: Ricki was drawn to this secret tragedy of Ezra, the mystery, the tangible sadness. His unknowable depths.”I liked Ricki’s new eccentric friends, and I would have much rather read about her bond with them than her insta-love with mystery man. Ricki’s family had potential, but they ended up being relegated to the role of minor villains. I found a certain cameo to be quite unnecessary but even more cringey were those sex scenes (that poor piano…). Overall, A Love Song for Ricki Wilde was a bit of a mixed bag for me. While I liked the chaotic energy of Williams’ characters, as well as her engaging storytelling and humor, the romance and plot failed to win me over....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Dec 25, 2023","Dec 29, 2023","Nov 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/173404023-a-love-song-for-ricki-wilde

The ‘quirky’ tone and the use of absurdist and surreal elements felt almost formulaic as if Chung was following a checklist or creative writing prompts rather than genuine narrative experiences rather than genuinely experimenting with her storytelling. The choice of the opening story was particularly baffling; it’s basically a series of instructions, not a story at all. To place this as your ‘opener’...it’s an odd choice. It was almost off-putting in a way. Usually collections like these open with a banger (and then fizzle out). But still, I moved past it hoping that the following stories would at least deliver on the themes promised by its summary. Sadly, they didn’t. Not only did they lack substance, but the style they prioritized felt derivative and not particularly compelling. Characters fail to register their presence on the page, and the story’s ‘quirks’ were entirely gimmicky. The only truly memorable one was the story about an amorphic praying mantis, but this story is really cut short and doesn’t really do anything (thematically or stylistically). They just washed over me. Neither bad, nor good, but certainly surface-level and forgettable. This is a pity as they promised to blend real-life struggles, specifically of Korean American women, with fantastical elements. However, I found the author’s exploration of bodies, desires, and memories to be tedious. While I didn't love Chung's debut, it had an earnestness that I couldn't help but admire. In comparison, Green Frog feels rather contrived.

The ambitioDixon, Descending is a thought-provoking debut novel, weaving a compelling narrative that is unfortunately undermined by uneven execution. The ambitious scope of the novel mirrors the monumental challenge at its core—the summit of Mount Everest by two brothers—providing a backdrop for a tale of survival and guilt, choices and their repercussions, forgiveness and recovery. The novel’s central character is Dixon, a former Olympic-level runner who, having narrowly missed making the team, has since avoided letting himself be consumed by a singular goal. Now a school psychologist, Dixon becomes involved in a tricky bullying case. Dixon feels personally connected as he is fond of the victim, Marcus, a boy who truly looks up to him. Dixon attempts to set aside his own anger towards Shiloh, the bully, and intervenes, but his efforts backfire, leading to an escalation of the bullying. Feeling increasingly on edge, Dixon finds himself yielding to Nate, his charismatic older brother, when the latter proposes a daring endeavour - to ‘conquer’ Mount Everest and become the first Black American men to do so. This audacious feat sparks something in Dixon, who, for the first time in years, becomes wholly absorbed by something. Preceding Mount Everest, the two brothers have a lot of training to do, and Dixon soon finds himself being the one to push his brother Nate onwards. Despite the dissent from their loved ones, the two brothers travel to Mount Everest. Along the way, they encounter many other climbers and find themselves confronted by the strange hierarchies operating in the ‘climbing’ world. However prepared they feel, a string of disasters has tragic consequences for the brothers.Much of the novel delves into the aftermath of the climb. Ravaged by Mount Everest, Dixon is guilt-ridden and grief-stricken. His decision to return to work proves to be a terrible idea, resulting in him finally losing control at Shiloh. Things take a turn for the worse, and now Dixon is even more tormented by how he handled the bullying case. The Dixon we encounter in these pages is barely holding on, with Mount Everest still looming over him.Through Dixon’s journey, the novel explores the consequences of life-altering decisions. Not only does Dixon experience survivor’s guilt, but he also finds himself losing sight of the kind of person he was, is, and wants to be. Dixon undergoes a transformative odyssey, grappling with the haunting echoes of his past choices.Despite the novel’s exploration of Dixon's internal and external struggles, the narrative doesn’t always deliver emotional depth. A more introspective narrative would have provided a more in-depth character analysis. The before and after timelines also don’t always gel well, with the bullying storylines sometimes feeling as if from a different book. It didn’t help that Dixon is a character lacking in ‘history,’ that is, we learn virtually nothing about his and Nate’s childhood, and throughout the narrative, I kept forgetting that Dixon is divorced and has a child. The ex-wife and his daughter have no impact whatsoever on his character or his story. Sure, sometimes this contributes to the characterization of a character, say, someone who is entirely self-involved and unreliable, with little interest in his family, etc. But Dixon is presented as someone who should care. The narrative establishes and critiques the dichotomy between the brothers, with Dixon playing the role of the reliable, ‘good’ brother, while Nate is the carefree, wildcard, ‘bad’ brother. Extended flashbacks into their childhood and young adulthood, and their relationship with the rest of their family would have made for a more nuanced portrayal of their bond. Nate serves the role of foil to Dixon, and because of this he never really comes into his own as a character. His behavior during the climb, particularly in the final stages, appears somewhat overdramatized. Sure, we can attribute some of his actions to their extenuating circumstances, but there are moments where his dialogue seems inconsistent and forced, designed more for dramatic effect.Having greater insight into Dixon’s professional life before the climb would have added depth to his character. Following the physical and emotional traumas he experienced, it's understandable that maintaining professionalism becomes challenging, especially in the face of provocation from Shiloh. However, Dixon doesn't exhibit many of the traits and knowledge one might expect from someone who finds fulfillment as a school psychologist. While he questions Shiloh's actions, he fails to consider the possible underlying issues that have shaped Shiloh's behavior. It's only towards the end of the novel that he starts to ‘contextualize’ some aspects of Shiloh's personality. I did appreciate that the novel doesn’t merely go for a cause-and-effect approach when it comes to exploring abuse, violence, and trauma.Still, a more thorough exploration of the bond between Dixon and Marcus would have contributed to Dixon's authenticity as a school psychologist. At times, it felt as if Dixon's role as a school psychologist was primarily a plot device to incorporate the Marcus/Shiloh storyline. Yet, it might have been more convincing for Dixon to be a teacher, considering his surprising lack of awareness regarding mental health throughout the novel. This adjustment would have aligned better with the portrayal of his character and the challenges he faces in understanding and addressing the complexities of his students' psychological issues.The chapters transporting us back to Mount Everest were certainly immersive and succeeded in giving us a glimpse into the kind of people driven by ambition and hubris, leading them to court danger in pursuit of greatness. Sadly, these sections feature a female character who seems to have been included merely to underline the dynamic between the brothers (why she chooses to have a fling with Nate over Dixon). She is the type of one-dimensional female character I usually encounter in male-authored fiction, so I was disappointed to find her here….Nevertheless, despite these criticisms, I found the novel engrossing. Dixon, Descending would make for a solid book club choice, as it certainly succeeds in challenging readers' notions of right and wrong, the extent of forgiveness, and whether renewal and hope are and should always be possible....more",Notes are private!,1,21,1,"Feb 07, 2024","Feb 11, 2024","Sep 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/154488337-dixon-descending

Yet, the novel seems to operate under the belief that it is self-aware, even 'smart,' in its usage of tropes. Take, for instance, a scene where Anna, our mc, sees a figure inside the house and knows she's not 'seeing things' because “she understood angles, perspective. This shape was inside the house.” We also get creepy children, and Anna realizes only later that said children are not her nieces because they are speaking in Italian...all of this happens way too early on. Thorne is spoon-feeding us the horror instead of letting it simmer. While I understand that haunted houses/places have been thoroughly explored in the horror genre, Thorne fails to build suspense, relying instead on a series of very 101 horror elements/scenes. Sometimes, making your characters aware of a place’s wrongness from the get-go can work, but Thorne is no Jackson and lacks the skill to pull this off (in the first pages, we get a trite horror line: “Someone’s in here, Anna thought. Listening.”).And the characters, oh, where do I begin? This type of obnoxious rich American family is everywhere in the media, and despite the promises of satirical depth, Thorne's take on the wealthy is as shallow as a puddle. The so-called ""black sheep"" protagonist, supposedly 'real' and unlike the rest of her shallow family, is banal, devoid of any real substance. Certainly, she does not make for a convincing problem child nor is she as interesting/relatable a figure as the narrative wants us to believe.My biggest issue lies with the author's portrayal of Italy and her usage of the Italian language. It's baffling how little effort was put into researching or consulting actual Italians (yes, ideally more than one) for authenticity. What is it with American authors doing the bare minimum research when setting books abroad? At least consult a few people from the country/culture you are intent on representing your book in before you start writing nonsense or just piling on the stereotypes...→ Thorne, I don't know who told you that ""molto bene"" is used in the way you think it's used, but they did you wrong (“She hit the galleries on Friday. L’Accademia. The Uffizi. Molto bene. Overwhelming in the best way.”...?)→ The protagonist tells us that her Italian 'accent' is good (“Her actual facility with Italian wasn’t nearly as good as her accent.”) when surely it should be pronunciation?→ A few pages in and we already have stereotypes such as Italians being bad drivers, and Italian men being don juans (leering at women/making inappropriate advances)→ The description of the villa tries hard to convey an understanding of architecture and interior design but it comes across as name-dropping (“alfresco dining”...). Sure, the narrative tries to be sort of self-aware, as the villa is described as “[M]ore Epcot Italy than the real thing”, but it ultimately fails to pull this off as it immediately flexes its art history knowledge: “And yet there was something idiosyncratic about Villa Taccola. The whole house suggested pentimenti,”. And I failed to be amused by a bathroom being described as “you know, a bathroom—” (why bother including this? is this a house tour? 75 questions with vogue?). Thorne's grasp of Italian art and architecture consists of an overuse of the term ""Romanesque"".→ And let's not forget the baffling detail of Anna serving herself a ""cold prosecco"" – because apparently, warm and/or room temperature prosecco is a common occurrence for this moneyed woman who claims to be an enthusiast of Italian culture.→ Anna's Italian is so good supposedly that when she goes for a drink in a restaurant, she is given an Italian menu (her companions are given English menus)...I do not believe that for a second. Saying a few words in Italian won't magically make Italians give you an Italian menu. I don't get given Italian menus. The waitress somehow compliments her on her translation skills (“Anna translated for the others as best she could, rewarded with a “molto bene” and a wink from the waitress, ”)...but how would she know whether Anna's translation was good or not if she spoke little/no English? And if she did speak English she would not be talking in Italian to Anna, despite the latter (claiming) to know enough Italian to get by.→ We have a scene of Anna, her brother, Benny, and his bf going into ‘Monteperso’ and passing a tabaccheria/BAR with “four sour-faced Italian men of indeterminate age leaning on the building and smoking cigarettes, seemingly in silence. They all turned to stare at the car as it approached, unsmiling. Benny gave a neighborly wave. They didn’t react. Not even to shift weight.”; 1st of all, if there are no tables outside, would they really be standing outside a tabaccheria to smoke? They would go to a bar with tables outside or a bench or whatever. Also, they would definitely be talking to each other. 2ndly, they wouldn’t be so blank-faced. if anything, if it's an area with little tourism, the locals would look puzzled by the sight of tourists/non-locals; the only instances where they would look more antagonistic is if the tourists in question were to be POC (but Anna & co are white so...here it makes 0 sense other than going for that 'there be strangers' horror trope); 3rdly…waving? What the fuck do you expect? For these elderly men to wave back? When I worked in Venice, I found waving tourists obnoxious, often they seemed uncaring of their surroundings (pushing people aside or getting too close to others), and excepted what…the locals to entertain them? Is this a zoo? An amusement park? Do the locals 'owe' you anything?→ And don't even get me started on the overuse of ""pentimento"". It reminds me of how people (especially dabblers of artspeak) like to misuse/overuse 'chiaroscuro'. I understand that the word pentimento sounds cool to non-Italians, and the whole concept will certainly have an ‘edge’, but goodness me don't use it as a metaphor to describe things that have nothing to do with it. Sure, you can use art terms as metaphors for other things, but here, Thorne does it so much it just comes across as obnoxious, and especially ridiculous to an Italian speaker....more",Notes are private!,3,17,0,not set,not set,"Sep 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/126918202-diavola

Fruit of the Dead feels like a misfire. despite the opportunity to breathe new life into the Persephone myth, lyon doesn't venture outside conventional boundaries. not only i craved a more daring and imaginative reinterpretation of this myth but i found myself bored and uninterested by the unfolding events. sure, lyon's prose is as dazzling and self-assured as in her debut, but prose alone doesn't suffice.if you happen to be interested in this novel i recommend you check out more positive s....more",Notes are private!,0,34,0,not set,not set,"Sep 05, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/181855910-fruit-of-the-dead

Sulky, prickly, and painfully hyper-visible, our every movement is tracked by a set of watchful guardians eager to land the next rage-inducing viral headline. […] One of the few things associated with millennials to have received a positive public reception is a particular form of millennial art. This art revolves around an archetypical Young Millennial Woman – pretty, white, cisgender, and tortured enough to be interesting but not enough to be repulsive. Often described as ‘relatable,’ she is, in actuality, not.""Or Emmeline Clein in ‘From Fleabag to Persuasion, the Rise of the Mussy-Haired, Self-Hating Sarcasm Machine’:""A single woman is drinking alone, crying over a man. […] These days, she’s sobbing in a bathtub, wallowing in her romantic regrets. Luckily, she still has her incisive eye and sarcastic tongue. Narrating in voiceover, our heroine begins telling us her romantic history, why she’s crying, and we’re meant to laugh.""I'm rather weary of these Fleabag-esque female characters. Like, ha, here we go again : [insert twenty-something messy mc whose inner monologue consists of endless quirky one liners making fun of herself, of course she's self-deprecating, and others, she can barely make herself a cup of coffee let alone carry out normal interactions with others without making things weird cause she's just like that and falling for a guy who is emotionally unavailable, but then again so is she]. I'm tired of these books featuring these 'relatable' yet (supposedly) 'unlikeable' female characters who are mired by their own ennui, unable to adjust to adulthood, or to do the things people their age seem to do. The narrator here is someone whose voice is so generic as to be perfectly unmemorable. Her quirkiness and inner monologue feel derivative, painfully so. The book tries and fails to be self-aware ('wink-wink') as it goes on to depict a tired dynamic between a young woman and a married man...alas this is no Luster.

To borrow, once again, LadyA freewheeling, off-beat, and relentlessly chaotic read, Candelaria is a rhizomatic novel that defies easy categorisation. To borrow, once again, Lady Gaga’s words: “talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it”. Populated by bizarre characters (prone to huge leaps of logic, maundering, and dissociating from the fucked-up things that come their way), absurdist elements, and weird, sometimes gross, horror-like scenarios, Candelaria is the type of book that might make one feel that they can't make head or tail of what they are reading. Yet, I found myself wholly captivated by Melissa Lozada-Oliva’s playful dark humor and by her irresistibly irreverent social commentary. I was equal parts appalled and delighted by her characters’ tribulations. Their behaviors and responses to the small and large-scale catastrophes that come their way often verge on the surreal, reminding me very much of authors like Helen Oyeyemi, Kevin Wilson, and Ling Ma. The novel’s opening is hectic enough. Through a 2nd pov we follow Candelaria, “you”, whose daily routine is interrupted by a devastating earthquake. Her surprisingly violent response to this event is in many ways more alarming than the earthquake itself, yet, the use of the 2nd pov keeps her motivations at arm's lengths from us. We know only that for whatever reason Candelaria sets out across Boston, her destination the Watertown Mall Old Country Buffet. Undeterred by the progressively apocalyptic obstacles in her path, Candelaria is determined to reach the Buffet, a place that, somehow, is connected to the ongoing chaos around her.The novel switches between Candelaria’s ‘present’ journey to the events that lead to it. Here we meet her three granddaughters, as overwhelmed as they are overwhelming, each far too wrapped up by her own drama to realize that the weird shit happening to each one of them is connected. There is archaeologist Bianca, who is plenty book-smart but lacks self-awareness, her cold, brusque even, demeanour often sees her (in)voluntarily pushing others away. Having long been forced into the role of the reliable daughter/sister/granddaughter, she’s at a low point in her life and has just been duped & dumped by her advisor who kicked her off of her own dig back in Guatemala. Her life work in jeopardy, Bianca is licking her wounds back in Boston, where, mired by self-pity, she spends most of her time whining to her (far too) understanding housemate. We then have Candy, the youngest, who, despite her name, is brazen and mean. Candy is a recovering addict whose self-destructive antics have often been a concern in the family. A film aficionado, Candy now works at a cinema. She’s brash, extremely self-centred, and rarely thinks things true. Her attitude to life is seemingly blasé yet after she and Bianca fall out, we can see how bothered she is by it. She discovers that is pregnant after a one-night stand with a mysterious man, whose disappearance was as strange as his appearance. Worst still, her pregnancy seems to have worrisome, monstrous, side effects. And last we have Paola, newly returned to Boston having been missing for over a decade. This new Paola goes by Zoe, and has become a devout member of a cultish wellness center. Having reinvented herself, Zoe is not interested in reuniting with her family, whom she’d run away from so many years before.Throughout the novel, Lozada-Oliva plays around with so many tropes and genres that one might struggle to keep up. Often we seemingly lose sight of the plot, distracted by whatever latest bizarre thing is happening on the page (be it brainwashing, cannibalism, or the end of the world). A series of grotty, horrifying, and baffling events puncture the sisters’ seemingly disparate storylines, but, these scenarios are depicted in such an energetic way that one might, like the characters themselves, overlook the magnitude of what has happened/is happening. Lozada-Oliva's characters and their circumstances are entrenched in the absurd, at times verging on the hysterical. Yet, the humorous and grotesque elements don’t take away from Lozada-Oliva’s social commentary nor do they make the characters less humane. The narrative may poke fun at the characters but not their struggles or desires. The novel’s gritty commentary on contemporary American politics is balanced by an empathetic yet incisive portrayal of the interplay between diasporic identity and generational trauma. Family is at the heart of Candelaria, even if the sisters’ attempts at belonging, at achieving happiness and success, see them hurtling into and out of each other’s paths. I liked how the novel allows for these types of flawed characters and sisterhood to take the centrestage, showing the complex layers beneath each sister and allowing for nuance in their love/hate bond. The novel’s foray into the horror genre is particularly effective as it allows for an uncompromising examination of bodily autonomy, female monstrosity, thorny family histories, and the hunger to belong. Lozada-Oliva's approach to horror made me think simultaneously of two very different films, Julia Ducournau’s Titane and Jim Jarmusch's The Dead Don't Die, as well as Stephen Graham Jones' adrenaline-fueled horror novels (in particular My Heart is a Chainsaw).This novel is a riot, and I was wholly wholly engrossed and invested in the ongoing chaos. There were some aspects that I wish could have been tweaked slightly (the reunion is too long delayed, several storylines are left unresolved, and i could have done without the offing of a certain character). Still, given its scope, those minor flaws hardly made a dent in my reading experience. I loved Lozada-Oliva’s punchy prose, her fucked-up sort of humor, and her messed-up characters. I can definitely see this appealing to fans of Helen Oyeyemi, Kevin Wilson, Hilary Leichter, and Ling Ma, as well as to readers who enjoyed Samanta Schweblin's bizarre short stories, An Yu's murky brand of surrealism, Sam Cohen's madcap stories in Sarahland, Candas Jane Dorsey's tongue-in-cheek postmodern murder-mystery, The Adventures of Isabel , Pizza Girl by Jean Kyoung Frazier, or the realistically dysfunctional family dynamics depicted by authors like Angie Cruz and Eden Robinson. Lozada-Oliva delivers a high-octane genre-bending read that sucked me into its nonsensical, uninhibited, funny, and gross vortex. I can't wait to read it again and look forward to reading more by Lozada-Oliva....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Dec 28, 2023","Dec 30, 2023","Aug 28, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/123650295-candelaria

I thought it would have a much darker tone, given the book's revenge tale premise. But inPerhaps I approached The Fox Wife with the wrong exceptions. I thought it would have a much darker tone, given the book's revenge tale premise. But in The Fox Wife the revenge storyline seems like an afterthought, and it often faded into the background. Much of the novel reads like a series of humorous misadventures, recounted to us in a conversational, ‘confessional’ almost, style (with lots of ""anyways"" and ""i told yous""). Yet, it never fully leans into the satire, and there are several moments that are meant to be dramatic, but these are depicted in a way that doesn’t quite deliver on the pathos, the end result is that the book suffers from a confused identity, neither a fantasy of manners a la Zen Cho, nor a more tantalizing Catherynne M. Valente type of fairytale-esque affair.  The majority of the novel takes place in Manchuria in 1908 with chapters alternating between a female fox, posing as a young human woman by the name of Ah San, and Bao, an old detective who is able to discern truth from falsehood. The fox chapters are heavy with exposition, and she repeatedly goes over the same information or feels the need to explain things to us. While I understand that this was somewhat necessary given the novel’s historical setting, I wish that the world-building could have relied less on the fox’s ‘telling’. She is after Bektu Nikan, the man responsible for her cub’s death, and to learn more about his whereabouts she finds employment as a maid. The grandmother of the family is worried that her grandson, Bohai, the only son of the family, will fall to the family’s curse (the eldest sons die before they reach 24). Bohai and his loser friends have become close to a mysterious and charismatic stranger, Shiro, someone known to our fox. The fox’s quest is seemingly lost in favor of setting up this rather drawn-out storyline involving Bohai&co dealings with Shiro. Eventually, they find themselves in Japan where we encounter with yet another mysterious stranger, who is actually not a stranger to our fox. These two male characters left such non-impressions on me. They have little to no chemistry with our main protagonist, and their few interactions aren’t thrilling (nor do they make you wonder what exactly they mean to one another). This retaining of information does little in terms of creating suspense, maybe because the reveals themselves feel so predictable, maybe because this retention of information goes against our narrator’s conversational confessional style. Surprisingly enough I was more interested in the detective’s chapters. Sadly Bao is so many steps behind that whenever he learns more about these fox rumors it feels like old news. I wish his storyline hadn’t felt so behind the main one. I liked learning more about childhood and his gift and I wish that the story had focused on him and his childhood friend. The story felt a bit too vanilla, childish even. Which is a pity as there was potential to go for a more ambivalent type of tale, especially when it came to the foxes. They were the perfect candidates for morally ambiguous types of characters. Yet, our central character feels simultaneously naive and like a busybody old maid (she was giving miss marple). Her narration is less clever than trite. She's prone to truism and unnecessary asides (""I’ve told you before that every action has an equal opposite reaction""). Maybe this will work for some readers but I found her to be an inconsistent and not particularly charming nor alluring character. There were so many instances where I wanted her to act differently, especially given how she goes on and on about foxes’ special abilities. Her revenge...was very anticlimactic, and even here Choo plays it safe. Worst still, we learn virtually nothing about her cub or her life before. This made her into a rather surface-character, who is there to give us the dos and don'ts of being a fox and interacting with humans. The novel's initial set-up is intriguing but the story felt surprisingly directionless and lacking in momentum. Still, this is probably Choo's best (so far)....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 18, 2024","Jan 22, 2024","Aug 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127278666-the-fox-wife

Disclaimer: The  below is negative and ranty. If you happen to have liked this noveReid’s latest novel is a disappointingly wishy-washy affair. Disclaimer: The  below is negative and ranty. If you happen to have liked this novel or are looking forward to reading it I recommend you give my  a wide berth.The feeling of being invested in their lives, it was thrilling and terrible.Reading Come and Get It was akin to waiting for a train that is delayed, so you sit there waiting and waiting, cycling between frustration, hope, and scepticism as the delayed time continues to increase. After hours, or what it feels like hours given your now woolly perception of time, an announcement informs you that your train has been cancelled.This is a roundabout way to say that while reading Come and Get It I kept waiting, anticipating really, for something to happen. Sure, some of my favorite books are plotless, that is, rather meandering in nature. Take Elife Batuman's The Idiot, which like Come and Get It hones in on campus/college life. That book is exceedingly digressive and resists traditional narrative arcs (of conflict and resolution). Yet, I found the novel's sardonic tone and realistically absurd dialogues to be deeply entertaining. But the narrative of Come and Get It seems to operate under the belief that it is providing a story with more dramatic elements, suspense even. As we switch between the novel’s three central figures, I was waiting for the atmosphere of subtle yet present unease (established by that very first chapter and later on compounded by the various character dynamics), to actualize into something more substantial, but it never did! There are a couple of plot points that the characters treat as being pivotal, or as a source of drama, but were actually deeply anticlimactic. The narrative ascribes far too much weight to these two pranks, which were actually just cringe and superfluous. The characters remain one-note, and as with her debut, Reid focuses way too much time on giving page space to deliberately obnoxious and oblivious characters, and doing very little with the person who should have been the novel’s central character (whose characterization can be essentially boiled down to bland yet ‘nice’). The novel seems to promise something dramatic, but nothing ever does. Compared to authors like Brandon Taylor, Ottessa Moshfegh, and Danzy Senna, Reid’s social satire feels tame, and shallow. The novel lacks bite, as it fails to really sink its teeth in its (supposed) themes: from the interplay between race, class, and sexuality, to present us with an uncomfortable close-up of privilege, or to consider how it feels to be a young adult in late-capitalist America. Yet it seems under the assumption that it is this witty and razor-sharp ‘tell-all’ of college life. The novel suffers from a confused identity, it doesn’t know whether it wants to be a satire about an insufferable group of people (think the white lotus or bodies bodies bodies), or a more realistic and earnest portrayal of campus life and (young) adulthood. The novel’s undecided nature made me lose interest in what I was reading and I found myself wishing that the story would either commit to being a parody (a la libba bray's beauty queens) or take a more hyper-realistic approach to college novel (from batuman's aloof duology, to martin chelsea's understated tell me i'm an artist or taylor’s anxiety-inducing real life).Throughout the novel, which takes place for the most part in the University of Arkansas in 2017-18 (why specify the year when said year bears little weight on the story?), we follow three characters, Millie, Agatha, and Kennedy, who don’t seem like they should belong to the same book. Kennedy was an incredibly derivative take of the 'dumb-blonde' characters like Glee's Brittany, Mean Girls's Karen, or Tiara from Bray's Beauty Queens. Her character would not be out of place in a novel by Moshfegh, Jen Beagin, or Mona Awad (but even then she would be ‘effective’ only as a cameo) or in a campy satirical comedy like Bottoms, Heathers, or Theater Camp…but here she feels out of place. Her ‘arc’, if we can call it that, is risible, as we are expected to care about her internal struggles when said struggles are worded in a way that makes them and her by extension appear idiotic. Her sections feature way too many flashbacks about her bond with her mum-cum-bff, same-y scenes about her wanting to make friends but not being able to, leaving crusty plates in the shared kitchen and feeling ‘attacked’ because her roommates aren’t keen on her industrial quantities of 'childish' stuff, and mentioning that she feels some type of way about Agatha’s book (her exact feelings towards this book are for the longest time never delved into and tbh the way she thinks this book ‘saved’ her felt like a reach given the way her character is depicted as being).We have Agatha, a white lesbian visiting professor in her late 30s who comprises several ethical codes to listen in on the conversations between a trio of besties who spend their time in the college's residence hall. She finds their in-jokes and ways of expressing themselves compelling despite or maybe because they are incredibly vapid, materialistic, and unimaginatively problematic. She keeps going on and on about how interesting their attitude towards money is, yet beyond establishing how unaware of their own privilege these girls are, the narrative doesn’t reveal anything particularly insightful on this subject matter. And yet we are meant to believe that Agatha’s piece on them is a hit and that readers love it. I mean, in this day and age, when plenty of content where people ‘tell’ on themselves on social media…and the things these girls talk about are banal and unfunny. Ironically enough Agatha herself complains during a scene about ""hat[ing] stories like this—Getting-There Stories. It was like someone talking about their dreams. They were only interesting to the person they'd happened to."" Well, I can say the same about this trio's exchanges, as their banter and gossip did not interest me one bit. One of them, the trio's 'alpha', really wants a dog and thinks it's funny to pull puerile pranks with problematic undercurrents. They are a rather entitled and grating bunch, the caricature of what the collective imagination tends to think of American girls, but even if we accept them as caricatures, they just weren’t that fun. I’d rather watch a clip from an episode of The Simple Life, which is guaranteed to be appealing yet entertaining. Agatha's wonderment at the girls’ ‘modern’ lingo, is rather hard to digest given that she has not been living in a bubble (she interviewed people for her previous books and is a professor and therefore must have been in contact with other young people before coming across this trio). That chapter early on relationship with her ex had some sort of promise, as here Reid is able to give readers a convincing overview of their relationship. Their break-up felt realistic as Reid shows how their age and wage gap, as well as their different values and priorities, slowly begin to sour their domestic life. But then the rest of the chapters that focus on Agatha do not really provide any new insights into her psyche. Despite being aware of the murky morals of writing about a group of (much younger) people without their consent (not only does she exaggerate their flaws but she takes all sorts of liberties when recounting their histories and words), she keeps doing it because it’s just so damn fascinating (it's anything but) to hear these girls talk. Agatha's choices in the latter of the novel seemed unconvincing given that there was really nothing in her previous chapters that indicated that she would be the type of person to go ahead and do what she did. It also made me rather disappointed by the light in which her sexuality is cast…We then have Millie, a 24-year-old Black student and RA who, similarly to Agatha, had a very promising chapter early on, as we learn about how she took time out of college to go back home so she could be close to her mum. I actually loved (yes loved) how the narrative describes their time together, and how their bond with each other is conveyed. It felt true-to-life and it promised a story with some emotional beats to it. But then Millie’s storyline ends up completely focusing on how she wants to buy a house (mais pourquoi ?!), and how compared to every other RA she doesn't/can't take this job lightly, and that she is a Nice Person. Nice she may be but give us something else to work with. I can relate to and believe in characters who are passive, especially in scenes of conflict or when dealing with microaggressions (like in win me something and luster), but Millie isn’t even particularly passive, she is just happens to be ""there"". Her chapters reveal little about who she is, and I found myself wanting for her chapters to reveal something more than her surface-level kindness. We are led to believe that she develops a crush on 2 characters (characters she has 0 chemistry with) combined with the ‘pranks’ (which again, were both pathetic and bathetic) and her quest for a house, see her adopting a more careless towards attitude towards her role as the residence hall's RA. The ‘consequences’ of this felt dramatic, in an unearned way. There was also something moralistic about her storyline which really didn’t sit well with me. Her being swept up by a romantic tryst and being mildly miffed by the people involved in the prank aimed at her, makes her what, stray from the Good Path…like really? She doesn’t even call out the person responsible for the prank, and yet the fact that she now gives the people involved in this prank a bit of a cold shoulder makes her irresponsible? Bad? Puhlease.Side characters are thinly rendered stereotypes. Reid's older characters were far more convincing than her younger ones, whose words and behaviors ultimately come across as rather affected and cringey. Take Millie's side kicks for instance: the mean lesbian and the sassy gay. As I kept waiting for a dramatic event or exchange to happen, I found myself growing increasingly annoyed by the novel. From the way the characters are portrayed to the flat dialogue. The prose also left something to be desired as it brought to mind authors whose writing I am on the fence about: Sally Rooney, Emily R. Austin, and Naoise Dolan. It sometimes really struck me as generic, impersonal, and unimaginative. We never delve deep into any one issue or theme, and the college setting felt really underutilized, a gimmick, as we don’t learn much about what any of the characters are studying or how they actually feel about their present and future.final thoughts:Come and Get It feels like a missed opportunity. It promises something but never delivers. The three main storylines do not mesh well together, the prose is flat, the characters are underdeveloped, and outside of those first introductory chapters, the narrative is monotonous. There were moments of humor that landed, such as: ""Ryland, I'm kind of emotional,"" Millie said. ""I have lots of emotional experiences in parking lots. I always have.""But these were outweighed by several scenes that are meant to be witty but didn't strike me as particularly clever or new. Reid's satire lacks oomph and her social commentary was neither provocative nor insightful. Even on a purely entertainment level, Come and Get It just did nothing for me. The novel never seems to find its footing, from the pacing to its tone.I swear that wanted to like Come and Get It, and maybe I would have if Reid had structured her novel as a series of interlinked stories, like Taylor does in Filthy Animals. But at the end of the day Come and Get It was something in the realms of Rooney by way of Curtis Sittenfeld, so if you are a fan of either, you might find Reid's latest to be a much more rewarding reading experience than I did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Dec 16, 2023","Dec 21, 2023","Aug 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127482608-come-and-get-it

At first, I liked the novel's chaotic energy and the quirky almost Wes Anderson-esque characters, but, as I read on I found that many scenes just try too hard and for too long to be funny, in a way that didn't quite succeed.While the author does manage to strike a balance between Greta and Valdin's perspectives, their internal monologues at times were too similar ( from them having similar experiences and worries to their vocabulary and thought process) in a way that now and again made it tricky to distinguish whose head we were currently into. I never quite warmed up to Greta, probably because she struck me as the type of messy young woman type of character popularized by Fleabag. While I understand that some people use humor as a shield, a defence mechanism, whatever, she just does it so much that any potentially emotional or vulnerable scenes starring her end up highlighting how quirky she is.I was interested in reading more about the various family dynamics, especially given how chaotic and absurd each family member is, but the narrative seems to speed through most of these types of family scenes in favor of more wacky asides and anecdotes featuring our oddball protagonists. the ending struck me as a bit twee, which was disappointing given the novel's initially wry tone. Still, I would definitely read more from this author and I wouldn't dissuade others from giving this novel a go as it is a delightfully queer and zany read....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Aug 24, 2023","Aug 29, 2023","Aug 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57758746-greta-valdin

This book was meant to make my work commutes better, however, it succeeded in making me look like a total weirdo given all of the grossed-out faces I must have made while I was reading this. I like Kawakami, I usually find her style to be whimsical without lapsing into contrived sentimentality. her storytelling is playful, while her plots and characters often veer into the absurd. 水声, published in Italian as La voce dell'acqua (something along the lines of 'the voice of the water/the water's voice') is tinged by the same melancholic atmosphere that characterises much of Kawakami's oeuvre, as our narrator, Miyako, and her brother, Ryo, move back into their childhood home. Miyako's reflections on the past and the passage of time, certainly add to the overall sense of nostalgia, and I did find myself lulled by her recollections and her insights into her childhood and family dynamics. I also liked the slice-of-life feel given by the narrative's focus on those seemingly mundane interactions and moments that make up everyday life. So there I was, enjoying this book while pretending not to be bothered by the overcrowded tram I was in (one of the many perks when working in venice when living on the mainland) when i n c e s t! I had to re-read that passage several times because it came really out of the left field. and then the novel devolves into this incesty romance that not only felt hugely unnecessary but was surprisingly corny. maybe this is due to Ryo's character, someone whose whole personality could be described as being 'there', or to his scenes with his sister being this weird mix of sappy and icky, but I found their relationship to be little else besides gross. the narrative tip-toes around the taboo nature of their relationship and seems in fact unwilling to confront just how and why their relationship is so 'forbidden' (read: yuck). Not only that but as I read on I was confronted with even more incest making this one of those rare incest² types of incest-y books. If I was depressed before reading this I found myself even more depressed after it (thinking that i'd just wasted my money on it). the thing is, i know that to portray something doesn't mean to endorse said something, and can put up with topics/dynamics in fiction that i find gross/problematic/whatever-else (a couple of my favorite books deal with incest). but if you are going to depict incest, i except some angst, some nuance, something more than whatever wasn't going on here. Even if you, like me, are a fan of Kawakami, I'd advise you to read this one at your discretion (as of now it has yet to be published in english but i'm pretty sure it won't be long till it will be)....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"May 26, 2023",Jun 2023,"Mar 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62673187-la-voce-dell-acqua

Kevin Kwan meets Gossip Girl in this Spotted: Anna K, a high-society darling with a penchant for horses, Newfoundland dogs, and, of course, scandal.  Kevin Kwan meets Gossip Girl in this juicy retelling of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. In Lee’s modern-day adaptation of Tolstoy's classic we follow the drama-filled antics of America’s young and wealthy.  Seventeen-year-old Anna K is the reigning belle of both Manhattan and Greenwich societies. She has it all: an impeccable reputation, a respectable boyfriend, a doting father, an elite education. Until she meets Alexia, aka Count Vronsky, a (supposedly) charismatic playboy unbound by constraints of priority. As sparks ignite and gossip swirls, Anna embarks into a scandalous relationship. Meanwhile, Anna’s brother Steven grapples with the fallout from his unfaithfulness to his girlfriend, Lolly. Lolly’s sister Kimmie, is adjusting to ‘regular’ teen life after an injury cuts her ice dancing career short. She’s also head-over-heels in love with Alexia, much to Steven’s best friend, Dustin, chagrin. Things get even more tricky after a party makes everyone aware of Anna and Alexia’s sizzling attraction.Having read Tolstoy’s original, it was fun to see how certain plot points and characters would be reimagined for a 21st American setting. Lee's Levin, Dustin, is made far more palatable than his predecessors (thankfully, no cosplaying serfdom to be had here). Unlike the original,Levin/Dustin is relegated to the role of secondary character, with the novel mostly focusing on Anna and Kimmie.The novel is basically about rich kids behaving badly. We see them cheating, having or wanting to have sex, and doing drugs. Now and again they pursue obnoxious rich people activities, participating in horse races or entering their dogs in beauty pageants. Compared to other campy satires—But I’m a Cheerleader, Mean Girls, Libba Bray’s Beauty Queens—the teens in Anna K are devoid of distinct personalities beyond catchphrases and hobbies. They resemble reality show contestants, their shallowness bordering on the absurd. They have extravagant parties, get involved in minor and major scandals, the girls spend most of their time talking or thinking about boys, while most of the male characters have the emotional depth of a paddling pool.Despite dabbling with drugs, and for all their talking of blowjobs, Lee’s teens speak and behave in a babyish lingo. While at times this type of idiosyncrasy can work, Lee’s characters just sound like Disney channel teens. Their lexicon and frame of references also felt off. For a book set in the latter half of the 2010s, there were so many pop cultural references that were dated (the amount of game of thrones references is truly baffling) and not believable. The outdated references combined with the teens’ improbable dialogues seemed unmistakable signs of the generational gap between the characters and their author.Oddly enough, Lee’s characters share similar beliefs to their 19th century counterparts when it comes to what is proper. It felt as though by making her characters adhere to puritanical beliefs, Lee was able to keep the same conflict between Anna and Alexia/Vronsky as Tolstoy had. Considering the contemporary setting and that most of the adults around the teens are divorced and or have had several spouses, without being exiled from their rarefied world, it made no sense for Anna & co to treat her relationship with Alexia as scandalous.The novel flirts with serious topics—substance abuse, revenge porn, suicide ideation—but it does so in a very glib, tongue-in-cheek tone, befitting of Gossip Girl. Even when portraying experiences of first love, heartbreak, and jealousy, Lee does so in a frivolous, sensationalist style. Once again, I find myself comparing Anna K unfavorably to Bray’s Beauty Queens. The latter novel pulls off campy satire in a way that Anna K just doesn't. Also, Bray’s characters, however ridiculous, were fun to read about. But Lee’s ones are mostly different shades of annoying. Most of the secondary characters, Kimmie especially, were excruciatingly grating. The two leads, Anna & Alexia, were surprisingly bland, and I wish Lee had imbued them with some zest. Anna is wishy-washy, and Alexia comes across as a generic fuckboi. Anna’s brother, although idiotic and problematic (especially his use of aave), at leasts provides some levity, and it was nice to see how he always has Anna’s back. Anna K is a read that doesn't demand your undivided attention. It's a frivolous and pulpy retelling populated by a cast of characters who do not sound or behave like actual human beings. The narrative revels in the drama of the rich, poking fun at how inane and shallow the characters are. The novel is undermined by Lee's surface-level satire, which offers little in terms of commenting on privilege, peer pressure, or sexist double-standards. Sure, Anna K is kind of trashy and very stupid, but if you like Kevin Kwan, Curtis Sittenfeld's Eligible, Gossip Girl, or if you enjoy watching reality shows like Made In Chelsea or The Simple Life, chances are you’ll find it to be an entertaining read....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Feb 05, 2024","Feb 07, 2024","Feb 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45043369-anna-k

Some of the poems read like time capsules, or snapshots, that in just a few verses manage to capture the zeitgeist of the 1920s. Langston Hughes hones in particular on the experiences of Black Americans, and he does so both with joy and sorrow. Some of the poems are full of zing, as they are populated by dancers, lovers, and music. Others are more contemplative, as Hughes writes about history and the continued social injustices experienced by his community. While many of his poems are playful and thrumming with energy, some are startling for their seeming simplicity. I found myself loving those latter ones in particular. In these poems Hughes experiments with his voice and style and the result is a multivalent collection; while some poems did come across as more 'finely tuned' than others, I found myself charmed by his collection and look forward to reading more of his poems....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 16, 2023","Feb 21, 2023","Feb 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15762561-the-weary-blues

Something in the realms of authors like Liane Moriarty. We have the dual timelines/povs, the sine qua non of domestic thrillers, that switch between the present day, where we follow Auntie Claudine as she travels to Nigeria to look for her estranged niece, whose disappearance does not seem to be of much concern to either Nicole’s husband or her in-laws, and the ‘past’, where we get an insight into Nicole’s married life. The ‘missing woman’ plot makes for a rather tired premise, however, given the story’s setting and the focus on an aunt-niece dynamic (while usually in these type of thrillers, it’s about sisters, mother-daughters, current wife-former wife), I did hope that The Nigerwife could make for a gripping read. Sadly, the novel feels bogged down by scenes that reveal very little about the characters. Much is made about Nicole’s powerful in-laws but those family dynamics are barely hinted at. The novel lacks suspense, and atmosphere, which is a pity. The characters are surface-level, and the story relies on the usual cliches of the genre. The twists and reveals at the end were predictable and lazy. As per usual, the opinions expressed above are entirely subjective so if you are interested in this book you should definitely check it out....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 10, 2023","May 17, 2023","Feb 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62919389-the-nigerwife

Leïla Slimani’s The Scent of Flowers at Night really resonated with me, in particular, when it came to the author's exploration of the intersection between creativity and solitude; while she does, like many other authors, mystify her profession and craft, I did not find her observations and conclusions far-fetched or obnoxious, especially since her view of authors and writing leads to some truly compelling discussions on belonging, aloneness, otherness, and privilege. She is particularly aware of the circumstances that led to her being able to ‘become’ a writer, and I appreciated how honest she was when reflecting on the role of her father’s death in her being able to pursue her writing. She demonstrates a perspective and critical mind, and her self-awareness allows her to consider ‘uncomfortable’ truths, about herself, her family, society, and history. I liked how Slimani's writing seemed in conversation with that of other writers, from considering the authors who shaped her to giving us glimpses into their lives.While Slimani does write about art and museums, knowledge and beauty, the Punta della Dogana Museum remains a mere backdrop to her various acts of introspection. Slimani does acknowledge that as an author she doesn’t have much to contribute when it comes to writing about Venice but I did feel this was a bit of a cop-out given that she does have very little to say about Venice. Another small quibble is the comparison between Native Americans and the dwindling population of Venice, I mean, not only was it in really really really bad taste but it made little sense.Slimani’s contemplations on solitude, creativity, identity, heritage, migration, and art, were captivating and I found myself inspired by her words. This type of reading will definitely appeal to readers who enjoy Jhumpa Lahiri, Zadie Smith, and Elena Ferrante's nonfiction.I found Slimani’s recollections of her past, her reflecting on her experiences as a Moroccan woman, first in Morocco and then in France, as a daughter to a Moroccan-French mother and a Moroccan father, and, most of all, as an author to be insightful. I will definitely be revisiting this....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Feb 20, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Feb 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63234896-the-scent-of-flowers-at-night

Percy Jackson by way of Neil Gaiman, Zalika Reid-Benta's River Mumma is 3 ½ stars (rounded up) Great start, meandering middle, satisfying conclusion. Percy Jackson by way of Neil Gaiman, Zalika Reid-Benta's River Mumma is a short yet compelling urban fantasy novel inspired by Jamaican folklore that explores the importance of ancestral ties in the modern world.Set in Toronto, our main character is Alicia who is very much going through a quarter-life crisis after finishing grad school. she's now 'stuck' in a retail job she neither likes nor is particularly gifted at, and tends to isolate herself from others. Alicia's humdrum existence is brought to a halt by River Mumma, a Jamaican water deity, who appears to Alicia and tasks her with a time-sensitive quest: Alicia has 24 hours to find River Mumma's missing comb. Much like Percy Jackson, Alicia is not alone in her quest. By her side is Heaven, who is very knowledgable in Jamaican folklore, and Mars, whose participation in this possibly life-endangering adventure is reluctant at best. I really liked the banter and friendship between Alicia, Heaven, and Mars, and I also found Alicia's current 'predicament' (feeling lost after finishing grad school, unsatisfied but unable to leave the world of retail), all too relatable. The fantasy elements and the various 'obstacles' that present themselves along the way to finding the comb were imaginative and engrossing. What I did find repetitive and somewhat of a 'filler' were the scenes featuring these flashbacks into Alicia's ancestors. I just thought that they detracted momentum from Alicia's 'present'. Maybe I would have preferred it if these flashbacks weren't so samey, both in their vocabulary and imagery, and I would have felt more of a connection if, like in Reid-Benta's previous novel, the focus had been on her more immediate family (her mother and so on). Still, I did find River Mumma to be a captivating read that succeeds in imbuing a contemporary coming-of-age tale with folklore....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Aug 25, 2023","Aug 30, 2023","Jan 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/65650494-river-mumma

An ache opening up inside you. Deep, deep."" / ""Cynical smile of the beautiful who know they're on the downhill slope."" / ""Don't know why I came here.

Novels focusing on alienated women who travel somewhere they both feel like they belong to but do not, such as The Human Zoo and The Far Field, tend to appeal to me and so do main characters who are a combination of pathetic, churlish, and selfish. And yet, Sonia, our central character, manages to be not only painfully uninteresting, despite her attempts at fashioning herself as interesting and oblique, but profoundly annoying. I am sure that this was to some extent the desired extent but the narrative does suggest that she is far more complex and fascinating a figure than she actually is. Not only did I find her boring and obnoxious but there were several instances where I had a hard time 'buying' into her. She presents herself as this somewhat jaded and remote actor with a tendency to be in relationships with questionable power dynamics (she has an affair with the director of a play she was starring in), but more often than not her internal monologue and her responses to other people's words and actions struck me as sanctimonious and affected.Still, I am not about to dissuade prospective readers from giving Enter Ghost a chance given that YMMV. If this novel is on your radar I recommend you check out some more positive s.Sonia Nasir, our narrator, is an actress in her late thirties who decides to visit her older sister Haneen in Haifa both to escape tribulations of the heart and, having not visited since the second intifada, to reconnect with her heritage. While Haneen returned to become a teacher, Sonia remained in London to build her acting career. In Haifa, their relationship is uneasy, as their attempts at having meaningful conversations often lead to disagreements and recriminations. As Sonia attempts to form a new understanding of Palestine, she finds herself looking to her past, in particular, a traumatic experience during her adolescence there. Despite Haneen’s lukewarm welcome, Sonia does meet through her Mariam, a director who is working on a production of Hamlet in the West Bank. For all her protestations, and her perplexing not-so-warm feelings toward Mariam, Sonia finds herself travelling to Ramallah with her to play the part of Gertrude. There she meets the other actors, one of whom she is particularly attracted to. Their production however faces many obstacles, from the long drives and alienating checkpoints they have to go through, but they are all too aware of the ever-encroaching possibility of violence, persecution, and oppression at the hands of Israeli authorities. Mariam’s own brother has come under 'suspicion', and her connection to him may pose a danger to their production. However, Mariam, who believes that their play can be a form of resistance, is determined to make the play work, regardless of outside forces and internecine disputes.Before I move on to what I did not like about Enter Ghost, I will mention what was effective: Isabella Hammad manages to give readers both an overview of contemporary Palestine and a more intimate close-up of the everyday experiences of Palestinians who continue to live under oppression. The confusion, uncertainty, and anger felt by many of her characters are rendered with clarity and acuity. I also appreciated the author’s exploration of displacement, (multi)heritage, and the way she is able to convey the confusion and sadness that are specific to feeling, or being made to feel, like an outsider in your own culture. Hammad also shows the divide between Palestinians living ‘inside’ Israel and those in the West Bank, without resorting to easy categorisations. So, when it comes to rendering time and place, Hammad certainly demonstrates a skilled hand. What ultimately made the book a chore was its protagonist, a character that I found improbable, in that her internal monologue was full of anachronism that did not make her into a more realistic character, but an unconvincing actor (""He drew nearer and I shrugged, shrinking with embarrassment and virginity""/""I was ready to be outraged if he kissed me. I imagined his pillowy lips""). That she is under the impression of being this complex and ambiguous person, made her hammy performance all the more egregious. She has so many chips on her shoulder you might as well order an aperitif while you are reading this. I can think of so many books that succeed in portraying the uneasy bond between two sisters who spend a lot of their time bickering and snapping at each other, both of whom believe that the other has had an easier time or is more adjusted than they are, examples being Sunset and Yolk. But here Haneen and Sonia's interactions were stilted in a way that did not seem convincing. That is not me saying that they needed to be close, far from. In fact, I was expecting the narrative to explore how the physical distance between them as well as the diverging paths they took in life caused or contributed to the emotional rift between them. But this didn’t really come through. Their fights just didn’t ring true to me (if they did to you, ben per te) and their dynamic was just underwhelming. And so for the matter was Sonia and Mariam’s ‘friendship’. Sonia spends most of the narrative painting M as being an unpleasant yet fascinating figure, yet, suddenly, we are to believe she cares for her deeply. I never understood her enmity towards Mariam, at one point she describes her as possessing a ""straightforward, repugnant, magnetic light""...and it just seemed uncalled for and random to be honest. And the play...I wasn’t expecting chunks of actual Hamlet to make up the narrative but they do. Not only that but the narrative switches to a play/script format more than once even during scenes where the characters are not rehashing. Maybe this will appeal to others readers, but I found this meta choice to be jarring and not particularly suited to the tone of the narrative. Maybe the rehearsals themselves could have been more interesting if the people taking part were fleshed out, but they are not. Early on the author uses actual character introductions in a way that seems a cop-out at actually ‘showing/establishing’ their personalities and personal histories in a more natural way over the course of the narrative. It did not help that Sonia fails to really see most of them as people, especially the two younger men, for who she has some motherly feelings, and she uses to make points about the male ego. It’s a pity that they are not given more of a voice but flattened to fit Sonia and even Mariam's discourses and theories on male youth, masculinity, and rivalries.Very early on Sonia makes a move on of the actors in a way that was cringe and pathetic, but not in a funny or relatable way, but I later on came to understand that Sonia really thinks she is an intriguing figure (""I had a marketably unusual appearance, or so they said""). Being in Sonia’s head was a tiresome affair as I felt mostly annoyed by her self-pitying, her dull observations and assumptions about other people, as well as her painfully cliched love life.I would have liked for the story to remain more focused on Sonia’s relationships with her family, her sister and dad in particular, who are often sidelined in favor of Sonia’s navel-gazing, her career retrospective, her farcical projections, whereby Sonia attributes unconvincing motivations and traits people around her, and flashbacks that are clearly meant to make us feel bad for her.The story slowly inches its way forward with few if any emotionally satisfying beats. The main character, despite her self-dramatizing, is a sulky bore, and the people around her never come into focus. Still, even if I found this novel wanting in terms of storyline and character development, Enter Ghost is not an ‘empty’ read as it is a novel that deals with oppression and revolution, and interrogates nations and identities that are displaced and fragmented. I just wish that the author had not created such a boring and unbelievable character and one who fails so spectacularly to be amusing, insightful, and/or interesting.The story feels drawn out and the prose at times tries to be oblique and complex but succeeds only in unnecessarily over-elaborate. The glimpses into their theatrical production and theatre, in general, tended to be more interesting but were more often than not ruined b Sonia's obnoxious explanations and truisms. A lot of the dialogues were stilted, and even if the characters now and again do say something that is 'convincing', they remain thinly rendered figures.I wish that the author had committed more fully to making Sonia into more of a mystifying and detached figure, but it seemed that she did not fully want to commit to making her into a flawed, destructive even, person. Ironically, her attempts at making us feel bad for Sonia, by showing us that her family left her out of the loop and those times shitty men treated her badly (who could have predicted that), only succeeded in making her into a bland shade of 'unlikeable'.I can't see myself re-reading this in order to see if my not liking this book is a case of right book/wrong time but the occasion might rise where I am stranded on a deserted island and this is the only book at hand...Like I said above, don't take my  to heart given that you may click with Sonia or Hammad's storytelling in a way that I wasn't able to....more",Notes are private!,2,47,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59725231-enter-ghost

She was afraid of many things that weren’t real, but she didn’t tell anyone. They would’ve sent her far, far away, and she wasn’t ready to go.” Liar, Dreamer, Thief had all of the ingredients to be a unique mystery-thriller exploring mental health, but sadly this novel eventually adopted a rather tired formula as it devolved into the typical suspense story where we follow an unreliable woman taking on the role of amateur detective (sometimes to discover what really happened to a friend of hers, who went missing or died, sometimes after she witnesses something troubling, sometimes after she inherited a house or something, etc). Worst still, it relies on the same twist as a lot of these novels do. Maybe if this book had been mid from the very start, I wouldn’t have felt so disappointed, but when I was about ⅓ in, I genuinely thought this was going to be a 4, 5 stars even, read. Not only is too much importance given to that tired twist, but it felt like the middle of the book was just a lot of padding, scenes and internal monologues that come across as repetitive and as if they are stalling for time.Katrina Kim, our 20-something narrator, is precariously employed at Advancex, a “hospital revenue cycle management” company in NY, where she mostly has to deal with taking calls about people’s insurance, bills, etc. Katrina lives with Leoni, whom she found on craigslist, who for various reasons is often away, either due to work-related reasons or to take care of her ill sister. From the very first pages, we realize that Katrina is not doing well at all. Something happened in her past that resulted in her dropping out of college and being ‘ousted’ by her parents, who have not reached out to her in years. In the present day, Katrina is obsessed with Kurt, a co-worker at Advancex whom she has barely interacted with. Leoni, the only one who seems to know about Katrina’s fixation, tries to tell her that her behavior isn’t healthy and that she is acting like a stalker. But Katrina seems to genuinely believe that there is something connecting her to Kurt, not romantic, as Katrina is into women, but a kinship nonetheless. So Katrina often goes to his desk, when he isn’t around, to look at his stuff, sometimes even stealing things from him. What aggravates Katrina’s loose grip on reality is that she often views the world around her through the magical lenses of her favorite children’s book, identifying real people with characters, or seeing her life or actions as if mirroring those of the book’s protagonist. Katrina has many maladaptive coping mechanisms, rituals, and routines, that have to do with numbers and symbols, many of them connected to that magical world. The first few chapters give us an idea of the ways in which Katrina struggles to maintain a semi-functional facade, emphasizing how day-to-day actions, behaviors, and interactions, that other people do automatically or take for granted, she has difficulty to emulate. Sadly, Advancex doesn’t seem to have a lot of visibility or awareness for disability and accessibility in the workplace. Prone to anxiety attacks and perpetually on edge, we see just how lonely and in difficulty Katrina is, yet, that doesn’t make her inappropriate fixation on Kurt any more palatable. It just so happens that after a particularly bad episode, Katrina turns to one of her more powerful rituals to regain a measure of control, her midnight trip sees her become a witness to Kurt’s suicide. Before jumping to his death, he turns to her and accuses her of being somehow to blame for this.Reeling, unsure whether she imagined Kurt’s death or not, Katrina loses the little control she had over her life. At work, she finds several clues that lead her to discover that as she was spying and watching Kurt, he was doing the same to her. What follows is a rather convoluted mystery, with a lot of scenes set in the workplace or in Katrina’s apartment, as we follow Katrina trying to learn more about Kurt and coming across one cryptic clue after the next. In doing so however not only she gets into trouble with her manager but she also puts at risk one of her colleagues, who has always had her back. At first, I really liked the atmosphere of the story, and Katrina’s surreal, feverish, narration is captivating, despite her troubling behavior. I wasn’t sure if this story was going in the direction of something like Horse Girl, or The OA, or in the murkier realms of Danzy Senna’s Symptomatic or the bizarre world of Sayaka Murata's Earthlings, so I was disappointed when it ultimately went along the lines of those thriller books that are all the rage, with our ‘messy’ unreliable main character doing some questionable sleuthing, often guided by instinct more than logic/proof. While Katrina’s voice was compelling, the characters around her were very cartoonish. From her angry manager to the mean receptionist, to the cat-lady who lives in the same building as her, to the librarian she briefly came across…her colleagues too, both of them behaved in a way and said things that weren’t entirely credible. I also found that the novel tries to go somewhere dark, presenting us with a young woman who is doing things that are irrational, and dangerous even, but it ultimately cops out by making the two people with who Katrina behaves appallingly, into psychopathic villains. While I appreciated the lack of romance, I did wish that Katrina’s queerness didn’t feel like such an afterthought, almost as if the author wanted to make Katrina’s obsession with Kurt more palatable because she isn’t in love with him…Also, if I had to be nitpicky since a lot of this book revolves around and in the workplace, there were inconsistencies when it came to how employees like Katrina were monitored. I have a hard time believing that she was able to leave her desk and stalk Kurt for so long without drawing notice. Also, in a lot of workplaces where you have to answer emails/calls from clients/customers, those are monitored, usually for calls to see that they are resolved quickly, and you definitely can’t get away with putting down the phone on someone knowing that they will call again and bother one of your colleagues instead. Additionally, I remember, a friend of mine worked in a call centre and her breaks to pee etc were timed, so if you took longer than 5-10 mins you could be penalized. I wouldn’t be so fussy if it wasn’t for the fact that work surveillance comes into play in the story…There were times when Katrina's 'other world' seems forgotten, and when it comes into play it almost feels gimmicky. spoilers aheadThe worst characters were Kurt and Leoni. He was just a one-note generic bad man, and I could never reconcile myself with Katrina’s obsession with him. Sure, she thinks the guy likes the same music as she does and she is lonely, delusional, and prone to obsession….but still. Leoni was even worse. I have come across this type of character one too many times. She is usually the friend or bff of the mc in these books that is super nice and supportive, even when the mc is shitty towards her, but it was all pretend. She is actually a manipulative girlboss who feels like a distant cousin to those golden-age female characters who appear meek, and innocent, only to be then revealed as an evil femme fatale or whatnot. Her motivations were all over the place, and her plan was so convoluted as to lack any sense. Plus, guarda caso, because they are revealed to be as Bad, Katrina’s stalking of Kurt, and her neglectful behavior toward Leoni, are all made moot, because they were actually playing her all along. I did find Katrina's reunion with her parents moving and rewarding even if I didn't buy into how everyone was seemingly swindled by Leoni's act and didn't care to challenge/question her.end of spoilersI guess I just wanted more, from the mystery, from the characters. While the story succeeds in giving readers a glimpse into Katrina, a young woman whose spiralling mental health leaves her vulnerable to other people’s manipulations, it didn’t quite do a lot besides that. The finale was cheesy, almost at odds with the uneasy tone characterizing much of the narrative. This could have been a darker, more subversive read, but it ended up reading like yet another mystery book whose titles usually use words like 'sister', 'girl', 'lies', or a combination of words like 'the other woman', 'the girl you left behind', 'the lies we told', 'the apartment', and so on.Still, it did have the makings to be something great, so I am actually looking forward to reading more by Maria Dong....more",Notes are private!,1,43,1,"Jan 17, 2023","Jan 19, 2023","Jan 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61030718-liar-dreamer-thief

Countries of Origin, a novel exploring the will-they-won't-the first few pages are intriguing but boy oh boy this was a mess (of the boring variety). Countries of Origin, a novel exploring the will-they-won't-they dynamic between two very different men, promised to be, if not quite something in the realms of a queer psychosexual thriller, something in the realms of Christopher Bollen's A Beautiful Crime or Scott Spencer's An Ocean Without a Shore. Demetrio, our narrator, is a 20-something pâtissier who works in New York, where he lives with his uncle Chus. Demetrio's existence is jeopardised by a job offer, one that risks exposing his undocumented status. Fearing deportation, Demetrio sees no choice but to leave 'voluntarily', travels to Madrid. During his flight there he begins chatting with Jacobo, a student from an aristocratic family who persuades Demetrio to come stay with him in Madrid. Jacobo, Demetrio's object of desire, is a painfully boring character whose main characteristic is that he is handsome. We are told the guy is charming, alluring, possibly manipulative, but being told that he is all of these things does not make these things true or actual facets of his persona. Their conversations were awkward, and not in a realistic way, but in a way that seemed strained, unconvincing. Their supposed codependency and love/hate dynamic felt exaggerated and unearned (given that their scenes together did not really succeed in selling their relationship). The novel ends up being all about Demetrio obsessing over this supposedly magnetic guy, yet resenting him becomes of class differences (class differences that are explored with as much nuance as an episode from a soap opera). I am all for tales about seemingly 'normal' people who fall under the spell of more outgoing/successful/mysterious individuals (i mean, barbara vine's the house of stairs is my roman empire), but I have to believe that this person has this irresistible 'aura', and here, well, it was impossible. Jacobo is this rich guy with a convenient sad boi backstory that is meant to make his present-day asshole behaviour sort of okay...but I just never understood how and why our protagonist is drawn to this basic rich-bro-who-thinks-he-is-all-that guy. I found myself more interested in say seeing Demetrio acclimatising to Spain, from every-day things to the working culture. I found myself wanting to learn more about his profession or having more scenes focusing on his new workplace (i admit it, i picked this up soon after watching the bear) but his entire narrative comes to revolve around Jacobo and his family. Countries of Origin turned out to be a surprisingly vanilla portrayal of what was meant to be a tumultuous relationship. The novel's exploration of queerness and masculinity also struck me a shallow.As usual, the opinions above are entirely subjective and if you are interested in reading this novel I recommend you do so regardless of my ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 24, 2023","Aug 03, 2023","Jan 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62802740-countries-of-origin

The collection opens with a very tame story that, surprisingly enough, actually ended up being the only one I really appreciated. I found the quiet unease permeating this first story far more effective than the graphic portrayals we get later on of women who want to act out their sadomasochistic fantasies or children being physically and emotionally abused. This story has a seemingly simple premise, that of a married couple heading out to visit some friends of theirs, that is elevated by the ‘clandestine’ nature of their visit and by the subversion of our expectations in regard to how the night will pan out. It had this disquieting dreamlike quality that I have come to associate with the work of David Lynch and Kazuo Ishiguro.The other stories are mostly populated by women who want their partners to whip/flog them as they find physical pain to be a source of pleasure. Given that these stories were published in the 1960s, the author’s unflinching exploration of her character’s sexual desires, their bodies and psyches, these stories were definitely avant-garde, transgressive even, and they can still be seen as such given that many of the women in these stories express or envision depraved fantasies.The title story is the most ‘shocking’ one given that we follow a woman who out of a mixture of self-hatred or internalized misogyny finds girls repulsive. However, she seems to feel quite differently about little boys and finds ways to watch them undress or eat. Other women in this collection seem to find it arousing to scold children or imagine someone else scolding, or even brutally beating up, children. Some of Taeko Kōno’s women brought to mind Jean Rhys’ passive heroines, as they also find themselves drawn into other people’s volatile marriages (people who are rather 'unattractive' and 'unpleasant'). Others instead made me think of Mariana Enríquez and the infamous Humbert Humbert. Certainly, Kōno has no trouble presenting her readers with discomforting scenes or delving into taboo subjects as grooming, sadomasochism, strange malaises, abject bodies, cruelty to children, self-abnegation, and unnerving portrayals of motherhood are motifs of this collection. While I am usually drawn to this type of restrained prose and morally dubious characters, I was, despite the stories’ graphic contents, bored. I found the stories too-samey, repetitive even. The women in these stories, despite their disruptive and ambiguous desires, were not particularly fascinating to me and I do not attribute depth or value to graphic content alone. I need something else, something, apologies to my fellow vegans, ‘meatier’ to sink my teeth into. Some of my friends here on GR seemed to have had a more rewarding experience with this collection so if you are interested in reading I recommend you check out their s instead. Maybe I shouldn't have read this collection all at once, maybe then the stories would have felt more distinct from one another, so I am open to revisiting Kōno's work in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38622807-toddler-hunting-and-other-stories

Growing up is about being sad and angry sometimes.” What could have been a depressing and angsty coming-of-age is ultimately saved by a rewarding & bittersweet narrative arc. As a Korean-American teen girl in the very white New Jersey suburbs, Deb feels and is made to feel like an outsider. She’s introverted and insecure, struggles to make friends, has been subjected to her peers' bullying and racism, and feels very much stuck ‘in limbo’. Her dissatisfaction with her physical appearance, in particular her eyes, is exacerbated by white and western-centric beauty standards and feds into Deb’s self-hatred. Although not without friends, Deb, who is either made to feel visible or hypervisible, is deeply lonely and constantly aware, thanks to the microaggressions of her peers and of the adults in her life, of her ‘Otherness’. When she makes a new friend she soon invests all of her energies in this friendship, but her insecurity and need for validation ultimately pushes away said friend.Contributing to Deb’s poor mental health is her strained relationship with her mother, who is shown for much of the graphic novel shouting, snapping, and even getting physically abusing her daughter. While others dismiss Deb’s mother's behavior as a result of ‘cultural’ differences, her mother’s verbal and physical 'outbursts' still affect Deb, who is made to feel worthless, a failure. There was an instance where a verbal ‘fight’ escalates into something more that came across as somewhat staged (Deb leaves the kitchen in shambles and tells her mother she doesn’t have time to clean it up now because she’s behind with her work…). Sometimes depression can make you quite self-centered, as you are so overwhelmed and fixated on your own sadness, failures, and insecurities, as to never take into account that the people around you also may be going through some difficult times. Thankfully towards the latter half of In Limbo Deb does realize this, and even takes accountability for the way she behaved with her friend. Yet, I did find Deb's propensity for self-victimization and her possessive and obsessive behavior toward that friend rather annoying, especially when the narrative frames most of Deb's not-so-great actions as not really her fault.I think the ending section, when Deb goes to Seoul to visit relatives, as well as Deb’s interactions with her father, had a great emotional resonance. I also appreciated that while much of the story presents Deb’s mother in a rather negative light, Deb, rather than forgiving and forgetting her mother’s physical and emotional abuse, tries to understand her (her experiences growing up, her move to the us, etc).The art style never completely won me over, for instance, I often confused Deb's friends (one was blonde, the other a brunette, but i forgot often which one was which). Speaking of art, Deb's passion for art also comes into play but I kept hoping for it to be explored more. There were some panels that I did find beautiful, especially those in the water, or those solely focused on Deb. While Deb's friends and the people in her art class did feel rather one-dimensional, I did like that one of them brings up how often adults and authority figures fail to see when a young person is struggling, chalking up their depression or unenthusiasm to laziness or in the case of Deb's friend drugs. I think Deb's story also examines how it feels when you feel that your parents aren't there for you, or worse still, they just confirm everything that you hate about yourself or fail to recognise your pain.For some reason when I read this I forgot that it was a memoir, and I wonder if maybe I would appreciated it more if I'd kept that in mind.Maybe I would have found this more hard-hitting if I hadn’t watched Kim Bora's House of Hummingbird on the same day I finished reading this, which is also a coming-of-age that deals with domestic abuse, dysfunctional parents, loneliness, growing-up, feeling left behind by your friends.While I may have not been the ideal reader for this graphic novel that should not dissuade you from picking it up.I admire Lee for writing about their experiences and for being able to be both critical and compassionate towards their younger self. It isn't easy to unlearn self-loathing practices, especially if you have been made to feel unworthy by your own parent. ps: i have used her/she to refer to deb the character not Lee the author (who uses they/them)....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Jan 15, 2023","Jan 16, 2023","Jan 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60316965-in-limbo

When it came to my oshi, I wanted to offer him everything I had.” Rin Usami’s Idol, Burning gives readers insight into fandom culture and celebrity worship through the lens of Akari, a high-school student whose thoughts are always on Masaki Ueno, her oshi, a former child actor who is now part of the boyband Maza Maza.Akari uses her money to go to concerts and to buy their merch and dedicates a blog to Masaki where she interacts with other fans. Her devotion to him never sways, even when rumors about Masaki having assaulted a fan begin to circle. Akari doesn’t really consider these allegations, saddened by the onslaught of haters on online spaces dedicated to Maza Maza. Eventually, she gets a part-time job so she can attend more concerts and buy even more merch. Her room becomes a shrine to Masaki. As Akari’s grades steadily fall, her parents and sister grow increasingly frustrated by her lack of interest in her studies, in life, in her family. Akari’s inability, perhaps unwillingness, to articulate why she is so disinterested in school or to make her parents and sister understand her struggles with her studies, is a cause of additional stress on the family unit.Akari finds solace, from her alienation and abjection, in her oshi. Not being able to feel like she is normal, she finds comfort in Masaki, believing that they share a deep connection.Akari is a rather empty character, a blank slate, which may as well be intentional given how easily she becomes obsessed with the life of another. Yet, her understanding of Masaki is incredibly skewed, as she fails to see him as a human, an entertainer, but endows him with divine qualities. Her treatment of her family is frustrating, as she doesn’t seem to care particularly for them nor does she understand that she cannot exist on devotion alone. I kept waiting for the story to go somewhere, especially with Masaki’s ‘alleged’ assault, but it never does. While you can tell that the person behind this story is familiar with fandom culture, I found myself wanting a more in-depth exploration of it, rather than the surface-level one we get. I also found that the author’s words at the end are simplistic. It seemed that she wanted to make Akari a sympathetic character whose struggles in school may be a result of learning difficulties. But, beyond Akari recalling that a doctor said she was ‘not normal’, this venue of the story remains largely unexplored. Even when it comes to parasocial relationships the novel fails to go deeper. Beyond reiterating that Akari felt ‘saved’ by Masaki when he was acting the role of Peter Pan. The author also doesn’t really go into cancel culture or death of the author (or in this case singer). What happens when a public figure you admire is accused of something like assaulting another person? Akari never doubts him or thinks about it really, beyond feeling sorry for him and being saddened by him losing fans and gaining haters. The author merely comes up with a vanilla take on this (online bullying is bad, we should consider how the people accused of things like this feel, etc).The prose is distant and restrained, and while I usually like this type of style, here it just compounded my disinterest. I guess I was expecting a darker, more complex read. But Idol, Burning made for a rather surface-level read. If you happen to be interested in this novel I recommend you check out more positive s.

The interior of her mouth is as empty as the veins through which the blood no longer flows, it is as empty as a lift shaft where the lift has ceased to operate.” In a clinically detached prose Han Kang examines in exacting detail the experiences of two individuals whose ability to perceive the world and be able to express themselves, to interact with others, are impaired. Preoccupied with the notion and the reality of communication, perception, language, and sight these characters feel increasingly alienated from their everyday reality, unsure of themselves, their senses, and their bodies, and attempting to find a new way to occupy space, of navigating their world, by, in the case of the woman, distancing herself from that which was familiar, and, in the case of the man, retreating inward to recollect the past and to understand the origins and effects of his linguistic and cultural disconnect.Unsparing and analytical, Greek Lessons is permeated by ambivalence. This atmosphere of unease and the characters’ aloofness succeed in making us feel a sense of estrangement from the text, which is compounded by the prose’s impersonal way of addressing the characters and how events that should carry some emotional impact are delivered and/or recounted in a distinctly dispassionate way. Kang places her characters under a microscope, zeroing in on momentary discomforts and sensations, be it a character’s dry lips or quivering eyelids. These close-ups are often uncomfortable, but they do succeed in conveying with precision the characters’ experiences. These coldly anatomical descriptions interrupt the characters’ introspections, which often amount to a lot of navel-gazing. Their preoccupation with the function and reality of a language, of linguistic barriers, of bilingualism, of ‘dead’ languages, of the way language and communication are necessary to navigate many spaces, and without it, one can find themselves on the margins, a passive spectator. The woman’s difficulties in conveying and articulating her thoughts and feelings definitely resonated with me. She is unwilling or avoids explaining her ‘loss’ of language, and there was something like resilience in her silence, in her choice to remain opaque. I was reminded of a Georgian film I watched a while back, My Happy Family, which revolves around a middle-aged woman who decides to leave her husband and family to live by herself and throughout the film refuses to explain her choice or back down from it. Here of course the circumstances of the woman are quite different, soon after the death of her mother the woman loses a drawn-out custody battle over her eight-year-old son. Severed from her son, grieving the loss of her mother, the woman, a professor, falls once again victim to a ‘malady’ that results in a loss of speech.“Before she lost words—when she was still able to use them to write—she sometimes wished that her own expressions would more closely resemble inarticulacy: a moan or low cry. The sound of suffering through bated breath. Snarling. Humming in one’s half-sleep to pacify a child. Stifled laughter. The sound of two people’s lips pressing together, pulling apart.”Yet, her loss of language cannot be easily ascribed to these losses. Feeling disconnected from Korean, the woman attempts to approach the language anew. To do so, she distances herself from her mother tongue and chooses to study a dead language, ancient Greek. These classes are taught by a man who grew up between Korea and Germany, and because of this has long felt not only a linguistic divide but a self-divide, perpetually longing to belong, to feel at ease. For years he has been gradually losing his sight, and so he finds himself questioning how he can retain independence, observing the world around him with regret and yearning. He writes letters to his sister, recounting his childhood experiences, from the shock of moving from Korea to Germany to the pressure to ‘assimilate’, and he also reflects on past friendships and loves.“Even the occasional memorable event is soon erased without a trace under time’s huge, opaque mass.”By switching between these two individuals Kang draws a parallel between their experiences and realities, as they both find themselves having to reevaluate new ways of perceiving and communicating with the world around them. There is, towards the end, a moment of kinship between the two, that felt startlingly poignant. “Sunspots explode, without a sound, in the distance. Hearts and lips touch across a fault line, at once joined and eternally sundered.”The narrative expounds on these two individuals' theoretical and personal ruminations, mirroring and juxtaposing their experiences and perspectives. Their reflections on languages, spoken and unspoken ways of communication, expression and perception, memory, grief, and the body (the way they fail and change us), are rendered all the more lucid by the author’s unsparing style. Yet, despite how clinical and ascetic her style was, there are moments where Kang’s prose is elevated by an elegiac, lyrical even, use of language.“If only she’d made a map of the route her tears used to take.”Greek Lessons makes for a fascinating read. The two central characters remain slightly outside of our reach, despite the time we spend alongside them. The subject matter and language itself are the core of this novel, making it sure, intellectually and stylistically arresting but, except for a few moments, I felt not only at a remove but as if I was reading a textbook. I couldn't help but compare this unfavourably to two favorites of mine, Whereabouts and All the Lovers in the Night (both novels also explore loneliness in women who assume the role of observer). Nevertheless, I do admire what Kang achieves in Greek Lessons and I found the ending to be quite rewarding. Some quotes:My love for you wasn’t foolish, but I was; had my own innate foolishness made love itself foolish? Or is that I myself wasn’t at all that foolish, but love’s inherent foolishness awakened any foolishness latent in me and eventually smashed everything to pieces?[T]here had once been a word that encapsulated both beauty and the sacred, without their having yet fallen away from each other, just as colour and clarity had formed one body within another word—the truth of this had never before been brought home to me with such vibrant intensity. Whatever their motivation, those who study Greek share certain tendencies. They walk and talk slowly, for the most part, and don’t show much emotion (I guess this applies to me too). Perhaps because this language is a long-dead one and doesn’t allow for oral communication. Silence, shy hesitation and reactions of muted laughter slowly heat the air inside the classroom, and slowly cool it.What a strange thing one's flesh and blood is.How strange are the ways that it brings us sorrow.Ink overlays ink, memory overlays memory, bloodstain overlays bloodstain. Serenity over serenity, smile over smile, bears down. Do you ever wonder at the strangeness of it?That our bodies have eyelids and lips,That they can at times be made to close from the outside,and at other times to lock fast from within.She knows that no single specific experience led to her loss of language. Language worn ragged over thousands of years, from wear and tear by countless tongues and pens. Language worn ragged over the course of her life, by her own tongue and pen. Each time she tried to begin a sentence, she could feel her aged heart. Her patched and repatched, dried-up, expressionless heart. The more keenly she felt it, the more fiercely she clasped the words....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Jan 09, 2023","Jan 10, 2023","Dec 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61686012-greek-lessons

Thankfully, Yangsze Choo gives less page time to its love interest(s), as the story is more focused on Li Lan having to navigate the Chinese afterlife. “The town of Malacca was very still, dreaming under the tropical sun of its past glories, when it was the pearl of port cities along the Straits.”The first few chapters are certainly compelling as Choo immerses her readers in colonial Malaysia and brings to life Malacca and Li Lan’s household. Despite her family’s good standing in society, her father’s fall into financial ruin and opioid addiction throw Li Lan’s future in jeopardy.“The hours, days, and years that had bled away in his opium haze demanded a payment from my future.”Li Lan’s father then receives a peculiar offer: a well-off and influential family, the Lim, wants Li Lan to become the ghost bride of Tian Ching, the family’s recently deceased male heir. Rarely practiced, ghost marriages seek to soothe restless spirits or to fulfill promises. Li Lan does not take this offer seriously, yet, when she is invited to the Lim mansion she finds herself growing intrigued by this powerful family, in particular Tian Ching’s cousin, Tian Bai. Li Lan’s blossoming feelings for him lead her to believe that their two families might eventually come to arrange a marriage between them, especially when she learns that the Lim patriarch is a friend of her father and that her mother was related to Madame Lim. Things however do not go Li Lan’s way as the Lim seem intent on making her Tian Ching’s ghost bride. Worse, Tian Ching begins to haunt her and her household, invading her dreams, and insisting on their union.A grave oversight severs Li Lan from her physical self, and she is left in a state of in-between. To return to the land of the living she has to contend with the ghost cities of the Chinese afterlife. She soon learns that the afterlife is as corrupt as the real-life world. To return to ‘life’, Li Lan has to hide the fact that she is not a ghost, face the afterlife’s Kafkaesque bureaucracy, and escape the notice of demons and Tian Ching, who is supported by his other dead relatives. She finds herself aided by a helpful spirit.“[T]o marry the living to the dead was a rare and, indeed, dreadful occurrence.”I genuinely thought that this book would be about Li Lan becoming a ghost bride, but she never does. Her would-be ghost husband is a bratty and frankly pitiful villain. Most of the story takes place in the afterlife, which is a pity as I would have liked more of a back-and-forth between these two worlds, especially given that once Li Lan is trapped in the ghost realm, she is cut off from her Amah, whose presence provided much needed female solidarity. When it comes to the ghost cities and the afterlife the world-building felt surprisingly weak. The ghosts and spirits Li Lan encounter there should have been fascinating and mysterious but at times I forgot that she was not in the real world given how mundane it all felt. This may have been the point, to emphasize how powerful people there are exploiting others or using their wealth to keep living the life they did in the mortal realm…but it just didn’t make for an entertaining reading experience. The Lim family wasn’t that interesting either, which is a pity as the narrative plays out in a way that makes you think that they are much more villainous or powerful than they are. Li Lan’s love interests were painfully dull, one was a complete case of insta love the other seemed a rip-off of Spirited Away. The conceit here, of a mortal trapped in the spirit realm, has been done before and better. From Ghibli’s take to YA books like The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea (which was actually published more recently than this novel but hey ho i read that last year). I think the ghost bride premise combined with a murder mystery would have made for a much more captivating story. I could have also done without the cartoonishly mean/evil villains. It seems cheap to me to make bad characters be described as physically unattractive, or if they are beautiful then they are a cold type of beauty. I mean, it gives me Disney energy. Li Lan's voice was rather generic, a light take on the (supposedly) 'spunky' heroine type of protagonist. Her relationship with her parents is sadly sidelined in favor of focusing on petty disagreements and her profoundly vanilla love triangle. It's a pity that I wasn't able to love this as I was at first drawn to Choo's charming and humorous storytelling which brought to mind authors like Zen Cho and Diana Wynne Jones. Nevertheless, while Choo's afterlife may not have grabbed me all that much I did find her portrayal of colonial Malaysia insightful, as she is able to provide a lot of historical and cultural anecdotes and explanations. We are also made to understand the limitations experienced by women such as Li Lan at that time, and the dynamic between a patriarch's wives and off-springs. If this happens to be on your tbr list I recommend you still give it a shot as YMMV....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Dec 28, 2022","Dec 30, 2022","Dec 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16248223-the-ghost-bride

That road I had been on didn’t lead anywhere, this trip would never end—it seemed to me as if next morning would never arrive.” Banana Yoshimoto is at her whimsical best in the two short stories collected in Hardboiled & Hard Luck.Her storytelling is so carefree, unconcerned by plot or traditional narrative structures. Yet, it is characterized by a breeziness that adds a propelling energy to her stories. Maybe this energy comes from her protagonist’s voices, which remain easy-going and often oddly cheerful, regardless of their circumstances. Far from inducing one to sleep, the dreamlike atmosphere that is typical of Yoshimoto’s work, has a charming effect. Yoshimoto’s knack for surreality, and her tendency to dabble in magical realism, revitalize what would otherwise be more grounded slice-of-life stories. Yoshimoto’s off-beat realism is charming, occasionally bizarre, and ultimately heartwarming. In 'Harboiled', my favorite of the two stories, we follow an unnamed narrator who after a hike in the mountains she goes to stay at a hotel. We learn that it is the anniversary of her ex-lover’s death. The narrator dreams of this lover, a woman by the name of Chizuru, and recalls the way they came together and, eventually, apart. The narrator is not only visited by Chizuru, another woman comes to see her. While the story features ghosts and haunted places, the narrative feels far from eerie. These visitations feel far from fantastical, but rather natural extensions of the ‘real’ world. While the narrator is taken aback by her encounters with the dead, she takes the experience in stride, and so does the woman working at the hotel. The bittersweet mood permeating this story adds to the overall atmosphere. Witty yet heartfelt, 'Hardboiled' is a delightfully dreamy story about past loves and regrets.The second story instead follows a young woman whose sister is in a coma. Knowing that she will soon die, the sister longs for past days. She forms a tentative connection with the older brother of her sister’s fiancé, but the timing makes it impossible for them to explore or deepen their relationship. This story does seem to incorporate many of Yoshimoto’s thematic trademarks (sisters, comas, jokes about incest, cold male love interests), but given its brevity, it isn’t weighed down by them. I guess both stories in this collection are about letting go, reconciling yourself with past loves, and moving forward. Balancing melancholy with humor, Hardboiled & Hard Luck makes for a quick yet dreamy read....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jan 02, 2023","Jan 05, 2023","Dec 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50142.Hardboiled_Hard_Luck

In order to feel happy he had to feel everything.”A quietly crushing yet devastatingly tender work scintillating with insight and emotional intelligence. With acuity and empathy Hanna Jameson presents her readers with a captivating narrative chronicling four people’s attempts at happiness despite a looming health crisis: more and more people are literally sitting down and seemingly giving up on life. “He didn’t want to die, he just wanted to stop, to cease, sit down. Maybe just sleep, for a year or maybe forever.”Even more so than in her previous novel, The Last, Jameson bypasses the usual apocalyptic storylines, as she grounds her quietly dystopic concept firmly into reality. There is a minimalism to Jameson’s alternate/what if reality that brought to mind the subdued yet ominous world-building of authors such Kazuo Ishiguro, Emily St. John Mandel, Ling Ma, whose works are often characterized by a faintly ominous atmosphere. “Boy meets girl at a wedding and the world ends. The classic meetcute.”The novel opens at a wedding reception in NY, on a hot summer night. At first, we principally follow Yun, who is 29 and for years has been trying to make a living as a musician. He meets and is taken by Emory, a journalist who exudes wit and confidence. Their meet-cute comes to an abrupt halt when one of the s sits down and refuses to get back up. As the weeks go by, and Yun and Emory’s attraction blossoms solidify into something more solid, rumors of more and more cases reach Emory’s ears, and she decides to publish an article on the matter. This goes viral and she receives a lot of backlash. The lack of information on the whys and hows of “psychogenic catatonia” contribute to people’s growing panic and an avalanche of misinformation leads many to believe that psychogenic catatonia is either the beginning of the end or that it only affects ‘weak’ young people. Although Yun and Emory’s relationship eventually see them adopting the rhythms and routines of a couple, their dynamic shifts. Yun’s depression runs deep, casting everything around him with gloom. His self-doubt sees him pushing away those who care for him, such as Emory, his best-friend Andrew, and his own family. Perpetually dogged by his own sense of inadequacy, his growing self-absorption, even if of the miserable and negative variety, soon affects his empathy and well-being. “He wondered why he always seemed destined to be slightly too far ahead or too far behind his own life.”Emory on the other hand attempts to help him but as the world around her becomes more and more weighed by bad news, she also struggles to make sense of everything that is going on and the gnawing guilt she feels towards her article. For all her attempts to make things work and his longing to be happy, content even, their relationship continues to fray. “Emory couldn’t imagine what it felt like to inhabit space you truly owned. Cities were hostile to anyone who couldn’t count on the split rent and utilities of partnership. Being one person was more expensive than she had been taught to anticipate.”We later return to the wedding scene, except that this time we follow two different guests, Andrew and Fin. Both are there with their soon-to-be exes. They properly meet later on, in a gallery. Despite his best efforts, Andrew, a 31-year-old professor who has recently gone through a fairly amicable separation from his wife, finds himself falling for Fin. Not only does Andrew slowly come to terms with the desires and knowledge that he had so long suppressed, but he is wary of falling for Fin, a 20-year-old ballet student hailing from London. Fin too is filled with doubt, and seems always braced for the worst-case scenario, of Andrew’s inevitably disinterest, of failing at what he loves, of not being good enough. Yet, despite their worries, the two have fallen fast and hard for each other. As their relationship becomes more serious, Andrew and Yun’s friendship seems to come undone. “He wondered if a love not properly expressed mutated into something jagged and unwieldy like metal, something that could kill you.”As the characters contend with old and new hurts, hidden feelings, loneliness and longing, psychogenic catatonia continues to threaten their horizon. Jameson seamlessly switches points of view, often adopting a nonlinear narrative and or using foreshadowing to build and maintain tension. Her prose brought to mind Hanya Yanagihara, Donna Tartt, and Scott Spencer. Jameson’s prose effortlessly moves between registers: from presenting us with clear-cut and incisive descriptions (of the character’s feelings, thoughts, actions, and surroundings), to using her language to evoke with striking intimacy and poignancy the mood and nuances of a certain moment/scene. Jameson’s style maintains a balance between crisp yet opaque, at times eliciting in dazzling detail the state of mind of a character, at times allowing room for the ambiguous nature of her character’s fears and desires to shine. Her dialogues rang true to life, not only in their rhythms but in how they often revolved around or hinted at unspoken feelings. The setting, mostly ‘post’-covid NY, is brought to life. Jameson captures just how easy it is to feel lost and alone in such a city, while also incorporating discussions on current politics and on America’s healthcare service. Jameson presents us with a painfully realistic portrayal of depression: not only the many ways in which it manifests in the person affected but on its eventual effects on the people who love them; rather than indicting Yun, Jameson makes us feel for him. We eventually may grow saddened by his inability and unwillingness to accept other people’s help and the way he weaponizes his own hurt and disappointment. Despite the melancholic tone permeating much of this novel, there are so many moments and scenes that will fill readers’ hearts with hope and love. I was 100% invested in Andrew and Fin’s relationship, and seeing them be vulnerable with one another really pulled at my heartstrings. Andrew and Yun’s relationship also gave me all sorts of feelings, and I found myself filled with sorrow on their behalf.Jameson uses this ‘is the world ending?’ scenario as a backdrop to some profoundly poignant character studies and as a bouncing board to interrogate happiness, love, self-destruction, depression, suppressed and/or unrequited feelings and many more. I found Jameson’s examination of happiness thoroughly captivating. How some people set themselves up for failure and disappointment by never allowing themselves to be happy, always comparing what they have unfavourably with what they envisioned. Often, rather than wondering why they feel perpetual unhappy and dissatisfied, they blame others for not meeting their expectations. Or they hold others responsible for not making them ‘happy’. To cope with this constant sadness and satisfaction they make themselves believe that being with someone else or doing something else or being somewhere else is what will make them happy. Jameson captures the current zeitgeist, as she articulates her characters’ very contemporary malaises: from daily anxieties and depicts their experiences with precarious jobs and housing, the ever-present FOMO, ennui, and their growing nihilism at the world they live in. Many of the characters in this novel feel simultaneously unmoored yet stuck, overcome by their own impotence in face of psychogenic catatonia and a world that, against all odds, keeps going on. Psychogenic catatonia plays a symbolic role in the story, as those affected seem to be giving up on participating in life; no longer bound by social norms, they lash out at anyone who attempts to interfere with them, refusing to get up, talk or eat. Whether their ‘sitting down is an act of resistance or surrender, is a question that underlies much of the narrative. Throughout the novel, Jameson explores happiness, adulthood, loneliness, and connectedness. Her characters deal with failure, disappointment, and their own impotence, ‘smallness’, in the face of all that is going on in their world. I loved how many moments of vulnerability, kindness, and love we got. I also found myself relating very much with the many instances where characters are struggling to cope: with their own life, with their own unhappiness, and with taking accountability. Yun, Emory, Andrew, and Fin’s flaws and idiosyncrasies are what made them memorable and real. Although I am more of a Yun/Fin, Andrew had my heart. He was such a gem. His kindness, his alertness to other people's feelings, his selflessness…getting to know him was a delight. The narrative’s self-awareness adds to the story. Not only does Jameson touch upon the notion of ‘main character syndrome’ but she reflects on the concept of a narrative arc, examining stories' tendency to provide some sort of closure for their characters. Jameson resists doing this, which will inevitably annoy readers and I have to say that the what-ifs scenarios presented by the ending were the only thing that I did not love about this novel.Are You Happy Now makes for a deeply moving novel exploring the sadness and happiness of its main characters as they grapple with ordinary and extraordinary situations. While I was reading I felt many things: apprehension, joy, sadness, and tenderness. Are You Happy Now is a striking novel that for all the heartache it causes me, I look forward to revisiting again. PS: not a fan of the cover...it really doesn't have anything to do with the book's vibe.some quotes:And she thought, Oh shit, I really like him. Oh shit, because it was never a good time to realize you really liked someone. Realizing you really liked someone meant knowing on some level it was going to hurt.He was struck by the familiar feeling that someone else out there, or maybe several other people, were already living the life he was supposed to be living, were already living the life he was supposed to be living, because maybe he had been too slow or too unfocused, or just not good enough to attain it.I wanted you to be happy. I didn’t care what you were doing. It just got too much, watching you do the same thing over and over, and I realized you were never going to stop trying to become this imaginary version of yourself where you’re happy because you’re rich or signed to a big label or something huge like that. Even when things did go well, you were never happy because it wasn’t like this ultimate fantasy you already made up in your head. […] It was really hard to be around, to be with someone who was just never happy.He wondered if she had somehow felt it, felt him slipping away. But it wasn’t likely. She was just standing by him and searching for a way to help, like any normal person would. Like any good person. That’s my problem. Everyone feels like the right person, I can’t even tell the difference any more. I ride the subway and see someone reading a book I was just reading and think, Wow, maybe it’s you. It happens all the time. Someone looks at me and it’s just them. You know what I mean?Home is just a lie our brains tell us about permeance.He couldn’t stand to be looked at like he mattered, when mattering to someone was dangerous.Fin wanted with all the wide-eyed grasping of someone who’d never had, and no matter how viciously he polished the surface everyone could see it.Not because of age. Being in your thirties meant nothing. But by then, people tended to have acquired things that gradually cut them off from all the places […] they imagined more exciting lives were taking place. It was like he didn’t understand that relationships were all about power. They were about control, about who could endure the longest without visibly caring. Andrew was always giving his power away without a thought, like wasn’t ceding anything.As far as she could tell, what Yun wanted from his parents was impossible. He wanted them to have made him happy.Time will give you the illusion that you've put some distance between you and trauma, that you can stand up and walk away. But that time is elastic. The further you try to pull away, the harder it will snap you back. He couldn’t forgive them, for being human, for not getting parenthood right the first time, for not raising him better able to deal with this.Andrew waited at the bottom of the steps, wondering whether friendships burned out in the same way epidemics, hysterias and protestors do, then went up. You couldn’t actually tell people you just didn’t want to be with them any more. There had to be a better, more socially acceptable reason. By a force of habit, going back to childhood, he asked himself what part of the movie this was. The movie of his life. The main problem with his life-as-a-movie theory was that it wasn’t easy to apply to other people who weren’t the protagonists of his reality. What happened to everyone else?He wanted something too large and all-encompassing to articulate, and even if he had known what he wanted, he didn’t know how to ask. How do you ask someone if you can go back? Asking if you could both go back was too much to ask of anybody, certainly too much to ask of someone who was moving forward. He could ask for anything but more time, to go back and right that misstep....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Dec 15, 2022","Dec 17, 2022","Dec 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61028436-are-you-happy-now

Sadly, it seems that this creative duo is just not for me. In She Eats the Night we follow twins and restaurant co-owners, Milly and Billy. In addition to the difficulties of keeping their business afloat they also have to contend themselves with their parents’ annual visit. Ipo and Keon, who left Hong Kong for America hoping that their children would ‘prosper’, wonder whether they have shielded them too much. While Keon is more of a laid-back kind of father figure, Ipo is shows little empathy or interest in her children, and most panels show her scowling or looking hard-edged (no doubt these are meant to make her look intriguing and badass but to me, it just made her overly callous and even difficult to take seriously). Ipo enlists Milly and Billy to clean up the house next door, which exudes bad vibes. Although this is listed as a horror, and there are some scenes that are meant to inspire fear/unease in readers, I just found the overall tone and direction of the story to be very corny. A lot of scenes and dialogues exist only to confuse us, readers, when it comes to Ipo and Keon’s motivations (what are they hiding? how do they know about this house? why are putting their children in danger?). I just wasn’t a fan of the parents or their dynamic. The twins were bland and mostly there to react to the weird things that are happening in their lives.I am afraid that She Eats the Night was not the kind of horror graphic novel I was hoping it would be. The dialogues are clunky, the art style didn’t really grab me, and the story is trying too hard for this ambiguous vibe that ultimately comes across as trying too hard to be mysterious.

This book reminds me of this sketch by Fry & Laurie, where they make fun of the type of tourists who don’t see themselves as tourists. I found Fine’s vision of Venice and Italian characters laughable. Sprinkling in Italian words does not make your work more authentic (especially if said words don’t ring true: “They’ll go together, tutte due”....). And why oh why make the choice to refer to il lido as “The Lido”...? Just call it “the Lido” or since you decided to leave “La Serenissima” as is, do the same and call it “il Lido”. Anyway, I found the prose affected and the dialogues ​​unconvincing. In a way, I was reminded of The World Cannot Give, a book I did not care for in the least. Anyhow, this was a major disappointment. Maybe non-Italian readers, or less nitpicking readers, will find it to be a blast but I found the dynamics to be trying and failing to go for that Sarah Waters vibe....more",Notes are private!,0,16,0,not set,not set,"Dec 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61884841-maddalena-and-the-dark

We simply have the privilege of coming into contact with it every once in a while.” The dreamlike mood permeating this short story by Mieko Kawakami is reminiscent of Elisabeth Thomas’s Catherine House, Sylvia Plath, and Fleur Jaeggy’s Sweet Days of Discipline. The idyllic scenery is counterpointed by Marie’s disenchantment. We learn that, alongside other girls, she stays at Mia dormitory, a place which, unlike her home, is safe. A former lover, Karen, wants to know if Marie really loved her, and this leads to a discussion on love, God, transcendence. The story also touches on the grief experienced by Anna, a guardian at Mia dormitory, over her one-year-old daughter's sudden death. With clarity Kawakami renders Anna’s sorrow, allowing Marie’s feelings to be more opaque, ambivalent even.Despite the story’s short scope, Kawakami is able to capture Anna's grief and Marie’s alienation and loneliness. 'Marie’s Proof of Love' makes for a contemplative piece that is at once intriguing and poignant. “Marie’s proof of love was a sentimental cliché. But she had arrived at it herself. To give shape to her unformulated thoughts was an arduous task as if she were performing surgery on her own body, grasping what lay whirling around her throat, cutting and sewing them into words.”You can read this story here....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 16, 2022","Dec 16, 2022","Dec 02, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/56656336-marie-s-proof-of-love

What he and all the other people on this site were doing was harvesting such moments, no“Life was full of such moments, the self momentarily exposed. What he and all the other people on this site were doing was harvesting such moments, not through happenstance or spontaneity but using some apparatus of mass production.”This latest release by Brandon Taylor reads less like an elaboration and expansion of those themes and dynamics we can find in his previous works and more like a rehash that sadly doesn’t feel as focused, cohesive, or satisfying as neither Real Life nor Filthy Animals. That is not to say that this was an entirely ‘unsatisfying’ read but since I have come to hold Taylor in high esteem and I ‘just’ expected something more from him. In many ways, The Late Americans suffers from an identity crisis: does it want to be a coming-of-age novel following a group of grad students, friends supposedly, a la Real Life? Does it want to be a series of interlinked short stories like Filthy Animals? Could it be both? Maybe, but The Late Americans struck me as a somewhat clumsy attempt at merging these two different structures. With the exception of Seamus, each character is given one single chapter that favors their perspective. These chapters however felt somewhat unfinished, not quite meandering but unfocused, in a way that the short stories in Filthy Animals certainly didn’t. Not only do the many characters populating this novel all happen to have names that are a rarity, or at least not particularly used, in America (seamus, ivan, fyodor, goran, timo), but most of them seemed to be stuck in relationships with all-too-similar fraught dynamics, share the same area of studies or are in the same field (for instance, we have several dancers), and respond and articulate themselves in a manner that seemed strangely alike. If Taylor had focused on a smaller group of friends, like in A Little Life, as opposed to including a couple of people who are ‘friends’ and then some acquaintances or friends-of-friends, maybe then I would have felt more invested in these characters’ lives and their relationships with each other. While I was making my slow way through this I kept thinking how less impactful Happy Together would have been if it had focused on several dysfunctional couples/people rather than honing in on the perspective of three people. But before I ramble on about the story, and why it ultimately didn't come together (for me), I want to praise Taylor’s style. His unadorned and exacting language intensifies the oppressive, uneasy, dynamics and situations that he explores throughout his narrative. The people Taylor writes of are lonely, unable or unwilling to express themes, their desires, and their fears, and often end up sabotaging their own happiness or their relationships by pushing people away or by picking up fights with them. Many of them are post-grads or in their late twenties and unsure of how to go from their lives as students, to the ‘real world’. Taylor touches on a lot of everyday issues and worries that preoccupy people in their twenties. Are they okay with the person they are? Is the path they are on the one they really want? What do they want out of a relationship? Taylor’s characters seem to perpetually long for connection but are unable to actually see, listen, and make themselves vulnerable to others. Miscommunication, perceived and real slights, insecurity, and jealousy, all of these add tension to the relationships they have with their friends and lovers. Taylor is unremitting when it comes to identifying and probing his character’s flaws, and when doing so he often adopts a clinically detached tone. Yet, despite the cold and impersonal language, there is also a vulnerability, an intimacy even, in the way he hones in on those feelings and thoughts. I will always love the way Taylor is able to articulate and capture those more opaque aspects of a person’s psyche, allowing, when necessary, for ambiguity. Taylor also has a knack for portraying uncomfortable, stultifying interactions, be it an encounter/exchange between two people or a scene taking place at a party or in a class. The discomfort at times it’s almost palpable, and it isn’t always clear what causes this but this uneasiness between his characters is certainly felt, all of the time. I appreciated how Taylor's portrayals of love and friendship are often unforgiving, in that they contain more moments of ugliness, pettiness, and selfishness than say kinship, trust, and kindness. Like in Filthy Animals, Taylor often draws parallels between his characters and animals, ‘beasts’, in a way that is not dehumanizing but that allows us to glimpse, and feel even, the intensity of what his characters are feeling. In addition to being able to bring his readers uncomfortably close to his characters, Taylor can switch to a panoramic view of the people populating his narrative, so that we see them as ‘mere’ players of a larger game, and we realize just how little control they have, or they feel they have, over their own lives.“These sundry interruptions and redactions, all the skirmishes and misdirection. Like a dog finally catching its tail and chewing it down to the gristle.”Whereas I read Real Lifeand Filthy Animals over a short period of time, as I found myself invested in the characters’ lives, The Last Americans was less compelling. With the exception of Seamus and Fyodor, I wasn’t drawn to the characters. Timo and Goran, these two guys were very much the same, and their (supposed) friendship only exacerbated my confusion. Then we have the dancers, Ivan and Noah (i think it was them), who are involved with people who, to put it simply, don’t treat them right. Ivan’s partner disapproves of Ivan earning money through pornography, yet he doesn’t seem particularly close or interested in Ivan himself, whereas Noah is with an older guy who resents younger gay generations.There are three main ‘couples’, and the conflict between them was very much the same. They have different upbringings, different levels of education, different values, and they want different things in life.Later on, we get two chapters from two women, and these read like a belated inclusion of a female's perspective in this otherwise male-dominated novel. Taylor is more uncertain, and tentative even, when it comes to their characterization, whereas he allows his male characters to be messier.The character I felt the most invested in also happened to be the one we are probably meant to find least likeable, Seamus. The guy is a sad asshole, a white gay guy with poor social skills who happens to antagonize or set others on edge. Yet, what can I say, I find pathetic characters like Seamus strangely compelling (at one point we get this: ""Seamus liked to be used this way. Sometimes he thought the only things he really needed in life were poetry and to be occasionally held down and fucked like dogmeat."" and ""It was a guy with reddish hair and sad brown eyes. He didn’t look like he belonged to anyone.""). He gets two chapters, and I was fooled into believing that because of this we would be given by no means a neat resolution to his arc, but something more satisfying than what we got. Instead, he seems merely forgotten after his second chapter, in a way that was unkind.A lot of his chapters are sadly wasted on detailing his experiences in this poetry class he goes to. I have said it before, and I will say it again, I am not a fan of creative writing spaces. But I would rather be in one than have to read a fictionalized writing/poetry class/seminar because, more often than not, the authors present us with caricatures of the kind of people that would be in these places. They use meaningless artspeak, usually, they attack the mcs writing or invalidate their work, they feel the need to use performative language to appear morally superior and so on. Sure, in real life, you might get one, two, or even three people, in your class who use buzzwords to appear more enlightened than others and wear edgy tote bags that announce that they don’t give a shit about your ‘fragile masculinity’ or whatever, but a whole class?I just didn't get the point of those scenes. In a way we are meant to see just how wrapped up in himself Seamus is, how he often expresses himself in a way that riles people up, and of his struggles to produce poems that conform to his peers’ expectations: they see poems as inherently personal and political, a cathartic art form, a way to talk about their traumas and personal experiences, whereas Seamus finds the idea of mining his past or drawing from his own personal experiences as banal (i guess he is more of an art for art’s sake kind of guy). The tension between him and the rest of the class had potential, but Taylor goes too heavy-handed in his characterisation of these women who Seamus calls ‘witches’ (something that is meant to emphasize how childish and on the defensive he is with them but frankly felt fitting). They are insufferable. Horrible even but in a way that comes across as less ‘clever satire’ and more ‘unfunny caricature’…in fact I found Taylor’s portrayal of these women to be devoid of subtlety, worse, mean-spirited even, the kind of sketch that you’d expect from people who will go and on about ‘wokeness’ and ‘man-hating feminist’ who are liable to 'screech' 'stop oppressing me' whenever a totally decent guy is just being nice. Whenever Seamus would open his mouth, sure, sometimes to make some provocative comment, things would just escalate in a less credible way than say the other fights and disagreements that populate this novel. Seamus writes a poem about the war, (i or ii, I cannot recall), about a nun (i think it was a nun), and expresses frustration with the way the other poets in his class elevate and romanticize trauma (i also hate the kind of thinking that leads some to see trauma as character-building or a source of ‘depth’ or ‘specialness’...), this leads to him being accused of being racist, misogynist, victim-blaming, and so on. Sure, traumatic experiences can lead to the production/creation of cathartic art, and this can help someone heal or take ‘control’, or whatever, but here the women are unanimous in their consensus that trauma leads to meaningful art and that if you express negative or critical feedback is you are invalidating the poet’s experiences etc. I think that there was potential to have a discussion about what art is and what art ought to be, but Taylor makes these women into such obvious one-note figures that I had very hard time 'believing' in them, let alone the opinions they expressed. Anyway, ironically enough, as they accuse Seamus of this and that and make disparaging comments about him and his poetry, they are themselves doing the ‘invalidating’.I just hated these scenes, the women were too cartoonish, in their ganging up on Seamus, one of the only two male poets (at one point one continues to tell him ‘you don’t get to speak to me’). I wanted to learn more about him, to see him at his job where he makes clumsy attempts at talking to his colleagues, to see him outside of that cursed poetry class.Yet, despite my hating the way Taylor portrayed this class, I did find Seamus to be the most well-developed character. He is very much flawed, lost, and seems resentful of the notion that being ‘privileged’. I found his two chapters to be compelling, despite feeling uneasy about him or the way he behaves with others.“But no one had a happy childhood. No one had a good life. Human pain existed in a vast supply, and people took from it like grain from a barn. There was pain for you and pain for you and pain for you— agony enough for everyone. The pain of his childhood was of such a common source that it embarrassed him. Perhaps it was this that he resented in the work of his peers. It wasn’t that their lives were worse than his or that his life was better than theirs— it was that they all had the same pain , the same hurt, and he didn’t think anyone should go around pretending it was something more than it was: the routine operation of the universe. Small, common things— hurt feelings, cruel parents, strange and wearisome troubles.”The other character that stood out was Fyodor. He is a ‘townie’ who works at a ‘leaner’ in a beef plant, and he is in an on-and-off again relationship with Timo, who Fyodor describes as “irritatingly middle class” and who often picks fights with Fyodor over his job, how unethical it is, and so forth. The two are in a love/hate relationship, drifting apart, arguing over petty nothing-things, breaking up, missing each other, getting back together, and reverting to the same tired cycle where neither feels understood by the other. Sadly Fyodor is also forgotten even if we glimpse or hear of him in later chapters.“Loving people was hard. It was difficult sometimes to believe that they were good. It was hard to know them. But that didn’t mean you could just go on without trying. What he believed was that love was more than just kindness and more than just giving people the things they wanted. Love was more than the parts of it that were easy and pleasurable. Sometimes love was trying to understand. Love was trying to get beyond what was hard. Love, love, love.”The other lads, well. With the exception of the two girls, whose povs felt strangely ‘sanitized’ compared to the men, read very much too samey. I had a hard time distinguishing these guys from one another, and this wasn’t helped by the way they seem to use the same imagery or vocabulary to evaluate and understand the world around them, their sense of self, the currents of their relationships, sexual and non, and so forth. I just wished the novel could have focused on a smaller cast of characters, maybe switching between Fyodor and Seamus, or focusing on an actual group of friends because the whole dancer group did not strike me as actual friends.While I do appreciate how Taylor explores power dynamics, codependency, alienation, loneliness, destructiveness, ennui, race and class disparities, as well as his cutting social commentary. As always he demonstrates a penchant for those inscrutable, occasionally petty, sometimes nasty feelings and urges that lead fights, heartaches, and misery. Yet, Taylor's critique of academia and his observation on the 'real world', lacked the urgency and depth of his other works....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Feb 03, 2023","Feb 06, 2023","Dec 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62092265-the-late-americans

The Salt Grows Heavy is a tantalizing novella that will very much appeal to fans of Neil Gaiman & Catherynne M. Valente. Khaw’s dark yet delicious prose really emphasizes the fairytalesque ambience of their narrative. The dynamic at the heart of this novella is captivating as we follow a mermaid and a plague doctor who, without giving too much away, have been put through the wringer. I was actually reminded of Juliet Marillier’s series Blackthorn & Grim, which also follows ‘older’ characters who slowly begin to find solace in one another.The novella’s weakness lies in its plot. I found myself far more interested in learning more of the central duo’s pasts and exploring their present circumstances, than the whole plot line involving the creepy children. Sure, I appreciated that Khaw is able to use a fairytale lens to explore abuse, without romanticizing said abuse, there was something about it that was oddly…peter-pan-esque..and it was just jarring given the novella’s overall dark and gritty tones. Khaw’s prose now and again does seem to be trying too hard to be edgy, so we end up with these convoluted sentences that are trying to be sensual and striking but ultimately struck me contrived and purple (e.g. “The hand, this time, is flavored with copper, its cartilage fractures like glass; the heart is a mouthful of brine and fermented raspberry; the eyes burst into effervescence, peculiarly tasteless”; also, a pet-peeve of mine is the unnecessary use of the word chiaroscuro…and khaw does exactly that).

Trinity is given barely any page time, we aren’t given a proper glimpse into her childhood or teenage years but we are transported to her life as an adult which not so subtly echoes Oz’s own story (pushing away/hurting the ones you love and all that ‘relatable’ jazz) and is weighed down by her daddy issues.

Her own ambitions and passions are hinted at but only superficially.Maybe I wouldn’t have minded the predictable turns taken by their storylines if say their relationship to Oz had been portrayed with depth, nuance even….but that’s not the case (of course, my take on this will inevitably differ from other readers’). Anyhow, serious topics, affecting one of these two characters, which include alcoholism, SA, and depression, are depicted in a way that ultimately places Y at the center stage. The novel is in fact not about Deborah or Trinity’s experiences but Oz’s trauma. His big secret leads him to make the poor choices he makes…Deborah’s own traumas are sidelined or made to seem ripples caused by Oz’s much more ‘important’ traumatic past. And I couldn’t help but feel as if the novel was going down the very tired and sexist route where women, who can cry whenever they feel like it, cannot possibly understand a man’s traumas or feelings, which are portrayed as more complex, to the point of being mythologised and mystified. The narrative itself uses Deborah’s own trauma to put Oz in a heroic light….never-mind that he later sabotages the people closest to them. His homophobia and possessiveness are made to seem natural consequences of his boyhood...maybe if we had been given snippets from his mother and brother’s pov we could have had a more encompassing view of his family situation and I would have felt a little bit more sympathetic towards him but as things stand I hated his guts…the story exonerates him from being truly held accountable for his shitty by going down the whole 'self-sacrifice=he was a good person all along' route. Dio mio. This was a chore to read. I was infuriated by Oz, by the way, the story deals with trauma, abuse, and addiction, and by the way the narrative ultimately condones his character’s behavior.

Alas, not only did I find its world-building to be thinly generic, but the plot was predictable, worst still, we follow a character who is meant to come across as cool and badass, but seemed to me little other than a self-righteous and annoying asshole. The novella takes place on a ship that harbors ‘the last of humanity’ who are making their way to Earth…Jacklyn Albright is acting as Captain in her father’s stead. She makes tough calls with little to no hesitation, even if these result in the death of those who are more disadvantaged and or taking a stand against the hierarchies within the ship. Things become particularly dire at the discovery of something ‘other’ being aboard the ship, something that soon enough seems intent on shedding blood. The premise had potential, between the enclosed setting, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and the ‘unknown’ threat within. Sadly, much of the novella is wasted on Jacklyn being a really dull character. Most of her interactions are with this AI, I believe that it went by Watson, whom she mistreats for way too long. I couldn’t account for Watson’s devotion to Jacklyn, sure, she is the acting Captain but I wonder why Watson gives little thought to the actual Captain (who is a non-character really). I also hated that similarly to two other books (The King of Crows and Chain of Thorns), Brown relies on a ‘supposedly’ ominous message in order to create and maintain suspense…but I find this trick little other than a cheap gimmick. Especially when, as to be expected, the main characters ignore the message, then waste time thinking about it, and by the time their brain is making the right connections shit has already hit the fan.

These books focus on women in their 20s, sometimes their 30s, who are unable or unwilling to reconcile themselves to life; so they drift, unmoored from others, alienated from social conventions and expectations, their passivity occasionally giving way to something nastier, more misanthropic, yet they remain mired by ennui, burdened by a sense of otherness. If they have a boyfriend he is either too kind, too well-adjusted, or he is the opposite, a right wanker. Their solipsistic nature and self-sabotaging tendencies make them into bad friends, yet, they are desperately lonely and often long to be someone else, someone happy, someone capable of traversing the murky waters of adulthood like other people seem to do. While you could easily argue that once you read a few of these books, you’ve read them all, they do often implement an element or revolve around a specific event that differentiates them from one another. In the quintessential she's-not-feeling-too-good book, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, the main character plans on sleeping for an entire year. In Woman, Eating the protagonist is a vampire. In Everyone in This Room Will Someday Be Dead the narrator is death-obsessed. You get the gist.“Other people’s joys have always seemed more solid to me than my own. I’ve never trusted happiness, have trouble with the very notion of it.”What makes or breaks these books is the protagonist. I find characters who are flawed to be compelling, even when they are as nasty as the unnamed narrator in MYORAR or self-destructive like the leads in Luster and in You Exist Too Much. Sure, not all of the main characters populating this subgenre have that dark, mordant, sense of humor that makes their social commentary and internal monologue so wickedly funny and on point. Some, like Writers & Lovers by Lily King, Win Me Something by Kyle Lucia Wu, and Tell Me I'm an Artist by Chelsea Martin, present us with narratives that are more grounded in reality, and characterized by a sad, occasionally wistful tone. And to some extent, Sea Change offers something to that effect as it is quietly reflective work. However, it ultimately felt flat, insubstantial, and monotonous, in a way that the books I just mentioned by King, Wu, and Martin didn't.“No one is going to fix you for you, I thought to myself when I got home, giving myself a good hard stare in my bathroom mirror. But like all revelations, it didn’t last long.” Ro is in her early thirties and has been working the same ‘menial’ job at the same mall aquarium her father, a marine biologist, used to take her to visit. There, he introduced Ro to Dolores, a giant Pacific octopus. After her father is declared missing during an expedition, Ro latches onto Dolores, seeing her remaining link to her father. Over the years, Ro’s unwillingness to change, to break away from her lonely routine, pushes away her boyfriend, Tae, who leaves her to train for a mission to Mars, and Yoonhee, once her best friend. Estranged from her mother, Ro often spends her nights drinking herself into being numb, removed from heartbreak and grief. After Ro learns that the aquarium is planning on selling Doloros to a rich investor, who will move her to his private aquarium, she slips further into depression and grows resentful of her mother and Yoonhee. She longs for her father, often imagining what-if scenarios, where they are eventually reunited. “In the end, I know, no amount of wishful thinking can ever bring him back, and nothing we say or do or promise to one another can inoculate us against loss or leaving. But in the meantime, there is still so much of this world to see and hold on to, to care for and care about, to love in spite of— or because of— the fact that none of us are here for very long.”Like most she's-not-feeling-too-good books, Sea Change is definitely not plot-oriented. The story instead sets out to immerse us in Ro’s life. Similarly to Win Me Something and You Exist Too Much, there are chapters giving us insight into her childhood and her adolescence, where we gain not only an understanding of the dynamic between Ro and her parents, but we see how her idealization of her father often saw her dismissing her mother’s feelings. We also how Ro’s friendship with Yoonhee has never been easy, or smooth, as her friend seems to find Ro’s more introverted nature a ‘downer’. And, of course, we also get to see the making and unmaking of Ro’s relationship with her ex. Facts about animals, be it penguins or octopuses, are interjected through the narrative, and there is even this water-motif that succeeds in making certain scenes or thoughts more evocative. “Some days, wandering through the aquarium’s blue halls, I start feeling like maybe I don’t exist, like my body is just this translucent membrane for water and light to rush through, day in and day out, just like all the other creatures here.”But the more I read the more I found the whole past/present chapter structure predictable and so Ro’s ‘journey’. I kept waiting to feel something more, to be surprised even. But Ro’s story unfolds in a very conventional way. The people around her never come into focus, so those moments of fracture and/or of reconciliation felt underminingly flat. Sure, the author succeeds in articulating the worries and uncertainties many people feel when they feel that their adult life is not going how it should, or when they feel unlike other people, they will never be able to ‘fucntion’, to be ‘normal’. But much about Ro and her story felt ‘safe’, I wanted more opaqueness, more ambiguity, just more, especially from Ro herself. Her strained, eventually tentative, bond with her mother was a much more compelling dynamic than her relationships with Yoonhee and ex. We see how Ro's loyalty to her father, pushed away her mother, and we see how things like generational and cultural differences as well as a language barrier can be both a source of tension between mother and daughter but eventually allow them to recognise the ways they have both failed to really see each other. I wanted more of that, less drama about her friend getting married and Ro not being supportive. Or the whole ex going to Mars thing. That whole thing was just a gimmick. Then again, I recognise that having read my way through many of these books and having even spent months of my life writing a dissertation on a selected few of them, I may have simply been overexposed to this type of story. The focus on the aquarium, on animals, on Dolores, which should have made Sea Change stand out against a lot of similar ‘alienated-disaster-woman’ type of books, actually brought to mind Mindy Mejia's The Dragon Keeper, which I read a couple of years back. So, maybe if you haven’t read that one or if you have simply read only a couple of books with this type of ‘vibe’, maybe then you'll find Sea Change to be a less conventional read than I was.“If every hurtful or careless thing we ever said to one another manifested itself visually in the body. Would we be any different than how we are now? Would we do more to protect each other, ourselves?”...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Jan 21, 2023","Jan 23, 2023","Dec 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61387972-sea-change

Maybe I have read too many female-driven thriller-esque stories where the mc’s sister (occasionally best-friend, sometimes her mother) is dead and or has disappeared and in their search for answers they find themselves going to their childhood home or revisiting their past. As I was reading Bad Cree I found myself waiting for something to happen, for the storyline to flesh out the characters’ personalities, to deepen the characters’ relationships, and to elaborate the worldbuilding, but the narration remains fairly superficial, more interested in maintaining suspense and drawing out the mystery. Our main protagonist could have been made into an interesting, nuanced even, character, but she very much exists to push the story forward. There are glimpses of something more, in terms of her character and her relationship and role within her family, for instance, she believes that she is often on the outskirts of her family, a spectator to unfolding conversations and drama. Her friendship with Joli also could have added a much-needed level of warmth and intimacy to the story, but upsettingly enough soon after Mackenzie’s return to Alberta, Joli is pushed to the sidelines and seemingly forgotten (which makes our mc into a rather crappy friend) for plot reasons.The novel follows Mackenzie, a young Cree woman who after the death of her kokum and Sabrina, her sister has been laying low in Vancouver where she works as a cashier. That is until her dreams and reality begin to coalesce. Her recurring dreams eventually reveal a pattern that leads to a night when her sisters, Sabrina and Tracey, and their cousin, were camping by the lake. Something happened, something that has Mackenzie feeling guilty and confused. Eventually, persuaded by her aunt and Joli, Mackenzie takes time off work and returns to her hometown where at first she tries her best to assuage her loved ones that all is well and that her dreams are no longer encroaching on her reality, but she soon realizes that ignoring the problem won’t make it disappear. As she confides in her family, she learns that all of them have been hiding something, and their dreams may be all pointing to that night and that something may be indeed after them.The narrative maintains its initial suspense however I kept waiting for things to be taken up a notch, for the tension to be amped up, which doesn’t seem to happen. There are elements that could have been scary but they are executed in a rather anticlimactic way. Mackenzie’s grief and her decision not to return home after her sister’s death are certainly touched upon, but I found myself wishing for more depth, or at least, more page time spent on unpacking or elaborating these themes and on conveying Mackenzie’s inner voice. While reading it I was brought to mind Monkey Beach, which is an underrated gem, and a recent release, Erika T. Wurth’s White Horse, which also dabbles in horror.Overall Bad Cree was by no means a ‘bad’ read but I did find it ultimately rather forgettable and unsatisfying. Don’t take my word for it, as we know, YMMV, so if you are interested in this debut I recommend you give it a try....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Jan 11, 2023","Jan 13, 2023","Nov 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60839741-bad-cree

Within these 13 chapters, bell hooks interrogates love (what does it mean to love someone? how does love look?) against the backdrop of her contemporary America. In a capitalistic society that promotes consumerism and individualism, where does love fit?I did find the first few chapters to be insightful and relevant: hooks writes about the false ideas of love promoted by the media, which either present us with an idealized vision of familiar and romantic love or romanticize abusive dynamics and patterns of behavior. She writes at length about how within many families children are subjected to confusing notions and versions of love: from abusive parents telling their children that they are abusing them because they love them or treating them as property/things. Here she also touches on lying, why and how we lie, how we teach children not to lie but we lie ourselves, or how women may choose to lie in order to navigate patriarchal structures. I did find some of what she wrote on lying to be a bit ...not quite sanctimonious but her understanding of the act of lying seemed a bit sanitized, in that there wasn’t much room for nuance. Sure, the dichotomy between lies and truth can be very black and white, but I do believe that truth telling should not always triumph over lying and that lying isn't always inherently wrong/bad.hooks writes about self-love, differentiating this practice from the narcissism and self-centeredness we associate with it. She also writes about consumerism, faith, honesty, and loss. hooks attempts to clarify the multivalent nature of love and why we find it so difficult to talk about it. Sadly, we then have essays that pretty much killed my initial enthusiasm for hooks’ writing. I understand that these relatively short essays don't allow for much depth but I found hooks' exploration of class, consumerism, and status as well as her take on unequal power dynamics simplistic at best...from implying that Nicole Simpson was responsible for her own murder because she was unwilling to quit her ""superficially glamorous lifestyle"" to viewing the Clinton–Lewinsky affair as wholly consensual and saying that Lewinsky ""prostituted"" herself to the media. The way she wrote about people who are in relationships with addicts or abusive individuals or whose children are involved in criminal activities also struck me as shallow and moralistic. The disappointment and later on anger that I felt at hooks’ misreadings and generalizations of these dynamics and situations made me wish I’d never picked up this book in the first place. I may not know what love is but I know that I am not keen on hooks' definitions of love....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Nov 28, 2022","Dec 09, 2022","Nov 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/218042.All_About_Love

It had its moments, and early oI should have not waited so long to  this as it seems that The Guest failed to leave a lasting impression on me. It had its moments, and early on in the narrative Emma Cline’s storytelling carried echoes of authors like Shirley Jackson and Patricia Highsmith. Alex is in her twenties, and for the past few years, she has been drifting along, using people around her to make ends meet. She doesn’t want or, or doesn’t even consider, the possibility of working a job like her peers, rather she manages to get by dating older men. These transactional relationships are not a reliable source of income, as the men in question either find a younger more attractive girl or begin to see cracks in Alex’s acting. After a fall-out with an on-again-off-again boyfriend and becoming persona non grata in her shared flat, Alex jumps at the opportunity to get out of New York. She tags along her latest man who is going for a break at his place on Long Island. There Alex makes a misstep that sees her falling out of his ‘graces’. Unwilling to return to her old place and knowing that her ex is out to get her, Alex decides that she will win this latest guy over by showing up to this guy's party (was it for the 4th of july? i can't recall), which is a week away. In the meantime she drifts, insinuating herself at parties, willing to deceive whoever so she can just stay in Long Island till the following week.  The premise definitely brought to mind Tom Ripley, and as I said, there were definitely some similarities not only between him and Alex but the author’s style, which at times comes across as detached, clinical even. This certainly contributes to the stories’ atmosphere of unease, as in both The Talented Mr. Ripley and The Guest we have narratives that are pervaded by ambivalence. The emptiness, alienation, and ennui experienced by Alex brought to mind authors like Shirley Jackson (especially when it came to alex being ‘expelled’ from the various places she drifts through), Danzy Senna, and Sabina Murray. Sadly, after an intriguing opening The Guest flatlines. The story unnecessarily drags on Alex’s fallout with her ex. Additionally, Alex ends up spending most of her time with this boy, who is rather sheltered and nerdy. The dynamic between them brought to mind BP, a book I abhor. Some scenes struck me as trying a bit too hard to be edgy and shocking (when i have read very similar ones in milk fed). I understand to a certain extent that the narrative is trying to reflect Alex’s worldview, her apathy, numbness, and boredom. But I found myself craving more from her and the story. I wasn’t expecting Barbara Vine's levels of psychological undercurrents but something more than this…which was very much all vibes. I wouldn’t have minded if the vibes in question were worth it. Ultimately I guess I was too aware of the various stylistic and plot devices at work in this book, so I had a hard time becoming immersed in the narrative. Alex’s girlbossing gaslighting gatekeeping was tedious. The one thing I appreciated about her is that the narrative doesn’t give her a sob backstory, as Eliza Clark does in Boy Parts, to make her ‘wickedness’ more palatable. Still, compared to Maria in Senna's New People and Katherine in Murray's A Carnivore's Inquiry, Alex just wasn't a particularly fascinating character, despite the narrative attempts to paint this ambiguous figure. Perhaps readers who haven't come across the works that I have mentioned in this  will find this novel to be more captivating than I was....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Feb 25, 2023","Feb 28, 2023","Oct 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61986136-the-guest

This past summer I was very much taken by Limón’s latest collection, The Hurting Kind, so much so that I was keen to make my way through her backlist. In Bright Dead Things Limón showcases not only her skill for language, but her ability to breathe life into words and sentences. From the gorgeously rendered , or otherwise striking, imagery underlining most of the poems in this collection to the understated yet captivating reflections on life, nature, memory and connection. One does not so much read Limón’s poems, as experiences them. There is a lushness to her description, and the rhythm created by her words feels like a breeze. The images, memories, and feelings she conveys within these poems are tinged by melancholy, which renders them all the more affecting. I admire the way within this collection, and at times within the same poem, Limón is able to shift between introspection, where what she writes feels very intimate and specific to her, to observations about nature, and questions related to life and death. A truly stunning collection that was able to simultaneously draw me away from my reality and make me reflect on all of the big and the little things that make-up every-day life.

Not only widespread slaughter, but the necessary accompaniment of gorging.”Unapologetically solipsistic and deeply manipulative, Katherine, the central character of A Carnivore's Inquiry, makes for an awful human being and a deeply entertaining narrator. A predecessor to Ottessa Moshfegh and Mona Awad’s protagonists, and many of the young women from the 'She's Not Feeling Good at All' subgenre, Katherine is a ceaselessly sardonic and relentlessly remorseless narrator with a predilection for histories and representations of cannibalism.“I was one of those people who made up for what she lacked in talent with her father’s money.”Katherine is 23 and has arrived in New York after an extended trip to Italy. She is young, attractive, and from wealth. However, she has no interest in reconnecting with her father, a man she thinks rarely of, and never with any particular fondness. Her mother has been in and out of institutions all her life, and glimpses into Katherine’s childhood reveal just how unstable she was. But Katherine is not prone to melancholy, or at least, if she thinks of the past, it is not her past that she longs or feels for, rather, she is fascinated by tales and accounts of cannibals, cannibalism itself, and nurtures a troublesome, perverse even, admiration for colonialist and their violence and usurpation against native communities. She’s often awed by accounts of violence, of madness, and of death, recounting and reimagining many of these episodes, often adopting the point of view of the person who inflicted violence upon others, or went mad, or was put in a situation where cannibalism was the only means of survival.“I find it hard to feel bad for Hansel. It’s the witch I feel for.”Katherine sets her sights on an older man, a fairly well-off writer Boris. Her momentary interest in Boris seems a consequence of boredom and a monetary desire. Soon she grows tired of Boris, a rather pathetic yet nasty person, who makes the mistake of thinking himself cleverer than her. Katherine convinces him to buy a house in rural Maine, a town that happens to have a killer on a loose. Far from bothered by this, Katherine seems comforted by the idea of this killer. Eventually, she finds herself travelling to Mexico City, and later returning to New York where she comes across some unwelcome familiar faces.As her restlessness sees her hitting the road, she forms unlikely friendships with random men she meets on her travels. All the while, bodies keep piling up wherever she goes.“[I]n our culture there was a weird enthusiasm for cannibalism. Cannibalism was a big thrill as long as we weren’t doing it.”While we know from the start that something is off about Katherine, we don’t really know just how unreliable a narrator she is. She often says and does exactly what she wants when she wants, has no trouble striking up conversations with strangers and is not put off by people not liking her. Her disregard for social niceties and norms makes her a character that is always able to surprise you. Her blithe responses to the odd, occasionally disturbing, circumstances she finds herself in are pure gold. Yet, despite knowing and being confronted with her strangeness, she retains a hypotonic quality. Her ambiguous nature drew me in, as I found myself eager to learn what was truly going on. Who is responsible for these deaths? Why is Katherine obsessed with cannibalism? What is at the root of her ennui? “After a few hurdles, my life would achieve a stunning, appealing normalcy.”Adroit, dark, and wickedly funny, A Carnivore's Inquiry is a riveting tale. The plot, however meandering, reflects Katherine’s restlessness. Aloof, duplicitous, and hungry for experience Katherine uses those around her as she pleases, both for materialistic gain and to pass away time. The novel’s historical and artistic discourses brought to mind the work of María Gainza, as here too we are given in-depth insights into art pieces and historical figures. I found A Carnivore's Inquiry's exploration of taboos, cannibalism, and violence to be sharp and subversive. I appreciated how Sabina Murray upends traditional power dynamics and challenges notions of normalcy and likeability. Her commentary on consumerism, colonialism, power structures, the ‘elite’, NY’s art and literary scene, femininity, and privilege was sly and thrilling. “The needs of appetite justified everything.”A Carnivore's Inquiry makes for a unique read, a rare treat. Not only is A Carnivore's Inquiry rich thematically but stylistically. Murray constantly keeps her readers on their toes as she shifts from genres (gothic, thriller, satire) and tones (playful, grotesque, introspective). Katherine’s voice is the book’s strength, as readers are bound to find her both fascinating and abhorrent. Her interactions are always interesting, as they often veer into the realms of the absurd (more than once david lynch came to mind). “I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Ann.“Thank God for that,” I said. “I was beginning to wonder if I was still alive.”My only quibble really is in regards to the Italian (chingiale should be cinghiale, seiscento should be seicento, and then gittoni should have been gettoni). And yeah that Silvano was utterly ridiculous (of course, he is a fascist) but he ended up adding to the novel's vibe of surreality. I think this would definitely appeal to fans of Moshfegh, Awad, and Danzy Senna as well as readers who are on the lookout for novels exploring 'The Female Malaise' or that centre on alienated & alienating young women.Clever, enigmatic, and atmospheric, A Carnivore's Inquiry is a novel that I look forward to rereading. I liked this so much that I am even planning on revisiting The Human Zoo, also by Murray, which I read with little fanfare last year (hopefully this time around it will win me over).re-read: a truly ingenious novel, thematically rich and written with impressive confidence. within the novel colonialism and cannibalism are deeply intwined, the monstrous desire to conquer is presented as a hunger, one that our narrator and anti-heroine feels deeply. similarly to Guadagnino's Bones and All the novel questions inherited monstrosity, especially in a mother/daughter dynamic. i loved the hazy quality permeating much of this novel, which really adds to Katherine's ambivalence. ...more",Notes are private!,2,37,2,"Mar 17, 2024Jan 03, 2023","Mar 24, 2024Jan 06, 2023","Oct 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/774200.A_Carnivore_s_Inquiry

Worst still, the narrative seems under the impression that it is doing a lot, in terms of unconventional female characters and challenging simplistic representations of women. Ironically the novel’s portrayal of a female character who is presented as someone who we should see as empowering and irreverent seemed very male-gazey. Had I not known the author, I would have assumed her to be the classic product of a male author who thinks he is single-handedly breaking the mold in terms of fictional women by presenting us with a beautiful, clever, and manipulative young woman who is able to maintain an expensive lifestyle through sex work. And she also has a girlfriend, who is just as sexy, and they sometimes work together because tee-hee their clients don’t realize that they really do enjoy having sex with each other. But before my rant continues, I will give an outline of the story: set in Brazil the first chapters follow Lucinda, who has long felt overshadowed by her younger sister, Vivi. Vivi works as a model, not a particularly famous one given the colorism rampant in this sector, and seems to lead a fairly glamorous existence. The two sisters are not particularly close but when Lucinda learns that Vivi has gone missing on a trip to São Paulo, she immediately tries to track her down. The police do not seem particularly concerned or competent enough to do anything about it so Lucinda has to rely on her barely-there-investigative skills. She gets some help from vivi's girlfriend Graziane, and soon discovers that they were both sex workers. This makes Vivi’s disappearance all the more concerning as she could have been taken by one of her clients. We also get chapters with Graziane, who, other than being white & stunning, does not have a semblance of personality. Later we also get to follow Vivi herself, as she tries to survive and outsmart her captors. Her chapters were the most risible of the lot. If you like the writing of Alex Michaelides or the duo Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen , I can maybe see her chapters working for you. I however found this type of writing utterly ludicrous. Worst even that having to follow Vivi directly, are her smutty book/journal entries. Such as: “My monster’s insides writhed languidly, wanting more”, “I offer up my fingers as a sacrifice and feel the hungry creature devouring them until it’s satisfied”, Lucinda believes will be a bestseller…se, ciao. To me, Vivi’s writing was beyond garbage. Maybe if it had been more campy and self-aware, as opposed to trying and failing to be erotic and real, when it was anything but, I could have coped with them…but as things stand, Vivi’s writing is beyond cringe. Lucinda initially seems like a bit more of an interesting take on the very much tired dynamic of the two sisters or bff where the one who is charming & magnetic goes missing or dies, and the more conventional and boring one is left behind. Lucinda does muay thai, and that’s about the only interesting thing about her. Her character, similarly to Graziane, besides her physical appearance, is not at all fleshed out.The characters in this book are incredibly cliched and often verge on stereotyping. Why did the author have to make Vivi, who cannot help being cold and intelligent, ‘autistic’? Why adopt a male-gazey lens to depict sex work and an f/f relationship? Why are all the men more or less the same shade of bad? Why rely on so many sensationalistic plot points and scenes?  While I did find the narrative’s take on female empowerment and its exploration of sex work and male-perpetuated violence against women flashy and shallow; these are realities that deserve to be portrayed with depth and nuance, not to make your characters into #edgygirlbosses. Vivi is a walking talking cliche. From her various ‘personas’, from the ‘party girl’ who she describes in a way that seemed to me an embarrassing take on Amy Dunne’s ‘cool girl monologue’: “How to define the character who gets me places in life: the party girl? It’s like that Sia song, the one that begins ‘Party girls don’t get hurt.’ But not the depressing bit, the positive bit. […] sheìs well-travelled, she’s cool, never a downer […] she’ll open her mouth and sing […] almost like a geisha and her shamisen” (dare i say, making your neurodivergent character quote a sia song...it's a choice that did not age well). But she also has a quirky side, almost a la Manic Pixie Dream Girl, because she reads comics and speaks “a little Japanese” from “watching too much anime” and “invents her own fashion. Paperclips as earrings […] dungarees and clogs”. But wait, you say, Vivi’s characterisation is intentional. Lucinda reminds us that she may be this way because of an intentional act/effect on her sister’s part: “‘I’m a weirdo girl’ thing. Hiding in plain sight with her glittery Nomi Malone-Sailor Moon”...which may as well be but to describe it this way makes it risible. Vivi’s chapters also try hard to impress on us that she really is super edgy and built differently. Her pov is so affected as to be entirely OTT in a story that tries to be gritty & real: “It’s so unfair. I never asked to be this self-conscious”. Rather than allowing us to see Vivi, and to realize why she may behave/seem as she does, we are told straight-up: “I know that my apparent lack of interest in everything around me can appear to come from pure coldness. But I’m not trying to appear cold and distant, nor do I take pleasure from it’”. Her inner monologue was painfully studied and not at all convincing. The narrative's attempts at self-awareness when it comes to female characters and how many women have learnt social strategies to adapt to socially accepted gender norms made its shortcomings all the more glaring.Although we are told that Vivi and Graziane are in a relationship and care about one another I did not buy them together. Their moments together or the passages detailing their relationship conform to your straight man’s feitish-y vision of wlw. The way their scenes were written ranged from icky to strangely mechanical: “But what really sealed the deal was when Vivi went home with her and gave her that wonderful oral. Graziane often tried to repay her with her best technique”, “The two of them were symbiotically in love. Any time they were in the same city, no matter how exhausted from their respective appointments each always ready to spoil the other with an orgasm, one woman totally focused on the other” (that last line…dajeeee). In comparison, the narrative’s depiction of microaggressions as well as its examination of sexual harassment, racism, and colorisms seemed to be far more grounded in reality. I just wish that the author could have maintained that level of sobriety and uncompromising realism when delving touching upon other serious subject matters.The setting was rendered fairly well but I did grow tired of the narration having to really emphasize certain things in a way that failed to be nostalgic and just seemed very much a la ‘back in my day’. For instance: “It was 1998 . People still thought CDs”...And some places are described simplistically, especially in Vivi’s novel/journal: Dubai is “very masculine” and “very Arabian Nights, only with technology”, men love going there because their “pricks feel a mile long”. There were several passages discussing porn and making very generalised pronouncements on young men vs. older men.I also found myself questioning many descriptions, such as “His chest was also brown, but from the sun, not naturally. It was also shaved: he must have been a swimmer. Or a rent boy.” Or having a character wondering whether a male character has feelings for another man she can’t just say that, she has to add: “Brokeback Mountain kind of thing”.The novel’s trying to be gritty tone did not mesh together with the overdramatized storyline and affected the writing style. These kinds of one-note characters might have worked better in a noir, but their tumblresque way of speaking would have still come across as farcical. Maybe if the narrative had really leaned into being playfully absurd, a la Mona Awad, or more entertaining, a la Oyinkan Braithwaite, maybe then I would have bought into the silly and pulpy writing and exaggerated characters. It seemed like Campos was trying to be something dark and heavy-going along the lines of something by Gillian Flynn, but then ended up being closer to Victoria Helen Stone's Jane Doe or Colleen Hoover's Verity. If you happen to like those novels, chances are you will like Campos' Nothing Can Hurt You Now. But if you are looking for a psychological thriller or a more nuanced exploration of sex work, sisterhood, and violence, like in Liz Moore's Long Bright River, you might want to give Nothing Can Hurt You Now a wide berth....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Dec 13, 2022","Dec 16, 2022","Oct 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62880060-nothing-can-hurt-you-now

UnlikeStylistically and thematically the stories collected in Racconti Romani/Roman Stories resonate a lot with Jhumpa Lahiri’s previous collections. Unlike those however Roman Stories features stories written directly in Italian. Having loved Lahiri’s previous Italian work, Dove Mi Trovo/Whereabouts, I was prepared to once again be pulled away by her quietly melancholic storytelling. Most of the stories in RS however came across as ‘labored’, from the studied language to the storylines themselves. For instance, whereas the lack of proper names in Whereabouts didn’t bother me, here, perhaps because it is a ‘thing’ in almost every story, it felt gimmicky. Characters are referred to by their ‘role’, job, age, and or gender. While there are quite a few stories focusing on foreigners, we never learn much about their pasts, be it their language, culture, or even their family histories. Consequently the characters felt as vague, representative of their role, age, or whatever, rather than individuals with personalities and histories. While I did appreciate how Lahiri highlights the experiences of those who are subject to xenophobia and racism in Italy (having recently returned to italy after nearly 10 years abroad i was taken aback by just how proudly bigoted many italians are), aside from one story in the latter half of the collection which deals with a violent hate crime, I do think that the episodes she portrays were slightly too ‘tame’, or maybe not tame but more ‘sanitised’...so things are never said but alluded to, which I am sure happens but like I said, there are also so many Italians who have 0 qualms about being vocal when it comes to their shitty opinions on ‘stranieri’.I appreciated the themes Lahiri explores throughout this collection, as many of her characters seem mired by their own past and present choices. Change too is a motif in this collection: from changing family dynamics to changing landscapes to changing seasons. There is a sense of movement, yet, we also get that typical slice of life Lahiri excels at, so that it feels as if we are glimpsing an intimate moment in the everyday life of ‘ordinary’ people. Although the characters deal with grief, unrequited love, ageing, and hopelessness, yet, the stories retain a lightness that makes them exceedingly readable and far from heavy going. The dialogues sometimes lacked immediacy, in that most of the characters spoke this rather formal Italian, which sure enough, give the stories a nostalgic vibe, but they don’t always sound ‘credible’, or at least true to life. Especially considering that these stories are set in Rome, I was expecting a different type of vernacular, especially in those stories that seek to juxtapose older and younger generations.Overall far from a bad read but not on the same level as Lahiri's other collections. Still, I think readers who aren't familiar with Rome or Italy might find this more enthralling than I was....more",Notes are private!,2,47,1,"Feb 22, 2023","Feb 25, 2023","Oct 01, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/78292448-roman-stories

'Aida' is a quietly evocative short story that really shows off Engel’s strengths as a storyteller. Like her other works, Vida and The Veins of the Ocean, ‘’ has a beguiling, dreamlike, atmosphere that is however permeated by a slight sense of unease. In the story, the narrator’s sister goes missing. The narrator notes the different ways in which her disappearance affects their parents, and how not knowing what happened to her becomes both a source of despair and of hope. In 'Fausto' we follow a girl who falls in love with a boy who has a bit of a bad reputation. Despite her father’s disapproval, she becomes involved with him. In another story, we follow a couple who meets online and marry not so much out of love but convenience. They eventually relocate to the US and have a child together. We read of how the husband keeps tabs on his wife, installs cameras in their home, and attempts to dissuade her from having her own life.  In yet another story two Colombian ex-pats meet in New York. The two connect, even if the woman is wary of what the man reveals about himself. Set in Cuba, Colombia, and the US, these stories often revolve around sleazy or otherwise unpleasant men who are either cheating on their partners or do not seem particularly concerned with how their choices/actions affect the women they are involved with. While portraying people who make mistakes and have regrets, can make for compelling character studies, these stories present us with barely there characters, whose personalities and motivations easily blended together. I wondered why so many stories gave these shitty men not only so much page time but gave their presence so much weight. And it was boring too for so many of these stories to be focused on sexual and romantic relationships, as I found myself craving for ones that were more centred on familiar/platonic ones. Nevertheless, despite my not having really clicked with this collection, I do like Patricia Engel’s style, especially when it comes to creating and maintaining the tone of a story. Her settings too are usually rendered with realism, and there were some poignant reflections of belonging, regret, and connection. Sadly, the only story that left a strong impression on me was the first one. This if the fourth work that I have read by Engel and I'm afraid it's the one I like the least.

Blacktop Wasteland and Razorblade Tears managed to be gripping and gritty reads that managed to pack an emotional punch. The only nice thing I can say about My Darkest Prayer is that it attests to Cosby having grown as an author. My Darkest Prayer reads like a generic story in the realm of a hardboiled novel that thinks it's being way smarter and funnier than it actually is. While Cosby’s penchant for snappy and occasionally bombastic metaphors won me over in Blacktop Wasteland and Razorblade Tears, here they often struck me as unfunny, over-elaborate, and even puerile (“I felt his thin lips split like a pair of cheap pantyhose”). Yet, maybe I could have accepted a story that reads like it’s trying too hard to tick every box in the Walter Mosley or Kenzie & Gennaro book, with its wannabe sigma protagonist who happens to have a friend who is as dangerous, possibly unhinged (always there when our protagonist is going against the bad bad guys), is a magnet for curvaceous women (maybe one of them needs rescuing after being kidnapped by the baddies), and spends way too much time coming up with or responding to colorful threats that don’t make anyone sound particularly tough or clever or intimidating (au contraire, they sound like they have just moved past the recess jokes stage of their lives). Except that this book’s constant objectification of women got to me. Maybe if this had been published during Raymond Chandler’s days, maybe I might feel more inclined to overlook it, but given that My Darkest Prayer was first published in 2019, I just cannot. Worse still, this book pretends it's different from the usual hard-boiled or grit-lit reads, with our main guy calling out other men for being sexist pigs. He even tells us: “I tried to adhere to the three-second rule as I watched her walk. If I looked longer than three, I was straying into pervert territory”. My oh my, what a nice guy. Truly not like other men. At one point, he even tells us that he believes that his traumatic past means that he is not like other people. Anyway, set in a small Southern town, we follow Nathan, a former marine and sheriff's deputy, who now works at a funeral home, he handles the bodies, and now-and-again teaches the local ‘riffraff’ a lesson or two. After the death of the cherished local minister, his parishioners, knowing that the police won’t properly investigate this, pay Nathan to make sure to discover just what went down. We learn that Nathan’s relationship with the authorities is strained not only due to their general incompetence, but somehow connected to his parents’ deaths. Nathan goes around asking questions, having some physical altercations, which establish him as the sigma man that he says and even becomes involved with the minister’s daughter, who happens to be a ‘sex bomb’ and a pornstar. There are a lot of scenes that can be boiled down to ‘too much testosterone’, with Nathan going on about how muscular he is (he even tells us that unlike other guys he doesn’t do it to gain female attention, further establishing him as the true sigma). He learns that the minister was up to no good and somehow involved with a powerful and dangerous figure.Way too much page time is dedicated to Nathan’s flexing and his constant objectification of women. If the women are old, forget it, they barely register on his radar (he may note just how scrawny they are). But younger women? Wow. He is a womanizer who isn’t looking to settle down, and these desperate women stand no chance against how smooth and manly he is. It just so happens that most of the women he pursues, has had sex with, or is flirting with (even at the most inopportune of moments, say when the life of someone you care about is at stake), are curvaceous, with firm thighs (“Mrs. Short’s faith was not as firm as her honey-brown thighs”...), and butts that are described as ‘ample’ or compared to ‘peaches’. Every time he comes across a woman he has to make these remarks about their bodies which really gets repetitive fast. He often thinks that the way they dress is solely for his benefit (“a black bra that peeked out at me through the knitting like a shy puppy”, ) and compares their bodies to sweet things like ‘honey’ and ‘butterscotch’. He particularly objectifies light-skinned Black women, “She had a honey-brown complexion that made it appear as if she were sculpted out of amber ambrosia. […] She could have been a tanned Italian or a light-skinned Black woman or a Latin goddess come to life or a combination of all three. You didn’t gaze upon her and think about fucking her. You wanted to protect her. Put her in a gilded cage and admire her for the rest of your life like a captured angel”. Additionally, this is yet another hard-boiled novel that pains a victim of sexual abuse as having to be saved by a man or if she worked as a prostitute or was involved in other activities deemed illegal has to be portrayed as ‘broken’ and ‘unhinged’. And for all his posturing, Nathan is exactly like the men he looks down upon. After he has sex with Lisa, the minister’s daughter, he wakes “to see Lisa sprawled across the bed like an action figure some kid had left behind once he was done playing”. Later on, he thinks this when coming across a lot of cash: “It was all tens and twenties. Folded over, it was a knot big enough to choke a horse or a whore”...wtf. Not only is he comparing women to playthings, that he can use and toss aside, but placing them in the same category as fucking horses? I found the way the narrator describes and perceives women to be gross & dehumanising. The sex scenes were cringe, with Lisa reverting to her pornstar persona and having to once again emphasize just how manly Nathan is (“Fuck, you’re strong”, “Well, aren’t you big all over”, “Give it to me! Tame this pussy!”). When having sex Lisa “growls”, her eyes go “feral”. And then we get eye-roll-worthy things like: “Her skin was feverishly hot, but she felt weightless in my arms. It was like holding a feather from a phoenix”.Lisa of course has to reveal her traumatic past because there is nothing like using female trauma and pain to incentivize our hero.So many jokes were sexist, homophobic, or simply down-right icky, and may appeal to people who still think of Family Guy as being funny.The story was boring, predictable. Nathan was a one-note character who wasn't half as cool or funny or edgy as this book thinks he is while the side-characters are painfully cartoonish.As much as it pains me to write such a  for a Cosby book I can't close an eye to how sexist and dull this book turned out to be. If you are interested in checking out this novel I recommend you check out more positive s out. If you've never read anything by Cosby but want to I recommend you give this a wide berth and check out Blacktop Wasteland and/or Razorblade Tears instead....more",Notes are private!,1,36,1,"Jan 16, 2023","Jan 17, 2023","Sep 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60827561-my-darkest-prayer

It ended, and another ending world spun in its place.""War, historical conflicts, present crises, and apocalyptic visions, are the motifs of Franny Choi’s The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes. Some poems are brief, others read less like poems than sections from someone’s journal or a piece of writing that will eventually lead to an essay or an article. As much as I wanted to love this collection, Choi’s language failed to draw me in. Often it struck me as affected so that I was all too aware of Choi’s creating and writing presence and unable to actually fall into the images, descriptions and reflections that she creates. This is a pity as I did appreciate how she adopted a collective perspective and at times a more personal one. For instance, when exploring episodes of violence she draws from history and colonial pasts, but also from her own experience with violence and disruption. I also did like how the images Choi conjures are often of a cyclical nature and blur the line between baggings and endings. As much as I admired the concept of this collection, for its themes and the issues it sets out to shed a light on, I just could not lose myself in Choi’s language. I know queerness was a theme but it felt submerged by a language that was trying to impress its own lyricism onto its readers. Her poems as they just brought to mind my time workshopping other students' work during a creative writing class I took at uni (make of that what you will). But as I have said in other poetry s, I am still new to the poetry reading ‘scene’ and therefore, if this collection happens to be on your radar, you should check out more positive and/or in-depth s. If you are on the lookout for poetry concerned with survival, the future, past and ongoing violence, fraught histories, heritage and identity, and dystopian visions, The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes may be the perfect read for you....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Dec 17, 2022","Dec 31, 2022","Sep 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60147181-the-world-keeps-ending-and-the-world-goes-on

It’s a novel about love, survival, death, and the reality and the aftermath of witnessing and being participants in unthinkable violence. The idyllic landscapes and the trivialities of youth we encounter in the opening chapters belie the violence and pain that are to come, making those earlier moments all the more precious, all the more bittersweet. This novel broke my heart. It made me cry, it made me despair, it made me feel all of the feels. In Memoriam is a gut-wrenching novel revealing the brutality and the banality of war: time and again we are made to read of young men, boys really, dying in the most horrible and random of deaths, and we see how their bodies are merely replaceable cogs in the machine of war. But I am getting ahead of myself.“He went there in the mornings, sometimes, and gave himself to that strange country rapture, that deep, bonewarming feeling that England was his, and he was England’s. He felt it as strongly as if his ancestors had been there a thousand years. Perhaps he felt it more strongly because they hadn’t.”The opening pages transport us to 1914, to Preshute, the idyllic boarding school in the English countryside. Here we see the petty disagreements and secret entanglements between various students, most of whom have grandiose visions of the English Empire, of honor, of war. Despite their different temperaments Henry Gaunt and Sindey Ellwood are best friends. Their friendship is complicated by the unspoken feelings they harbor for one another. Each believes that their love is unrequited and that acting on it will inevitably ruin their friendship. So, they spend their days pining for each other and trying to hide, not always successfully, their true feelings. In this rarefied world, they spend their days talking about meaningless and meaningful things, yet, news of the war puts a strain on their days of idleness. Gaunt and Ellwood, alongside their friends, are particularly drawn to the ‘In Memoriam’ section of their paper, and while soon enough the names on those pages are of boys and men they know, these also seem to promise heroic tales that speak to them given that they are well-versed in the classics. Gaunt, however, who is half German, feels differently about these things from most of his peers. Yet, despite his anti-war sentiments he finds himself pressured to enlist by his mother and his sister after they reveal that it will put to rest rumours questioning where their family’s loyalties lie.“Ellwood’s England was magical, thought Gaunt, picking his way around nettles. But it wasn’t England.”Ellwood, a year younger, initially stays behind, keeping a correspondence to Gaunt that reveals the unbridgeable gap between his reality at Preshute and Gaunt’s one on in the trenches. They continue to yearn for one another, but their love is soon obscured by the horrors Gaunt experiences on the front. Class privileges continue to be felt in the army and Gaunt, a boy still, is in command of men who are twice his age and did not grow up in the sheltered walls of Preshute. Concerned for Gaunt, Ellwood eventually decides to enlist as well, and he is joined by most of his friends. Soon enough he realizes that his former visions of honor, glory, and England have little to do with the day-to-day reality of war. From the living conditions to the landscapes punctuated by bodies and gore. And always so much death all around them. Death that is not always a result of enemy fire. The men around him die because of infections, a literal misstep, or a mild malady turned deadly. They also die because they waver, and their hesitancy is deemed an act of cowardice. They are driven mad, by the violence they see, and the violence they do.“It was the Hell you’d feared in childhood, come to devour the children . It was treading over the corpses of your friends so that you might be killed yourself. It was the congealed evil of a century.”Gaunt and Ellwood’s love seems a foreign thing in a reality like this. Yet, their proximity to death is also what makes them now more than even desperate for the other.Their relationship is a fraught one given the circumstances that have led to their coming together. Gaunt in particular being Ellwood’s superior, and haunted by his own actions at the front, is committed to keeping their relationship one of convenience, something that pains him as much as Ellwood. Ellwood, who still retains at this point an easy-going insouciance, tries his best to be of comfort to Gaunt, but, eventually, their paths diverge. During the months and years following their enlistment, we watch them trying to survive but retaining one's body and one's mind in war is no easy feat. The more of his friends die, the more Ellwood begins to change, and his attempts to immure himself to pain see him turn into someone who is jaded, cruel, and angry. Gaunt, who had for so long suppressed his feelings, and rarely allowed himself to feel things fully, is reunited with some old friends and their companionship, as well as the possibility of seeing Ellwood, spur him on. Oh, my poor heart. At first, I was fooled by the beautiful prose and by the dazzling intensity of Gaunt and Ellwood’s yearning. Once we leave Preshute behind, there are only echoes of that earlier beauty. There are moments of kinship, of comradeship, between the men. Their banter is a temporary reprieve from the fear, uncertainty, and brutality of war. Against this unforgiving landscape, punctured by violence and agonizing waits, Gaunt and Ellwood’s feelings for one another, as well as their faltering relationship, appear almost as if bathed by a quietly luminous light. “I wish I could be more articulate, but the English language fails me. It sometimes feels as if the only words that still have meaning are place names: Ypres, Mons, Artois. Nothing else expresses.”Alice Winn doesn’t hold back from portraying the realities of war or from being critical of the British. Except for one character, Gaunt’s sister, the novel is populated by characters who for better or worse struck me as real. Given the period and depending on a character’s background, they would inevitably express troublesome views. Rather than indicting or condoning them, Winn allows her characters to be flawed, messy, and idiosyncratic. Notions of duty and honor, as well as cowardice, are recurring motifs, as we witness how these have shaped and continue to shape the characters. Some find themselves holding onto patriotic beliefs, others are unable to reconcile the realities of war with their lives so far. Some are driven mad, lashing out against their fellow men, or retreating inward, so inward that their physical body no longer matters. Time and again we are reminded of how young these soldiers are, and the myriad of banal ways their lives can be cut short. We see the disconnect between those on the front, and those who dispatch orders from afar, often sending hundreds or more to meet avoidable deaths.But you keep on reading, hoping against hope for a miracle, a way for Gaunt and Ellwood to be brought back together…“My dearest, darling Sidney, There was nothing else.”In Memoriam really tore me up. Yet, the majestic prose, the urgency of the story, and the bond between Gaunt and Ellwood kept me turning pages. There are so many scenes and passages that are harrowing, raw, and unsparing in their brutality. And maybe those make those moments of stillness, of quiet, all the more agonizingly tender.“Gaunt was woven into everything he read, saw, wrote, did, dreamt. Every poem had been written about him, every song composed for him, and Ellwood could not scrape his mind clean of him no matter how he tried. He thought perhaps all the pain would sour the love, but instead it drew him further in, as if he were Marc Antony, falling on his own sword. And it was a magical thing, to love someone so much; it was a feeling so strange and slippery, like a sheath of fabric cut from the sky.”And the more I read, the more worried I became, as it was clear that no one was safe and everything goes. And it was fucking heartbreaking to see just how unrecognizable some of the characters become. They may not have died but they are certainly not living. And Winn succeeds in capturing that specific terror of being confronted with the possibility that someone you know, someone you love, is there but not. Their body is, it may even look eerily unchanged. But their minds are no longer the same. You may lie to yourself into believing that they will be restored to who they were, that time will heal their wounds, but eventually, you might have no choice but to confront the reality: that they will never be who they were.The novel’s exploration of love, queerness, and of morality, definitely brought to mind works such as The Charioteer, The Absolutist, and Maurice. Winn’s writing has this pictorial quality and melancholy that really brought to mind the style of Mary Renault, so much so that even the way the characters speak, their inner turmoils, and the way they interact with one another, all made me think of Renault's work.The characters are continually faced with difficult choices, but the rhythms of war and the chaos of a battle rarely allow the time for them to question whether what they are doing is right, wrong, or another thing altogether. What do you do when you know you are being sent to your death? What do you do when the people around you are losing their minds?“Ellwood was surprised to find that he was not glad either, although his hatred grew and grew. But he could not hate soldiers. He longed to destroy, to hurt, to kill, but he wasn’t sure whom. Possibly the civilians.”My one quibble lies in Maud, Gaunt’s sister. She is the kind of female character that you can find in Natasha Pulley’s books or other historical fiction featuring a gay romance, that is a young woman who is a source of conflict for the couple, and always finds a way to excuse their callousness and selfishness (often by reminding the other person of the limitations imposed on her by her gender). Her presence annoyed me. Winn does, unlike Pulley, try to make her readers feel for Maud, but I had a hard time ignoring how uncaring and sanctimonious she was, especially towards Gaunt. And she never seemed to listen or to allow for someone else’s perspectives, presenting herself instead as the wronged party. But maybe a re-read will make her character more tolerable...“Ellwood had never been interested in ugliness, whereas Gaunt […] feared that ugliness was too important to ignore..”The main characters, Gaunt and Ellwood are compelling, and so are their differences and similarities. Not only does Winn render the patterns of their thoughts, but is able to convey their voices: the way they speak, the kind of things they would say, and so. The cadences of their speech, and the way their minds work, however exasperating, Winn captures all of this, so that they both felt like real people. This makes the way they change all the more heartbreaking. Having grown to care for them, to see them become so unlike themselves, it was truly harrowing. Their feelings for each other are beautiful. They long for each other, but they are unable to articulate their love. Yet, they do form a love language of sorts, as they borrow the words of other men, quoting poetry and the classics to one another. Even at Preshute their love is clouded by worry, by the possibility that their feelings are unrequited, and later on, it is obscured by the war. Trauma changes them, and it changes the way they can love, and I cannot stress enough how that scene, that scene you were waiting for so long, has none of the happiness and warmth you’d expected. This may seem like an exaggeration but I felt bereft. But it would have been disingenuous to have that scene go any other way.We encounter so many men within these pages. Some live, but a sentence, others live longer, but their safety is never a guarantee.“How alive it all seemed, and how gracious—to die in an era when your death bought you a brief moment at the centre of something. To be important, rather than one of millions.”Time and again Winn juxtaposes the beauty, the poetry, and the blissful freedom of their time at Preshute, with the newfound reality, which is oppressive, brutal, and bloody. In portraying Ellwood and Gaunt’s experiences on the front, Winn never takes the easy option, by making all of their actions and behaviors heroically selfless acts. Gaunt cannot wholly shake himself of his anti-war sentiments, nor can he ignore that he is fighting against the Germans, a people he still feels part of. Ellwood instead grows bitter towards that and those he’d loved, from the poets he admired to the civilians back home who easily speak of the war without even knowing its ravages first-hand.“It was a common conversation. In 1913, you might ask a new acquaintance where he had gone to school, or what he did for a living. In 1916, it was this: what part of yourself did you most fear losing?”The time period is depicted with startling realism. From showing the constraints experienced by Gaunt and Ellwood, their awareness of their difference from others, not only when it comes to their sexuality, but Gaunt is half-german and Ellwood has Jewish roots. We also see how Preshute both insulated them from the real world, but not wholly, as there they are still expected to obey certain hierarchies and traditions, and they are taught that displays of emotions are a weakness.“He did not know that it was the first thing homesick little boys in their dormitories learnt at boarding school: how to cry in silence.” In Memoriam is a novel that hits hard. It’s beautiful, theatrical, and romantic. It’s brutal, tragic, and devastating. It’s a book about war, death, trauma, and grief. It’s also a book about love: the love between friends, between brothers in arms, between allies, and, of course, between lovers. It’s by no means an easy read but it’s a gripping one. If you don’t mind sobbing, and feeling as if your heart was in your throat, In Memoriam is a soul-stirring and arresting read that has your name on it.A symphonic meditation on love, brotherhood, masculinity, death, grief, and trauma, In Memoriam is a startlingly evocative and deeply excruciating debut novel that I am planning on losing myself into again and again....more",Notes are private!,1,131,1,"Jan 28, 2023","Jan 30, 2023","Sep 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59948520-in-memoriam

There the author really commits to presenting us with a non-linear storyline, as the chapters are not put in chronological order. Both of these novels also feature men who abuse their positions, drugs, some queer longing, and dysfunctional families & dynamics. So, having rather liked A Prayer for Travelers, I was prepared to feel the same for Sisters of the Lost Nation, given that it did have all of the ‘right’ ingredients to be the type of thriller-y coming-of-age that I tend to ‘vibe with…but the central character and the story’s key events ended up falling flat (for me of course, ymmv). I will say that Sisters of the Lost Nation does have a strong sense of place and, despite some pacing missteps, a well-maintained atmosphere.Alas, the simplistic characters were giving me Riverdale vibes, in that they are exactly the kind of characters you can expect to find in media focused on a small community in the States (the oblivious teachers and school president, the mean popular bullies, the fishy older guy, the laid-back, hippy even, older woman, the bratty younger sister, and so forth). Anna, our protagonist, is the classic outsider who is bullied by her peers and overlooked by the adults in her life. Her younger sister is the quintessential bratty tween who chooses popularity over being a decent human being (she is even involved in this very unnecessary ‘prank’ scene that struck me as both gratuitous and an unsubtle attempt at making us ‘feel’ for the mc). Anyway, Anna works as a cleaner at the reservation's casino, a place chock-full of dodgy guys. There is this lingering animosity, or mistrust, among staff members, that makes us, and Anna, question what really goes on in this casino…when Anna’s sister disappears, Anna knows that the casino and the people behind it are somehow involved. The non-linear structure here comes across as very gimmicky, a way to give this ‘missing girl’ story a more ‘fresh’ take…but I actually think that this story didn’t need it. It had enough to offer without having to resort to distracting storytelling techniques. A lot of the chapters ultimately come across as repetitive as they keep going over things and dynamics that have already been established. We know who the bad guys are, we know that Anna and her sister didn’t get along, and we know that Anna was bullied and mistreated by almost everyone. It annoyed me that we get this flashback/callback to a phrase this teacher once told her, about Anna being ‘different’. Rather than delving into that, or focusing more on Anna’s identity, we just get to hear those same words time and again without anything on the actual page to back them up. The dynamic between Anna and her sister managed to be both bland and cliched. I am so tired of teenage girls being portrayed like this (stupid, catty, boy-crazy, superficial). The bad guys were just painfully one-note and everything they said or did made me roll my eyes. There were also a lot of scenes that were hard to take seriously. Sometimes this was due to the cartoonish characters, sometimes they were just unbelievable (like that scene where anna interrogates a suspect while the police are right there…? si, come no).But hey ho, I have read a ton of books with a similar premise (missing sibling/coming of age/small-town setting such as Winter's Bone, A Crooked Tree, Monkey Beach)so I probably have less patience than most when it comes to this type of storyline. If the premise of this book appeals to you I recommend you check out more positive s and/or give it a read to form your own opinions about it. If the author were to write something else I would probably give it a try as the themes underlining this story had potential. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Apr 22, 2023","Apr 25, 2023","Aug 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61686006-sisters-of-the-lost-nation

Everything fucking hurts, and still we are bigger than our tragedy. We are not deviant, we are exultant. We are on top of the world. We are bigger than our tragedies.”  The Minus-One Club is a sad, sometimes funny, ultimately bittersweet coming-of-age exploring grief, love, identity, as well as depression, addiction, and faith. The short chapters, some not even a page long, the simple yet punchy prose, and the focus on mental health, make The Minus-One Club the kind of read that is hound to appeal to fans of Benjamin Alire Sáenz and K. Ancrum. The Minus-One Club is the kind of ya book that I would have absolutely loved 10 years ago, but now, I can only ‘just’ like. There were these moments of tenderness that did get to me, and I found the author’s portrayal of grief, acceptance, and sexuality to be realistic, so much so that readers looking for books where everything works out, in the end, should approach The Minus-One Club  this with caution.“It didn’t feel like anything to me,” he says. “I don’t feel anything anymore.”Our narrator, 15-year-old Kermit Sanders, is bereft. His older sister, died in a car accident, and Kermit’s life will never be the same. His very religious parents seek solace in God and in their local church, but Kermit doesn’t know what to believe anymore. When he returns to school he feels at remove from everything, miles away from the ‘petty’ concerns of other high school students. His best friend, alongside most of the school, doesn’t know how to deal with Kermit’s loss, so they either proffer unwanted platitudes or avoid him altogether. Kermit can’t stop thinking or dreaming of his sister, often hearing her voice in his head. And then he finds in his locker a mysterious invitation that leads him to the “Minus-One Club”. The club is made up of five other students, all of whom have ‘lost’ someone. They meet up after school, to play cards together or other games. They offer a weird type of moral support as they are never to discuss their losses. The club is in fact a place where they want to be free of other people’s sorrys, or have to talk about their feelings. Here they can just be. Despite belonging to different ‘social’ groups, and not being able to talk about ‘stuff’, their bond is an unspoken one.Kermit finds himself growing particularly close to one club member, Matt, a seemingly happy-go-lucky guy who happens to be their school’s only ‘out’ gay student. The more time they spend together, the stronger Kermit’s feelings for Matt become so that soon enough his crush develops into something harder to ignore. But spending time with Matt and the club sees Kermit drift away from his parents. Not only do they impose stultifying rules on Kermit but they expect, demand even, that he continue to attend church and take part in church-related activities. As Kermit realizes that Matt may feel the same as he does for him, he struggles to reconcile his sexuality with his faith. Not only is his church particularly homophobic but his parents are too. As Kermit tries to unlearn those beliefs that have made him view his desires and himself as sinful, and wrong, he is forced to decide whether he can continue ‘pretending’ to be someone that he is not.Kermit and Matt’s relationship however is further jeopardized by Matt’s own troubles. Despite his carefree attitude, Matt is not doing well at all, and as his drinking worsens it falls Kermit, and all of the club really, have to confront the dangers of keeping silent about their grief and their pain.In addition to exploring the realities of grief and depression, Kekla Magoon touches on peer pressure, both when it comes to drinking and having sex, and bullying. Some of the characters act in ways that are, to put it mildly, problematic, but rather than condemning them, we are made to understand what and how they may have come to behave in such a way. I appreciated the empathy Magoon shows her characters and the sensitivity she demonstrates in treating such complex issues. My heart went out to Kermit, Matt (flawed as he is), and the rest of the club. I liked that the ending is hopeful yet realistic, in that some things remain (for the time) unresolved. I also appreciated that the story not only shows how grief expresses itself differently in different people (some like matt develop a self-destructive streak, others find thesmelves questioning theri faith, some cry, others don't, etc.) but the repercussions of having emotionally abusive and/or neglectful parents. Kermit's parents fail or refuse to, recognise his grief as 'genuine' (because he hasn't cried), or allow him to be himself. They even try to stop him from spending time with Matt, even when that's what makes him happy and pressure him to go to church even when he expresses the desire not to. Superficially Matt's father may seem great, given that doesn't care whether Matt goes to parties or who he brings back home with him. But, after certain events later in the story, Kermit comes to realize just how hurtful it can be to know that your parent doesn't really think of you. Another strength of The Minus-One Club was that Magoon doesn't gloss over Kermit's internalised homophobia nor is his faith depicted simplistically as Magoon takes time to explore the whys & hows of his fraught relationship to his religion and his parents.While I could have done without the 3-page farting/dream sequence (maybe that’s just me) I did find those sillier moments between Kermit and Matt or between Kermit and his sister, to add much-needed levity to the story. The chapter titles also provided a source of humor. Anyway, if you are looking for a ya read that will pull at your heartstrings, look no further. I know I said earlier on that I didn't love this, I just liked it, but now that I have thought back to it, I can honestly say that I am fond of this book. Kermit, Matt, and the rest of the club got to me. They have these very wholesome moments that felt so very precious. Also, I think this book delivers several important lessons in a way that felt authentic and poignant (as opposed to contrived and 'preachy').And while not everything is resolved by the end, those final pages were rewarding and full of heart. Ultimately, the book shows the importance of being honest, about your feelings, ugly or sad as they may be, of being there for your friends, even when they try to tell you nothing is the matter and everything is a-okay, and that sometimes, you can't just 'get on with things' or push through it, and you have to allow yourself time, to feel, and maybe even, one day, heal....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jan 24, 2023","Jan 26, 2023","Aug 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60316977-the-minus-one-club

I’ll admit that once again I was taken in more by the eye-catching cover than the actual book summary. Sure, the premise itself did bring to mind several other titles, namely Lakewood by Megan Giddings, but I found the cover design so hypnotic that I decided to give Natural Beauty a try anyway. Alas, nothing about Natural Beauty really caught my attention or left me with a positive impression. The writing is flat, the characters are mere names on pages, and the tone is all over the place. It seemed that the narrative was trying to be this edgy satire that fails to actually delve deeper into the issues it is attempting to tackle. There are a lot of throwaway gratuitous scenes, there is a lack of logic both in the characters’ actions and motivations and the world-building itself. Our main narrator is given a traumatic backstory that seemed to exist only as a way of contextualizing her lack of personhood. While I understand that the characters’ shallowness could have been very much the point, given that they are focused or are made to be focus on superficial things, it just wasn’t convincing. And again, if the narrative had addressed with more depth the themes that are meant to be crucial to the story, maybe then I could have put up with shallow barely-there characters. I don’t mind books that focus on vibes, on the aesthetics, more than say plot or character-development, one of my favorite books Catherine House is very much all vibes, and I quite like the prose of authors like Megan Giddings and Nghi Vo, who are very much gifted when it comes creating and maintaining a mood…but here it all felt very…ham-fisted. The evil people are evil, the main character is chosen because of reasons, a sinister corporation is, in fact, sinister, so many convenient coincidences, and so on and so forth. We learn virtually nothing about the narrator’s job, which is a pity as I think it would have helped make Holistik more ‘credible’. In the last year, I have worked for 4 different companies in 6 different locations and I can safely say that the story’s depiction of the narrator’s hiring process and training seemed full of inconsistencies and plot holes.It’s a pity but ultimately the narrative merely seems to rehash ideas and plot points from things like Black Mirror, Get Out, and even The Stepford Wives. The author throws in a lot of supposedly shocking scenes that come across as fairly predictable twists and/or unnecessary. I wish more time had been dedicated to the portrayal of Western beauty standards, the pervasiveness and elevation of whiteness, bodily autonomy, economic inequity, and the demands of modern workplaces, than to attempting, and failing, to set a mysterious mood.As you know, YMMV, so if you are in the mood for a speculative read you should give this novel a shot. Hopefully, you'll end up finding it a more rewarding read than I was able to. ...more",Notes are private!,1,54,1,"Apr 04, 2023","Apr 06, 2023","Aug 12, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/60535993-natural-beauty

Sure, the first 100 pages or so were intriguing but i was bored by Bret's endless navel-gazing, horniness, and flexing (we get it, you have a gucci backpack and you lift weights) and the constant inane fighting with his 'cohort', which usually follows this formula: -what are you suggesting?b. what do you think i am suggesting?-i think you are suggesting something.b. why would you think that i was suggesting something?-i just dob. why would you say that?-say what?b. that i was suggesting something- because you are.b. i think robert is a FuCkiNG fREaK.Banal, polemical, self-indulgent, misogynistic, sensationalist, verbose, and frankly, just all over the place.Ellis is an edgelord who brought to mind those wannabe auteurs like Sam Levinson whose work is desperately trying way too hard to be transgressive and brilliant. Sure, sometimes you can bring to the table both flash and substance, but sometimes, like in the case of The Shards, your attempts at flashiness are so forced, so ostentatious, so desperate, that you end up stripping your work of any actual substance. At times it seemed that this book was trying to be something like TSH, other times it adopts a true crime quality, but ultimately, it only succeeds in being truly cringe.I can think of so many works that succeed in exploring obsession, enmity, alienation, and repressed desire, in a way that The Shards just fails to. Titles like Apartment by Teddy Wayne, These Violent Delights by Micah Nemerever, New People by Danzy Senna, Old School by Tobias Wolff, Night Film by Marisha Pessl. There are several films (of dubious quality) that present us with two delusional boys playing mind games, doing something ‘bad’ together, and you are not sure who is lying or who has the upper hand or if they want to kill or fuck each other such as Like Minds, Murder by Numbers, and Super Dark Times, that would probably succeed in being less dull than The Shards. Before this  devolves into what is likely to be a spoiler-y cathartic rant, I will give you the gist of things:this is a 700-tome of a book that oozes self-importance but beyond giving us detailed descriptions of everything worn by his peers (i could google ‘what did vanilla rich white teens wear in 1981/82’), providing us with every single street name he drives on (with as much passion as a sat nav), and using the same repetitive imagery and language to describe the bodies of the men around him (we get it, you are a horny teenager), it has nothing to say. Bret’s alienation and emptiness are established in the very first chapters, the rest of the novel doesn’t really elaborate on his malaise further. The true crime angle...it comes across as subpar true crime podcast that wants (but fails) to be something like Zodiac or I'll Be Gone in the Dark There.I genuinely thought that Ellis’ would have more to say about evil and the nature of evil, about darker instincts, violence, obsession, delusions, normalcy, queerness, about privilege. But it doesn’t. Sure, he succeeds in capturing the essence of a place and moment in time, but he often loses sight of the big picture, so that beyond presenting us with a generic group of rich white American kids whose successful parents are divorced/separated and emotionally distant (i can hear that *violin*), spend their time by the pool, partying, drinking and snorting coke, and the guys’ (whose personalities are variations of the bro/chad figure) exchange puerile wisecracks all the while blissfully unaware of just how privileged an existence they have. Despite Bret thinking that the story he is recounting is the most shocking story of all time, it was boring, shallow, and stupid even. There, I have said it. I usually don’t stoop to the level of calling a book I didn’t like stupid but The Shards was stupid. Once we passed the 30% mark, I no longer felt affected by the trying-too-hard-to-be suspenseful atmosphere, and neither Bret’s insufferable internal monologue nor his interactions with the obnoxious people around him challenged or inspired me. This book has nothing really to say and I should have heeded ellis' dedication (“for no one”).There is a long introduction that I did not read with close attention, as it was a lot of waffling and Ellis discussing how beneath his “prince-of-darkness literary persona” there is “an amiable mess, maybe even likable” (sure) and this story which has haunted him for years, and although he planned on writing it, for the longest time, he was unable to. The gist is that the events in The Shards supposedly happened. Still, The Shards is marketed as a work of fiction, so I decided to approach it as such. But, if pressed, in the case that the events in The Shards are truly drawn from Ellis’ own personal real-life experiences, here is what I think: that's questionable. Sure, in some vague capacity, they may have happened but there is a lot of stuff that is...not so credible. Maybe this is due to Ellis’ unrelenting over-dramatizing and his edgy self-fashioning, maybe due to how inane and unlikely certain exchanges between him and his friends were (in that they often seemed either scripted or hollow, like the type of conversations you have come across in media about american high schools), or maybe due him constantly going on about how at that point in time he wasn’t aware of the true narrative of things, in a way that tries to be suspenseful, makes you question who is playing who, but Ellis is so heavy-handed and repetitive in his foreshadowing that it really ends up being counterproductive.I have read enough mystery novels and a lot of academia-adjacent novels where we follow a clique of friends but someone is a bad egg and someone is cheating on someone else and someone is maybe gay etc., that can’t say that I found the scenes focusing on Bret’s ‘friends’ petty discussions or in-group fighting to be particularly riveting. Especially when Bret tries to tell us that the people in his clique are actually friends, and that he even loves Thom and Susan. Thom, Bret establishes early on, is drop-dead gorgeous and like almost every other young man he is friends with he is invisible compared to a greek statue, and we are reminded time and again that they all are tanned, blond, muscular, and so on. Now, Thom, we are told, has the personality of a golden retriever. And that’s pretty much it. I often forgot about his existence and the generic lines he gives gave me some strong NPC vibes. This is fitting in a way since Bret has a serious case of main character syndrome and occasionally says shit with some very strong red pill vibes. There are the girls, Susan and Debbie, who predictably fall into the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Susan doesn’t have a personality as such, beyond being beautiful. Time and again, Bret will remind us that she is something else, Not Like Other Girls. Yet, she very much sounds like other girls. She has the most generic personality, her most distinguishing trait is that of being the object of desire of Thom and of Robert. Then there is Bret’s girlfriend…where to begin. The way Bret behaves towards her is disgusting. And I’m not even talking about what happens later on in the novel but from early on. His distaste for her person and her body, his completely denying her a mind, feelings, personality, depth, and so on, was dehumanizing. Bret’s misogyny proves that yes, sometimes, misogynists do come in shapes that are different from your good ol’ standard cis straight man mold. From the careless way, he calls her slutty, to the way he suggests that the way she comports herself is solely to gain male attention, to him being neglectful and dismissive of her, to his feeling more sympathy for Thom (whose parents have divorced) than Debbie (her mother is an alcoholic, and her ‘closeted’ father makes passes to her male friends). The sex scenes with her were a mix of grim (ragazza, file a restraining order) and turgid (of course, making this 'slutty' girl orgasm is easy for bret). Then there are the two boys Bret has flings with, one is the dopey stoner, Matt, and the other one is this Ryan guy who is very much the epitome of the bro. But of course, the true centerpiece in the novel is Robert, the new guy.Now for the first 100 pages, like I said, I feel almost hypnotized by the fevered quality of Bret’s recollections. In the opening pages time and again Bret says ‘I remember’, and the rhythm created by this repetition is mesmeric. These idyllic last days of summer brim with the promise of youth, yet, these are tainted by Bret’s ominous foreshadowing, as he refers to the danger to come, and that things will never be as they once were between him and his friends. Bret is suspicious of this new guy from the moment he learns about his existence, finding it strange that he would transfer for his senior year and that he was able to get into their exclusive school. We become aware that Bret believes he is playing pretend, a role even, and that once the school year is over he will be able to make a fresh start in college. The night before the first day of school, he happens to see someone sneaking around the school. The morning after, he learns that whoever snuck into the school likely was responsible for a perverse ‘prank’. Bret meets Robert, the new guy, who is nice enough, until Bret realizes that he saw Robert months earlier during a screening of The Shining. He brings this up but Robert denies that it was him. Bret keeps insisting in a way that is guaranteed to give second-hand embarrassment (that’s basically how he behaves throughout the novel). Bret tries to paint Robert as a sinister figure, hinting that on that first day, he was already lying to them about ‘stuff’. And by stuff, I mean that before enrolling in this school, he was in a psychiatric facility. Bret, who learns from Susan about this, decides that this proves that the guy is a freak. Bret convinces himself that Robert was responsible for the prank, based on him denying he was at the cinema + not telling Bret's clique that he was in a psychiatric facility (and why would he? the guy literally just met these people so not opening up about this doesn’t seem weird; after all, when bret learns about this he becomes hysterical, proving that robert was right in not disclosing his personal life story to them). Additionally, Bret seems to forget that he too is a liar. Anyway, Bret begins stalking Robert from the get-go and is scandalized that Robert catches him and isn’t happy with it (pretty sure bret calls robert a lunatic…which pot kettle mate). Every time he spends time with his bland group of friends Bret makes his outlandish feelings for and suspicions of Robert known and is frustrated that no one feels like he does. There are so many ridiculous scenes where an agitated Bret is about to have a hernia over Robert being a freak or responsible for ‘terrible’ things. Every-time Bret accuses Robert of this (to his face, to his friends, to adults) he is so apoplectic and hysterical it seemed weird that the people around him could move on from the frankly unhinged shit Bret just said. Bret’s paranoia is exacerbated by the sight of Robert and Matt (the guy he sleeps with) talking, and when something is up with Matt, Bret decides that Robert is responsible. Much of the narrative is about Bret either salivating over Robert or going on and on about what a ‘freak’ he is, often painting him as some sort of a ‘psycho’ mastermind. I swear, there were times when Bret is fixated on using a certain type of imagery when interacting with Robert, one that hints at Robert’s having several ‘faces’, that made The Shards come across as a third-rate Death Note. Bret’s morbid delusions are repetitive and seem to stem from him being attracted to and jealous of Robert, and being impressively ignorant about mental health (which is weird given that he paints himself as being intelligent and astute, a reader and film enthusiast…wouldn’t he have read sylvia plath? watched one flew over the cuckoo's nest?).There are a lot of interactions that are about nothing. But not even in a realistic mumblecore way, these backwards and forwards were generic and often unconvincing. These conversations are meant to come across as intriguing, possibly hinting at the clique’s shifting allegiances and dynamics, but they succeed in only being bland and as insightful as a puddle. Bret’s friendship with these people is so shallow, that I didn’t ever feel particularly troubled by the supposed in-group tensions and petty fights. I understand that you might romanticize or come to mythologise certain aspects of your childhood or in this case your teenage years (which according to hollywood are everything), but then, make us care too. But no, we have to have these preposterous backwards and forwards that go nowhere and achieve nothing. Turns out that Thom and Susan tell Robert that Bret doesn’t like him, Bret is angry at first but this never goes anywhere (do i even care though?). Bret keeps wanting to get involved in the love triangle between Thom, Susan, and Robert not so much because he actually cares and is worried about Susan, but because he believes that Thom “didn’t deserve this” and he wants to keep his clique as is. Bret is so noisy and sanctimonious about Susan’s love life, often demanding to know how she feels about Thom and/or Robert. His distaste for Susan and Robert’s behavior is rich coming from the guy who eventually becomes involved with his gf’s father. But Bret is quite venomous when it comes to Susan and Debbie being taken by Robert, which again, is quite hypocritical given that he spends way too much time fantasizing about Robert’s body.Eventually bad shit does happen and Bret is convinced that Robert is responsible. Not only because of him being a ‘freak’ and a ‘liar’ but at the party, Robert starts making obscene comments about what he would do to Susan. Rather than dissuading Susan from becoming involved with him by telling her what Robert said, whenever he speaks ill of Robert in front of others he just keeps going on about the same shit in a way that comes across as unfounded, irrational, and prejudiced, so no one, surprise surprise, takes him seriously. He even confronted Robert himself a couple of times, but these moments were far from suspenseful. The book wants you to think that it's this psychosexual cat-and-mouse game with a nihilistic vibe (in bret’s words: “numbness-as-a-feeling aesthetic”) but it all felt puerile, affected, and lacking any nuance whatsoever. Funnily enough, I haven’t even spoken about the whole serial killer/cult/true crime aspect of the story. There is this killer on the loose, girls disappear, houses are being broken into, and pets disappear. All of this troubles Bret, but not the people around him. Time and again he believes someone else is in the house with him or that he is being watched and so on. He soon enough becomes convinced that it is Robert. Based on what…? His earlier (mis)conceptions and delusions and paranoia? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting Bret the misogynist to care about the victims or wonder about their lives, their fears and desires, but I did think that he would question the motives of this killer, think about what drives or compels someone to enact such violence and depravity (nurture? nature?) but he doesn’t. Robert is a ‘certified’ freak. That’s that.The story being set in LA also means that we get a ton of pages blabbering on celebrities, influential people, and the state of the entertainment industry in the 70s and 80s. The men in these rarefied spaces are granted semblances of personalities, and Bret even feels some degree of pity/empathy towards the ones he sees as old, washed-up, and pathetic. But…the women are not. This brings us back to Bret’s misogyny. Not only he doesn’t consider them as complex a being as man, but the way he talks about women left me with the impression that he did not attribute any sort of complexity or depth or intelligence, be it emotional or analytical, to them. Like many people who are way too obsessed with serial killers, he doesn’t give a shit about his victims (or at least, his female victims), he doesn’t think that someone like Debbie could experience anything meaningfully, he also views Susan as beautiful, and not much else, and sees her an object (either “unattainable” or be possessed by his bff thom), and all of the women over 30 are neurotic alcoholics. I found Bret to be an arrogant, hypocritical, edgelord whose navel-gazing (seghe mentali) is by no means as shocking, subversive, or intelligent as it wants to be. You know how (often) other's people dreams are just boring? Even when they are convinced of their dreams specialness? And they insist on recounting them to you even when you make it clear you are not that interested? That’s how I felt listening to Bret's interior and exterior blathering.I had the feeling that Ellis was trying hard to use certain motifs, but he does so inconsistently. But what really annoyed me was just how often Ellis felt the need to stoop to polemical asides, that try to make fun of younger generations for being pc, ‘sensitive’, and simplistic in their understanding of human nature (labeling people/things as good/bad)...in a way that, to use, as Ellis would say, the ‘parlance’ of today, is cringe. Mate, it’s embarrassing. Stop. We get it. Back then students could whistle at Susan and that was okay, she LIKED it even. Back then, a grown-ass man could proposition an underaged person, with the tacit and/or spoken understanding that in exchange for sexual favors they will be able to advance their career or something along those lines, without being labeled a predator. Boo-hoo. Bret even whines about when he thinks that someone like Thom would be called “in today’s parlance, a white privileged male, a king of the system”. Imagine that.

Shinzo portrays their routines in such a soothing yet compelling way that I found myself unwilling to interrupt my reading. Ikuta Hiroto, one of our protagonists, is a self-described freeter who is in his late twenties and leads a content carefree life. He has no interest in having the kind of life that his peers and his society expects of him, and he is satisfied working part-time and drifting along. He eventually inherits a house that belonged to a neighbourhood granny, who he had struck an unlikely friendship with. He is joined by his cousin, 18-year-old Natsumi, an aspiring mangaka, who has moved to Tokyo to attend university.Natsumi however feels out-of-place in the city, and struggles to make friends.I cannot praise this manga enough. It was a balm to my soul. I liked everything about it. From Shinzo's reflections on modern work culture, to his exploration of loneliness and hope. There was something so refreshing and nonjudgemental about the way he depicts his characters (their personalities, their struggles) and I found the focus on, often unexpected, friendships to be delightful....more",Notes are private!,0,23,2,"Dec 25, 2023Dec 2022","Dec 28, 2023Dec 2022","Jul 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59821941-1-hirayasumi-1

Her experiences versus mine, as if she owned that part of history and I could only receive it second hand. Sometimes. Rarely. Never.” Uneven execution aside, Ghost Girl, Banana makes for a compelling and immersive spanning decades and continents, exploring identity, belonging, and the tribulations of two women, mother and daughter, as they attempt to survive family expectations and deceptions. Some minor reservations aside, this debut certainly succeeds in establishing Wiz Wharton as an author to watch as her writing is confident and her story is thematically rich. The chapters alternate between Sook-Yin’s one, which takes place in the mid-60s and early 70s, as she leaves Hong Kong behind to work as a nurse in England, and her youngest daughter, Lily, during Hong Kong's Handover to China in 1997.We know that Sook-Yin dies while Lily is still young and that after her death her presence was in many ways erased from their household. Lily, who has always been made to feel like the messy ‘problem’ child, suffers greatly because of this but her sister, whose ‘adulting’ is far more successful, avoids talking about her. Their father has also recently passed away which leaves Lily and Maya completely alone…or so Lily thinks until she receives a letter informing her of an unexpected inheritance. Fulfilling the inheritance’s requirements Lily, unbeknownst to Maya, travels to Hong Kong, where she begins to uncover her family’s secrets and her mother’s connection to the bequeather of her mysterious inheritance. In Hong Kong Lily is overwhelmed, both by her mother’s history and struggles to feel like she belongs when time and again she is reminded of being an outsider, that is a ‘ghost girl’. “My mother is from Kowloon.” Over the years I'd evolved into the present tense and used it now by default. I found it more accessible for strangers; people were more amenable to what they expected rather than the thing that might have been true. In Sook-Yin’s chapters, we follow her as she journeys from Hong Kong to England where despite her best efforts she finds herself having to make the best of unforeseen circumstances that lead to taking a nannying position at a childhood acquaintance's household. Through her ‘employers’ she meets a white British man who promises her a working opportunity that however never comes to fruition. Rather, he pursues her and pressures her into going out with him. Even at a long distance Sook-Yin’s brother continues to berate her and sways their mother’s opinion of her (that she is a failure, a disappointment, good-for-nothing, etc.). Sook-Yin’s reputation and well-being are threatened by an unexpected pregnancy, which leaves her with little choice but to marry Julian. Julian is manipulative, often playing the part of a loving, or inoffensive at least, husband who makes one disastrous financial mistake after the other. They eventually move to Hong Kong where Sook-Yin is reunited with a boy she harbored feelings for, now a wealthy married man, who also happens to be friends with her brother. Sook-Yin’s brother seems determined to make her life hell as he continues to behave appalling towards her, berating her for having married a ‘colonizer’ and for having had children with a white man. His hatred for her is so strong that he seems intent on sowing discord in her marriage. The story’s setting and sense of time are strikingly rendered, both in Sook-Yin and Lily’s chapters. That we get to follow their respective experiences in England and Hong Kong gives the novel a comparative dimension and it makes us more aware of the similarities and discrepancies in their circumstances and in the kind of opportunities that were available to them. Both are made to feel unwelcome wherever they go: from the racism Sook-Yin experiences once in England to the hostility aimed at her back in Hong Kong for having married a British man (and is derogatorily called a ‘banana’); whereas Lily is biracial, and unlike Maya, who ‘passes’ or at least has attributes that fit in more with Western beauty standards, is often made to feel as if she was an ‘exotic’ attraction.The storyline did become repetitive towards the middle and the latter half of the novel, as by then we already know the lengths Sook-Yin’s brother will go to in order to make her life hell. Sook-Yin’s husband is awful and I think the story lets him get away with a lot, painting him as injudicious and naive as opposed to a gaslighting exploitative liar. He was gross. Curiously enough Lily, who doesn’t know her parents' marriage or the many ways in which her father manipulated and betrayed her mother, and should therefore in theory have remembered her father fondly or with some level of warmth, affection even barely thinks of him…which is weird given that he died recently. But his existence and death barely make a dent in her narration…which is odd. Her dynamic with Maya and her rich awful husband brought to mind Fleabag, and I wish more could have been done to make these characters more rounded. We are told Lily is a messy disaster but she just doesn’t come across that way. She also sounded strangely old-fashioned and I had to keep reminding myself that she was 25. I just wish she’d had more of a personality but the novel ends up utilizing her as a vehicle through which we can uncover Sook-Yin’s past. This made the novel rather reminiscent of those dual narratives type of books where a daughter or granddaughter comes across a diary, some letters, a photo, or inherits a house that shines a light on some family secrets. “The first rule of life is pretending. It was all a charade. A big bluff. The most surprising thing, however, was that as much as these people had deceived her, they seemed to have deceived themselves too. Was this the secret to belonging? Her cynicism turned to curiosity.” I wish that Sook-Yin’s fate and the whole drama involving her brother, her husband, and her childhood friend hadn’t been so drawn out and that maybe we had been given more of Lily and Maya together. In general, I was more interested in the this mother-daughters trio than the male characters, all of whom come across as bland. I think that having Maya's perspective would have benefitted the novel, a triptych structure, a la Francesca Ekwuyasi's Butter Honey Pig Bread, would have allowed for a more nuance exploration of the sisters' relationship. At the end of the day Maya's voice, her whole character, is pushed off page only in favor of an unnecessary 'twist/reveal'. Still, Wharton's portrayal of Hong Kong and her depiction of Sook-Yin's experiences in England were striking. I also found Wharton's exploration of migration, belonging, self-sacrifice, and survival to be compelling. Other themes receive a more superficial treatment, and this may due in part to simplistic characterisation (especially when it came to 'bad' characters...).Despite my criticism, I would still recommend this novel, especially for those who are keen on stories where a character embarks on a 'life-changing' journey. I, for one, really look forward to whatever Wharton will publish next. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Feb 16, 2023","Feb 20, 2023","Jul 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61387385-ghost-girl-banana

It slathered everyone in her path and she didn’t care how it hit or who it hurt, as long as she was giving it.When Trying to Return Home is yet another collection of short stories that begins with a bang but peters out with each subsequent story. McCauley’s writing is certainly accomplished enough as she is able to render the setting of her stories, some of which take place in Puerto Rico others in the midwest and across the southern states. The characters however failed to come fully into focus, however, grounded in reality their circumstances were. We have a lot of sleazy boys and men who ultimately came across as rather one-note. There is also a story about infidelity that relies on a rather gimmicky literary device that doesn’t make the experiences of each person involved more realistic or vivid. The first story instead was poignant and atmospheric: we follow a young woman who finds herself unable to extricate herself from her mother’s influence. We are made to understand that the love they feel for one another is messy and that the mother uses her daughter’s love for her, even if it means putting her daughter at risk. I liked how nonjudgmental the author is when exploring parenting, motherhood in particular. In the remainder of the stories the author continues to explore the experiences of characters who are Afro-Puerto Rican and find themselves having odds with their own desires or having to navigate the expectations and desires of the people in their lives. While this is by no means a bad/weak debut I would be lying if I said that it was particularly memorable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 10, 2023","Feb 14, 2023","Jul 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61275050-when-trying-to-return-home

In some of these poems, Nina Mingya Powles examines how language has affected the way she interacts with her family members, her grasp of Mandarin, and writers like Eileen Chang and actors like Maggie Cheung. Some of these poems are light, ephemeral even, others appear more like snapshots, ones that capture in vibrant detail a certain mood.“When reading her stories in translation it’s like trying to see her from a great distance. Or through a thick pane of glass. I am standing outside, peering into rooms where her ghost has been.”Sometimes a certain memory or image leads Powles, and us, into unexpected places, so that we come to surprising realizations or observations. Many of these poems are suffused by a sense of longing, a nostalgia even. Powles yearns for connection, for clarity, for a more clear understanding of her own history. While the experiences and images within these poems are clearly very specific to Powles, there were many instances where I felt very in sync with the way Powles articulated her feelings and/or impressions. I liked the rhythm of her words, the imagery she creates, and the reflections she makes. The melancholic atmosphere permeating these poems adds to their introspective mood, and I even found myself revisiting my favorites once I’d finished the collection. “Everything is in a haze, a sunken dreamworld seen through pink stained glass. Everything around me might collapse at the slightest touch. Light, sound, the air that separates you and me.”Powles’ interrogation of language, its limitations, and its potential, brought to mind the work of Jhumpa Lahiri, Kim Thúy, and Victoria Chang. The comparative dimension Powles brings into her poems, as she refers to real-life people and art, brought to mind Olivia Laing. If you are looking for a melodic collection exploring language, memory, and identity you should definitely add this release to your tbr list. “In Chinese one word can lead you out of the dark / then back into it / in a single breath”...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Sep 02, 2022","Sep 12, 2022","Jul 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54348017-magnolia

The street air was hot and loud and dirty and the buildings were so large."").for the record, i am not a fan of so-called purple proses, or proses that rely on too many metaphors or whatnot, and in fact, i like proses that are simpler, more subdued. but the writing in this book comes across as just flat & uninspired. imagine someone giving an unemotional & uninvolved scene-by-scene description of a film (""She brushed her teeth. She made coffee and toast. She drank the coffee. She buttered the toast. She ate it looking out on the street."")sometimes sure, we get these descriptions that do manage to evoke a certain atmosphere (""They watch a film, they fall asleep, they wake on the sofa. Soft light. Warm and pell mell limbs. They brush their teeth, one toothbrush. Lights off. Pyjamas. Fingers in fingers […]""), as they capture a certain mood or phase of one's life, but for the most part the writing was too dry & affected for me. and what am i to make of these descriptions...""a person who looked fifty-five years old"" and ""she looked somewhere between forty-one and fifty-three years old"". at one point we are being told about the childhood of one the main characters and we are informed that ""There were thirty-three kids in 7C"" and i kid you not, we then get each name. what was the point? and before you @ me saying that they were included to give readers an idea of the ethnicity & gender of these kids i say ma che minchia dici?! anyway, the dialogues attempt to go for a mumblecore vibe, so we get a lot repetition and not-fully-formed sentences. sometimes these were convincing in rendering the way we actually speak in rl (""and well he didn't talk much to Johnathan these days, no he didn't talk much to Jonathan these days"") but there were times were they made no sense (such as with: ""What you do you lot do now go on 'dates'?""...even if the man in question is meant to be a tipsy and bumbling idiota i don't think that's how that phrase would come out). the novel is very much concerned with politics and i wish that the focus on this did not come at the expense of its characters, who ultimately seem as vehicles through which the author can discuss the UK and Brazil's past & present political climate. the two mcs are painfully one-note and i forgot they even exist most of the time. i can like books that are all about the vibes but the writing here didn't capture me enough to make me forget about story & characters. while i appreciate that the author talks about current social issues, without presenting us with cartoonishly evil conservatives, there were many instances that made me question why the author hadn't written a nonfiction or a bunch of essays instead (i probably would have liked them a lot more). the book does seem to go for a very anglo-american view of Brazil and Latin America (for instance, the myth that there aren't any white Brazilians)....again, maybe the latter half of the book will challenge this more so the jury is out on this point.maybe one day i will pick up this book and find myself vehemently disagreeing with everything i have said (or written) so far but at this point in my life this type of edgy millennial writing style is not for me. anyhow, i wish the author the best and i feel genuinely bad for not liking this. i really wanted to love it, and i did find some scenes aesthetically pleasing, but it was not enough to hold my interest....if you are interested in this book i 100% recommend you read some more positive s as it just so happens that i did not get on with the author's style....more",Notes are private!,0,14,0,not set,not set,"Jun 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59666036-there-are-more-things

He works in a record shop, shares a place with his best friend, and spends most of his nights exploring North London’s indie music scene, getting increasingly drunk at venues and pubs. He’s seeing a counsellor but knows that his NHS allocated hours are running out and soon enough he will be left alone to cope with his debilitating self-hatred and depression. His two closest friends are not only together romantically but they have a band together, and Noah, feeling that he’s being left behind, spirals into self-destructiveness. One night, after a venue with his favorite band, the enigmatic Smiling Politely turns awry, Noah seeks refuge outside where Dylan, a charismatic barman from Australia, comes to his aid.When he starts getting to know Dylan, who is a couple of years older than him, he sees him as a cure to the overwhelming emptiness that has become increasingly hard to keep at bay. His infatuation with Dylan is complicated by the fact that Dylan is ‘straight’ and by his living arrangements: Dylan lives with Fraser, an incredibly mercurial man who doesn’t take kindly to Noah ‘inserting’ himself into their lives. Noah becomes entangled in their very toxic relationship but soon finds his attraction to Dylan shifting to Fraser. As Noah spends more of his time with them, getting drunk and high, neglecting his mental health and physical wellbeing, he finds himself alienating the people in his life. His friends try in vain to reach out but Noah is unwilling or unable to ‘lean’ on them. Eventually, his dishevelled appearance and tardiness get him in trouble at work, and Noah finds himself crashing at Dylan and Fraser’s place. Noah becomes wholly consumed by their relationship, to the point where he compromises himself to belong with them. He becomes a participant in the unhealthy cat-and-mouse dynamic between Dyland and Fraser. Their volatile relationship and living situation do not make for a good environment, as they seem to enable each other to engage in harmful behaviours.Konemann renders with heart-wrenching lucidity Noah’s vulnerabilities, his yearning to fit in, to be loved and to belong. He also captures with brutal intensity Noah’s his anxiety, his self-hatred and his self-harming, without ever romanticising his spiralling mental health. We see how difficult it is for Noah to rid himself of the deep-seated and poisonous belief that he doesn’t matter, that he is worthless, a non-entity. We also see how this deeply affects him in his day-to-day life, and how careless he is with his own safety and wellbeing. Both Dylan and Fraser use him, ignoring all of the warning signs that point to Noah’s ‘unwellness’. They never really let Noah in, keeping him in the dark about the true nature of their relationship, nor are they honest about their intentions with him, hell, sometimes they do not even consider him at all. Once again Noah finds himself an outsider, a witness to the jealousies and manipulations running between Dylan and Fraser.His alcohol and drug consumption lends a murky quality to many portions of his narration and further adds to the gritty atmosphere of the story. His unreliable, often unintentionally so. His self-deception becomes a dangerous coping mechanism, and he can survive only by ignoring his problems and current circumstances.There is a sense of unease permeating much of the story, so I was never able to let my guard down, always worried about people’s nefarious intentions’ toward Noah or Noah’s own self-sabotaging. The author articulates with painful precision the anguish, desperation, and loneliness in Noah, and my heart really went out to him. I could really relate to him, and his conviction that he doesn't really fit in with the queer community.This story is less of a coming of age than a coming undone. The indie music scene serves as a backdrop to Konemann’s troubling character study, which really adds to the novel’s edgy atmosphere. The fraught and disconcerting relationship between Noah and these two older men brought to mind Barbara Vine’s urban tales of psychological suspense (The House of Stairs, Grasshopper). Like Vine, Konemann has given his narrative a very nostalgic vibe, one that doesn’t see the past through rose-tinted lenses, quite the contrary. I also appreciated the thorny exploration of queer desire, and how he underlines how dangerous it is to become wholly consumed by someone you love, to the point where you are cutting yourself off from everyone and everything else.While music is an undeniable component in Noah’s narrative, Smiling Politely serve a rather underwhelming function in the story. Noah’s chapters are interrupted now and again by articles or snippets of interviews with two of the band’s members, Ryan and Claire, and these were kind of unnecessary. They would have made more sense if the band, or at least their music, would have played a bigger role in the story, but they don't. I also would have liked Isaac to be given more page time, at least before Noah becomes wholly obsessed with Dylan/Fraser. The finale was slightly a bit too rushed, but I appreciated the realistic note things ended on. I would definitely read more by Konemann and when I next feel like getting emotionally sucker-punched I will be giving this a re-read for sure. I loved Noah’s compelling voice (ragazzo mio !), the vivid descriptions (of often very grotty & sweaty places), and the realistic dialogues (from the small talk, to the banter and the arguments). Throughout the course of the story, Konemann presents his readers with an uncompromising interrogation of the contradicting and often obscure nature of love and desire. The jealousies, lies, manipulations, and small acts of cruelty add complex shades to his portrayal of love, affection, intimacy, and desire. While in many ways Noah’s narration is limited by his naïveté, his social commentary is interspersed by whip-smart observations and wry assessments that often serve as sources of levity. There are also moments of euphoria that starkly contrast against the novel’s darker themes.I would definitely recommend this to fans of Caroline O'Donoghue's work, as both Promising Young Women and Scenes of a Graphic Nature feature self-destructive main characters becoming entangled in unhealthy dynamics & toxic relationships. The gritty nostalgia in The Arena of the Unwell made me think of Elizabeth Hand, specifically Wylding Hall and Generation Loss.Anyway, I inhaled this novel in less than 24 hours (it really served as a distraction to a particularly sh*tty shift). It was a gripping and heart-wrenching read, one that I won't forget anytime soon....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jun 03, 2022","Jun 04, 2022","May 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60132493-the-arena-of-the-unwell

While Don't Fear the Reaper hasMy Heart Is a Chainsaw was a blast so I was really looking forward to reading more of Jade, my favorite slasher fiend. While Don't Fear the Reaper has the same chaotic energy I had a harder time following its plot. I swear this is the kind of book that made me question if the reason I couldn’t keep up with the story had to do with my brain not being able to process information fast enough. The fact of the matter is that I struggled to make sense of what was happening on the page and often felt that I’d missed some crucial scene transition or action sequence.In Don't Fear the Reaper we are reunited with (most of) the cast MHIAC, except that they are all in various stages of physical and mental recovery after the Proofrock massacre. Jade, who now prefers to be called Jennifer, has just been released from prison and is now back in Proofrock, a place she is both wary of yet unable to leave behind. It just so happens that a blizzard results in the escape of a convicted serial killer, Dark Mill South, who seeks revenge for 38 Dakota men who were hanged in 1862. When the bodies start dropping Jennifer finds herself once again starring in a slasher movie, except that this time the people around her are the ones who seem excited by the foundling events. In a twist of irony, she’s the one to find constant references and slasher-tinted lenses to be ‘annoying’ and a common refrain of hers is to wonder how people put up with how annoying she was about slashers.As I said, I was often confused. The multiple perspectives exacerbated said confusion by jumping around between characters when the story was chaotic enough as it made it harder for me to keep up with where/what each character was. We also get a lot of characters who fail to leave an impression, like the teens who inevitably get mowed down by the slasher. That we have characters pretending to be someone they are not only made things harder for me and my little brain. And maybe I just wanted less of other people and more of Jade/Jennifer. She has changed a lot and we don’t entirely understand that change given that when we left her at the end of MHIAC she was still very much in the same slasher headspace. We learn very little of her experiences in prison or what drives her now. She says that she no longer is the slasher fangirl she used to be but the story fails to delve deeper into her psyche. What I did like was her interactions with (former) final girl Letha whose life and body have been irrevocably altered after her injuries in MHIAC. Sadly, she is now with a forgettable guy from the previous book, and they have a child. I wished that this subplot hadn’t been a thing as Letha is enough of an interesting character not to need props like those of a child or a husband (are they married? i can’t remember).I just missed the old Jade, her frenzied monologues and chaotic energy. Don't Fear the Reaper sadly falls prey to the second book syndrome as it lacks the intensity of MHIAC. Having other perspectives wasn't itself bad, I just wish it didn't come at the expense of spending time with Jade who remains the most interesting person in Proofrock. I'm definitely planning on rereading this befor the final instalment is out as maybe then I won't feel as discombobulated by the story's events....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Feb 07, 2023","Feb 09, 2023","May 28, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59364174-don-t-fear-the-reaper

I have never come across a multilingual graphic novel so it was really refreshing to see Harmony Becker seamlessly incorporate English, Japanese, Korean, and Singlish in her work. I loved that the English equivalent of whatever was being said in Japanese was imperfect, or incomplete, to convey a specific character’s ‘limited’ knowledge/understanding of the language.  We follow Nao, a Japanese-American young woman, over the course of a year that she spends at the Himawari sharehouse in Tokyo. Nao longs to reconnect to her Japanese heritage, but soon after arriving in Tokyo is made to feel like an outsider, an American, a ‘foreigner’. Growing up in America she was also made to feel like an outsider, with her white peers taunting her for the way she looked, for the food she ate, etc.In going to Japan Nao hoped to find that which she’d been so yearning for, a place to belong to. Thankfully for Nao, she’s not alone in her attempts to master the Japanese language and understand/adapt to Japanese customs. She bonds with two other girls staying at the Himawari sharehouse: Hyejung, who is Korean, and Tina, who is from Singapore. The three study Japanese at language school, find part-time work, explore the city, go to festivals, share meals together, etc. The story has a very slice-of-life feel that really gives us an impression of the characters’ everyday lives in Tokyo. Additionally, Becker gives us insight into the girls’ pasts, and we learn more about Hyejung and Tina’s lives prior to Tokyo, what led them there, and what made them stay. I loved the friendship and their moments of bonding together, and I found myself really liking Hyejung and Tina. Now, Nao was harder for me to like. Which is weird given that—to a certain degree of course—I understood her longing to belong, and what she says about feeling more American in Japan and more Japanese in America made me think of how I feel, and I am made to feel, like a foreigner both in England and Italy (*tiny violin playing in the background*). But she had this very binary way of looking at things and her understanding of everything was very…dare I say, American? I could see why she was frustrated by the way Japan is portrayed and spoken of in the West, and her anger at the kind of white people who think that because they watch anime that means they speak Japanese or know all about Japan (there is this hilarious video on youtube that makes fun of this type of person) but the idea that a country or a language belongs only to those who have lived there or have parents who were born there, well, it makes me a bit sad I won’t lie (i am definitely more in line with jhumpa lahiri's way of thinking).Maybe I am being too sensitive about this because I am living in a ‘foreign’ country…I don’t quite know. Also, while she does usually specify that she dislikes white people who playact being Japanese, I thought she was a bit insensitive towards Tina and Hyejung, especially when she complains about being seen as a foreigner (or seems to see this word as inherently negative) when both of them also are foreigners and will undoubtedly experience xenophobia for not being Japanese. I don’t know, I just didn't like her that much. Then again, maybe I am being a bit hypocritical in disliking her...boh.Anyway, despite not really liking Nao, I still loved the friendship she forms with Hyejung and Tina, and I did appreciate the characters' conversations on language, belonging, and identity. The romantic subplots were a bit too heteronormative for my liking (don't @ me, there was some good queer potential here). I’m glad the author didn’t couple up everyone at the house but still…I wish the focus could have remained on the friendship between Nao, Hyejung, and Tina.While I wasn't wholly enamoured by Becker's art style, her illustrations generally strike a good balance between being cute and simple, and she usually conveys really clearly the characters' various states of mind.All in all, this is a good read and I look forward to reading more by Becker. If you are looking for a coming of age graphic novel exploring the realities and complexities of being a young adult, specifically of living abroad, well, look no further. The story has many moments of lightness and sadness, and the ending is rather bittersweet. Becker captures the experiences of feeling like a perpetual outsider, the difficulties in learning and adapting to another culture (or a culture that is you consider yourself part of but did not grow up in), and of making your own way into the world, even if it means leaving your loved ones 'behind'. And of course, the multilingualism at play here is just *chief's kiss*.

For some reason or other I ended up neglecting to read it but at long last decided to give it a try, and I’m really glad that I did get round to it. Written with clarity and precision, A Coastline Is an Immeasurable Thing Mary-Alice Daniel together a more intimate coming-of-age memoir with historical accounts. Daniel writes with compelling authority and her recollections will undoubtedly plunge readers into her childhood and adolescence. She’s able to conjure up not only past feelings but vividly reenact episodes from her youth. The people, dynamics, and situations she presents us with are evocatively rendered, as they seem to capture the mood, essence even, of what is being portrayed. Daniel depicts her family with a heartfelt mixture of love, understanding, and frustration. In these more personal chapters/sections Daniel, born in Nigeria to a Longuda father and a Fulani mother, chronicles her experiences moving from Nigeria to England before finally settling in America. Daniel conveys the seen and unseen difficulties she, alongside her family, experienced once in Reading. She articulates the loneliness and confusion brought about by this dislocation and by an environment that labels you as foreign, other. Her shifting and confused perception of her identity is exacerbated by her Longuda and Fulani heritage and by her adoption of English customs and exposure to English culture. Eventually, Daniel’s family relocates to Nashville, America. Here Daniel is marked as an oddity, yet again subjected to the white gaze and often made to feel excluded from Black American culture. In retracing her childhood, Daniel reflects and gives insight into the experiences of the Black diaspora, contrasting and comparing America and England’s treatment and perception of Blackness and Black immigrants. Daniel addresses and challenges stereotypes about Nigerians, which often place them as ‘inferior’. While terms like resilient may seem trite when used to describe books concerned with immigration and Blackness, it did come to mind while I was reading this. Much of the book adopts a more, not quite detached, but more educational tone. Daniel examines tribal traditions and mythologies, the aftereffects of colonialism, past and present internecine conflicts, and religious and cultural divides. There is a lot of history to unpack but Daniel does so swiftly and skilfully. Sure, Daniel walks down some well-treated paths, for instance when writing about Ham, but she also shines a light on forgotten, or at least overlooked, mythologies and histories. These sections often use an anthropological lens to discuss the traits, histories, and customs of the Fula and the Longuda people. In her overview of Nigeria Daniel looks at its many different ethnic groups and its religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and traditional worship, that often exacerbate civil unrest. By depicting Nigeria as a multivalent country, Daniel demystifies Western misconceptions of Nigeria and West Africa itself. I did prefer when these more informative sections drew from Daniel’s own family histories and myths, as these family tales often enlivened the writing.Belonging is one of this memoir’s major themes, as Daniel probes her conflicted sense of self in the face of dislocation. Daniel shows how one’s identity is shaped both by one’s home environment and by the ‘dominant’ culture of the place one grow up in. Language, accents, family lexicons, food, beliefs, mannerism, popular media, we see how all of these play a role in her ‘coming of age’. Given that movements, be it from continent to continent, or from culture to culture, and the dialogue between past and present are motifs within this memoir, Daniel did try sometimes too hard to anchor her experiences into a larger historical context. For instance, when she mentions ""In 1895, the controversial Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde was imprisoned in Reading, the town I grew up in"", which came across as very random and not particularly relevant.While I may have felt more invested by Daniel’s more personal insights into her family and experiences growing up, I did find the themes, histories, and mythologies she surveys throughout her memoir to be captivating....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Dec 17, 2022","Dec 19, 2022","May 18, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60563712-a-coastline-is-an-immeasurable-thing

Ada Limón’s poems are luminous, and I was struck more than once by her ability to espouse a graceful language with such vivid imagery. Limón has proved that I am not only able to appreciate poetry but be swept away by it. Many of these poems are particularly attuned to nature: from the local fauna to the changing seasons. Limón’s sensitivity to her environments results in some really striking imagery, and more than once I felt transported to the places she described. While I found myself lulled by Limón’s lyrical language and the landscapes she was presenting us with, I was also touched by the feelings, thoughts, and experiences that are interpolated in many of her poems. There are poems where Limón includes snippets of family history and snapshots of a more personal nature, as well as reflections on connection, grief, and her heritage. Although I was struck by Limón’s language, she practices an admirable restraint over it, making those instances where she uses metaphors or ventures into the abstract, all the more wondrous. I read this collection in a particularly bad couple of days and I was uplifted and deeply affected by it.

In the last few months, I have been making an effort to read more contemporary poetry and so far I can safely say that I love Ada Limón’s work and that I found poetry collections like Nina Mingya Powles's Magnolia, 木蘭 and Victoria Chang's Dear Memory to be poignant and evocative. For some reason, this debut poetry collection by Su Cho didn't quite work for me. I found most of her poems to be not contrived, which is too strong a word, but a wee bit affected. Cho’s poems explore and interrogate ideas, aspects, and experiences related to language, immigration, geography, and memory. Maybe I found Cho’s focus on the body and on the organic, to be irritating, but I can’t quite pin those things as wholly accountable for my failure to become engaged in her poems. I tried to get behind her poems, but her words failed to transport me or move me, and I am of the belief that you can’t really force yourself to like/get a poem. That is to say, do not let my  dissuade you from giving this debut a try, given that according to other s I am very much an outlier here.

It is intentional❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ If you are boo-booing this book just because of its title...kindly f*ck off. It is intentionally provocative and I am here for it. To place ‘the mother’ figure on a pedestal is ultimately detrimental to mothers since by idealizing them we cease to see them as real flawed human beings.  I'm Glad My Mom Died is a brutally honest memoir recounting Jennette McCurdy’s abusive relationship with her narcissistic mother, her disturbing experiences as a child actor and the unsettling realities of the entertainment industry, and her long battle with various eating disorders and self-destructive behaviors. I won’t lie, there were many scenes and passages that were very triggering but these never came across as gratuitous or sensationalistic. This is very much thanks to McCurdy’s clear-cut prose, which renders things with clarity and avoids sentimental and moralistic pitfalls. McCurdy’s unadorned style really reflects her younger perspective, as she details the psychological, verbal, and emotional abuse she experienced with a child’s ‘limited’ understanding of those things. As a child McCurdy was unable to identify or articulate the myriad of ways in which she was being abused by the adults around her, specifically her mother, and McCurdy remains faithful to her child’s pov. This is a tricky stylistic choice as I have come across memoirs where I found this re-identification with a younger version of yourself to be gimmicky, contrived, and not at all convincing (like when 30yr-olds actors play teens). Here instead it felt very authentic and effective as it brings home a child’s limited understanding of the abuse they are experiencing (that it wouldn’t occur to them to call it as such, that for them this is the ‘norm’, that they are somehow at fault).Growing up with a narcissist parent (although i must point out that my parent was more of the child-like-emotionally-immature variety) can truly warp your view of the world and your self-perception. Rather than looking back to the past with an adult understanding of this, McCurdy drops us right into the thick of things, so that it felt less like an act of retrospection than a reliving of her childhood.McCurdy was raised in a Mormon family and was homeschooled by her mother Debra, who is prone to fits of rage and hysteria (i use this word in a non-gender-specific way).We witness how controlling and manipulative Debra is, specifically with her daughter. From horrific violations of privacy—Debra carries out body inspections and insists on showering McCurdy well into her late teens—to food policing—instilling and later on enabling McCurdy’s eating disorder—Debra constantly infantilizes and guilt-trips her daughter (using her cancer to win arguments or other people’s sympathy). To placate Debra’s volatility McCurdy would always acquiesce, doing whatever her mother demanded of her in order to please her. We see that this was how Debra is able to push McCurdy into a child acting career, placing her in numerous objectionable situations and putting her under an undue amount of stress by making her the ‘breadwinner’ of the family. As the years go by we see just how deeply this abuse is affecting McCurdy. Her eating disorder soon dominates her life, exacerbating her self-loathing. When McCurdy eventually hits the ‘jackpot’ with i-Carly her fame doesn’t appease Debra, who always demands more of her daughter. We learn more about the entertainment industry, in particular how it exploits children. From the unsafe working environments to the relentless work schedules (interviews, promos, etc.) and the casting process…McCurdy peels the curtain and allows us an unsavory view of what goes on behind the scenes of children shows. McCurdy details the abusive behavior of ‘the Creator’, the director of i-Carly, on and off set as well as the overwhelming realities of being a public figure at such a young age. As her abusive relationship with Debra contaminates every aspect of her life, McCurdy, who has yet to reconcile herself with the f*cked up nature of her mother’s parenting, turns to her eating disorder as a source of (misplaced) ‘comfort’. As her years of disordered eating begin to take a toll on her, McCurdy eventually turns to alcohol and becomes involved in some rather toxic romantic/sexual relationships (one of whom was quite a bit older...schifo). Debra’s cancer eventually leads to her being hospitalized yet again and eventually to her death. After her latest show is shut-down due to the Creator’s behavior, a grieving and confused McCurdy distances herself from the entertainment industry. In the subsequent years, McCurdy seeks professional help, which ultimately results in her gaining a new understanding of Debra (that she wasn’t ‘merely’ overbearing). McCurdy is unsparing in detailing her various eds. Much of what she wrote about her warped relationship with food and her body (she wants to prevent her body from hitting puberty to appease her mother) was truly hard to read about. This is not only because she is brutally frank, but because I had an ed (i’m afraid that i am of the belief that eds, like most addictions really, never really ‘go away’). So yes. I had a hard time with a lot of the content of this book. Thankfully, because McCurdy’s writing is very matter-of-fact I was able to push through my discomfort but if you also have experiences with eds and you are still in a vulnerable place, I recommend you put this memoir on the back burner. Like I said earlier, I appreciated how nonjudgmental and unsentimental McCurdy is. She doesn’t vilify her mother, even if she would have every right to do so, nor does she take the opportunity to blame other family members (i did question how aware mccurdy’s dad was of Debra’s emotional incest: i know narcissistic parents can be quite covert and that they usually tend to parent their children differently but i still wanted to know more about his role in all of this).I know I am making it sound like a bleak-fest, and, well, that’s because it is in fact a depressing read. That title and the cover belie the memoir’s sobering tone. McCurdy does now and again lighten things up, by giving page-time to her friendship with Miranda Cosgrove, her i-Carly co-star, and later on, her mordant humor injects much-needed levity into her experiences. I'm Glad My Mom Died was truly a heart-wrenching read. McCurdy’s voice was as compelling as it was perceptive, and I appreciated just how candid she is. She doesn't portray herself as flawless, nor is she seeking our pity. Hopefully, the people who read this will be able to empathize with her, without focusing only on the ‘juicy’ bits involving her acting career (i have already come across several articles misrepresenting McCurdy’s words and pitying her against Grande…can we as a society move past this need to pit women against each other?).Within this memoir, McCurdy presents us with hard-hitting depictions of abuse, trauma, grief, and eating disorders. My heart really went out to her and I found her voice to be truly captivating. I won't forget about this memoir any time soon, and I look forward to reading or seeing what McCurdy will do in the future as she is a truly talented writer. If you happen to be a fans of memoirs such as Michelle Zauner's Crying in H Mart, T Kira Madden's Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls, & Lily Allen's My Thoughts Exactly, chances are I'm Glad My Mom Died will be right up your sleeve so do check it out....more",Notes are private!,0,162,1,"Aug 10, 2022","Aug 12, 2022","May 16, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died

That is not to say that White Horse is not worth reading as I do think that it does have value in terms of entertainment and in its discussions of trauma, self-destructiveness, and survival. Our narrator is Kari James, an Indigenous woman who is into heavy metal, grunge clothes, and horror books. On the surface, she enjoys a carefree lifestyle but we are given glimpses of her troubled past and her present-day worries. She works at the White Horse, a bar that has come to symbolize more than ‘just’ a workplace to her. We learn that during her teens she lost her closest friend, that her mother died when she was small, and that a car accident left her father permanently disabled. So, despite what her cousin and her husband think, Kari has a lot on her plate. Kari’s life is complicated further by the resurfacing of an old bracelet, which apparently belonged to her mother…soon she begins sighting sinister apparitions, such as her dead mother, and sensing an ominous presence. To break free of this, Kari can no longer let sleeping dogs lie, and has no choice left but to venture into her mother’s past, finding out more about her mother’s side of the family, her parents’ marriage, and her mother’s role as an activist.On paper, this type of story should have really been my thing as Kari had the potential of being the kind of gritty main character that makes me think of Elizabeth Hand, Stephen Graham Jones, and even Grady Hendrix. It just so happens that the story tries to juggle too many elements, and wastes way too much energy (ie page time) on the least interesting dynamic and characters (debbie and her generically controlling and uncouth husband). Also, given the length and pace of the story, I do think that some of the side plotlines should have been dropped as they were not given the time/depth they deserve. Take Kari’s dead friend. She does ‘haunt’ Kari’s thoughts now and again but her character, in addition to being very underdeveloped and the kind of very generic ‘cool edgy possibly a bit of a bad influence’ friend you see time and again in books & films (like thirteen) seemed to be used as a cautionary tale for Kari, which seemed a wee bit unfair to the friend. Kari’s mother also functions as a plot device more than anything. Even the supernatural element is delivered in a rather bathetic way, which is a pity as I think that it really had potential in terms of building and maintaining a certain atmosphere. Debbie’s plotline was just so grating. She has the most generic whiny personality and for most of the novel is shown to be a rather wishy-washy type of person who tells Kari off for defending herself against her drunk husband. In the end, instead, we are shown that she was at some point a decent friend to Kari but by then she had gotten on my nerves so much so that I just wanted her off the page. Her controlling husband is even more generic and cartoonish than she is and seemed to exist only to (supposedly) add tension to the story, given his friction and heated showdowns with Kari. The last section of the story really double-downs on paying homage to Stephen King’s The Shining, even if Erika T. Wurth does view his work through a more critical lens (and is able to discuss tropes related to indigenous peoples and cultures in the horror genre). If the story had solely focused on Kari and her past ‘ghosts’ (her mother, her friend) I would have found this novel much more engrossing. Kari herself was the kind of character I would usually really root for, but much of her characterisation here relies on her grungy aesthetics and her responses to other people saying/doing things, that is to say, that she seemed at times more a vehicle through which the author could tell this story than a character in her own right.Still, even if the plotline unfolded in a fairly predictable way and included scenes that felt like unnecessary filler (we have that scene where kari is on the phone with debbie and the line isn't good so of course, she misunderstands her and jumps to a certain conclusion...) and both the characters and the supernatural element left me wanting, I still found myself engaged in Wurth's storytelling. Even if I may have not been enamoured with the final product, White Horse definitely had some good ingredients and considering this is Wurth's debut I am really looking forward to reading more by her....more",Notes are private!,1,47,1,"Nov 05, 2022","Nov 08, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60652964-white-horse

Alas, despite the last chapters being actually pretty decent, the majority of Central Places was a trite and annoying affair. I was looking for an introspective read, a meditation on family, belonging, and becoming, with a slice-of-life feel, but what we get is an overwrought drama that gives the same energy as not quite a hallmark movie but a netflix original. I kid you at one point a blizzard or whatever forces our main character to spend the night with her former crush…I mean, this is the kind of stuff I could have written in the awful fanfics I wrote when I was a teen. If you’ve read a few of my s you know I like the so-called ‘unlikable’ characters, those whose flaws and messiness aren’t made palatable or excused by something or other in the narrative. What I cannot stand are the type of protagonists we are meant to find sympathetic and root for but who are obnoxious, rude, self-pitying, never listens to anyone or takes actual accountability, and, worst of all, dull (looking at you emily in paris). Nothing is ever their fault, they are always the wronged party. The people who call them out usually are made to have privileges that our protagonists do not have, so their criticisms are made moot. Worst still, Audrey, the main character of Central Places, is a blank. Beyond her annoying responses to other characters, she possesses no identifiable traits. She has a job, she must have colleagues, and she tells us she has a best friend back in NY (who she never thinks of)…but all of these barely make a dent in the narrative, leaving us with a character who seemingly exists from the novel’s first scene in the plane. Even what she tells us about her high school experiences, later on in the narrative, does not give her character a solid history or even a sense of who she is (or who she isn't). We know she had a close friend and a crush on Kyle because he was attractive, a skater boy, and being Mexican-American they shared a tacit understanding of the it means to live in a very white corner of America (hey are both made to feel both hypervisible and invisible, and their existence is often questioned: ""what are you?""). Sadly, Audrey's feelings often come across as very superficial. But I am getting ahead of myself. Central Places follows Audrey as she flies with her fiancee, Ben whose personality is that of the generic straight white guy (he comes from wealth, he enjoyed an easy childhood, and he gets along with his family and his wholly oblivious to experiences and realities besides his picture-perfect one) to Hickory Grove, the small town in central Illinois where she grew up. Audrey hasn’t visited since leaving for high school and is not happy to be doing so now. Her relationship with her Chinese parents is very strained (or so she keeps insisting), and since setting off to NY she has had little contact with them. This is due to the resentment she feels towards her mother who weighed Audrey down with her expectations and made her feel that she wasn’t good enough, that she should keep on studying, and that she couldn’t behave like her peers (going out etc). Now her father is not well, so Ben convinces Audrey to make the trip to her hometown. There Audrey immediately behaves in a very antagonistic way towards her mother, but the narrative frames her behavior as a natural response to how awful her mother is…except that apart from a disapproving remark here or there, the majority of the narrative ignores her mother’s existence. In fact, a good 70% of this novel is far more concerned with Audrey’s rekindled feelings for her high school crush. I absolutely hated how rude Audrey is to her parents. Considering that she is there for her father’s health she barely gives him a second thought, going on and on instead about how Hickory Grove is basically another universe from NY. Mate, sure, it’s a small conservative town. Suffocating, especially if you are not white/straight/cis. But she made it sound like it was this cesspool. Anyway, she reconnects with Kyle, who is there to be the Nice Guy. She also comes across a few high school acquaintances and discovers that a guy she knew, the brother of Kyle’s high school girlfriend, died a few years before and is shocked that no one told her (she cut ties with them so…). Yet, she barely thinks of the boy’s sister, or the boy himself, but she makes it about herself because that was the guy she first had sex with. Yikes. She also sees her former best friend who she dumped while at college. The friend however makes only a few appearances and in one of them calls out Audrey for the way she behaved towards her and the rest of the people they grew up with. But because we can’t make Audrey into an actual unlikable person the way she calls her out is made to be dismissive towards Audrey’s experiences growing up with Chinese immigrant parents. Nothing much happens beyond Audrey overdramatizing every encounter she has. Ben leaves and they have an argument that makes him into a Not So Nice Guy so he deserves to be cheated on. She gets into an argument with her mother over the whole Ben/Kyle debacle, acting very much like a brat towards her. She then remembers the existence of her father who is the most decent character in the lot but probably gets the least page time. Rather than addressing Audrey’s awful behavior the story paints Ben in a negative light (he used his parents' money to buy them a house without consulting her beforehand…which seemed weird given how the first few chapters make him seem caring and recognizes that audrey was very supportive of him when he was getting his career started) so that Audrey’s cheating is swept under the rug. She’s not the bad guy, Ben is. Yeah, sure. Dare I say that whole Audrey was financially supporting Ben felt weird given that his parents are loaded and seem to have a good relationship with him (wouldn't they have given him financial support? maybe this is mentioned somewhere but if so it didn't leave an impression). In the final chapters, Audrey decides just like that to be better and makes (insincere) apologies to the girl whose brother died and her former best friend.I just detested Audrey so much. Her crush on Kyle for instance…at the time of her crush he was with someone (that girl whose brother died) but that didn’t stop her from following him around their last summer at Hickory Grove and hoping that he will make a move on her. In the present day, she reproaches Kyle when she realizes that he knew how she felt and didn’t do anything about it….he had a girlfriend Audrey! WTF. She cheats on Ben but feels basically no remorse whatsoever. In fact, she is angry at her mother who calls her out on it. She is even shown to be annoyed by Ben’s jealousy or his asking if their breakup is because of Kyle…aaargh. Her whole navel-gazing about how different her life in NY is compared to Hickory Grove was cringe. Speaking of cringe, so was the reveal that actually popular guys had crushes on her at high school because she was cool and aloof. Lord.We then have a scene where someone tries to make it seem that Audrey’s experiences growing up with immigrant parents wasn’t as bad as their own one, which once again paints Audrey as the wronged party (given that someone is making an uncalled and invalidating comparison) that had the same energy as that infamous “Oppression Olympics” scene from Ginny & Georgia. If the references to HP and Taylor Swift weren't enough, we also get the classic trying to be 'relatable' 'this makes me a bad feminist' line to establish that yes, Audrey is indeed a millennial. Maybe having actual chapters delving into Audrey’s childhood and adolescence, like in Win Me Something by Kyle Lucia Wu, would have made her into a more fleshed-out character, and it certainly would have given her family dynamics more depth and nuance. As is I can’t help but unfavourably compare the novel’s portrayal of a fraught mother-daughter relationship with the ones you can find in films like Lady Bird and Everything Everywhere All at Once (where you are made to understand both mother and daughter), or novels like Butter Honey Pig Bread, Frying Plantain, and Lucy and memoirs like I’m Glad My Mom Died and Crying in H Mart. I can just think of so many other novels where we follow a character either travelling back to their hometown or moving to the midwest due to work (O Beautiful, Goodbye, Vitamin), a reunion party (The Town of Babylon), their parent’s poor health (The Sleepwalker's Guide to Dancing), and so on and so forth. I can even think of several titles that navigate the experiences of characters who have attempted to sever themselves from their pasts, like Luster, Bad Cree, American Fever, and Liar, Dreamer, Thief. Hell, I have just read a book where the main characters falls out with her best friend because she wasn't involved in the latter's wedding (Sea Change). And don’t even get me started on novels featuring a protagonist who is with this white straight generic guy who has never experienced any hardship really, he has rich or otherwise affluent parents and enjoyed a stable upbringing (Days of Distraction, Disorientation, These Impossible Things, The Four Humors).I just wish that this novel had remained focused on Audrey’s relationship with her family, as opposed to the whole Ben/Kyle drama. Neither guy felt like a real person, but more like a plot device that enable Audrey to go through a very rushed self-discovery journey.I hated how hypocritical Audrey was, and how the story makes her uncalled-for behavior reasonable. Even when her father is unwell Audrey manages to make it all about herself…The way she behaves and responds to the people around her was really aggravating. She is acerbic, rude, and dismissive. I understand that she often feels on the defensive due to having grown up with someone who made their disapproval known, and that being back with your parents may see you revert to your adolescent self, but having her be exclusively this way was tiring. She’s selfish, and self-victimizing, and seems to believe that she is a nice person (her apologies at the end were beyond insincere yet they are meant to redeem her).The writing was okay although it relied too often on phrases like “I blinked”...which I know is meant to convey something in the realms of surprise or incredulity I find it wholly redundant.Anyway, just because this novel was not my cup of tea does not mean you should give it a miss.

Throughout the course of this novel, we read of the trials and tribulations of an art school student Joey, who attempts to reconcile herself with a new existence in San Francisco. She struggles to navigate her new surroundings and often feels alienated by the wealth and stability her peers seem to enjoy. Joey enrols in a film elective and is given an assignment that despite its seeming simplicity sees her moored in procrastination. As she struggles with her initial conceit, that of remaking Wes Anderson’s 'Rushmore' despite having never seen it and relying only on other people’s recollections of it, she adopts a self-doubting mindset, and not only does she begin to doubt her portrait idea but her identity as an artist. Amidst her internal confusion Joey also has external worries pressing on her: her sister, an addict with a long history of erratic behavior, has gone MIA and left her toddler with their mother who in turn blames Joey for not helping more. Joey oscillates between feeling guilty and resentful of her mother and sister, and as she glimpses the lifestyles of her peers, well, she becomes all the more aware of how different her situation is. Her loneliness sees her seeking solace in her friendship with Suz, who seems much more sophisticated and put-together than her. Yet Suz soon reveals herself to be far less enthusiastic about their friendship. Joey’s finances also preoccupy her, especially when her family asks her for bailouts. Tell Me I’m an Artist interrogates the meaning of art, artistry, creativity and authenticity as well as questions the ways in which we attribute meaning or value to our and other people’s art. In doing so the novel offers a lot of food for thought.I appreciate Joey’s narration, which was full of acts of introspection, navel-gazing, and self-doubting, and permeated by longing and disorientation. Joey’s morphing anxieties and desires are articulated in razor-sharp prose that captures with clarity her various moods and states of mind. She may not be likeable but her likability is certainly not the point of this novel. Chelsea Martin allows her to be thorny yet occasionally pathetic, solipsistic yet perspective. Her observations of the people and world around her as well as her reflections on art, academia, and privilege all resonated with me. In rendering Joey’s unease, ennui, and disenchantment Martin demonstrates a keen eye for these difficult-to-pin-down feelings and emotions. We see how Joey’s sense of self-worth affects her art and her self-belief, leading her to procrastinate. The more she worries and agonizes over this portrait, the less she wants to do it. Personally, I found her idea somewhat interesting but as she oscillates between various methods or ways of going about it, I found myself kind of bored by it (which was probably intentional). I would have liked more from the secondary characters, as they seemed kind of hazy around the edges in terms of characterisation. In reading about Suz (whom i disliked given that she disses radiohead fairly early on in the book) I found myself wishing for Selin and Svetlana's friendship in The Idiot and Either/Or. Speaking of Batuman, Tell Me I’m an Artist will definitely appeal to fans of hers. While Martin’s novel lacks Batuman’s deadpan humor it definitely has a similar vibe, especially if we consider the way both these authors have a penchant for describing and detailing the minutiae of their narrator’s day-to-day lives. The settings too are also similar as we follow young women trying to navigate the world of academia and questioning the functions of art, language, etc. All in all, I found this novel to make for a really immersive reading experience. I liked the atmosphere, the unadorned writing (we even get pages with joey’s google searches), and the themes that are at play in it and I look forward to whatever Martin publishes next.If you are a fan of character studies and/or books focused on young women searching for something, even themselves, and attempting to understand themselves and their role in the world, such as Lucy & Wish Me Something, definitely add this to your tbr pile. I could also see this debut to readers who look for books exploring female creativity, such as Writers & Lovers by Lily King,  We Play Ourselves by Jen Silverman, and Self-Portrait with Boy by Rachel Lyon....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Sep 28, 2022",Oct 2022,"May 12, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56149962-tell-me-i-m-an-artist

There were aspects of the storyline that reminded me of certain sections from The Goldfinch and A Beautiful Crime, a book about art 'heist' & queer love. While the publisher’s comparisons to The Talented Mr. Ripley and The Great Gatsby don’t quite convince me, there were moments within the narrative that had definitely had Succession vibes.There is much to be admired in Confidence and overall I definitely liked it more than not, however, it is very much plot-driven, and I’m afraid that the fast pacing comes at the expense of the story and its characters. In the opening pages of Confidence, we learn that our protagonist, Ezra Green, is in prison. Far from penitent, Ezra is putting his conman skills to good use as he has recruited a fellow prisoner into what I can best describe as a pyramid scheme. He then gives us a retrospective of his life in crime, starting with the pivotal meeting of Orson, who is charismatic, conventionally attractive, and confident. The two meet as teenagers at Last Chance Camp, a place for ‘troubled’ teens. Ezra, who comes from a low-income household, ends up there after he begins selling knockoffs and other things to his peers. His parents want him to ‘straighten’ up his act, so the awful Last Chance Camp. Ezra and Orson bond very quickly, and we know from the first that Orson is undoubtedly aware of the effect and hold he has on Ezra. This unbalanced power dynamic becomes all the more glaring as the years go by.“The rich glamorize being poor […] They think it gives you integrity or something. They think it’s like noble somehow to have been poor once. It means you’ve earned your wealth. But that’s a myth, because the poor just stay poor. No one gets rich.”This early section exploring this period of their life is perhaps the one I found most engaging as here Frumkin maintains a good balance between plot and character development. Sadly, the following periods and years of Ezra and Orson’s lives are often presented to us in a stop-and-start fashion, so that we fast-forward over some major events or potentially interesting moments of transition in their lives & cons (rather than showing how they get from A to B, we are told that they have gone from A to B). It was a pity as I think Confidence could have benefited a lot from a slower pace, one that could have allowed for a more detailed and vivid portrayal of their life in crime.Ezra’s compelling voice makes his narration fairly absorbing, to the point where I immediately found myself making excuses and exemptions for his criminal activities and the way he is complicit in and/or the instigator of some very sh*tty behaviour & dealings. Even so, I would have liked for his narration to provide us with some more moments of introspection, rather than consisting so heavily of him giving us summaries of his and Orson’s various schemes or detailing certain aspects of their cons.I also thought that the narrative could have done with more tension and that if Ezra and Orson’s relationship had remained the focus of the story it would have resulted in a more charged atmosphere. Orson’s had the potential to be the type of character who is a bit cypher and leaves you wanting to know more about the way his mind operates (like Ripley). But even when Orson is making an on-the-page appearance, he never captured my attention. I struggled to understand why so many would fall for his manipulations as most of the stuff he says is flimsy & kind-of-generic. I also don’t understand why his presence is so often relegated off page so that I sometimes even forgot of his existence until Ezra reminds us that he worships him and is wholly devoted to him.The side characters were fairly one-note and often come across as caricatures of rich & otherwise privileged people…which weren’t particularly funny or cutting. While the details and information we are giving about ‘Synthesizing’ and ‘Bliss-Mini’, which are at the heart of Ezra and Orson’s latest & biggest con, did not fascinate me all that much, I did find their earlier scams fairly gripping. In their early cons we can feel their titillation and excitement, that rush of adrenaline at getting away with it and ‘sticking it to the man’ and the ‘blood suits’ (white wealthy men). As the years go by however it becomes apparent that Orson is never really satisfied, that he is always on the lookout for the next big thing, and even when the two begin the whole ‘Bliss-Mini’, he still doesn’t seem to have found ‘it’. Ezra, whose criminal activities were borne out of financial necessities, only wants to be with Orson, which also means following him into his increasingly risky and unethical endeavours. As the two expand their operation and make more and more money, we have to question what happened to their earlier motivations, if they have become the people they had set out to take down, and the fallacies of the American Dream. I liked that despite their appearances & first impressions, the author doesn’t push Ezra and Orson into that tired introvert/extrovert mould. While it is clear that Orson is using Ezra, we can see that his manipulations are not wholly devoid of fondness. Yet, I did think that their dynamic could have been portrayed with more depth and nuance. I wanted to ‘feel’ more but was often left rather unmoved by what I was reading. We are told that Ezra is hopelessly in love with Orson, but I couldn’t quite ‘feel’ that. More emotion, more angst even, would have taken their supposedly intense relationship to the next level. It's a pity as I tend to love books that combine the kind of atmosphere & aesthetics you would find in a psychological thriller or crime novel with a tale queer unrequited love (Giovanni's Room, The House of Stairs, An Ocean Without A Shore, Apartment). While the characters populating the rarefied sphere our mc's come to move in where fairly one-dimensional, the social commentary is not, as there are many scenes or observations where the author is able to delve into themes such as privilege, class, and capitalism. I really liked the way the casual way in which Ezra and Orson's sexualities are depicted, without shying away from the realities of being gay/queer/bi in a heteronormative society. Still, even if I didn’t always like how the story was executed I did find Frumkin’s premise & prose to have a lot of promise and they are an an undoubtedly talented author. I will definitely read whatever they write next…grazie to the publisher for granting me an arc <3...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jun 20, 2022","Jun 23, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57580217-confidence

Cassandra, our central character, now an adult, recalls the death of her seven-year-old brother, Wayne when she was twelve. Then, this accident is presented to us again, except this time the circumstances are different. Cassandra tells different versions of his death, and while we cannot tell which one is closer to the truth, she is always somehow to blame. The trauma of his death, and her role in it, have clear ramifications on her adult self. She may not articulate her pain and guilt but the numbness and dissociative episodes she experiences, both as a teen and as an adult, speak volumes. As an adult in fact she says Wayne everywhere, and we are never sure whether the people in question are actually Wayne-look-alikes or merely figments of her imagination. In this way, the author renders the recursive and opaque nature of grief, which does not always manifest itself in tears and i-miss-yous. Interspersed within this very intimate yet enigmatic tale of loss and pain, are incisive observations on belonging and reconciliation. Namwali Serpell’s commentary on race in contemporary America brought to mind the work of Danzy Senna, as they are both unafraid of interrogating uncomfortable questions and realities related to race, racism, and colorism.What lessened my appreciation of this novel was the role of a Wayne-look-alike. He is presented at first as someone who knows something about Cassandra’s history and her family. That he pursues her intentionally and omits telling her that he knows who she is…so many red flags. I seriously and genuinely thought that he was being presented as a potential threat to Cassandra who is so consumed by grief and guilt as to leave her guard down. minor spoilers: The way he describes and talks about her is incredibly gross and sexist. The guy basically sounds like Joe Goldberg from You ( he stalks her ffs! And, steals from her! He has sex with her and doesn’t tell her his true identity/motivations for pursuing her). Wtf. And yet…the story ultimately paints him and his actions in a good light? Because Cassandra’s mum calls the cops on him (a shitty and dangerous thing to do given that he is not white). But why then did the story go out of its way to paint him as this really creepy and manipulative person? Who decides to take advantage of a vulnerable woman? Daje! Their dynamic was incredibly off-putting and made me feel very queasy. The guy needed a restraint order and therapy. The connection between him and Cassandra’s family also seemed kind of random and detract attention from the actual subject of the story (the trauma caused by Wayne’s death). Such a pity because I found the first few chapters to be really ingenious and enigmatic. I found the author’s approach to depicting grief to be both inventive and unflinching, and I liked the surreal and dreamlike quality permeating Cassandra’s recollections of Wayne’s accident and her childhood. The author blurs the line between what happened and what might have happened, in a way that creates tension and propels the narrative forward. Yet, as much as I liked the unreliable nature of her narrative, the supposedly romantic plot that eventually takes the novel’s centre stage, well that was several levels of yikes & oh-god-please-no.If this book is on your radar I recommend you check out some more positive s out as ymmv....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Oct 17, 2022","Oct 18, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59900679-the-furrows

Irreconcilable differences, which can’t really be explained or solved.”  What could have been a polyphonic tragicomedy exploring trauma, abusive and dysfunctional relationships, generational and cultural divides, sex, love, and desire, is let down by a cast of cartoonish characters, repetitive dialogues and interactions, and a rambling plot. The novel’s opening is certainly intriguing as we follow 20-year-old Soledad returning to the neighborhood she grew up in, Washington Heights, which she left two years prior to work at an art gallery and rebrand herself in the East Village. Her past however catches up with her when Soledad learns from her Tía Gorda that her mother, Olivia, has slipped into a deep trance that leaves her unresponsive to the ‘real’ world. Soledad hates her neighborhood, she feels burdened by her familial duties, by the rhythms of Washington Heights, and longs to leave. But she stays, despite her love-hate relationship with her mother.“My name means loneliness in Spanish, the language my mother speaks and dreams in. She said this name would open people’s hearts to me and make them listen. She thought with a name like Soledad I would never be alone.” The novel switches constantly povs, so we get sections centered on Tía Gorda, who resents her sister’s closeness to her own daughter, Flaca, her mother and Soledad’s grandmother, Doña Sosa, who for years has been her husband’s caretaker, Soledad’s uncle Victor, a machista who doesn’t want to ‘settle down’ and has a reputation for breaking hearts, Flaca, a fourteen-year-old who is portrayed as ‘promiscuous’ and ‘bratty’, and Soledad’s mother, Oliviam who watches over the people who are coming and going in her apartment but is unable to wake from her mysterious malady. Now, I liked the premise, and while I don’t usually love books that have no quotation marks and constantly switch povs I was curious to see how this tale of a dysfunctional family would unfold, especially given that it is rooted in magical realism. Also, a week or so before reading Soledad I'd read and loved Louise Erdrich's LaRose, which also features no quotations marks, multiple perspectives, dysfunctional families, fraught mother-daughter relationships, a 'troubled' young girl coming of age, and magical realism....so I actually had a good feeling about Soledad.“We just worry about her fate, like people worry about the hole in the ozone; not doing anything to stop the disaster but seeing it looming in the future. ” My oh my….this novel was all over the place. While I usually prefer books that are less about plot than character development or even books that are more interested in giving us a ‘slice of life’ type of presenting us with some epic saga, Soledad just comes across as an inchoate mess that fails to bring closure or meaning to its storylines. There were so many dynamics and scenarios that are poorly addressed/portrayed or seemingly forgotten about. It did not help that despite the different voices, many of them, regardless if from a 1st or 3rd pov, sounded much like the same person. There was also a lot of repetition. The novel tries to underline over and over again just how fraught, with old and new resentments, and lingering traumas, the bonds between these women are, but it does so in an ultimately very over-the-top fashion. There is no subtlety, no layers. Even statements that seem to suggest a more nuanced understanding of the complicated nature of mother-daughter relationships ultimately felt like weak platitudes about generational differences (that gave me strong 'young people today tsk tsk' vibes) and misunderstandings (borne out of wanting to protect someone you love or preventing them from repeating your mistakes).“My grandmother is split between ideas, countries, her dreams and what’s real.” The fragments we get focusing on Soledad’s older relatives do not make for fully fleshed characters or vividly rendered circumstances. This is a pity as I do think that the novel had the potential of exploring sexual desire in older women, but these snippets seem to paint Soledad’s relatives as rather one-note ‘hysterical’ women (because of course women who emote have to be portrayed as ‘strident’ and ‘irrational’). Soledad is meant to be a sympathetic character, the central piece to this disruptive family portrait, but she just seemed painfully vanilla. Rather than challenging her view/understanding of her neighborhood, her Dominican-American community, her family, the novel makes her change of heart a result of a super seductive guy, Richie, who gives some serious pick-up artist vibes but in reality he is actually a Good Guy, two scoops of trauma for plot reasons, and a good ol’ dose of filial guilt. I did not like her, sure, but it frustrated me that the novel pinned so much on her when it came to Olivia's condition and their strained relationship. I found that scene with her sassy, wise, and cool lesbian friend (who is largely forgotten after said scene) to be queer-baiting. Maybe if the novel had explored her attraction to her or dedicated more time to their friendship or explored her sexuality, maybe then it would have not stood out as at best shallow, at worst ‘sensationalistic’. The worst character was Flaca. Sadly, time and again I have come across this type of adult-authored teenage girl. I don’t need every problematic or troubling thing that appears in a novel to be challenged, far from it, but I just could not put up with how the narrative makes Flaca, basically a child, into a ridiculous joke. Her antics, from acting ‘tough’ to her pursuit of this bloody Richie, her childish responses to her mother and Soledad, everything about her is meant to paint her as a bratty, self-obsessed, disobedient, rude, mean, manipulative, vindictive, stupid, man-crazed adolescent. Her mother tries to instil some sense of duty in her or to make her obey her rules but Flaca doesn’t care. She comforts to society's idea of a teenage girl, someone who is disrespectful (especially towards her long-suffering mother), and who 'puts herself' in danger or 'objectifies herself'... rather than criticizing how patriarchal societies & androcentric cultures sexualize young girls or exploring the harmful power dynamics between an adult man and a teenage girl (she may feel validated/flattered by an adult seeing her and treating her like she is a grownup, that she is special, desirable, etc), it just paints Flaca as 'silly', 'childish', 'promiscuous'. Gorda and Flaca's scenes basically see them fighting, verbally and physically, and that's that. Flaca, we are led to believe, loves her Tía Olivia, but I did not buy it as we are meant to believe that her antics would not be a problem for her Tía?! The worst thing is how Soledad doesn’t worry when she learns that Flaca is interested in Richie and is in fact slightly jealous…WTF. She even tells Richie that ""It's not like I care if you are [after Flaca] or anything. You can do what ever you want"" …is she forgetting that he is a grown-ass man and that her cousin is 14? Soledad, ragazza mia, you don't have to like your annoying cousin who clearly hates you but how can she tell this guy that he can do 'whatever' and go 'after' a 14-year-old???? And she seems to be reassured by his response: ""It's not like I'm all that. It's more like Flaca is a minor and I ain't going there."" Which is not at all fucking reassuring because what is preventing him from ""going after"" Flaca is not that ""that would be gross she is a child"" but that she is ""minor"", the law is against, you know, going with a minor, so he is not going to go there. He claims that he is not giving Flaca any ideas but he constantly is, calling her his ""favorite girl"" and telling her that she doesn't like when she wears ""revealing"" clothes because ""I don't like my favorite girl going around like that. You too classy for that shit"". If he really understood and was concerned for her wellbeing he wouldn’t say shit that Flaca, in her impressionable ‘according-to-this-adult-writer-teen-girls-are-stupid’ brain, can warp into meaning that ""he wants me/he is being possessive/he thinks I'm classy"". Later on, she starts hooking up with a friend of Richie, to get him jealous. The guy is really pushy and pressures her into becoming physical with him (pretty sure he is also a grown-ass man...disgusting). Flaca then spends all of her time whining about Soledad for 'stealing' Richie and even messes with Soledad's stuff. Towards the end she asks Richie why he calls her classy but doesn't ""do anything about it"" to which he replies ""be careful what you wish for""...Btw, all of the men are some shade of vile, stupid, and/or sexist. Richie, supposedly a good guy, is just as sleazy and the way he behaves and talks about Flaca...yikes. Victor has a sudden change of heart from his fuckboi ways that feels contrived and as if exonerating of his earlier behavior...Victor, upon coming across a naked Olivia, fears that ""his dick [will find out] there's a potential place for it, it will pop up"" and that ""he's had that feeling before, where he doesn't care who the person is […] he just wants to fuck"" so he has to remind himself that Olivia is ""not a woman but his sister"".There was so much yuckiness. The sex scenes either made me roll my eyes or triggered my gag reflex, the story deals with heavy themes (like sexual and physical abuse, abusive relationship, child abuse, misogyny) either flippantly or garishly. I also could not forgive this novel for its hatred and misunderstanding of teen girls and its lack of genuine female solidarity (for instance between flaca and solidad). I excepted a lot more, but I found Soledad offensive, simplistic, and repetitive. The exploration of sexuality, complex family dynamics, guilt and forgiveness, trauma and healing, often felt cut short, by a pov switch or yet another fight or ridiculously horny line. The magical realism element also troubled me as I found an aspect of it moralistic (it has to do with olivia's past). Despite all of these issues, I do think that Angie Cruz is (in theory) a good storyteller. She has an ear for language, and while sadly her prose ventures down cliched avenues, there are instances, especially when it comes to describing her characters’ environments, tracking their frenzied thoughts, and in the dialogues (when the characters are not fighting) when she is able to be both blunt and lyrical. Because of this, I actually plan on trying something else of hers.Just because this novel wasn’t for me should not stop you from giving it a go, YMMV and all that....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jan 06, 2023","Jan 08, 2023","May 12, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56070408-soledad

Hua Hsu captures the aesthetics and culture that characterized his college experiences. Hsu recollects the music, clothes, and cultural influences that shaped this time in his life. The memoir is also about his unlikely friendship with Ken, someone whose tastes didn’t really match Hsu's. The two nevertheless become friends and Hsu relates some of their shared escapades. After Ken’s murder, the memoir adopts a more sombre tone, as Hsu renders on the page his own grief as well as those of the people around him.I honestly wanted to love this a lot more than I did. Hsu spends too much time discussing his hobby and interests and not enough time fleshing out or conveying the personalities of the people who characterized his college days. I would have liked less talk about aesthetics and more about friendship tbh. While Hsu does explore grief, he also uses that same section of the memoir to do a lot of college talk that failed to enthuse me. I liked it when he spoke about his calls with his father and the way he captures the atmosphere of that specific period of time. Nevertheless, I wanted something with more of a bite. This was an easy enough read, which is odd given the subject matter. Hsu, I don’t know you, and I’m sure you were being slightly self-deprecating, however, the college self you present in this memoir gave me some serious Not Like Other Guys vibes and that is just not my vibe. He is an alternative, he likes wearing vintage clothes, and wearing band tees (of course, unlike other people he listens to those bands), he is into zines…you get the drift. I’m sure this memoir will resonate with a lot of readers but sadly I found its portrayal of friendship somewhat of a let-down....more",Notes are private!,1,106,1,"Oct 12, 2022","Oct 13, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/59811545-stay-true

L An ingenious and effervescent collection of surreal stories that will definitely appeal to fans of Kevin Wilson, Helen Oyeyemi, and Hiroko Oyamada. Ling Ma has a knack for blending realistic dynamics and issues with absurdist ones, and, in doing so, for subverting our expectations. Ma’s storytelling is playfully irreverent and I was captivated by the fantastical scenarios she presents us with in this collection. In the first story, 'Los Angeles', which very much reminded me of Hilary Leichter's Temporary, our protagonist shares a house with her many ex-boyfriends. Her current partner seems to accept the arrangement but when the exes start to find new places to live our protagonist struggles to adjust. The second story, 'Orange', which actually features a character from the previous story, sees a woman reflecting on a past abusive relationship and sees her determined to find where her ex, who now stands accused by many women of abuse, has gone into hiding. There is a short story that explores a friendship which includes a fantastical drug that can make you invisible. Another short story sees a professor discover a passageway to someplace else in her office’s closet. In yet another, we follow a writer who is in an MFA program and is writing about her mother’s early days as an immigrant in the US. Ma imbues real-life scenarios and issues with a dose of the surreal, making for some incredibly extraordinary and engaging stories that explore the absurdities of modern life and interrogate notions of identity, connection, and belonging. I found Ma’s style deeply engaging and the direction of her stories surprising.

As soon as they were fed, their contents would be regurgitated, undigested.”I am happy to report that I found Shua Dusapin’s second novel much more to my liking than her first one (which i actually tried revisiting hoping that it would be one of those ‘right book, wrong time’ kind of cases but nope). Cool yet incisive The Pachinko Parlour is an accomplished work that is able to simultaneously convey some of the protagonist’s feelings and thoughts with piercing clarity and to lend a certain ambivalence, opacity even, to her narration. Much of what Claire, our main character, experiences and observes is in fact permeated by an almost a hazy dreamlike quality, that really conveys that sense of being stuck in-between two different phases of your life. Claire is spending her summer in Tokyo with her grandparents who own a pachinko parlor called Shiny . She tutors 12-year-old Mieko, a clever yet sheltered child who takes an interest in Shiny.At times the prose is unflattering in its descriptions of Claire’s environments and the people who populate them. Yet this adds authenticity to her narration, as her reality is rendered to us no matter how mundane. Some of the descriptions did bring me pause however, such as ‘Her teeth look discoloured, like shrivelled olives’ or ‘I take a good look at her. Long nose, rounded belly, like a baby seal’, as they seemed a wee bit contrived.During her stay in Tokyo, Claire begins to reflect on her grandparents’ experiences from fleeing a civil war to finding themselves in a country where they are labeled ‘Zainichis’ and even after 50 years they do not seem to feel at ‘home’ in. They lead a fairly isolated life, even keeping themselves apart from other ‘Zainichis’.“Looking at them, I feet overwhelmed. Their lives begin and end with the pachinko parlour.”As Claire considers her family’s history she finds herself thinking about their relationship to her mother, the physical and emotional distance between all of them. The author at times articulate Claire’s sense of directionless and ennui in a way that is at struck me as crystal clear, and at other times instead she plays into the ambiguous and dreamlike ambience of her story, obfuscating and confusing our perception of Claire and the people around her. The Pachinko Parlour is characterized by a coolly hypnotic tone, one that makes Claire’s interactions and introspections all the more captivating. I can see this type of unsentimental yet affecting writing appalling to readers who were fond of Jessica Au's Cold Enough for Snow and Jhumpa Lahiri’s Whereabouts as well as the work of authors such as Jamaica Kincaid, Katie Kitamura, Donatella Di Pietrantonio, and Mieko Kawakami (despite thematic differences their works tend to be focus on solitary and/or lonely women prone to prolonged acts of introspection)....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Aug 28, 2022","Aug 31, 2022","May 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59825231-the-pachinko-parlour

It is always him they want to know about—the father, not the other mother.”The Other Mother is an affecting and nuanced multigenerational tale unearthing long-buried family histories. The author's interrogation of motherhood challenges the heteronormative archetype of the nuclear family, as she focuses on the experiences, choices, and parenting of single-women and same-gender couples. Throughout the course of the novel, readers will witness how parental love is not dictated by blood and the complexities that arise from that. Within these pages, motherhood is a multivalent term, one that changes from mother to mother. The two mothers that are at the chore of the story are flawed and imperfect individuals, who make mistakes believing that they are doing what’s best for their child. The author however is never not sympathetic towards them, nor does she condone their behaviour, allowing instead her other characters within her narrative, and readers as well, to reach their own conclusion about some of their choices. We are made to understand their states of mind, the events leading to them making those choices or the circumstances that aggravated certain ‘bad’ habits. The ‘democratic’ structure of the novel allows for all of the people connected to Jenry Castillo to be given a perspective, to give their side of the story and the rift between his two families, the Pattersons’ and the Castillos’.“What Jenry does know is that he doesn’t belong here, which is how he’s felt about almost every place he’s been. Call it the mark of illegitimacy. But somehow this campus feels different. He’s come here to find something; more specifically, to find someone, which alone gives his presence a purpose. He has come to find his father.”The narrative opens with Jenry starting his 1st year at Brown University after earning a music scholarship. Jenry was raised by his mother, Marisa, a nurse. While thanks to his grandparents he feels a connection to his Cuban heritage, neither they nor Marisa can fully understand his experiences as the only Black kid in his neighbourhood or fill the absence of his father, Jasper, who died when he was two. He has learnt that his paternal grandfather, Winston Patterson, is none other than a renowned professor of African American history at Brown, so once on campus Jenry sets out to find him, wanting to know more about the kind of person Jasper was. When he does speak to Winston, the encounter is far from the bittersweet reunion between two estranged family members. Winston seems not particularly interested or surprised by his estranged grandchild’s existence, and is unwilling to reveal more about Jasper. In fact, he asks why Jenry is so focused on Jasper when it was his sister, Juliet, who was involved with Marisa. Upon learning this Jenry is shocked and confused, angry at Marisa for having hidden the truth from him, and unsure what it even means that at one point in his life he had two mothers. The following sections, focusing on Marisa, Juliet, Jasper, Winston, and Victor, Jenry's maternal grandfather, give us a retrospective of what occurred between Marisa and Juliet, their love story and the eventual dissolution of their relationship. We know from the start that Marisa took Jenry away from Juliet without any warning, leaving her with no way of contacting them. Since then Juliet has struggled with addiction and has only in recent years been able to find a stable relationship and job. Her career as a musician seems to have gone astray soon after Marisa left, leaving Juliet bereft and alone. And what role did Winston and Victor play in their daughters' stories? Both men disapproved of their relationship and their ‘unconventional’ family, but, did they eventually try to do what’s right by them and Jenry?I really appreciated the uneasy questions this narrative raises in terms of doing right by others and yourself. If you do something terrible (whether it is taking them away from a parent, pressuring them academically, or forcing them to deny who they are) but you have convinced yourself it is the best thing for your child, can you and should you be forgiven?The narrative shows the many ways in which parents hurt their children out of ‘love’ or because they are unable to accept them and their choices, without exonerating them or villainizing them. Other characters may blame them but thanks to the book’s structure we can’t really favour one perspective over another. If anything, the author is able to show the justifications and fabrications some of the characters make in order to justify to themselves, and others, their actions. I appreciated how imperfect and messy the characters were and the different forms of love we see in this story. The author captures the longing, heartache, and regret experienced by her characters in a melodious prose.“The loss of him fills her body, courses through her veins. And now, as her memories replay over and over, she can’t help but feel it all—the sadness, the loss, the love she had and perhaps still has for him—flowing into her limbs, making her skin twitch, her fingers ache, till it spills from her eyes as tears.”The uneasy character dynamics that are at play within the story were deeply compelling and enabled the author to incorporate larger discussions on gender, sexuality, race, class, motherhood, cultural and generational differences. Additionally, grief underlines much of the narrative. It may be grief at the death of a loved one (Jasper) or grief resulting from physical and emotional separation (Jenry being taken away from Juliet, the unbridgeable rift between Marisa and her mother, the distance between Juliet and Winston and eventually Jenry and Marisa). I loved much of the story and found myself particularly moved by Juliet’s portion. The author beautifully articulates her sorrow, without romanticizing her struggles or painful experiences. Initially, I found myself also feeling sympathetic towards Marisa, despite her choice to take Jenry away from Juliet. We see how unrequited love and rejection can eventually alienate you from the ‘object’ of your desire. But then in the latter portion of the book, any affection I held for Marisa perished when she behaves in a really crappy and unfair way to her son. Jenry, upon learning that she had lied to him for years, is obviously angry and upset. She is initially shown to be desperate to make amends, and I really felt for her especially given what she is going through. But then when she eventually reaches Jenry she tries to force him into forgiving her by threatening to make him leave Brown, saying that this place had clearly ‘changed’ him and he’s clearly not ready or something…and cristo dio. Wtf?! What a f*cking stronza. Really. When she said that sh*t and the narrative glosses over it I just could not move past it. It infuriated me beyond measure and soured the remainder of my reading experience. Additionally, there was a predictable soap-opera reveal that was hinted at earlier on that just made me roll my eyes. The ending sequence was tonally a lot different from the narrative so far and struck me as mawkish and really jarring. But hey ho, I did love most of the book so I would still recommend it to others. If you are a fan of multigenerational sagas, such as the ones penned by Brit Bennett, Ann Patchett, and Margaret Wilkerson Sexton, or authors such as Hala Alyan, Jhumpa Lahiri, Kirstin Valdez Quade, Danielle Evans, and Francesca Ekwuyasi, you should definitely not miss The Other Mother....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"May 13, 2022","May 16, 2022","Apr 30, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59432947-the-other-mother

Like Riordan’s books, Zhao combines an action-driven quest with a coming of age tale exploring the highs and lows of being a 12yr boy. I loved the way the author managed to incorporate—with varying degrees of self-awareness—existing tropes of the 'chosen one/kids with powers' genre whilst adding new dimensions and elements to their story. Additionally, unlike a lot of MG books, Zhao addresses serious and topical issues/realities in a very clear-eyed and straightforward manner.Zachary Ying, our main character, has tried to distance himself from Chinese culture in order to fit in his white majority school. His mom, who is his sole carer, works long hours, so Zack spends a lot of his time playing Mythrealm. One day at school he comes across Simon who seems eager to get to know Zack. Turns out that Zack, the host of the spirit of the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who, alongside Simon, host to Tang Taizong, and later on Melissa, host to Wu Zetian, are tasked with a crucial mission: they have to seal the portal to the Chinese underworld before the Ghost Month. Zack doesn’t really want to be part of all of this but with his mom’s life in jeopardy, he has little choice in the matter. Unlike Simon and Melissa, however, Zack’s emperor was not fully able to possess him and was forced to tie himself to Zack’s AR gaming headset (which lends many of the action sequences a gameplay quality). To rectify this Zack flies to China to strengthen his bond with his Chinese heritage, all the while being chased by baddies…but as their mission unfolds and Zack learns more about the emperors’ reigns, he begins to worry that he is not working for the good guys either.Throughout the course of the narrative, the author references superhero comics, games, anime (i mean, code geass gets a mention which will always be a win in my books), as well as, you guessed it, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The narrative is quite self-aware in that these references often come at an apt moment, and usually poke fun at the existence/perseverance of said trope/storyline (for example with the 'fridging' of zack's mom). I liked this meta aspect of the narrative as it gives the storytelling a playful edge that serves to counterbalance the more serious themes/scenes. Through Zack’s storyline, the author is able to explore the everyday realities of being a Chinese-American kid who feels pressured by his white peers to distance himself from his own Chinese heritage. Additionally, Zack is Hui, an ethnoreligious minority group with Islamic heritage and/or adhere to Islam. Like other minority groups in China, the Hui can be and are discriminated against by the current Chinese government. Zack’s father was executed after protesting the government's treatment of Uighur Muslims, and this makes his journey to China all the more fraught. While the author criticizes the current Chinese government, through Zack’s quest they are also able to showcase their love for Chinese culture and history, presenting us with a complex image of this country, its past and present. The author's depiction of and discussions around China oppose the kind of monolithic and homogenous image of this country that sadly seems to prevail in a lot of western media and public discourses. The China that emerges from these pages is enriched by its expansive history and many idiosyncrasies (other MG authors, please take notes!).I loved the way they incorporate historical facts in the action sequences, so when we are introduced to a new historical figure we get a punchy introduction giving us an overview of their life. There were instances where I wish the author had not added American, or otherwise western, equivalents when introducing a certain figure or when touching upon a certain historical period (we often are given enough context to understand the cultural/historical significance of said person/period). Still, I really appreciated how the author avoids the usual good/bad dichotomy that tends to be the norm in a lot of MG books. Zack repeatedly questions the past behaviours and present motivations of the emperors.The chapters all have funny titles that were very much a la Riordan. The banter between the various emperors and historical figures was very entertaining, even in those instances where it was trying a bit hard to be ‘young/relatable’. I loved the way the narrative includes and discusses historical-related things, as it very much reminded me of the author’s youtube content, which—as you may or may not know—I am besotted by. While I thought that the historical characters were equal parts interesting and amusing, the contemporary ones, except Zack, were not quite as dynamic. Simon and Melissa in particular lacked dimension and seemed the type of stock characters you find in any ‘trio’ (melissa in particular is the kind of aggravating sidekick who is meant to be a 'spunky girl' but comes across as kind of a jerk). I didn’t like them that much either, even before the latter half of the novel. Zack deserves some real/better friends.Anyway, Zack steals the show as this is ultimately his story. He goes through a lot in this book and is forced to question the kind of person he wants to be/become. He makes mistakes, and he learns from them. He knows he wants to be stronger but finds his notion of strength to be challenged more than once. I wish that the narratives had called out a bit more people like Melissa who mistake his moments of vulnerability or hesitancy as signs of weakness or a 'lack of moral fibre'. Dio mio, he's a KID, leave my boy alone. I don't know, I felt protective of Zack and because of this found myself rather peed off by anyone who tried to make him feel ashamed of being sensitive. But I digress. Overall I thought this was an enjoyable book that manages to blend together history and technology. If you a fan of heroes' quests you should definitely give this one a try. Added bonuses: hints of casual gay rep + positive Muslim rep.I for one liked it a lot more than the author's debut novel, which I sadly was unable to enjoy (i know, don't get me started if i could actively control and change my response to that book i would). I found the author’s prose to be a lot more confident in this one and their style really worked for this MG-type of storytelling. This is the kind of book I wish had been around when I was a 12yr old as I would have been able to love it, whereas now I can only just ‘like’ it. Anyway, I liked the humor and the historical facts, so this gets a thumbs up from me and I look forward to its follow-up.ps: i just remember but some of zack’s reactions to learning some of the horrific things the emperors did are gold...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"May 05, 2022","May 12, 2022","Apr 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59365584-zachary-ying-and-the-dragon-emperor

But when you realise that you’ve given your life to someone, yet you know nothing but his name? That kind of solitude is loneliness. That’s what kills you.”Not having had the best experience with An Yu’s Braised Pork I was intrigued but wary of this second novel of hers. Similarly to Braised Pork, Ghost Music is a sparsely written surreal tale that manages to explore weird and existentialist avenues while also remaining tethered to the daily minutiae comprising the main character’s every-day life (preparing meals, eating, etc). The narrative is characterized by a murkiness that obfuscates our understanding of the events and experiences that are being recounted, the line between reality and dreams becomes increasingly blurry so we soon find ourselves struggling to differentiate between what is real and what is an illusion. I won’t lie and write that I understood what was going on in this book, because I did not. While reading Ghost Music my eyebrows were fixed in a perpetual perplexed frown. Yet, those elements and scenes that mystified and confused me were also the ones that intrigued me. Silences, ghosts (figurative and non), music, and pasts that haunt, are the motifs running throughout Ghost Music. The narrative’s juxtaposition between the bizarre and the mundane brought to mind David Lynch and the work of Hiroko Oyamada. The dreamy atmosphere, the off-beat, and sometimes absurd, character interactions, as well as the fantastical ‘ghost’ storyline, resulting in a unique reading experience that is guaranteed to confuse and confound you. “Loss came in all shapes and forms, but it hadn’t occurred to me until now that you could lose the things you never had.”Our narrator is Song Yan, once a promising concert pianist, and now a piano tutor to young kids. She and her workaholic husband live together in a flat in Beijing. Bowen is remote, distracted, and quick to shut down any conversations about the possibility of children. Bowen's widowed mother, who is from the province of Yunnan, later joins them. Soon after they begin receiving parcels of mushrooms native to Yunnan. Song Yan and her mother-in-law form a tentative bond by cooking these together. Tensions rise when Song Yan’s mother-in-law begins to blame her for her lack of children. Song Yan receives a letter that leads her to Bai Yu, a renowned pianist who disappeared years before, and here the story becomes even more fantastical. Song Yan also learns more about Bowen's past, and this widens the rift between them.Another bizarre addition to Song Yan’s life is a recurrent dream involving a ghostly mushroom that may be trying to reveal something vital to her. “I’d always known that I was on my own, that I existed as a person separate from others, but to accept that fact—to walk a solitary path without fear—took a whole other kind of bravery.”As I said before, I did not really understand a lot of what was happening (why it was happening, how it was happening, what it would lead to). Still, there was something about the dreamlike quality of Song Yan’s experiences that held my interest. I was both drawn to and weirded out by the bizarre elements and aspects of her story. While the narrative does tackle familiar themes such as grief, trauma, and memory, it does so in an unfamiliar, uncanny even, way. I was unsure of where Song Yan’s story would lead her, and that was part of the appeal to me. This uncertainty and not-knowing what was real or not, and the direction of her story. The tone retains this detachedness that makes it hard to come to know the characters, but again, this is what ultimately made them interesting to me. Bowen is a particularly frustrating character, especially in how cold he is towards Song Yan. Yet, I also felt a modicum of sympathy towards him, when we learn more about his past. Bowen's mother loses importance after the mid-way mark, which is a pity as I thought that the friction between her and Song Yan had potential. Still, I liked how Yu explored Song Yan's loneliness, her sadness, and her melancholy. I also appreciated the different types of silences depicted in her narrative and their effects (on a person's wellbeing, on a relationship, on someone's impression of another person). The characters' opaqueness and obliqueness really fit with the surreal themes and imagery that are underlining Song Yan’s narrative. I will definitely give this a re-read and hopefully, that will enable me to understand wtf was going on more. Nevertheless, I was still able to like Ghost Music, in particular the contemplative nature and dreamlike quality of Song Yan's narration....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Aug 05, 2022","Aug 12, 2022","Apr 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60890215-ghost-music

Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm appealed to me because I find that ensemble-cast books usually make for a kaleidoscopic reading experience. Sadly, most of the voices in this Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm ended up sounding exactly the same. With the exception of Maggie, who is a free spirit and therefore allowed to exist beyond her relationship with Circus were more or less blank slates, who spend their time thinking about Circus or in the case of Koko dodgy boys. If I hadn’t known who the author was, I would have assumed that they were a man, as the women in this story are as cliched as they come. With the exception of Circus, Koko, and her mother, Pia, each character is only given a chapter to shine in. The glimpse we get into their lives however felt far too shallow, and it frustrated me that these women are given no complexities, no real selves. They seem to exist only as a consequence of Circus, and because of this, their personalities suffer. Funnily enough, even if they spend a lot of their page time thinking about Circus, how they met, how things ended, and often yearning to be the one who is able to ‘change’ him…I still found it hard to believe that they were so devoted to him. We are told he is a real charmer, smooth-talking, and a talented trumpet player. But…he just came across as a sleazy guy who is beyond selfish, and manipulative, and a man who discards women as if they were disposable utensils. His lines ranged from corny (but not in an endearing way) to plain gross. Sure, his flaws are very much the driving force linking all of these voices together, but he was so one-note it was hard for me to care about him (doing better etc). It annoyed me that all of these women were reduced to the role they have with him (exes, daughter, lover, etc) and that their narratives had to stress just how hung-up and passive they are. Koko is the kind of teenage girl we often find in adult fiction. That is to say, she is ‘angsty’, ‘self-centred’, and full of ‘silly’ ideas about love, sex, and life. It frustrated me that her character arc ultimately hinges on her wanting to have sex as if other aspects of her life (friendships, hobbies, etc) weren’t interesting or deserving enough of being explored. Also, at one point we have a scene referring to Koko's 'virgin's blood'...which, anche no.  What I hated the most is how the narrative then decides to go for a very convenient, sadly moralistic, and rushed plot point that results in Circus ‘learning’ his lesson. We are also given a happy ending of sorts which felt really jarring…The prose often veered into sentimentality, even when attempting to come across as sensual or affecting. We even get a variation of the very much tired ‘someone lets out a breath’ phrase which did nothing to improve my impression of the author’s writing. Sure, here and there we have some observations that come across as insightful or piercing, but these often lead to less effective platitudes on love and sex, women and men. Also, given how many characters we get, it was a bit frustrating to have one woman be bisexual only as a way to turn on Circus...I wanted more female solidarity, a more nuanced exploration of femininity and masculinity, and a more convincing portrayal of a fraught father-daughter bond. Circus and Koko's interactions often came across as either painfully scripted or as consisting of badly delivered lines.More than anything, I longed to read about people who are flawed yet complicated individuals, as opposed to the entirely generic and not-at-all-believable characters we get here. The women's voices sounded too much alike, which was weird given that they are of different ages and come from different backgrounds. Circus was a one-note sleaze who did not deserve the convenient redemption arc he got. I swear the stuff he said & did made me either seethe with rage or want to hurl.If you are interested in Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm I recommend you check out more positive s....more",Notes are private!,1,49,1,"Dec 07, 2022","Dec 10, 2022","Apr 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60048960-sweet-soft-plenty-rhythm

Set in Britain, we follow Mika Moon, a witch who has learnt to live an isolated life in order to successfully hide her magic from others. Like other witches, she is an orphan who has grown used to being alone and hiding her true nature. Once every so often she meets up with other witches but they are discouraged from forming real bonds with one another. On a lark Mika has an online account where she posts witchy content, knowing that no one will genuinely believe that she is in fact a witch…except that someone does and they want to employ her. The story follows Mika as she embarks on a nanny McPhee venture: she is to live at Nowhere House and teach three young witches, how to control and use their magic. Despite her initial reluctance, given that Mika has come to believe that witches should not be in each other’s proximity, she takes on the job. Nowhere House is also the home to several other residents all of whom in their own ways look after the girls and the house. The novel relates the various magical mishaps that may happen when trying to teach young witches. Sadly, the novel focuses a lot of its ‘run time’ on the romance that develops between Mika and the ‘grumpy’ librarian whose dickish behavior is excused because of an appropriately sad backstory. From the get-go he is really rude, and disrespectful even, towards Mika, yet, his nastiness is made to seem ‘endearing’ as it is a sign of him being protective of the three witches. The dynamic between Mika and him fits the sunny girl/grumpy guy trope perfectly. I just could not bring myself to like this guy or see him in a sympathetic light. Mika deserved way better. The story’s themes about belonging and fitting in are explored in a rather predictable and vanilla way. I would have preferred something a bit sharper, funnier even, but instead, the story is very much twee galore and full of scenes that I can best describe as best suited to the realms of fanfiction. I would have liked more scenes exploring the relationship between Mika and her pupil. These three witches have barely-there personalities, two are nice, one isn't, and that's about it. There were some interactions where they were meant to come across as cute but they struck me as profoundly grating, the 'prickly' one especially. The side characters are more or less cartoonish and serve fairly comedic functions. The fantasy aspect was very unimaginative which was a pity since I really hoped this would be something along the lines of Zen Cho and Diana Wynne Jones, authors who incorporate magical elements into their storytelling in a really playful and inventive way.I am sure that readers who like a lot of fluff and cheesy humor will find this to be more of a more rewarding read than I did.

They’re the keys to civilization. And that’s knowledge worth killing for.”Babel, or The Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution is an incendiary indictment against colonialism. Within this superbly written slow-burner of a bildungsroman, R.F. Kuang presents her readers with an extensive critique of eurocentrism, scientific racism, white supremacy, elitist institutions and the hoarding of knowledge, and British imperialism that is by turns didactic and impassioned. If you are a reader who isn’t particularly into nonfiction but you are keen on familiarizing yourself with discourses on colonialism, decolonization, and postcolonialism, or are interested in linguistics (translation, interpretation, language contact), or learning more about the circumstances that led to the First Opium War, you should definitely consider picking Babel up. Babel is a rare example of how—in the right hands—telling can be just as effective a storytelling method as ‘showing’. Kuang’s storytelling is quite frankly superb. And not only is the narration immersive and encompassing, but it is also informative and thought-provoking. Undoubtedly readers will feel angry by what they will read, and the unrelenting racism, discrimination, physical and emotional violence experienced by the story’s protagonist, Robin. This is a decidedly heavy-going story. And yet, thanks to Kuang’s bravura display of storytelling, readers will find themselves persevering, despite the foreshadowing that presages worse is to come…The majority of the novel takes place in an alternate 1830s Oxford where Babel, the University's Royal Institute of Translation, is the ‘pioneering’ centre of translation and 'silver-working', an act that catches what is lost in translation and manifests it into being. After cholera decimated his family, Robin, a boy from Canton, is whisked away from China to London by the imperious Professor Lovell, who happens to be a renowned professor at Babel. Robin has no choice but to follow and obey Professor Lovell’s strict study regimens. Not only does Professor Lovell impose a punitive lifestyle on Robin, forcing him to dedicate his every waking moment to the study and learning of languages, but he devests him of his ‘former’ name and makes him relinquish any remembrances of his former life. Additionally, Professor Lovell subjects Robin to many forms of abuse: from spewing ethnocentric and white supremacist speeches, to physically ‘punishing’ Robin. Growing up in this environment Robin grows to resent his ‘mentor’, and yet, even so he is desperate to belong. Besides his tutors and Professor Lovell, Robin only really interacts with his mentor’s housekeeper, who, despite being the only person to show him any tenderness, is nevertheless complicit in Professor Lovell’s continued abuse of him. Robin’s childhood is not a happy one, in fact, it is not really a childhood at all. The setting combined with the misery of it all brought to mind the work of Charles Dickens. Unlike Dickens’ heroes, Robin is not only disadvantaged by his being an orphan but by not being white, something that ultimately makes him a very un-Dickensian character. Professor Lovell’s oppressive ‘rule’ instils in Robin a sense of fear: while he does have a lot of questions (how did the professor find him? why him? why is he 'bestowing' on him such an education? what will await him at babel?) he is weary about disobeying him. Moving to Oxford opens Robin up to a world that is both awe-inspiring and terrible. At Babel he can master languages in even more depth, he can be surrounded by hundreds of years of knowledge, and by (supposedly) like-minded individuals.“They’d been chosen for privileges they couldn’t have ever imagined, funded by powerful and wealthy men whose motives they did not fully understand, and they were acutely aware these could be lost at any moment. That precariousness made them simultaneously bold and terrified. They had the keys to the kingdom; they did not want to give them”But even Babel has its own set of hierarchies, which prioritize whiteness and European cultures and languages. While Babel, unlike other colleges at Oxford, admits a more diverse student body, compared to his white peers, Robin is treated with a mixture of fascination and disdain. The older students seem unwilling to mingle with first-years so inevitably Robin becomes close to his cohort: Ramy, Victoire, and Letty.Robin and Ramy become particularly close, and their bond is one of the novel’s strengths. It isn’t a particularly straightforward relationship but their similar experiences and circumstances intensify their kinship. There is a chapter relatively early in the novel that focuses on their early days getting to know each other which was immeasurably bittersweet.“[This] circle of people he loved so fiercely his chest hurt when he thought about them. A family. He felt a crush of guilt then for loving them, and Oxford, as much as he did. He adored it here; he really did. For all the daily slights he suffered, walking through campus delighted him.”You feel such relief for Robin to have found someone who just gets what it means to be seen as ‘other’, to be treated as ‘inferior’, 'un-English', and to have been deracinated from their homelands and to feel such contrasting emotions at being at Oxford, an institution that upholds racist ideologies. In this ‘alternate’ setting this contrition is even more felt given the role that Babel plays in silver-working and of how silver bars are enabling the British empire to amass even more power and wealth and to further ‘expand’. Robin believes that by staying at Babel, he is surviving. Ramy however is more openly critical of Britain. The duo is later joined by Letty and Victoire, who, being girls are also subjected to discrimination. Like the boys, Victoire, who is Black and was born in Haiti, has an extremely fraught relationship with Babel. Letty, who is white and was born and raised in Britain in a relatively well off family, is in some ways the odd one out. Yet, she seems intent on portraying herself as a victim, in any circumstance really, often referring to her own experience with misogyny to negate Robin, Ramy, and Victoire's experiences with racism and colonialism. Additionally, her brother died, which Lety, we are both told and shown this, uses to earn her ‘friends’ sympathy. We are meant to hate her, and hate her I did. Imagine the most annoying aspects of Hermione Granger’s character and you have Letty (stubborn, sanctimonious, a stickler for rules). She is a colonialist apologist who, despite being ‘exposed’ to the perspectives/realities of people who have been colonized or have experienced violence at the hands of the British empire, remains firm in her stance (we learn this quite early on so i don’t think it’s that much of a spoiler). I recently came across this quote by Oksana Zabuzhko, a Ukrainian writer, that very much applies to people like Letty: “This is what power really is: the privilege of ignoring anything you might find distasteful.’ Certainly, we can see why at first Robin, Victoire, and Ramy would not oppose Letty’s presence in their group. These opinions have been instilled in her by her upbringing. But, when the months and years go by and Letty's belief in the British empire remains unwavering…well…her presence in the group didn't make much sense. I couldn’t fathom why the others would keep her around. I get that she existed to make a point, and sadly I know people like her (who resort to self-victimization whenever confronted with anything resembling criticism, who believe themselves to be 'nice' and 'kind' but only have empathy for themselves) but I just found her beyond irritating and obnoxious. She has no redeeming qualities. And it annoyed me that she took the center stage in many of the group interactions and took away page-time from characters like Ramy and Victoire. I wish she could have been pushed to the sidelines more, and maybe for her then to take more of a role when sh*t starts going down. But I digress.At Babel Robin finally learns more about silver bars and dio mio, it isn’t good. He learns just how powerful language can be and has to reconcile himself with the knowledge that he is contributing to the enrichment of the British empire. Robin is approached by a member of a secret organization, Hermes Society, whose aim is to sabotage the silver-working that goes on at Babel and disrupt the status quo. Robin feels at a crossroad, damned if he does, damned if he doesn't. While he does still experience racism and discrimination at Babel, it is there that he can access knowledge that would otherwise not be accessible to him. And, of course, it is there that he was able to meet Ramy and Victoire (i should really include letty because robin does care for her but i cannot bring myself to). Babel also has shielded him away from Professor Lovell, who he now sees only on rare occasions, and given him the kind an opportunity that many others will never have...but that doesn't make him unaware of how, beneath its 'enlightened' veneer, Babel is rotten. Can he help Hermes Society if their acts of sabotage include or result in violence? Is violence inevitable in a revolution? And by choosing not to act does he become a cog that keeps the British empire running?“He hated this place. He loved it. He resented how it treated him. He still wanted to be a part of it – because it felt so good to be a part of it, to speak to its professors as an intellectual equal, to be in on the great game.” Robin is torn between his hatred for the British empire and the safety he believes he can only experience at Babel. Kuang renders his inner conflict with painful accuracy and extreme empathy. While other characters may be critical of Robin’s unwillingness to ‘choose’, readers won’t be as ready, and in fact, they will find themselves unable to judge him. He tries to help but inevitably his indecision leads the Hermes Society to decide for him. It is only when Robin is forced to confront the consequences of the opium trade—on China, on the Chinese population, and on the Indian farmers who harvested it—that he finds himself ready to act. But, things do not exactly pan out as the story takes us on a The Secret History kind of detour that will undoubtedly appeal to fans of whydunnits and dark academia. While the atmosphere prior to this event was by no means light-hearted after this happens Kuang ups the tension all the way up. The shifting dynamics within and outside of Robin’s group also change, and not necessarily for the better. And the stakes are just sky-high. Like the summary says, Babel ‘grapples with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of translation as a tool of empire’. We witness the many forms that power takes, and one of them is in fact language. Language can be in fact a tool of oppression. Kuang’s interrogation of the act of translation is utterly compelling. My mum is a translator and I am bilingual (yet have a foreign accent in both italian & english *insert tiny violin here*) and have recently started studying two other languages. Suffice to say, whenever I see a book exploring linguistics, I am interested (be it sci-fi like Arkady Martine's Teixcalaan series, literary fiction such as Batuman's The Idiot, or nonfiction like Lahiri's In Other Words). And Kuang really presents us with so many interesting facts and insights into translation and untranslatability. Kuang pays incredible attention to words and their various meanings, which truly enriches Robin’s story and his experiences at Babel. Kuang discusses contact-induced change (which sometimes results in language death) and reading about it even feel guilty about having neglected my ‘mother-tongue’ (on a side note: i have noticed that here in england people seem less interested in learning languages as they rely on english being the most widely spoken language worldwide…). While Kuang does acknowledge Morse code, braille and sign language and other nonverbal forms of communication do not really get a mention which is a pity. Nevertheless, Kuang presents us with such nuanced discussions around language and translation, I loved the attention she pays to the etymology of words, double meanings, doublespeak, and the ambiguity of language and interpretation…“In Classical Chinese, the characters 二心 referred to disloyal or traitorous intentions; literally, they translated as ‘two hearts’. And Robin found himself in the impossible position of loving that which he betrayed, twice.”Like I said early on, the writing sometimes shifts into a telling mode, so we have swaths of time which are summarized into a few lines, or certain events or arguments are related to us indirectly. But, Kuang storytelling is such that what we are being told feels incredibly vivid and—for the better and worse—immersive. Some of the lectures Robin attends may occasionally seem a bit too long or pedantic, and I wasn’t always keen on the footnotes (more on that later), but I was never bored. Robin is such a compelling narrator and my heart went out to him. This povero ragazzo really can’t catch a break. And when he finds some solace, with Ramy and Victoire, we have Letty to stir things up or spoil the group’s rare moments of contentment. He hates Professor Lowell who is just so f*cking despicable and full of vitriol but also ‘perversely’ wants to earn his approval. He is also burdened by the realization that as the years go by he struggles to recall his mother and his early years in China. Once in England and under Professor Lowell’s ‘tutelage’ Robin feels caught in a constant state of alterity: while the story mentions that there are occasions where he can ‘pass’, he experiences overt racism, disenfranchisement, and microaggressions on the daily. And he isn’t given the tools or words to express this profound sense of injustice and alienation. Ramy and Victoire become his lifelines as he is finally given the chance to try to name the difficult thoughts and feelings he experiences living in a country that sees him and those like him as ‘barbarians’. Speaking of barbarians, I really appreciated how Kuang highlights the irony and hypocrisy of those British people who will claim that the people they are colonizing or waging war against are ‘violent’, ‘savages’, and ‘uncivilized’ and therefore deserving of being colonized, oppressed, and killed. ‘How strange,’ said Ramy. ‘To love the stuff and the language, but to hate the country.’‘Not as odd as you’d think,’ said Victoire. ‘There are people, after all, and then there are things.’ I found Robin to be such an endearing character. Kuang captures the disorientation of living somewhere where you are and will always be perceived as a perpetual foreigner. His longing for a place to belong to is truly heart-wrenching. He is not flawless but I genuinely believe that he always tries his hardest to do good by others. Sometimes self-preservation kicks in and he finds himself at a standstill. He feels a moral obligation to help the Hermes Society but is not quite ready to be responsible for the destruction of Babel. Yet, when he realizes that he is becoming complicit in the injustices perpetrated by Babel..well, he has to question whether his loyalties can even align with those responsible for maintaining unjust systems of power. “Yet didn’t he have a right to be happy? He had never felt such warmth in his chest until now, had never looked forward to getting up in the morning as he did now. Babel, his friends, and Oxford – they had unlocked a part of him, a place of sunshine and belonging, that he never thought he’d feel again. The world felt less dark now. He was a child starved of affection, which he now had in abundance – and was it so wrong for him to cling to what he had? He was not ready to commit fully to Hermes. But by God, he would have killed for any of his cohort.” Ramy, who is more impassioned and outspoken, balances Robin perfectly. Their shared moments together do have certain undercurrents but these remain largely unspoken. And in some ways, it is this elision that made it all the more obvious. Letty…I have said enough about her. She, similarly to Professor Lovell, remains unchanged throughout the course of the narrative. We know the kind of people they are from the very first and I am afraid that in some ways Letty is worse than Professor Lovell. Her acts of self-dramatization and victim playing drove me up the walls. Victoire was sadly underused. Her characterization sometimes relied too much on opposing Letty’s one (we will have letty responding in a sh*tty way to something and then we will get a different response from victoire who usually acts as a pacifier). I just would have liked less page-time spent on Letty—who, however believable she is, is neither an interesting nor compelling character—and more on Victoire. In the latter half of the novel, Victoire is given more room to breathe but due to the pace of the plot, the storyline can't really focus on her.I liked how many secondary characters come into play in the latter half of the novel and I was surprised by the role some of them play in the story.Reading about Britain’s ‘past exploits’ is by no means fun. Yet, somehow, Kuang is able to make Robin’s story wholly captivating and hard to put down. The anxiety I felt for him, and later on Ramy and Victoire, made me go through this nearly 500+ pages tome of a book at a relatively fast speed. There is much to be admired in Babel.

Sutherland's UK setting just doesn't ring true to me, it comes across as a cheap filmset, that relies on 'props' (like name-dropping places like Boots). sure maybe young British people's frame of reference might include Hallmark movies and they might opt for bougie instead of posh as a descriptor, but if you combine these things with a consistent lack of vernaculars/accents (one of the character suppodsly spent time in ireland..? sure), results in a vague setting that seems aimed at an american readership.the lore another disappointing aspect of the story. characters who aren't acquainted with the supernatural are far too ready to believe in it or to seek supernatural solutions to their problems. all in all, this was a messy book starring cringey dialogues and characters, too much edgy posturing, and a storyline that has the mere trappings of a dark supernatural mystery....more",Notes are private!,0,24,0,not set,not set,"Apr 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59475768-the-invocations

They did it over and over again, playing their parts faithfully and acting as though the other had not transgressed.While I appreciate the conceit of Daughters of the New Year, its execution did not win me over. The summary may be somewhat at fault, as it gave me an impression that Daughters of the New Year would be something along the lines of Butter Honey Pig Bread, A Kind of Freedom, and Things We Lost to the Water, or even something along the lines of family sagas like The Arsonists’ City, The Vanishing Half, or most books penned by Elif Shafak. I thought that as each chapter switches between the sisters’ and mother's povs, we would be given glimpses, either in self-contained chapters or in the form of flashbacks, into the experiences of their female relatives and ancestors. The line that the sisters would “encounter strange glimpses of long-buried secrets” made me even think that there would be some interplay between past and present. What we get in actuality is something closer to Homegoing and Commonwealth, but not quite as effective. That is, each chapter reads like a vignette that doesn’t necessarily add up to create a bigger picture. Maybe if the chapters had given us an overview of the characters’ lives, as Gyasi does in Homegoing, these characters would have felt more fully realized than they were. I am not against books that are heavy on telling and light on showing, especially if the author’s storytelling is engaging and vivid enough…but here I found myself bored by the narration. The scenes and dialogues that do interrupt the otherwise heavy-on-the-telling narrative were far less interesting and poignant that the moments that are glossed over or barely alluded to. Additionally, as I said, the sections from the present-day characters and the ‘past’ ones do not coalesce together. Maybe if the past sections had been interspersed throughout the more 'recent' chapters, maybe then I would have felt differently. As it is, each chapter takes us back in time. Like counting backwards if you will. Or a forwarding back. This is a pity because I found the sisters’ and their mother’s present-day dynamics and circumstances much more interesting than, say, reading overlong chapters detailing their experiences at school (where they are bullied and ignored by their white and vietnamese-american peers). I found these chapters focusing on their childhood and adolescence to be predictable and I was frustrated by the way the narrative would give super-detailed descriptions of humiliating situations. That is not to say that scenes that make you squirm serve no function or cannot build tension, after all, one of my favorite authors is a champion when it comes to very awkward or straight-up uncomfortable scenes (often rooted in everyday scenarios or a result of a seemingly casual/ordinary interaction). But here the author offers few compelling insights into these characters and their motivations, focusing instead on giving us a rather dry blow-by-blow account of what happened. There was something repetitive in the way these chapters would unfold, something static even about the scenes and events that are being recounted. The sisters, their mother, and their other relatives serve the role of narrative vehicles through which their chapter can explore a certain scenario (so it is not so much about them but the situation). Their names and their Vietnamese zodiac signs are their main distinguishers, but these did not convey the kind of people they were. It was really frustrating that we never get to read chapters following their present-day circumstances.I wanted to read Nhi’s experiences in the Bachelor-esque reality TV show or to see Trac try to reconcile herself with her sexuality. I was even interested in seeing how the recently divorced Xuan would cope if her youngest daughter also left home. I was even interested in her ex-husband, the girls’ father. Did ageing really wear down his temper?I would have loved to see more interactions, especially between the sisters. But they have very few scenes together and they don’t think about one another that much. It would have been nice to see how their bond, or their lack of one, changed from childhood to adulthood. But instead, we get these vignettes showing us how the sisters are excluded by everyone, and that they had no friends growing up (even if sometimes the narrative will mention them being friends with white affluent girls who lead idyllic lives). We are shown that Xuan looks down on the Vietnamese community and that this causes her daughters to be bullied by Vietnamese-American children, but I wondered how the husband felt about it or whether the girls eventually try to befriend other children. The narrative does render how hyper-visible yet invisible the sisters feel. Some of their white peers ‘forget’ that they are not in fact white. At one point one of the sisters finds herself contributing to anti-Blackness as a way of fitting in with her white sorority. The story definitely made many incisive observations around race, whiteness, and internalized racism, as well as depicting the realities of feeling alienated by a culture or a language. Alas, the narrative often prioritized boring details, such as a character putting clothes on, over more complex ones.While reading this I was bored and frustrated. The characters struck me as thinly drawn and the prose monotonous. A more cohesive narrative arc would have could have made these chapters feel more in sync with one another, but as things stand, I found the forwarding back blunt. Just over the halfway mark, the chapters take us back to Xuan's youth and her experiences before America. Here the tone felt quite different to the previous chapters, which may have been intentional except that even theme-wise these chapters seem to share little in common with the preceding chapters. Some of these chapters pack a lot and the impact of what happens is stunted by the chapters' length and by the narrative's tendency to summarise and recount (as opposed to show). The only thing that felt purposeful, between these past and present chapters, was learning about Xuan's trophy. I think I would have preferred this novel if it had either gone for a more traditional family saga structure, or gone for a more linked narratives/multiple voices type of thing like in Calling for a Blanket Dance,and in The Travelers. But instead Daughters of the New Year reads like something that doesn't know what it wants to be...All in all, this book was not what I was hoping it would be. Do not however let my unenthusiastic take on this book dissuade you from giving it a chance as YMMV. If you do read it I recommend you don't opt for the audiobook which likely contributed to the frustration I felt towards this book. Even in the chapters set in Vietnam, where we follow Vietnamese characters and see them interact, the narrator's character voices for Xuan, and her mother & co, is the same exaggerated 'broken' English voice she uses in the American chapters...why? The characters are fluent in Vietnamese, why make them sound as they do when they are speaking a foreign language ?!...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Nov 30, 2022","Dec 04, 2022","Apr 08, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59978361-daughters-of-the-new-year

Solid pacing, a likeable and engaging narrator, plenty of compelling dialogues, and a well-rendered suspenseful atmosphere. I won’t lie, the main reason why I picked this one up was because I came across the audiobook version while perusing Bahni Turpin's audios . As per usual, she gives a brilliant performance which no doubt enhanced my reading/listening experience with Like a Sister. Our main character is Lena Scott, a graduate student at Columbia who is in her late twenties. After her grandmother passes away she inherits her house in the Bronx, which she now shares with her aunt. Her mother is dead, and Mel, her father, a big shot music producer with a don’t-mess-with-me reputation, has shown little interest in Lena. After their ‘messy’ separation he went on to marry and have a child with a former close friend of her mother. Despite the animosity between their parents, Lena and Desiree were ‘like sisters’. Despite their different home environments, with Desiree enjoying Mel’s wealth, Lena leads a more sheltered existence, focusing on her studies. Eventually, Desiree gains certain popularity, having taken part in a reality show and hanging out with ‘it’ crowds. Her partying lifestyle becomes a wedge in the sisters’ relationship, as Lena can’t condone Desiree’s careless ‘misdemeanours’. After years of not talking to each other Lena learns that Desiree has been found dead the morning after her 25th birthday. The media and police are quick to dismiss her death as an accidental ‘overdose’, but Lena is more x. Why was her sister found in the Bronx? Was she on her way to see her? Mel and Lena’s stepmother do not seem as troubled as she is by the inconsistencies of Desiree’s death. Lena feels guilty over her fallout with Desiree and is determined to find the truth. As she reaches out to Desiree’s ex and her friends she begins to suspect that her death may have something to do with the ‘event’ that led to their fallout. Reluctantly Lena is aided by Desiree’s bff, a white rich girl who serves as a source of humor for much of the early narrative. I liked the dynamic between Lena and the people she interacts with. I think the story would have benefited from giving her more of a backstory. She seems to have only one acquaintance and 0 friends. I kept forgetting what her profession/subject of study was because her character is very much all about Desiree and Mel. That is not to say that she doesn’t have a clear-cut personality. She is loyal, sensible, and funny. Some of the jokes she makes did come across as more in line with someone older than her (rather than 29, someone closer to if not over 40). Still, that didn’t ruin her narration, and I found her old-fashioned quaint and endearing. Her voice is certainly engaging as I was thoroughly absorbed by her narration.I would have liked for one of the side characters to be less of an ‘Inventing Anna’ type of figure as it was fairly predictable and the misdirection takes up a lot of the story for no reason. The mystery was interesting but the resolution was painfully anticlimactic. The culprit was painfully obvious and I really hoped that the author would subvert my expectations by not making them the killer. Their motivations are…kind of missing? I didn’t buy into their ‘reasons’, as it seemed a huge leap to go from ‘that’ to murder. The ending did feel rushed to the point that it lessened my overall enjoyment of the novel. We also get chapters that are the equivalent of insta posts or lives about Desiree and they did absolutely 0 for the story. I wish we could have had chapters giving us glimpses into the sisters' childhoods as that would have added depth and nuance to their relationship. Still, I did have a fairly fun time with this as it was a quick and gripping read/listen. I would definitely read more by this author!...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Apr 07, 2022","Apr 09, 2022","Apr 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58310680-like-a-sister

This is one of the most refreshing Sherlock Holmes-inspired tales. The space opera setting was such fun! The Watnsonesque character here is The Shadow's Child, a transport ship that lost its crew in a traumatic experience and now earns a living by brewing drugs to calm space travelers. The Shadow's Child's latest client is Long Chau, a brusque scholar who needs the brew to help her complete an assignment. The Shadow's Child becomes involved in Long Chau’s assignment, which may involve murder and a missing person. The Shadow's Child doesn’t entirely trust Long Chau, especially when it seems that she may have had a hand in this whole affair. The novella length makes this into a fast-paced and entertaining story. The writing is engaging, the setting is lively (i have a soft spot for reading space opera in ‘dark’ times), and the dynamic between Long Chau and The Shadow's Child had a real zing. I would love to read more about them, and perhaps see their partnership consolidate into a more meaningful companionship. I do not consider myself a big fan of Sherlock Holmes but the author here managed to improve on the og’s personalities and to freshen things up with a space opera setting (we have virtual realities, avatars, space travel, etc.).

This book is divided into three self-contained episodes centred on the same character. Our narrator’s wife really wants to have children but he seems far less enthused by the idea. Two of the episodes revolve around his acquaintances/friends of his, one of whom owns large quantities of this type of exotic fish and has recently gotten together with a younger woman, the other, also married, has settled down into a home that is already occupied by a family of weasels. The male characters are all similar shades of unpleasant and obsessive as they recount their surreal experience with these animals and or their romantic relationships. Our narrator is rather unpleasant himself as he becomes intrigued by someone other than his wife (if i recall correctly…). There is a feverish, oppressive even, atmosphere characterizing most of the interactions and happenings in these stories. Realistic scenarios and dynamics are given a surreal dimension through the addition of bizarre elements or anecdotes. Oyamada seems to have a knack for drawing out the weird from everyday life, but here I found myself bored by the sameness of these three stories. Perhaps it would be more interesting if the perspective had switched from the husband to the wife, or to some other characters as the author did in The Factory which incorporated several povs. Still, even if Weasels in the Attic didn’t quite hit the right spot for me, I remain intrigued by Oyamada’s storytelling and look forward to being ‘weirded’ out again by her future works....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Oct 12, 2022","Oct 14, 2022","Apr 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60534034-weasels-in-the-attic

To be rid of them, how skeletal and empty do I have to be? Despite its short length Concerning my Daughter is by no means a breeze to read. It is a candid and stark study of a fraught mother-daughter relationship. In Concerning my Daughter Kim Hye-Jin examines generational differences, cultural conservatism, and the realities of being an lgbtq+ person living in a heteronormative and traditionalist society. The story is told from the perspective of a middle-aged woman, a widowed careworker and mother to Green, who is now in her thirties. When Green asks her to rent out a room to her, she reluctantly obliges and is horrified to discover that Green will be joined by her long-term girlfriend, Lane. The mother wants her daughter to be happy, but her vision of contentment does not align with Green’s. The narrator longs for Green to lead a ‘normal’, expected, life: husband, children, a house. But here she is in her thirties and living with her. Worst, she is 'unapologetically' and 'unabashedly' gay, and has no intention of hiding her relationship from the prying eyes of others. In fact, Green is fighting for lgbtq+ rights, protesting the discrimination and unfair dismissal faced by members of her community at the university where she was employed at. Throughout the course of the narrative, the mother fails to understand her daughter, and to a certain extent vice-versa. The author never condemns the mother for her lack of knowledge or her unwillingness to understand her daughter’s sexuality. Without excusing her homophobia, she identifies instead the harmful rhetorics promoted by her society. Additionally, we are shown repeatedly that it is this desire to protect her daughter from discrimination and injustices that leads her to reject Green’s ‘unorthodox’ lifestyle. Being in her head was by no means pleasant but her perspective rang sadly true to life.The narrative swings between the mother’s uneasy relationship with Green and her girlfriend, to her taxing workplace. There she witnesses how uncaring and downright neglectful the staff is towards one of her elderly dementia patients. The patient has no family to speak of and therefore no one but our narrator looks out for her. The mother fights against the idea that this patient should be treated this way because she did not conform to society (the patient was a diplomat of some renown who travelled the world). I found the parallelism between this patient and Green banal …I also disliked the gratuitous descriptions of the patients’ bodily functions and wounds. The author could have made us understand her neglectful living conditions without lingering on scenes detailing these things.Her experiences with this patient lead to some depressingly bleak questions about mortality and ageing that at times came across as a wee bit too predictable. I think I would have found this to be a more compelling story if the narrative had focused exclusively on the mother-daughter relationship but neither of these characters struck me as particularly fleshed out. It would have been nice also if the perspective could have alternated between the mother and Green’s girlfriend, just so we could see Green both in the role of daughter and partner.Still, I appreciated the issues raised in this narrative. In some ways, it hit a bit too close to home as I am a lesbian from a fairly conservative country that has yet to legalize gay marriage and cares little about the wellbeing of its lgbtq+ citizens and I am temporarily living with someone who has dementia and needs full-time care...so yes, maybe readers who are more removed from the events described in the narrative, or are not as 'thin-skinned' as I am, will find this to be a more poignant read than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 14, 2022","Apr 16, 2022","Apr 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59703696-concerning-my-daughter

Both are ugly, visceral things. They rip holes through you and burst forth when they see fit. They are constant, controlling companions, and if they don’t destroy you or your relationship with others, they certainly go a long way to damaging you […] There is nothing eloquent about my grief.” Someday, Maybe is a book that interrogates the many faces and stages of grief. Yet, despite the heavy subject matter, the prose retains this lightness that kept me turning pages. The first quarter of the book brought to mind a favorite author of mine, Mhairi McFarlane, minus the comedy. That is not to say that Someday, Maybe lacks wit, Eve happens to be a very engrossing narrator who is more than capable of making amusing remarks. Some of the interactions that she has with her family members could also be rooted in humor. The novel however retains a somber and eventually bittersweet tone that will definitely appeal to readers who are looking for a read that will pull at their heartstrings. The novel revolves around the aftermath of Eve’s husband's sucide. Eve and Quentin, who goes by Q, met at uni where, in spite of their different backgrounds (she is British-Nigerian, he is as from a very white and exceedingly wealthy British family), they were able to form a very strong bond. Eve struggles to reconcile herself with Q's suicide, and spirals into depression. Her grief manifests itself in many different ways so that she finds herself unable to think of anything or anyone outside of Q. She blames herself for not being able to prevent his death, for not having realized that he was struggling.Eve's family and her best friend attempt to be there for her but she often finds herself pushing them away in what becomes a withdrawal from life. Her mother-in-law, who due to racist and/or classist motives was opposed to their match, seems after her, making cruel accusations and seeming intent on making Eve’s life even more difficult than it already is. The narrative renders Eve’s sadness, confusion, anger, and despair with empathy and insight. While we do get glimpses into Eve’s relationship with Q, how they met, their years together, and the tension caused by his mother, the focus remains on Eve ‘now’ and the overwhelming grief she feels in the days, weeks, and months after Q's sucide.I liked Eve's interactions with her family members. Her moments with her father were particularly touching. Her best friend serves more of a clichèed role, that of the spunky no-nonsense best friend who is there to cheer you up and encourages you to get your shit together. Alas, as much as I liked the author’s writing and the dynamics in her book, several plot points did not agree with me. What happens with Eve’s workplace struck me as very rushed and not particularly credible given her circumstances and her role within her company. There is a ‘revelation’ that is truly eye-roll worthy in that it is the kind of plot device I expect from Netflix originals. Additionally, I swear this ‘twist’ is often used in books/media that focus on widowed women and the like. Come on. There is something very sentimental and slightly manipulative about this type of plotline ('here is a reason to go on' type of thing). I would go as far as to call it one of my least favorite tropes, period. The evil mother-in-law was ridiculous and I wished she had been portrayed as more believable. I did not want her to be nice or likable but I do believe that having her be a caricature of the disapproving snobby mother-in-law did the story no favors. Lastly, the latter half of the book strayed too closely to Eat, Pray, Love territory. I am just not the right reader for this type of soapy/schmalzy reveals and healing ‘journeys’.I just wished that the story had remained focused on Eve and her family dynamics, rather than the later plot-line...still, I did like the way the author articulates Eve's grief and the writing was fairly engaging. But by no means do not let me dictate whether you should read this or not. If you are a fan of emotional and heartfelt stories about loss, love, and healing, definitely add this to your tbr list....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Sep 02, 2022","Sep 06, 2022","Apr 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61322352-someday-maybe

With piercing clarity, she touches upon Islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, and sexism. She reflects on the many flaws and conditions of citizenship, specifically American citizenship, and on the many ways, it fails people. I truly appreciated the way she discusses topical and oh so important social issues, and the lucidity of her arguments: from discussing the way citizenship is equated with whiteness, white privilege and white fragility, racial profiling, borders, racist rhetorics and the vilification of immigrants, inhumane legislations, the notion of ‘assimilation’, belonging, etc. Throughout this collection of essays, Lalami raises many thought-provoking points and makes many illuminating observations. While Lalami does discuss other people’s experiences, often providing statistics or citing specific incidents/events, her own personal experiences inform much of her writing, which makes it all the more affecting. I admired the way she would attempt to relate to the kind of people I personally would write off as c*nts while also fully acknowledging how frustrating a position she is often made to be in (that of educating bigoted people).While she does write about subjects that are ‘American’ specific, such as applying for citizenship in America, the issues underlying her essays should not concern exclusively an American readership. Although I did gain insight into processes I am not familiar with, throughout this collection Lalami delves into topics that will undoubtedly resonate with many readers outside of the States.  My only quibble is that some of her essays could have integrated a more intersectional approach. For instance, while Lalami does include 'asides' discussing gender inequality and #metoo, she barely acknowledges lgbtq+ related issues.Curiously enough this is another case where I find myself liking the non-fictional work of an author whose fiction I low-key did not get on with…I would definitely recommend this one and I am determined to read (and hopefully like) Lalami's The Moor's Account....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Apr 24, 2022","Apr 27, 2022","Mar 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52366322-conditional-citizens

The stories collected in You Are Free are a testament to her ability to create and maintain an atmosphere of disquiet, one that adds to the ambiguous characters populating her stories. The people Senna centres her stories around seem perpetually uneasy and their behaviour—which ranges from being slightly worrisome to downright perturbing—is often a source of confusion to other characters and readers themselves. Like in her full-length novels, Senna hones in on race, racism, and racial identity. Her caustic social commentary is as piercing as it is unstinting. Senna spares no one and this adds to the murky tone of her narratives. As much as I love Senna’s writing, her short stories pale in comparison to her novels. The stories here are not as disturbing as Maria’s spiralling into obsession in New People, or as disconcerting as the narrator’s experiences in Symptomatic, or as compelling as Birdie’s story in Caucasia.The first story is probably the most accomplished one, as we are introduced to a young couple who, as a ‘joke’, apply for their son to attend one of the country’s most distinguished private schools. When their son is actually offered a spot, the mother finds herself giving the school some serious consideration, while the father is adamantly opposed to it and wants his son to attend a local public school. What makes this story so effective is the increasingly creepy behaviour of the school’s member of staff. The other stories are less memorable, and many of them focus on new parents. I made the mistake of listening to the audiobook version of this collection and I can tell you that there are few things as irritating as an adult mimicking the voice of a whiny child crying for their ‘mama/mummy’. Anyway, the people within these narratives are varying degrees of terrible. Which was expected, but they did seem to share many of the same unlikeable traits, which made them rather samey. The short format also didn’t give Senna much time to flesh them out or to give them some nuance. I also could have done without the animal cruelty which seemed thrown in as an afterthought, or worse, for mere shock value. At times the character descriptions here verged on being lazy, which is quite unlike Senna (a character’s eyes are described as ‘asian’...). The focus on the parent-child and wife-husband dynamics had potential but ultimately the author prioritizes ambience over characterisation (also the lack of queer characters...). Senna is a fantastic author but this collection isn’t quite it…...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"May 04, 2022","May 05, 2022","Mar 27, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10125949-you-are-free

I needed this.”Being a big fan of collections of short stories following the same character/s, I was keen to read If I Survive You. Each chapter in this debut presents us with a self-contained story following a Jamaican American family from the 1970s to the 2008 recession. Most of these chapters provide us with a snapshot into the youngest son’s life, Trelawny, from his childhood experiences to his adulthood misadventures which see him, for a time, living in his car and attempting to find steady employment. In the first story, for instance, told through a 2nd pov, Escoffery uses Trelawny experiences to highlight how as a child he initially embraces everything related to America, but the more his peers question his identity and background, the more unmoored he comes to feel. His Jamaican parents express negative opinions about Black Americans and Trelawny himself does not feel like he fits in with the Black kids at his school. Eventually, he ends up ‘passing’ as Puerto Rican but his momentary acceptance to the Puerto Rican kids’ table is also short-lived. Trelawny’s experiences at school highlight the realities of race and racism in America, showing how pigeonholing others often relies on absurd and arbitrary conditions, and the real-life consequences of being a poc in a society that privileges whiteness. Time and again the people in Trelawny’s life attempt and fail to put in a box or label him in a certain way or we see how the adults around him behave or see him in a certain way.“Of course, the difference between exiles and my parents—in fact, the difference between me and my parents—is that my parents have a homeland to which they can return.”In the other chapters we meet Trelawny again as an adult: from the odd, and downright questionable, jobs he finds to make a living, to the circumstances that led to his father kicking me out (and him living in his car), to the feud he has with his brother, Delano, that reveal old wounds and insecurities. Trelawny’s dynamics with his brother and father had a lot of potential but sadly these are often left rather unexplored or merely hinted at. Because we are only given snapshots into their lives, these ultimately do not come together to form a cohesive family portrait or coming of age. Rather they seem like a series of vignettes strung together. The satire, although often clever and spot-on, could have been dialled down a little in favor of exploring different tones. I would have liked some more emotion, more depth, and more nuance. Trelawny’s mother is severely underused which is a pity as it made the story very male-centred. Which is fair enough but it was a pity that the men, Trelawny and his brother, who are given most page-time are different brands of stronzi. These short story sacrifice characterisation in favor of maintaining a certain satirical style.“The downside of being the face of rent increases in a low-income development is that the residents wish you dead.”Escoffery’s commentary—on race, on masculinity, on being Jamaican American, on growing up in Miami, on whiteness, on trying to survive financial and natural disasters, on attempting to strive in a capitalist society, on sacrificing one’s moral & ethical code to make a living—was irreverent and cutting to be the biggest strength of his storytelling. I just found the collection to be ultimately too focused on presenting us with vignettes that sure, are sardonic and clever, but are missing out on those emotional beats and that character development that would have made for a more memorable and richer reading experience. There were some genuinely witty lines/scenarios that made me laugh out loud though.“Had it read DIE!!!! I’d have attributed the message to rage, which is passing, unsustainable. But die, to me, seems cool-headed. The sender appeared to have given it ample thought.”Don’t let my so-so  dissuade you, however! If you are a books using this linked short-stories format, like Calling for a Blanket Dance by Oscar Hokeah, Night of the Living Rez: Stories by Morgan Talty, Frying Plantain by Zalika Reid-Benta, you should definitely give Escoffery's debut a read....more",Notes are private!,1,30,1,"Nov 10, 2022","Nov 17, 2022","Mar 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808611-if-i-survive-you

As the story progresses however I found myself growing weary of the unnecessary miscommunication. If you are a fan of Netflix teen comedies/dramas, Anything But Fine will likely be your next favourite read however, if you prefer more nuanced characters and more realistic scenarios/dynamics well, this may not deliver.  Set in Australia Luca Mason, our 16-teen-yr-old narrator has dedicated his life to ballet. His hopes of being accepted into the Australian Ballet School are thwarted after a bad fall results in a broken foot. After his doctors tell him that he is unlikely to ever be able to dance again Luca is more-or-less booted out of his fancy private high school. A lost and confused Luca distances himself from his ballet friends, three girls who do not seem to truly understand the irreversible consequences of his fall. At his new high school, Luca is befriended by Amina, an affectionate, dorky, genius. Luca also falls hard for Jordan Tanaka-Jones, the school’s handsome, popular and allegedly straight jock. While the novel does rely on insta-love Luca’s crush/obsession with Jordan did strike me as fairly believable. Luca is a horny teenager whose life has recently experienced an unwelcome drastic change so he decides to focus his attention on the seemingly unattainable Jordan. Luca’s dad, who is still grieving the death of his wife, Luca’s mother, tries to reach out to Luca and talk about how his ballet-less life is affecting him but Luca is quick to shut down this conversation. He spends most of his time daydreaming about Jordan and only on occasion allows himself to think about ‘what-ifs’ where he is able to dance again or has never fallen in the first place.Some positives: the writing was fairly engaging and there were even some well-delivered moments of humor. I appreciated that Luca was portrayed as flawed. He makes mistakes, he is rather self-involved, a bit desperate when it comes to Jordan, and could be a more attentive friend/son. The author also shows that while he is often at the receiving end of homophobic ‘jokes’ and verbal abuse, he has a lot to learn about other people's experiences. He does grow aware of this and works to improve himself, which was nice to see. Amina, for 70% of the novel, was a very sweet lovable character. Yeah, she had the type of personality that is often given to secondary characters in teen movies, so some of the stuff she does/say is a bit ott but overall it kind of worked (or at least it did until that scene…). She had her own arc, which made her character more rounded. And the negatives (spoilers ahoy): we are told that Luca’s raison d’etre is ballet and while he does now and on occasion think about I didn’t really buy into this aspect of his character. Look, I get that he would avoid thinking about it too much but surely he would notice how different his everyday life is now. He only comments on this once or twice which isn’t entirely credible. Like, the guy dedicated most of his life to ballet, something that requires a certain amount of devotion. He would have been performing/practising daily and followed a strict diet etc., yet he seemingly adapts to his new life with no problem. Also, while he does one time acknowledge to his father that he is in pain due to his foot, the author seems to gloss over his physical recovery. He has physio but those scenes are all about developing his romance. I just would have liked for ballet (or lack of ballet) to play more of a role in his story. As things stand, we are told he love(d) it but there were few scenes showing this. His former ballet friends are portrayed in a very mean girl way. And sure, there are girls who behave like they do but I did not appreciate that Lucas is dismissive of them from the start. He uses certain terms that were low-key sexist and the story doesn’t challenge any of them. Even the popular girls at his new school receive a similar treatment, and even Jordan and Amina dismiss them and imply that ‘popular’ girls are promiscuous/bitchy/and-other-negative-descriptors-almost-exclusively-used-for-women which seemed a bit out of character if I’m honest. Also, while I am a fan of media that falls under cringe comedy, and I am aware that one’s teen years may be filled with plenty of embarrassing/awkward moments, here there were several scenes that just seemed gratuitous. I am not keen on adult authors going out of their way to embarrass their teenage characters. And here we have a major plot point involving a character doing something very unbelievable and utterly embarrassing themselves and the people around them. Amina has a crush on Jordan and suspects that Lucas is hiding something from her, possibly something that has to do with Jordan. Lucas tells her he has a girlfriend but Amina doesn’t seem to believe him and decides to declare her feelings to Jordan in front of his teammates who have bullied her and Lucas. Why…why would she ever do such a thing? While I am willing to believe that she would confess her feelings to Jordan despite Lucas' attempts to stop her, I didn’t believe that she would do it publicly and seemingly on the spur of the moment. Her refusal to listen to Lucas’ pleas not to go ahead with her plan also struck me as inconsistent with her characterization so far. Sure, she is shown to be a tad naive and very wholesome, her fangirling over one direction comes across as a tad childlike at times but she is also portrayed as empathetic and in many ways more mature than her peers. I struggled to reconcile her actions at that party with her character. She’s obviously turned down and made fun of by the one-dimensional-jock-goons. Both Jordan and Amina take it out on Lucas, which wasn’t entirely fair. In fact, this whole section strings together scene after scene where Lucas is made out to be an ‘awful’ guy. The boy is not perfect sure but I didn’t think it was fair that he was blamed for so many things and rather than communicating/explaining himself to Amina, Jordan, or his dad, he just chooses not to. After being blamed by Amina and Jordan for making her embarrass herself, he inadvertently outs Jordan to his homophobic teammate. In an attempt to warn Jordan about this he forgets that he and his dad are meant to be celebrating his mother’s birthday (i think it was her birthday). Rather than explaining what was going on, he lets his dad think he is simply ‘boy obsessed’ and too busy to care. The dad also insinuates that Lucas ditched his old ballet friends, and the boy doesn’t think of telling him that said friends mistreated him and were racist to Amina.Now, onto the romance. Jordan was a slightly one-note character, and I am a bit tired of lgbtq+ YA novels where the lead falls for the popular and ‘totally straight’ person who isn’t ready/or sure they want to come out. But rather than discussing this with our protagonists, they make them feel ashamed of who they are. While Lucas does call Jordan out, he is ultimately made into the bad guy because hey ho he outs him!!! Like…ugh. I am not a fan of that plot point, at all. It would have been more suited to a show like Glee or something. But here it just comes across as totally unnecessary. While I do acknowledge that the author does allow both Jordan and Lucas to have valid opinions on the whole being ‘out’ and dating someone who is not ‘out’, towards the end he seems to just dunk on Lucas. Amina too after that whole confession-gone-wrong thing is angry at Lucas. Surely, the following day or whatnot, once she learns that the two were in a secret relationship, she would understand why Lucas couldn’t tell her? Best friends or not, Jordan told him he wasn’t ready to be out, so Lucas respected that. And Lucas even tries to stop her from making a fool of herself…and she blames him? Argh. The drama and miscommunication really annoyed me.I would have liked for this book to be less focused on the romance with Jordan and more on Lucas’ character growth. His personality was not particularly well-defined, and I would have liked some moments of introspection where he truly thinks about ballet, what it means to him, etc. His character instead is more or less defined by his crush on Jordan, which ultimately does his storyline a disservice.I'm sure a lot of readers will love this but I am just not a fan of the latter half of the novel.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Apr 02, 2022","Apr 05, 2022","Mar 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693496-anything-but-fine

With each articulated difference, we flattened ourselves and let American define us. We were only ever what it was not.” My initial reaction upon finishing American Fever was something in the realm of ‘underwhelmed’. Yet, as weeks passed by my opinion changed. Maybe it’s because my mother read this after I did and we ended up talking about certain scenes and characters in a way that made it all the more vivid in my mind. Or maybe I just needed time to reconcile myself with the tone and direction of the story. Suffice it to say that the  I am now writing will be a lot more positive than the one I’d planned to write. While I am sure that some readers will be able to tell that this is a first novel, I believe that American Fever makes for a very promising and confident debut. Not only does it resist the usual coming-of-age character arch, but the narrative retains a certain ambivalence that really adds depth and nuance to the story. “The newness of America beckoned. Kelly and Amy appeared crisp, like newly tailored clothes, the fact of them being strangers suddenly inviting. Abbu’s tyranny, Ammi’s coldness, Faisal’s petty concerns— I would leave them all behind. Because I was sixteen, and I thought one did that, could do that— leave anything behind.”The novel revolves around Hira, a 16-year-old Pakistani girl who in 2010 goes on a year-long exchange program, only to find herself in a small-town in Oregon. At first, Hira, a rather prickly and stubborn teen, is eager to leave her family behind and to refashion herself in America, the land of (supposed) opportunities. Hira buys into that tantalizing possibility of change offered by a new environment, but her ‘new’ life in rural Oregon is far from what she’d envisioned. First of all, there is the family she is staying with, Kelly and Amy, a single mother and her teen daughter. Kelly’s parenting is far from what Hira is accustomed to and she comes to resent what she perceives as a lack of care from Kelly. Because there seem to be no fixed mealtimes, and being used to food being prepared for her, Hira begins to lose weight. Additionally, Hira struggles to find places where she can buy halal meat. As Hira attempts to navigate Kelly’s ‘benign’ ignorance and Amy’s seeming disinterest, she also tries to familiarize herself with everyday American life. From their bathroom setups (after years in the uk i have returned to italy and boy did i miss bidets), to the way they interact with one another and so forth. At school, she is not necessarily ostracized but she mostly interacts with the only two other foreign students, Nicole, who is French, and Hamid, who is Omani. Hira and Hamid bond over their similar experiences with racism and islamophobia, although Hira soon finds out that they have quite different perspectives and attitudes when it comes to their peers and the notion of ‘fitting’ into American culture. Hira is a character that is as sympathetic as she is aggravating. You feel for her sense of alienation, her longing for a different experience, and later on her homesickness. But she is also rather self-centered and entitled (at one point rebuking kelly for not cooking more). She is also an observer, someone who often seems at a remove from her surroundings, taking them in but not necessarily allowing herself to interact with them. Although her reflections on belonging, identity, and the notion of ‘assimilation’ are rendered with piercing clarity, a sense of ambivalence and unease permeates much of her narration. Concomitant to her initial desire to connect to others and America itself, is her unwillingness to ‘flatten’ herself or her culture to ‘fit’ in. Her self-divide is somewhat assuaged when she begins to fall for Ali, but, as the weeks go by Hira begins to feel increasingly unwell and, after she begins coughing up blood, is diagnosed with tuberculosis.Dur e Aziz Amna’s American Fever will definitely appeal to fans of ambivalent narrators and stories following characters who leave one country for another, attempting perhaps to sever themselves from their past selves, like Charlotte Brontë and Jamaica Kincaid’s ‘Lucys’. Hira’s introspective quiet yet unyielding nature very much brought to mind Brontë and Jamaica's novels, respectively Villette and Lucy. Stylistically and thematically American Fever shares quite a lot with those two novels. From the cool-tone of the prose, to Hira’s occasional wryness and the awkward, occasionally tense, dialogues.Hira’s journey resists conforming to the usual coming-of-age arc. Her lack of growth brought to mind Selin from Batuman's The Idiot. While it is questionable whether Hira has gained any maturity or a new outlook by the end of her narrative, she has not necessarily stayed the same Hira she was before going to Oregon. As much as she is misunderstood by others, she also makes assumptions about others, and all too often misreads other people. Yet Hira remains a deeply compelling narrator whose voice, frustrating as it may be, nevertheless held my attention. If you are liked releases such as Win Me Something & You Exist Too Much, and Days of Distraction you should consider adding this debut to your tbr.American Fever presents its readers with a piercing interrogation of otherness and belonging that doubles as a quiet yet poignant meditation on adolescence, identity, and family. The narrative has a quiet almost slice-of-life feel that may bore readers who are looking for more plot-driven storytelling. But, if you are looking for a nuanced character study, look no further.Some quotes to give you the vibe of this novel:“There’s a strain of story this could fall into. The foreigner trying to fit in, hindered by accent and Fahrenheit and the Imperial system. The intelligent immigrant turned hapless by America. The outsider on the periphery of America. The entranced documenter of America. The truth— I was bloody bored. It is hard to overstate how much of an abstraction a new country remains to the foreigner, and for how long. America was a concept, and I was there to testify to it. It was metaphor, and not the thing itself. Nothing I did there had any material weight; nothing sated, nothing seeped.”“History is what happens in other places. America transcends it.”“Culture is so flattening when described for the outsider.”“One of the things I miss least about adolescence is the stupefying entitlement it sanctions.”“It’s important to note that the entire time I was in America, I peddled in one stereotype or another, taking succor in their confirmation . Americans were rural and ignorant, or they were urban and slightly less ignorant.”“Why move if you do not wish for places to change you? But perhaps you leave to find out what doesn’t change, the discontent and itch that are constant. You move only to discover, amidst the waiting and the hoping, and the dashing of that hope, that there is only one place the boat will dock. Wherever you go, there you are.”“Sometimes, while talking to Kelly, I stumbled around a sentence, unmoored by language. Even after the conversation had moved on, I remained unsteady, like I was riding a bike that had narrowly escaped a hedge.”“That entire year, Hamid and I treated parts of our identity like my tuna sandwiches— packed in little boxes, to be retrieved only during these lunches.”“Children are prone to exaggerating the cruelty of others, but there are times when one realizes the magnitude of someone’s unfairness only in adulthood.”“For years after, this was the tightrope that mattered —either confirm a stereotype to smug Americans like Mrs Sinclair or defend norms that had troubled me all my life. Then I realized two things. One, that my parents had raised me a snob, and universal legibility was not necessary, or even desirable , to me. Two, that I found no pleasure in translating culture, in working towards a greater understanding between one pack of duffers and another.”“To her, I was only an object of casual interest, an add-on to her daily life. And I didn’t help matters. Some people walk into friendships with open arms, and it’ll come as no surprise that I’m not one of those people. With Amy, too, I withheld. I kept a scale in my hands, always careful to be fair with her, but rarely kind.”“What grated on me was Mrs Sinclair’s insistent knowledge— nothing more dangerous than an American who thinks she knows the world. Kelly sometimes asked naïve questions about Pakistan, but they were curious and sincere, conscious of the place of unknowing they came from. This hag, on the other hand, was chewing up random facts gleaned over a telephone and throwing them at me as expertise.”“My daughter is a brave girl,” he had said, his own voice cracking, because that was and will always be the central myth of our family. It is brave to leave.“I knew the game. Culture and tradition looked best on a woman’s body.”“In the coming days, it would strike me as an oddity, even a lack of imagination , how often my points of reference flitted to that other continent. I would tell myself to be more present, that not everything was a slanted version of that thing I remembered from home. I took it to be a frustrating sign of my newness in America, and not for what it was— the forever condition of anyone living away from the city, town, street she had known to be the world.”“Did she still not know how it worked? He was a father. She was a mother. His errors and cruelties I would forget, or at least learn not to hold against him.”“It is the sole landscape of dreams, the only place that will ever convince you that its failings, its bounties, its excesses, and caresses are all your own. After all, where does it end and you begin?”“[B]ut above all the knowledge that we were all in it together— that giddy, intractable project of not being an adult.”“One of the exquisite delusions of adolescence— the self-chosen life. In time, many of us realize how lofty an accomplishment it would be, to be only as terrible as our parents.”“It pained me each time, because we are taught that independent women are heartless women, and who ever wanted that in a mother? It also thrilled the part of me that would take after her.”...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Aug 22, 2022","Aug 25, 2022","Mar 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59365908-american-fever

Naturally, me being a fan of both of those novels, I found myself intrigued by I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki. This is a relatively short read which is made up of the transcripts from the author’s session with her psychiatrist over a 12-week period. While there are occasional breaks in this patient/psychiatrist dialogue, these are brief, lasting one or two pages and consist of the author musing on the words of her psychiatrist or offering her own words of wisdom. Now, on the one hand, I appreciated reading these sessions as they lead to discussions on self-esteem, depression, anxiety, peer pressure, one’s desire to fit in and be liked, toxic relationships, etc. Baek’s worries and everyday tribulations will likely resonate with many millennials. While I appreciate the honesty that radiated from these sessions, and from her willingness to confront, assess, and critique aspects of herself, I did grow a tad bored by them. I remember coming across a book (i think it was a book) where a character comments on how, most of the time, other people’s dreams do not strike us as interesting as our own ones. Well, this is how I feel about this book. Baek, understandably, finds these sessions to be enlightening as through them she gains self-knowledge and a more nuanced understanding of her mental health, I did not. As I said, I could certainly relate to some of the conversations they have around self-esteem and self-perception, but at the end of the day, these sessions were tailored for Baek, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit uneasy at being ‘invited’ in. Maybe because I have always associated therapists/psychiatrists with privacy, but there were several instances where I wanted to bow out and leave Baek some space. Part of me wishes that this book could have taken only certain exchanges from her sessions, and incorporated these into longer pieces where the author considers the issues they discussed. In short, I wanted to hear more from Baek, and less from her psychiatrist. If I were to record my hypothetical sessions with a therapist or whoever, I doubt anyone would want to read transcripts of it. And if they did, well, that’s kind of sus.Anyway, jokes aside, this was by no means a bad book. I just think it could have benefitted from more original content (ie mini-essays/think pieces)....more",Notes are private!,0,144,1,"Mar 31, 2022","Apr 04, 2022","Mar 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60400779-i-want-to-die-but-i-want-to-eat-tteokbokki

Named in that persistent Southern tradition of irony and with the attendant tradition of nescience, the name becomes slightly sad, a marker of self-conscious ignorance that might as well be embraced because, let’s face it, it isn’t going away.” Percival Everett is an author that has been on my radar for a while now. And in many ways, The Trees does showcase the hand of a talented writer, as the book showcases plenty of quick-witted dialogues and clever descriptions, all topped by an unsparing yet humorous social commentary. It did take me a while to adjust to the tone and direction of his story as I thought that The Trees would be something in the realms of something by Dennis Lehane, Walter Mosley, or S.A. Cosby. I was surprised when I was confronted by an almost absurdist tone, one that brought to mind certain films by the Coen brothers, which usually abound with minor yet memorable side characters. The satirical way in which Everett depicts small towns and small-town ‘mentalities’ reminded me of certain books by Stephen King, as they both succeed in bringing to life—often more for the worse than the better—those who inhabit smaller communities in rural America. For the first few pages in fact I believed that The Trees had a historical setting, given the opinions and behaviours voiced and showcased by the family appearing in that opening sequence. It is only when more modern things are mentioned or make an appearance that I realized that the story had a contemporary setting.Everett effectively renders how insular, bigoted, and reactionary the people of Money, Mississippi are. They are a rural community, one that is teeming with poorly educated racist white-nationalist who struggle to find employement and fulfilment. Their bubble of insularity is burst when their town becomes the setting for a series of mind-boggling murders. The white murdered men appear to share an ‘unpleasant’ (this is an understatement of course) connection and at each crime scene, there is also another body, that of a Black man who eerily resembles Emmett Till, the victim of a lynching. Another odd detail is that the white men are castrated (which of course gives way to a repetitive verging on the homophobic gag which i frankly could have done without).Two detectives from the Bureau of Investigation and the local authorities, who are both inept and racist, attempt to get in their way. As more men die in the same peculiar circumstances the detectives find themselves looking for answers in the past. Are these murders an act of retribution? If so, by the hands of whom? The disappearing body of Emmett Till adds a dimension of surreality to the murders, so much so that I started to wonder whether Everett would go the route King did in The Outsider.Everett favours no perspective and throughout the book, he switches between the townspeople of Money to the detectives. I, like other readers, of course, preferred those sections that focused on the detectives and their investigation. They had a good if slightly cliched dynamic but their banter was entertaining and they play off each other quite well. If anything I found myself wanting to spend more time with them and less with the often cartoonish people of Money. That is not me saying or suggesting that people such as the ones we encounter in Money do not exist. I have come across Jordan Klepper’s videos (where he interviews trump supporters) and boy oh boy...still, Everett is quite heavy-handed in his use of satire, so much so that most of the characters populating his novel are closer to caricatures than fully-dimensional individuals. There were many instances where I found the humour crass and distracting as it took away from otherwise poignant or important scenes where characters discuss lynching, racism, and police brutality. I also did not like how the author writes about fat people, it reminded me of Family Guy tbh. So not my kind of ‘humor’. I could have also done without the very cliched female characters we get in this novel, in particular, the detectives' no-nonsense strong-willed ‘ally’. This is the type of character often penned by male authors, with good intentions I’m sure, but I just find this type of characterisation lazy.The pacing was somewhat uneven. There were several instances where I found my attention drifting away or where I found myself growing weary of the unrelenting satire, especially in those instances where it takes on a sillier tone. There are several storylines that do eventually come together but in a not quite satisfying manner. There are some loose ends or certain parts that just did not feel that convincing or well-executed. The ending in particular didn’t really work for me. Maybe if we’d been given insight into that part of the story from the get-go I could have adjusted more to it but we don’t so I was really sold on it. Still, I can recognise that just because I thought that the content of the story was at odds with the narrative tone does not mean that you will feel the same way so if you are curious about this book I recommend you also check out some 4 or 5-star s. This was less of a crime/thriller than a dark occasionally OTT satire which I wasn’t quite in the mood for. Still, I’ll definitely check out more books by this author. I appreciated the issues he tackles in The Trees, in particular on addressing racist violence both in the past and in the present. Ultimately however the tone of his narration eroded much of my interest in his story so that I found myself reading less out of a desire to do so and more so out of a sense of misplaced duty (on the lines of, i am already halfway there, might as well finish this)....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Mar 25, 2022","Mar 26, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56269278-the-trees

The ambiguous nature of the central characters’ racial identities will lead readers to analyze every passage, trying to ‘find out’ the answers to a puzzle Morrison leaves intentionally unsolved. Our eagerness to understand this short story plays into Morrison’s social commentary. The reading experience of Recitatif is almost a prelude to the real story, the one that occurs outside of its borders, in which we study, examine, and argue, with others or with ourselves about the characters’ identities and the meaning behind Morrison’s choice not to reveal them to us. Long rambling short, this is the type of story that delivers more substance and depth once it’s actually over. Whereas I found the two full-length works that I have read by Morrison to be riveting and all-consuming, I found myself less immersed in Recitatif. I was more interested in the conception and execution of this idea than in the actual story. The story and characters, curiously enough, felt secondary to the literary device employed by Morrison. The alleged fraught friendship between these two women, one of them Black, the other white, pales in comparison to the fiercely complicated bond between Sula and Nel in Morrison’s Sula. We are given a glimpse into their childhood, where we learn they both have experienced some form of hardship and we later see them encountering one another as adults, except that they now find themselves on opposing sides.Their complicity in the violence that other girls at the orphanage where they first met perpetrated against an older woman binds them together. While they both harbour guilt over this they disagree on whether the woman in question was Black or white. This will lead readers to wonder why that is. Which of them is right? And does that change anything? As I said, this is the type of story that is the ideal vehicle for generating discussions on race and racism in America. While I admired Morrison’s skill, I found that I was too aware of her presence in this story. That is, while with her novels her voice reeled me into her stories, here I felt more keenly her ‘hand’. As I was reading I knew that she was the architect behind the words on those pages.Nevertheless, I’m glad that I read this as I did find this to be a thought-provoking short story. Zadie Smith’s introduction adds another dimension to the story and I highly recommend you do not give it a miss....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Mar 23, 2022","Mar 24, 2022","Mar 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58949850-recitatif

I❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ It would be safe to say that I do have a bit of an uneasy relationship with Murakami’s work. I read and was not blown away by it. Over the last couple of months, I have picked up several of his short story collections but never felt compelled to finish them. The main reason why I do not get on with his work is that, well, his women are on a league of their own when it comes to female characters written by male authors. I cringed many times while reading Sputnik Sweetheart: his portrayal of the romantic/sexual relationship between Sumire and Miu, the two women at the centre of the narrative, was yikes. It often went from being slightly ridiculous to straight-up ludicrous. That he chooses to tell their story through ‘K’, our male straight narrator, is also somewhat iffy. While K acknowledges that it may be unusual for him to tell Sumire’s love story, he doesn’t provide a particularly satisfying answer. I mean, I honestly think this could have been a much stronger novel if the narrative had alternated between Sumire and Miu. Anyway, we are stuck with K and his creepy male gaze. When we first meet him he is a college student who has fallen in love with Sumire, who is very much the classic Murakami female character, in that she’s Not Like Other Girls. She’s messy and in the throes of an existentialist crisis. She often confides in K about her fears and desire, and he takes on the role of listener, never revealing anything particularly substantial about himself, keeping readers and Sumire at arm's length. He often recounts Sumire's experiences from her point of view, which obviously necessitates our suspension of disbelief, given that he would really have no way of being able to provide such detailed descriptions of her experiences, let alone her inner feelings. Anyway, K gives us an impression of what kind of person Sumire is, her somewhat skewed worldview, and speaks of her writerly aspirations. Eventually, Sumire reveals to him that for the first time in her life she has fallen in love. K is disappointed to learn that he is not the person in question and that Sumire has fallen for Miu, an older businesswoman of Korean heritage. Sumire begins to act in a way that Miu approves of, changing her style etc. to earn Miu’s favor. As Sumire begins to work for Miu, her feelings intensify to the point where she is no longer able to contain her emotions. During a work trip to an island on the coast of Greece Sumire disappears. Miu contacts K and he travels there. Although Miu tells him of the events that led to Sumire’s ‘vanishing’, the two struggle to make sense of what led Sumire to just disappear. Here in classic Murakami fashion things take a surreal route, as the line between dreams and reality becomes increasingly blurry. There are feverish visions that lead to life-altering consequences, hypnotic dreams, and, of course, inexplicable disappearances. The ‘intimate’ cast of characters does result in fairly charged dynamics between Sumire, Miu, and K. K, of course, did serve a somewhat unnecessary role but by the end, I could see why someone as lonely as Sumire would find comfort in his continued presence. They have bizarre conversations about human nature, love, sex, and so forth, and some of these were fairly engaging. Overall, Murakami certainly succeeds in creating and maintaining a dreamlike atmosphere and a melancholy mood. The late 90s setting casts a nostalgic haze over the events being recounted by K. I just wish that Murakami's depiction of women and lesbians wasn’t so corny. From the way he describes women's pubic hair to his strongly held belief that women are obsessed by their breasts (particularly nipples), to his dubious comments and takes on same-sex love….well, it was not for me. I found his language turgid in these instances, either funny in a that’s-idiotic-kind-of-way or just plain gross. There are other classic Murakami elements: characters who love talking about literature, jazz bars, and classical music. While K is more mysterious than his usual male characters he was not exactly an improvement model. He has some rapey thoughts and instincts that were definitely off-putting. Miu’s strange ‘affliction’ is also quite out there and I found Sumire’s attempts at a ‘declaration’ to be problematic indeed as it bordered on sexual assault. But if you can put up with dated and frequently icky content Sputnik Sweetheart does present readers with an immersive tale of yearning and loneliness. I appreciated the storyline’s unresolved nature and the sense of surreality that permeates it. I will probably read more by Murakami but I will do so when I am in the right state of mind to put up with his peculiar sexism....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Feb 19, 2022","Feb 22, 2022","Feb 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/397165.Sputnik_Sweetheart

It did manage to hold my attention and even delivered some fairly entertaining scenes and/or dazzling descriptions, and I can see this appealing to fans of historical fantasy novels like Libba Bray's The Diviners or YA books which employ the ragtag group + heist formula, such as Portrait of a Thief or Six of Crows. Sadly, as much as I wanted to love The Monsters We Defy, I found myself wanting more in terms of plot and characters. Set in 1925 Washington D. C. the novel revolves around Clara Johnson, a woman who is able to commute with the spirits. We know that after a stint in jail Clara is indebted to a spirit and must use her gift to earn back her freedom. This spirit tasks her with a difficult task: she is to steal a magical ring that happens to be in the hands of one of the city’s wealthiest and most connected people. As one can expect, Clara is joined by an ‘unlikely’ x-men-like team: there is the handsome jazz musician who is able to hypnotize others and an elderly actor who can change his appearance. Alongside for the ride is her second command of sorts, who mostly serves the role of the comedic character. Maybe if the dynamics had remained platonic or focused on their banter and friendships I would have found this team more engaging than I actually did. I did not care for the romance, which was very insta-love and induced several eye-rolls on my part ( she is the only one who isn’t smitten by his looks & yadda yadda). The other two people in the team are given tiny backstories but their personalities often were reduced to how they were different from others (the actor is queer, clara’s friend is a person with albinism). The heist unfolds slowly, and there were several lulls that lessened the overall intensity of the plotline. I also found the inclusion of real-life figures a wee bit cheesy. Still, Leslye Penelope does capture the aesthetics and politics of 1925 Washing D. C., highlighting the experiences of its Black community and, through the actor character, the lgbtq+ community. I also liked the magical aspect of Penelope's story, which seemed to combine together elements of spirituality with folklore traditions. Overall however I found the characters somewhat paper-thin, and I would have preferred a darker tone or a less binary view of good/evil. This was a fairly engaging read but I was expecting more of an exciting romp. Nevertheless, it was by no means a bad novel and I would recommend you check out more positive s if you are thinking of reading this yourself....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Sep 28, 2022","Oct 03, 2022","Feb 18, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60376516-the-monsters-we-defy

Never forget that. Never let them forget it.”What could have been a powerful and propulsive queer coming-of-age is bogged down by a narrative that is heavy on exposition, footnotes (related to real-life figures, places, and organizations), and a storyline that pacing and plotline wise perhaps would work better on the screen than in a novel. Even so, Rasheed Newson’s My Government Means to Kill Me has a lot going for it: it’s informative, it has some great dialogues, it boasts a strongly rendered sense of place and time, it demonstrates the author’s understanding and insight into many social issues that feel all too relevant to the present day, and it challenges simplistic visions of what activism is and what it can achieve. “My cause was born of a lie, but a lie can be the spark that leads to virtue.”Set in 1980s New York, the opening chapters are probably the most immersive ones as we follow Trey, a young gay Black man (boy really given that he is not even in his 20s), who attempts to make a fresh start in the city. Trey wants to break free from his family, their wealth, their expectations, and their disappointment, to escape from small-town mentalities, and to leave his past behind. He is taken under the wing of Gregory, who has several ‘daddies’, and likes to tease Trey, even if it is clear that he sees him as a younger brother. Their different backgrounds do create tension between them as Gregory, unlike Trey, doesn’t have a wealthy family to fall back onto. The two spend a lot of their time at Mt. Morris Baths, a gay bathhouse, which remained operating during the AIDS epidemic.“See, even during a pandemic, racism never fails to insert itself into the equation.”There Trey experiments with sex and relationships, and the exhilarating freedom of it all often leads him to view AIDS as a mere gray cloud in the sky. But, eventually, Trey meets Bayard Rustin (who was a leader in many social movements), someone he admires, and who instils in Trey a sense of duty towards their community. Although Trey’s initial motivations to confront the owner of his building, Fred Trump, are more selfish than selfless, this experience makes him realize the change he is capable of enacting. Trey eventually begins to volunteer at a home hospice for AIDS patients, and witnessing the death of so many men, awakens him even more. As he tries to navigate the shifting loyalties and intricacies of the people operating the hospice, he eventually joins ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. We see the gruelling tests aspiring members are subjugated to, we see internecine fighting within this group, and how the interplay of race, gender, and class affects and divides marginalized communities. Older activists challenge Trey’s understanding of activism, its aim, priorities, inner workings, and limitations, of the civil rights movement, and of the realities and dangers of protesting. Trey becomes close to Angie, a seemingly hard-nosed butch lesbian, and he finds himself rethinking the ways he has tended not to really see women. But it is Rustin in particular who pushes Trey into rethinking his simplistic and occasionally righteous judgment of key figures connected to the civil rights movements. Trey and his experiences did often strike me as vehicles through which the author could discuss, delineate, and pontificate, on real-life figures, movements, and historical events. He often adopts a didactic tone and Trey’s overview of these people/places/events took me out of the story a little bit. There were sections of writing that could have easily belonged to an op-ed or a work of nonfiction. Which is a pity as they undermined those more intimate and immediate scenes. Trey’s backstory is also…predictable and rushed. Last night I watched Earthquake Girl, which was so inane it made me mad, which employed a similar device. Rather than giving its main character a personality, the story decides to throw at her some childhood trauma that explains her lack of personality. I am so tired of these stories that rather than putting an effort into fleshing out a character, by giving them recognizable personality traits, or by allowing them to be realistically idiosyncratic, they just throw in some trauma. Because that’s what makes people interesting, special, not like other people. And in Trey’s case, it felt like that. Additionally, it didn’t help that the chapters are structured in a way that in each one Trey ‘learns’ a lesson, initially about life in NY, sex, and friendships, and later through his experiences as a volunteer and as a member of ACT UP. “Winning rarely changes how people perceive us and almost never soothes our insecurities. Winning, as most of us conceive it, is external and public. I didn’t yet know that the most rewarding activities of my life would be those done in secret.”Trey’s friendship with Gregory, which is by no means smooth, was one of the strengths of the novel, as a lot of the other characters tend to be literally or inspired by real-life people.The ending was rushed, and I was disappointed by how certain important events aren’t given a lot of page-time/weight.I would have liked more balance between facts and fiction, and for Trey’s character, his backstory, his personality, and so on, to be brought more into focus because as is he just struck me as a vehicle through which the author can discuss an array of subjects matter, which is a pity as there were moments were his voice did strike a chord.I will admit that usually, I tend to click more with books that are character studies than 'period' studies. Nevertheless, My Government Means to Kill Me was in many ways eye-opening and its documentary-like style did add to the reading experience. The dialogues, the sense of place and time, the challenging issues Newson explores and portrays, these definitely made My Government Means to Kill Me worth reading. The premise, that of a gay young man leaving his past behind, be it a troubled or an unremarkable one, and attempting to make a go of things in a city, brought to mind A Beautiful Crime and Bath Haus so if you happen to be a fan of those you should definitely check out Newson's novel. “New York City. No one I knew had anything good to say about the place. It was crime ridden and drug addled. It was the epicenter of moral decay. I set my heart on living there, and for a while, doing so felt like enough.”...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jan 22, 2023","Jan 24, 2023","Feb 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58724723-my-government-means-to-kill-me

Names that sound like heartbeats: Fe Fe, Precious, Stacia, Tonya.” Last Summer on State Street is a scintillating and profoundly poignant coming-of-age novel charting Fe Fe’s fraught girlhood & the tragic dissolution of her friendship group. “We were so different, but everybody loved them some double Dutch. Sometimes we made a tight-knit crew; other days we couldn’t get along for nothing.”Our narrator, Fe Fe, looks back to the summer of 1999, her last summer in the housing projects of Chicago. She used to spend her days with her closest friends playing Double Dutch, blissfully unaware of the events to come. The introduction of a fourth girl into her group upsets certain dynamics, and Fe Fe finds herself torn between developing a new friendship and holding onto her old ones. But friend-drama is not all that occupies her mind, as Fe Fe soon grows apprehensive at how her community is being upended from their neighbourhood, with high-rises being torn down by the Chicago Housing Authority. In addition, Fe Fe has to reckon with the gang-related activities and their hold on two of her friends. After a police ‘raid’ results in Fe Fe’s older brother being detained, he too spins further away from her, as he finds security and purpose in joining the local gang. Fe Fe not only has to cope without her beloved brother and two of her friends (one who has gone missing, the other seems out to get her) but her mother’s depression and heartbreak at her son’s ‘chosen’ path. Fe Fe wants to help those she loves, her friends, her brother, and her community, but she is soon forced to recognise that you can’t always save others, especially if they think that they do not need saving, to begin with. The narrative grapples with questions of right and wrong, but in a way that feels anything but simplistic or moralistic. There is a certain open-endedness and ambiguity to Fe Fe’s story that made her experiences seem all the more real. I found her struggles all the more affecting as I am myself experiencing a situation where I want to help someone who is very self-destructive and unwilling/unable to accept that they need help to begin with (to be less vague: the person in question is my father who is an alcoholic & drug addict). “That summer, one by one, they dropped out of sight as if we were in a game of All in Together.”A sense of apprehension permeates much of the narrative, and the possibility of danger is always around the corner. From the brutal taking of Fe Fe’s brother to the disappearance of Fe Fe’s new friend. While the narrator does render the fear and anxiety created by living in such proximity to gangs, her ‘adult’ knowledge allows her to view their actions with more nuance. That is not to say that she condones their violence and criminal activities but we see how racial institutions promote the formation of such gangs as well as interrogating the trauma and alienation that would lead someone to join them. For instance, in the case of Fe Fe’s brother, we see how disempowered and afraid he feels after he is the victim of discrimination & racial profiling at the hands of the police. Or how difficult it is to untangle yourself from a gang if your entire family is part of that gang.In addition to presenting us with a bittersweet portrait of female friendships & Black girlhood, the author explores the hyper-sexualisation & adultification of young Black girls, the criminalization of young Black men, and the bleak realities of living with neglectful and/or dysfunctional parents. Over the course of this summer, Fe Fe is forced into growing up, and we are forced to witness her trying to navigate dangerous and otherwise untenable circumstances. As those she loves to seem to spin further and further away from her, Fe Fe desperately struggles to hold onto them. As she watches her world irrevocably change, Fe Fe begins to identify & recognize the unjust systems that enable such damage to occur. Despite the novel’s subject matter, Fe Fe’s voice retains a lightness and hope that made even the most upsetting scenes ‘bearable’ (that is to say that of course they were still distressing but i was able to keep on reading). While there are a lot of heartbreaking moments, resilience & hope underline Fe Fe’s recollection of her past. We also see her friendship with Precious Brown and the affectionate bond she shares with an older woman in the neighbourhood ground her and provide her with a sense of self-worth & inner strength. Her faith also plays a role in her ‘coming of age’, and even if I am not religious, I found her relationship to her faith touching and depicted with subtelty.My one ‘but’ has to do with the letter and those diary entries we get towards the end. They struck me as out of place, vaguely ‘off’ in that the voices there sounded not from the ppl they were meant to be by but by Fe Fe herself (or someone who was not in their position but was trying, not so successfully, to put themselves in their shoes). I think they were a tad contrived.Overall I really loved this. The writing is (deceptively) breezy & lyrical, the topics are hard-hitting, and the characters are complex, their imperfections & flaws making them all the more realistic. I can definitely see this appealing to fans of authors such as Jacqueline Woodson, Danielle Evans, and Patricia Engel, not only because they also tend to explore 'girlhood', but their styles share a certain shining quality that makes for very captivating reads....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jul 03, 2022","Jul 04, 2022","Feb 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58884738-last-summer-on-state-street

Money—it was everywhere but nowhere.”  Over the last few years, I have developed a certain fondness for collections of interlinked short stories, especially when they focus on the same character or various members of the same family. I enjoy the way these collections often ‘disrupt’ the typical linear coming-of-age story, presenting us instead with self-contained stories that hone in on a specific period or moment of a character's life. I like the way they can achieve an almost snap-shot-like quality, one that really brings into focus the emotions and experiences of that specific moment. While here the style is pretty consistent, these collections also have the ability to implement different literary devices and of playing around with perspectives (switching between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd povs). If you like other collections with this type of format (such as Crooked Hallelujah by Kelli Jo Ford, Patricia Engel’s Vida, and Zalika Reid-Benta's Frying Plantain), you should definitely not miss out on Night of the Living Rez. Additionally, if you also happen to appreciate narratives exploring fraught dynamics and dysfunctional families, novels such as Nuclear Family by Joseph Han & Kirstin Valdez Quade's The Five Wounds or memoirs like Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls by T Kira Madden or Dog Flowers by Danielle Geller, then Morgan Talty's debut should be up your street. Stylistically, thematically and tonally I was reminded of several other contemporary works by Indigenous authors, from David Heska Wanbli Weiden's crime thriller Winter Counts to Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach & Son of a Trickster, which combine magical realism with a coming-of-age narrative.“You from the rez?” he said.I didn’t look too Native, and so I said, “Yeah, how’d you know?”“Your shirt says ‘Native Pride.’”This collection comprises 12 short stories in which we follow our protagonist, who is a member of the Penobscot Nation and living with his family on a reservation in Maine. In these various stories, we are reunited with our narrator (i believe his name was Dee…?) as a child, a teen, and an adult. In many of these stories we see him, or the people close to him, struggle with dependency and attempt to co-exist (however dysfunctionally) with the rest of his family. Many of these stories are pure funny sad, as Talty perfectly brings together humor with a brutal yet precise exploration of very heavy themes. While I can predict that some readers will be frustrated by the ways the characters fail themselves and each other (falling into ‘bad habits’ or lifestyles, lying to one another about important sh*t, neglecting themselves and others) for me it really hit close to home. It isn’t to cut yourself loose from the people you love or the people who know you, and I appreciated how unjudgemental the author was in portraying his characters’ struggles with addiction etc. Recently-ish I mentioned in another  that I had to return to the city I grew up in because my father had fallen off the wagon big time and had to be hospitalized so, well, there were quite a few scenes that felt painfully familiar. But that’s enough about me. Talty encourages his readers not only to feel ‘sympathy’ towards his characters but to really emphasise them and their respective situations. The dialogues and the way the characters interacted with one another were strikingly realistic, and I appreciated how chaotic and messy some of these scenes were. By presenting us with a humorous yet ultimately haunting family portrait Talty is able to interrogate the way our legacies and inheritances shape us, and the difficulties in trying to reconcile yourself with a past that has left such indelible marks on your present. In this Talty is able to explore boyhood, generational trauma, and the continued injustices faced by Native communities. As I said, I really appreciated how realistic Talty's depiction of addiction and trauma were in that he shows that healing is not a linear or straightforward process. Despite the bleak themes and the depressing scenarios described in these stories, this was not a heavy read. The stuff in here is hard-hitting, sure, but there is this energetic humor that gives a sort of lightness to Dee's narration. Which again makes those painful and sad moments all the more brutal. Another thing worth pointing out is how in certain stories we have this horror-like atmosphere which not only lends authenticity to Dee's 'younger' stories (showing that he is more impressionable) but also reminds us of the horror in the everyday.Overall, I thought this was a very self-assured debut. The writing is neither distracting nor dull, the dialogues and scenarios are realistically rendered, and the non-linear coming-of-age story was engrossing indeed.I look forward to revisiting this collection (hopefully when i am in a less stressful period of my life and give it the attention it deserves) and I am curious to read Talty's future work....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jul 05, 2022","Jul 08, 2022","Jan 29, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56648158-night-of-the-living-rez

While I believe that Joseph Han is a promising author, structurally and thematically Nuclear Family felt a bit all over the place, and the elements of magical realism were at best, ineffectual, and at worst, a mere gimmick. Still, there were some truly heart-rendering moments, especially towards the end, and the sense of place is consistently strong. I also appreciated how ambivalent the characters were and the fraught, yet sometimes playful, dynamics they have with one another. The narrative uses multiple perspectives and a nonlinear timeline to recount the events leading to and the aftermath of the novel’s ‘inciting incident’, that is Jacob Cho attempting and failing to cross the Korean demilitarized zone. The Cho's are a Korean American family based in Hawai'i who run several restaurants. While their daughter, Grace, a college student with a penchant for weed, still works for them, their son Jacob has gone to become an English teacher in Seoul. One day, Grace and her father see on the news a video showing Jacob’s failed attempt to cross the border to North Korea. Confused, angry, and scared the Cho are unable to get in contact with Jacob as he is being detained by the South Korean government. While the sections taking place in Hawai'i focus on the weeks and months after this incident, the chapters centred on Jacob's attempt to give us an insight into the circumstances that led him to do this. We learn more of his childhood in Hawai'i, where he was often made to feel like an outsider, and that he is fairly repressed when it comes to his sexuality and desires. Once in Seoul Jacob’s portions of the narrative acquire a feverish quality, as scenes and sequences of events are presented to us in fragments. He seems affiliated with a mysterious malaise, one that results in rashes and a general sense of fatigue. His sense of alienation is exacerbated in Seoul as although he is seen as Korean, he doesn’t speak the language fluently and has American mannerisms that once again lead him to feel like an ‘oddity’. Additionally, he is being stalked by the ghost of his grandfather who is intent on possessing him. Interrupting his chapters are the ones revolving around the rest of his family, in particular Grace. The Cho’s reputation is in tatters after Jacob’s botched attempt is televised, and the restaurants are hard hit. Their regular customers begin eating elsewhere, while their neighbours and the members of their church distance themselves from them, seeming to delight in gossiping about the Cho’s ‘fall’ and spreading false rumours about them (that they are spies, turncoats etc.). Grace, now more than ever resentful of her parents and her brother, as well as the ‘special’ treatment he was given by them growing up & in adulthood, tries to smoke away from her problems.While I appreciated the realism of the dialogues we do get, I found myself wishing for more. A lot of the ones we get are either of bantery & argumentative nature or of a stoned & confused variety. Sure, they could be entertaining and authentic but I would have liked for more scenes where we get to ‘hear’ the characters interacting with one another, especially in those more emotional & dramatic moments.Han’s multivalent perspectives do not always work out, and we get snippets following characters who do not really add much to the Cho’s narratives. I wish the narrative would have instead exclusively focused on the Cho’s, as I found myself wanting to learn more about Grace and Jacob’s parents. There are also time-skips that feel rushed, and they take away immediacy from the Cho's experiences and distanced me somewhat from their story. Jacob’s storyline was all over the place. I understand that many sections from his story were intentionally unclear, however, I still found most of his storyline very underwhelming in that he doesn’t come across as rounded a character as Grace. Maybe I would have preferred it if within his chapters we could have delved more into his sexuality or at least if we’d been given more glimpses of his personality. Besides his ability to see ghosts, and his propensity for awkwardness, we don’t learn much about him. At least we see Grace interact with different people (from her parents to her friends and colleagues) whereas Jacob’s chapters are mostly about him feeling unwell and being sort of possessed. This fantastical element didn’t really work for me. This grandfather's character was poorly developed and served more as a plot device. Maybe if the story had also included chapters exclusively centred on his story, maybe then I would have found his ghostly presence more ‘convincing’...The relationship between Grace and Jacob also left me wanting for the majority of the book. He doesn't really think much about her (or his parents for the matter) as he is too busy being possessed or possibly hallucinating stuff. Grace is angry at him, sure. But I would have liked it more if she'd been shown to think about him more, or at least of their relationship in the past. The glimpses we do get about their bond prior Jacob leaving for Seoul were kind of unsatisfying, and I was rather annoyed by how Jacob's sexuality is framed in her chapters.Still, in the latter half of the novel, we do get more of them together. While the last pages were a bit meh (to me, fart humor is just not that funny) I found the novel's final act to be far more poignant and cathartic than the previous acts. Without resorting to sentimentalism Han presents us with some truly moving moments.So, Nuclear Family was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I would recommend it to fans of family dramas or readers who are looking for a story exploring uneasy family dynamics and generational & cultural differences as well as failure, guilt, and reconciliation. Even if I wasn't blown away by Nuclear Family I am looking forward to reading whatever Han writes next....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jun 16, 2022","Jun 18, 2022","Jan 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59349398-nuclear-family

The unrelenting push of gentrification and the looming threat of eviction sees this cast of characters struggling to keep up with their rents and to stay afloat. As they strive to make ends meet some harbor dreams of finding success and/or of leaving, while others are focused on the now, willing, but not happy, to burn their bridges if it means holding onto the life they have built so far. In the first story, we follow Mimi, a single mother who works as a waitress and makes some extra money doing hair. With rent coming up, Mimi is short on cash, so she finds herself doing her friends dirty. There is Quanneisha, once a promising gymnast whose career is cut short by a group of neighborhood girls, who finds herself in the position of having to help the person who she holds responsible for ruining her life. We also read from the perspective of older and younger characters, who often witness or find themselves falling deeper into difficult situations. Fofana captures the dynamics between the various tenants, demonstrating empathy to all, the ones who choose self-preservation, the more individualistic ones, the ones who seek to form a united front, and the ones who are to wrapped up in envisioning their future they loose sight and control of their present. Many of the characters find themselves or have no choice but to make choices that have bad repercussions, hurting the ones they care about, or landing them into deeper trouble.The descriptions and the dialogues are all rendered with electrifying realism, as the author captures the rhythms of these characters' conversations and their interior voices. I will say that there is one chapter that explores the tensions between a group of Black men and a Chinese-owned restaurant, and I found the repeated use of a derogatory term for a Chinese man, well, it felt unnecessary. Using it once, as well as the characters’ behavior towards this restaurant, already makes us aware of the main character and his friends’ prejudice, for instance, that accented english signifies stupidity, and equating politeness with weakness. Anyway, many of these characters are put in compromising positions where they have to reevaluate or question the kind of people they are, and whether they will or won’t take accountability for their life and the choices they have made. I appreciated that Fofana does not oversimplify their struggles or uses simplistic parameters of good/bad when exploring their actions and choices. Like many collections out there, Stories from the Tenants Downstairs had a couple of gems and quite a few compelling but not particularly memorable. If you are a fan of the work of Ladee Hubbard, Anthony Veasna So, Danielle Evans, and Toya Wolfe then you should definitely add Stories from the Tenants Downstairs to your tbr list. Fofana is a clearly talented storyteller and I look forward to reading more by him....more",Notes are private!,1,29,1,"Jan 10, 2023","Jan 11, 2023","Jan 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59366136-stories-from-the-tenants-downstairs

David Santos Donaldson's insight into academia & creative burnout brought to mind the work of Weike Wang, Elaine Hsieh Chou, David Hoon Kim, and Jo Hamya. Similarly to these authors, Donaldson presents readers with a young(ish) main character who is in the midst of a bizarre existential crisis. There were elements of Donaldson’s storytelling that I rather appreciated as they reminded me of Helen Oyeyemi and Elif Batuman, in that Greenland is consistently absurd in its tone and in its engagement with its various subject matters so that we have many scenes which manage to be both surreal yet oddly realistic. Similarly to the protagonists of those authors, Kip makes for a hyperalert yet frustratingly naïve narrator whose inner monologue is rather navel-gazey, as he obsesses over himself & the perception others have of him and (over)-intellectualizes even the banalest and most fleeting of his ideas/opinions. Whereas Selin's ruminations in The Idiot have to do with language and philosophy, central to Kip’s narrative are race, history, and books, which allow for an intertextual dimension which really enriches his story.I think this novel had a lot of potential, sadly sometimes this potential was wasted so that the story came across as self-indulgent and too intent on being clever and satirical. Still, the narration has this playfulness to it that really works in the story’s favour and the author’s social commentary is very much on point, as it manages to be witty & razor-sharp. Donaldson’s exploration of his main character’s identity, his uneasy relationship with widely accepted ideals of masculinity & Blackness, and his experiences with racism in academia and in intimate relationships (with his partner and best friend), are some of the novel’s strongest aspects, and I admired how Donaldson was able to address serious and topical issues with both humor and depth.The story has a rather freewheeling structure as much of the narrative takes place in a confined setting: a basement study in Brooklyn. Kip Starling is a gay man in his thirties who is convinced that the only way he can meet his prospective publisher’s deadline is by locking himself in his study. He needs to revise his book on the love affair between E.M. Forster and Mohammed el Adl, which he initially had written from Forster’s pov, but now has to write from Mohammed's one. Kip’s reimaging of Mohammed’s life and affair are heavily influenced by his own personal experiences, and soon enough he struggles to distinguish fact from fiction, reality from fantasy.The narrative switches from Kip in the basement and the story he is writing. As Kip writes about Mohammed we learn more about him: he lives with his older white partner, an American therapist named Ben, who just recently broke up with him; he had a big fight with Concha, his best-friend months prior and the two have not yet mended things; he is British and struggled a lot to fit in with his American peers at university; he is very much experiencing a major identity crisis. Kip's speculations into philosophy and spirituality, into whiteness and queerness, are characterised by a wry millennial tone, one that was for the most part rather amusing. The sheer absurdity of the scenario and of Kip’s increasingly frenzied inner monologue result in an offbeat narrative, one that is often unapologetically weird and nonsensical. In the latter part of the novel we follow Kip as he embarks on a physical and possibly mystical journey, one that sees him confronting his relationship with whiteness, literature, and history. Here the story takes even more of a fantastical turn as the line between Kip’s story and Mohammed’s disappears almost completely, and it is very much left to the readers' interpretation to ascertain how unreliable a narrator Kip is.Sure, at times Kip’s intellectualizing grated on me, as it resulted in some verbose & florid passages that really added little to his story. The satire too sometimes feels too heavy-handed so that the characters and scenarios appear cartoonish, crass even, and in this way, I was reminded of Version Control by Dexter Palmer & My Education by Susan Choi.The female characters, from the way they were described to the way their personalities were portrayed, left a lot to be desired. And at times it seemed that the story minimises Kip’s sexism because he’s not straight, but that didn't quite sit right with me. One of the worst offenders is Concha, not because she is intentionally unlikeable (the way she fetishes and eroticises Blackness is schifo) but because she is the kind of Mediterranean character that I usually associate with English & American authors. They are passionate & hot-blooded, and often over-sexualised and prone to expressing quaint opinions about life, marriage, love, and sex. Concha is the type of character that I would expect to encounter in a book by Wilkie Collins or Agatha Christie, not in a book published in 2022 and that has a contemporary setting. Of course, when speaking about her Kip has to mention flamenco or emphasize how she goes on about men’s virility and whatnot. She is supposedly in love with Kip, and he knows this and doesn’t exactly do anything about it which leads him to feel guilty about the way he handled their relationship but I for one questioned the validity of their friendship. I just didn’t believe in it. Not because all friendships have to be nice and easy (i quite like the slightly competitive and peculiar bond between selin and svetlana in batuman’s books) but they have to be credible, and because Concha is such a cartoonish character who spouts the kind of ‘opinions’ that reek of scientific racism, I questioned what Kip saw in her. The narrative makes it seem like she’s funny purely because she’s Spanish, and has eccentric Spanish ways/views…le sigh. I was very much over her. She has no redeeming qualities nor is she horribly toxic in a particularly memorable or credible way.Kip’s partner also was rather one-dimensional, and I didn’t like that the narrative tries to paint him in an ultimately ‘he-is-not-so-bad’ light when again his microaggressions are of the scientific racist variety. Yeah, he’s white so inevitably he will make remarks that reek of his white privilege but the stuff he says are of the there-is-no-going-back variety. And to be honest he doesn’t really have much of a personality, other than being kind of pathetic and ignorant. I just found him rather unpleasant and icky. Once again, I struggled to believe in their relationship, as I did not really get what drew these two men together, nor did the glimpses into their relationship make their romantic and sexual relationship more convincing. As I said, I can find complicated and f*cked up relationships affecting, which is why I love authors like Brandon Taylor and Donna Tartt. But I could have easily looked past Kip's relationship with these two characters whose presence in the book is after all mostly relegated to flashbacks (i think we hear their disembodied voices while kip is in his self-imposed imprisonment). This story is mainly about Kip and the existential clusterf*ck he experiences. The author presents us with an experimental character study, one that is playfully surrealistic yet surprisingly touching and insightful. The narrative’s intertextuality enriches the text, as Kip often refers to the lives and works of other authors (for example kip refers to W. E. B. Du Bois' double consciousness, Walt Whitman, Toni Morrison, and Fyodor Dostoevsky) as we read of Kip’s experiences in white-dominated places as well as his struggle to ‘acclimatize’ to American culture. As a Black gay man, Kip feels and is made to feel othered, and much of the narrative explores this notion of otherness and there are many awkward instances, of him not fitting in or attempting to connect to others, that brought to mind cringe-comedy shows like Fleabag & Chewing Gum. Sure, I would have liked to learn more about his family and his childhood but by focusing almost exclusively on his adulthood Donaldson still achieves a compelling character analysis. What I struggled to look past was the story within the story, that is the sections we get from Kip’s book. While I love reading books centred on characters who are aspiring or established authors, for example Writers & Lovers, if said books include sections of writing from these fictional authors...these are of questionable quality. And the chapters from Kip's book...were, how shall I put it, not good. Words like pitiful, bad, and ridiculous come to mind when I think back to them. Atrocious even. The writing was laboured, the storytelling sensationalistic, and the characters, who are supposedly existing in 1919 Egypt, possessed rather modern sensibilities. Sure, you could say this was intentionally pointing to Kip’s over-identifying with his protagonist…yet, having these sections from his book made the parallels between his story and Mohammed’s one seem forced, gimmicky even. Personally, I would have preferred if we’d just gotten a quote from his book at the begging of each chapter or something, but having to read Kip’s book bogged down Kip’s own narrative and made me feel less engaged in what I was reading. I also really didn’t like Kip’s Forster, a generically effete Edwardian man who lacks a moral backbone. Again, was I meant to believe that he was in love with Mohammed? And vice versa? It seemed that Mohammed was mostly revolted by him, and while I can appreciate books that have very toxic relationships or unromantic love stories, here I just didn’t buy into them. The trajectory of Kip’s journey also risked being a bit too Eat Pray Love with Kip having an ‘awakening’ in Greenland. Sure, he isn't a blonde straight woman, but the way his narrative portrays Aguta, an Inuit woman, yeah...it wasn't great. In Greenland, he comes across someone who shares his very traumatic experiences and the narrative is very flippant about the whole thing, which didn’t sit right with me in that it felt gratuitous and exaggerated.Quite a few things would have been more effective or amusing if they hadn't been stretched out so long, for instance, I would have enjoyed that chapter on Idris Elba if that information had been given us over the course of a paragraph or two (as opposed to pages). I also failed to get those asides on the body electric (i think it was the body electric). All in all, I have rather conflicted feelings about Greenland. On the one hand, it was inventive and amusive, on the other, it was sometimes tasteless and it had a lot of cartoonish elements that just struck me as unfunny and self-indulgent. The verbose intellectualism at play here lacked the precise dry humor of Batuman's The Idiot and instead were more inaccessible and trying too hard to be clever & mean, bringing to mind Call Me Zebra by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi & Cho's My Education (which may very well appeal to some readers, just not me at this point in my life).Nevertheless, the writing could also be frothy and fun, Kip's shrewd reflections on race, belonging, class, and history made me think of one of my favourite authors, Danzy Senna. Additionally, the narrative made me add An African in Greenland to my tbr-pile.Considering this is a debut novel, I have to say it is a surprisingly memorable one (sadly i find a lot of debut novels to be a bit too vanilla-ey for my taste) and it has definitely succeeded in making me interested in checking out Donaldson's future work....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jun 07, 2022","Jun 10, 2022","Jan 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58986624-greenland

I thought I was going to read something in the realms of Elif Batuman's The Idiot or Brandon Taylor's Real Life (tonally and stylistically these are two very different books but they both deal with mcs trying to navigate the treacherous waters of academia) or even Alexandra Chang's Days of Distraction or YZ Chin's Edge Case (both books are centred on asian american young women who work in white-male-dominated workplaces). The first few pages made me adjust said expectations as the author's offbeat style brought to mind authors like Hilary Leichter, Sayaka Murata, and even Weike Wang. There is a zany and very absurdist quality to the characters and scenarios populating Disorientation, one that gives the story a surreal sense of hyper reality. Oddly enough however, while the conversations, topics, and scenes that make up the story struck me for their realism (in that i could all too easily believe the microagressions experienced by ingrid both in the academic world and outside of it) the author overdoes it, so that much of what happens or is being said becomes ridiculous. The characters are cartoonish and caricatures of certain types of people. I can appreciate satire but there was no subtlety or nuance to these people. Don't get me wrong, the world in someways would be a lot easier to navigate if Bad People went around like they do in this novel. Every white man Ingrid encounters is a breathing, talking, walking red flag. While readers obvsiouly know this the author makes Ingrid an ingenue, someone who somehow, after years spent in the academic world in a faculty were discussions about gender equality, racism, post-colonialisms, etc., have been happening for sometime now. Of course, many universities (my one included) content themselves with lip-service, and rarely back up their words with actual changes. But the author chooses to make Ingrid wholly ignorant about these things. She can barely bring herself to say the word race or is unaware of how misogynistic and racist many members of her faculty are. Her ignorance struck me as very manufactured, and results in a childish point of view. Which may have worked better if the story had been narrated by Ingrid herself and not from 3rd pov. In this way I was reminded of a novel I actually hated, The World Cannot Give. Both authors have chosen to emphasise how naive their heroines are by making them sound like 10-year-olds from the 19th century (exclamations marks abound!). The humor was so forced and wavered between cheesy and cringe. The author even includes sections of writing that are lampooning certain media: from fanfiction to peer ed articles and translated novel. None of these struck me as clever or insightful. Her social commentary was both crude and simplistic, which is a pity as I appreciated the issues she tackles: racism within and outside of academia, cultural appropriation, whitewashing and yellowface, misogyny, representation, academic burnout, and these are only a few. But the way these are discussed and presented on the page rubbed me the wrong way. They were handled in a slapstick and facetious manner. I'm all for wry humor and scathing social commentaries but tonally Disorientation reminded me of those animated adult tv shows that really hold no appeal to me. Maybe this type of humor would translate better to the screen, I'm thinking of shows like Fleabag or Chewing Gum but on the page it just did niente for me. There was this running gag about how Ingrid can't bring herself to say gay, and I just did not find that particularly funny. I gave up when we get four pages of just lines from people arguing over the casting of a white actress to play a non-white role. All of these lines seemed straight out of twitter and there is a reason why I avoid social media. Believe me when I say that I really really really wanted to love this. There were passages that stood out to me, particularly those pertaining Ingrid's studies and dissertation. I was also angry on her behalf: the way the white people around treat her is infuriating (they gaslight her, making her into the 'problematic' one, minimise her experiences with racism and or manipulate her into studying something she's not passionate about because she's Asian and therefore must feel strongly about Chinese poetry). But these moments were I sympathised with her or found the story compelling were far and few between. The childish tone, outlandish and laboured dialogues, the simplistic yet exaggerated characters failed to reel me in.Maybe future me will be able to like this but at the moment I am giving up on this one.PS: 1) i recommend you read s from readers who actually finished this book2) i do not hate this book so please refrain from leaving comments that suggest as much3) my reading tastes are constantly changing so i can actually see myself giving this book another try sometime in the not so distant future....more",Notes are private!,0,36,0,not set,not set,"Jan 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58350424-disorientation

This is ironic given that We Had to Remove This Post is exactly the kind of wannabe-conversation-starter book that tackles topical & important issues. Maybe someone who knows very little about the gruelling realities of being a social media content moderator may find We Had to Remove This Post to be insightful in a way that I was sadly unable to. Having already come across articles and actual interviews about this topic, well, I was expecting something a bit more evocative and nuanced. But this novella was a fairly banal affair. Sure, the characters have arguments, or they are confronted with the worst that humanity has to offer (videos/images of extremely graphic nature), but, I just could not bring myself to care or even really believe in them, let alone what they were arguing about. I found the choice to have Kayleigh’s narration be a ‘confession’ of sorts to this guy, quite frankly gimmicky. Kayleigh gives us an idea of the kind of toxic work environment and emotionally draining workload, but she does so in broad strokes, so I never got a sense of who she was, let alone the kind of people her colleagues were. She becomes girlfriend with one of her colleagues, and their relationship is supposedly a central aspect of the narrative, but I found their dynamic and that final twisty reveal extremely derivative.Eventually, some of the content moderators begin endorsing the kind of material they should be taking down, and the narrative shows how easily misinformation is spread on social media, and how long exposure to certain spheres of the internet may eventually lead someone to 'convert' to that line of thinking/way of life.I couldn’t tell you much else about this book, given how little of an impression it made on me. This is very much a book that could have easily been an essay or an op-ed. The subject matters—social media, conspiracy theories, being a content moderator—take the centre stage, at the expense of a compelling storyline and rounded characters. It wasn't quite a I'm Making A Point type of book but it wasn't that far off either...very much book club material. The writing was okay, nothing to write home about. In the latter half of the book were some attempts at the kind of atmosphere you would find in a psychological thriller and they did not stick the landing.Anyway, YMMV so if you are interested in this book I recommend you read more positive s....more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,"May 31, 2022",Jun 2022,"Jan 28, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59523594-we-had-to-remove-this-post

DISCLAIMER: like with any other negative  that I write I feel the need to remind ppl that my opinions/thoughts/impressions of a book are entirely subjective (scioccante) and that if you are interested/curious about said book you should definitely check out more positive s.If an Egyptian Cannot Speak English implements many trendy literary devices. The two central characters remain unnamed and are referred to as the ‘boy/man from Shobrakheit’ and the ‘American girl’, there is a lack of quotations marks (although, although most dialogues appear in italics), and the narrative is structured in a supposedly experimental way so that when the pov switches between ‘him’ and ‘her’ we get a question that is somewhat related to the content of their chapter. As you can tell from my tone I was not a fan of these devices. They can work but here the sheer combination of all of them struck me as deeply affected and not even that innovative. The story, in broad strokes, could be summarized as: an alienated millennial Egyptian American woman goes to Cairo in an attempt at reinvention. Her shaved head and ‘western ways’ however make her feel like an outsider. She questions the way she is perceived in America, and how being in Cairo challenges her long-held identity and beliefs. We are never given too many specifics about her stay but the author does give us an impression of the ‘mood’ permeating her days in Cairo. Her navel-gazing does provide the occasional pearl of wisdom, but more often than not we are given the usual platitudes about belonging and its opposites. While the author does succeed in articulating her struggles with her dual heritage and her efforts and frustration to 'master' Arabic, I found her speculations to be, more often than not, all-flash and not substance. There are attempts at being edgy which come across as somewhat cringey and fairly prosaic.‘His’ chapters are far worse. The man is a talking, breathing, living red flag. His traumatic experiences and drug addiction do not make him a nuanced character. While I appreciated that ‘she’ understands that his upbringing informs his misogynistic beliefs, which leads him to objectify women and much worse, I could not understand why she remains with him. She tells us that the man in question is a multifaceted individual, but we never see these ‘facets’ on the page. His sections, if anything, only show us his ‘vices’. His exaggeratedly perverted point of view also struck me as not entirely believable. He often refers to ‘her’ lips as genital-like or sees her lips and wonders what color her labia will be. The man is incredibly possessive, sexist, offensive, you name it…this results in a rather one-note cartoonish character. Their chemistry wasn’t there and their arguments left me feeling quite unmoved. The ending of their ‘troubled’ relationship feels rather anticlimactic. Maybe if the author had spent less time pursuing metaphysical questions and dedicated more time to fleshing out the voices of her two central characters I would have ‘felt’ more but since we get a recap of a relationship more than the actual relationship itself, I just could not bring myself to care. The occasional vulgar language was not thought-provoking or subversive and the author’s experimental structure and style were fairly banal. It’s a pity as I found the subject matter interesting (languages, identity, dual-heritage, cultural dissonance, etc..). I did not care for the way the author discusses queerness. She allows (as far as i remember of course) a page to the matter. The girl says she’s queer, but the context in which she says this is weird as she seems to equate her shaved head and desire to move in queer spaces as being queer. I would have liked for the author to spend more page time on this subject. That then we have the ‘lesbian’ character in love with ‘her’ frustrated me somewhat as she only seems to be mentioned to emphasize ‘her’ desirability and to fuel ‘his’ jealousy. That ‘she’ only shows interest/pursues a relationship with toxic men was a bit tiring. Maybe if the author had spent more time articulating the motivations/feelings that lead ‘her’ to self-sabotage, like Zaina Arafat does in You Exist Too Much, maybe then I would have those relationships more realistic. There is also a mini-rant against cancel culture and its brevity does it a disservice as the author delivers a rather surface-level and rushed commentary on the dangers of this 'practice'. SPOILERSHere comes the cherry on the poorly baked cake. When the climax happens, we are taken out of the novel and into a writing workshop of some sort. The people there are discussing the novel, while the author remains silent. We learn that the novel is based on her experiences and the people who have also just finished it give their various opinions. Many of them are celebrating her achievement and giving her some truly fantastic feedback. The few dissident voices point out all of the book's flaws (the experimental style, the ending, the use of dual perspectives to tell what should have been just ‘her’ story) but it just so happens that said ppl are shitty so their critique is made moot. This supposedly self-aware wannabe meta chapter pissed me off. It seemed a preemptive attempt at rebutting any criticism, and in this way, it reminded me of a certain passage from Mona Awad’s Bunny, where we have awful people give some valid criticism to the narrator’s book which happens to be stylistically and thematically similar to Bunny. I am all for autofiction, and some of my favourite books are inspired by the author’s own experiences (the idiot, you exist too much, caucasia) but here I question the author’s choice to add the pov of the man she was in an abusive relationship with. The people in the workshop argue that this is an empowering move and that she has the right to tell her own story etc etc, and while I don’t necessarily disagree with that, I found the way she chooses to portray him and his inner monologue during ‘his’ chapters to be at best lazy, at worst, of poor taste. The florid metaphors that dominate his pov ultimately amount to a caricature of a man (“her water breasts slipping to the sides of her rib cage like raw eggs”). I couldn’t help but to unfavourably compare this to the jaw-dropping finale episode of I May Destroy You or the section in Wayétu Moore’s memoir where she convincingly captures her mother’s perspective. I dunno, I felt this last section was smugly self-congratulatory and for no reason tbh. Nothing really stood about this ‘novel’: the structure was uninspired, the prose was mannered, and the characters were flimsy at best. The issues and themes had potential, and as I said, the author does on occasion proffer some keenly observed passages on American and Egyptian social mores, on cultural and linguistic barriers, on occupying a female body in contemporary Cairo, on being 'othered', on the ‘desirability’ of whiteness (for example she notes how in america her mother has recently ‘reinvented’ herself as white), on the privileges that come with being America (by emphasizing the opportunities that are available to ‘her’ and not ‘him’), and on the dangers of self-victimization (with ‘him’ trying to gaslight ‘her’ for his emotionally abusive behaviour by painting himself as a victim).I’m sure other readers will be able to appreciate this more than I was. Sadly, I was not a fan of the overall tone of the novel nor did I like how the author portrays her story’s only lesbian character. Lastly, that meta chapter pissed me off. I didn’t think it was half as clever as it wanted to be, and it had the same energy as those successful authors who bemoan their book’s few negative s on Twitter.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀...more",Notes are private!,1,135,1,"Apr 12, 2022","Apr 14, 2022","Jan 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57693584-if-an-egyptian-cannot-speak-english

Chō, our protagonist, is a lesbian, something she keeps ‘hidden’ from her coworkers. While Chō does hang out with other queer women in lgbtq+ spaces, a traumatic experience causes her to be self-doubting, distrustful of others, and perpetually ashamed. When she opens up to a woman she’s sort of seeing, the latter brutally rejects her, not only blaming Chō for having been attacked but accusing her of having been deceitful (by not having spoken about this before). This leads Chō to spiral further into depression and suicidal ideation, her disconnection further exacerbated by an ‘accident’ that occurs at her workplace. Chō’s arc brought to mind that of Esther Greenwood in The Bell Jar, that is to say, things seem to just get worse and worse for her. As we read of her experiences working and living in Japan as a gay woman, we are also given insight into her teenage years in Taiwan, her slow recognition of her sexuality, her first encounter(s) with women, and that devasting night that resulted in an irrevocable self-disintegration. Chō blames herself for her attack, and not only does she sabotages her relationship with her girlfriend but pushes away one of the few people actively trying to help her. Chō’s uneasy relationship with her sexuality and the physical and emotional violence she experiences over the course of the narrative make for an unrelentingly depressing read. Throughout the course of her novel, the author links Chō's experiences to those of Qiu Miaojin and of her fictionalised counterpart, Lazi. Both tonally and thematically Solo Dance shares a lot of similarities with Miaojin’s Notes of a Crocodile: both works interrogate notions of normalcy and alterity by exploring the experiences of women whose sexuality does not conform to societal norms.Whereas Miaojin’s writing has a more cynical and satirical edge to it, Solo Dance is mostly just depressing. Immeasurably depressing. I knew going into it that the novel would not be a happy read, but, dio mio, for such a short read this book sure is brimming with queer pain & suffering. Because of this, I’m afraid I found Solo Dance to be a very one-note read. Sure, the realities it explores are sadly realistic, but, the storytelling has this flat quality to it that made it hard for me to become immersed in what I was reading. I can’t pinpoint whether it is the author’s style or the translation at fault, but while reading this I felt not so much transported into the story as merely…well, as if I was ‘just’ reading a text that didn’t quite elicit any strong responses beyond finding r*pe, lesbophobia, and suicidal ideation upsetting to read of. The story never reeled me in, which is a pity as the topics it explores are ones close to my heart (i am a lesbian and grew up in a very catholic and not particularly lgbtq+ friendly country).The dialogues were a mixture of clumsy and dry and some of Chō’s internal monologues struck me as trying too hard to mimic Lazi’s brand of nihilistic angst. Other times it just sounded off, stilted (""is the stigmatization of my sexuality the source of all my misfortune? This illogical question had plagued her for a long time"", ""her rational thoughts returned to life and began to talk to her"")…this read like something that has not been translated very well.The narrative also seemed to go way out of its way in order to make Chō suffer, and while I can sometimes buy into the type of story where one character experiences trauma after trauma (a little life), here I didn't. A lot of the interactions she has with others either struck me as unlikely or just plain unbelievable (from the words spoken by the woman who 'rejects' her to her encounter with another suicidal queer woman). If you are interested in reading this book I still recommend you give it a shot (just bear in mind ‘tis dreary affair)....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"May 25, 2022","May 27, 2022","Jan 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58987876-solo-dance

Seven Empty Houses even promised a thematic unity in its seven stories, as they all featured strange houses. Sadly I found the motif to be explored/utilized in a rather underwhelming way, and none of the stories really stood out to me. Sure, they are all characterized by that quiet ominous vibe that seems to be very much on brand for Schweblin, and I do think that some of the stories did present us with some effectively unsettling imagery, but the atmosphere was just lacking. There was an air of surreality, sure, but it ultimately lacked ‘oomph’ (they were very samey). Compared to the stories from Mouthful of Birds , the stories in this collection are kind of predictable. We have missing people, ghosts, other 'disturbances', a blurring of the real and the imagined…but these never add up to create a genuinely disturbing or otherwise memorable tale.

Like most collections, not all of its stories are created equal, as there are a couple, especially the shorter ones last, that are rather forgettable. The most effective stories were the ones that, although characterized by a whimsical & off-beat tone, contained surprising moments of introspection and incisiveness. The surreal elements within these narratives are rendered all the more peculiar by Meng Jin’s deadpan delivery. In ‘Philip Is Dead’, our narrator recollects her relationship with Philip, a solipsistic artist who would routinely use her for his art or during his creative process. Convinced of his brilliance, he consistently failed to see the narrator’s own potential and talent. In ‘Suffering’ Ling, a single mother begins an online exchange with Mr. Fu, an older man. As soon as the two attempts to meet IRL, someone begins poisoning Ling’s favorite cream. In ‘Self-Portrait with Ghost’ our narrator, a writer, finds herself ‘haunted’ by a childhood friend, who challenges her understanding of real and unreal. In ‘First Love’ a woman, employed by her friend to look after her child, falls for X. The two knew each other growing up and have once again found one another so their rekindling is bittersweet. While most of the previous stories are set in China, ‘Selena and Ruthie’ transports us to America where we follow Selena, a Chinese American girl with a promising voice. She becomes fast friends with Ruthie, who also sings in the chorus. Ruthie and her ‘cool’ mother offer an escape for Selena, who lives with her widowed father. As Selena becomes more engrossed in Ruthie, she begins to draw away from her only friend, Helen. This short story was one of my favorites, as it presents us with a compelling coming-of-age exploring sexuality, identity, and unrequited love. Many of these stories feature characters who are attempting to gain self-knowledge as they navigate their regrets, jealousies, and desires. Past mistakes and disappointments encroach on their present-day lives, sometimes in the guise of actual ghosts. Otherness, whether stemming from one's queerness and/or one's cultural background, is also a motif in this collection, as time and again we follow characters who are lonely & disconnected. Death, beauty, and creativity are other recurring themes, and Jin explores these with ingenuity. Meng Jin plays around with perspective and narrative modes but her language always retains a wry tone, which often enhances a story’s absurd elements and moments. I can definitely see this collection appealing to fans of authors like Kevin Wilson, Helen Oyeyemi, and Hiromi Kawakami....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 19, 2022","Dec 21, 2022","Jan 25, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59314720-self-portrait-with-ghost

Victoria Chang’s lyrical writing is not only aesthetically pleasing but it demonstrates admirable emotional intelligence, sensitivity, and insight. Not only I found myself highlighting every-other sentence, but I was completely spellbound by Chang’s voice and her ability to articulate with precise yet poetic language thoughts, feelings, and things that are, to me at least, so difficult to express/address. Enriching her reflections are her and her family’s experiences as well as the words of numerous writers, poets, and activists. The many quotes that make their way into Chang’s letters added further depth and nuance to her own remembrances and observations. Family mementoes, such as photos, letters, postcards, and certificates are interspersed throughout Dear Memory, and often appear in a fragmented way or combined with Chang’s own poetry, resulting in a collage of sorts.“Maybe all of our memories are tied to the memories of others.”Within these letters—addressed to Chang’s grandparents, parents, and children, as well as a teacher, her body, and memory itself—Chang interrogates grief, language and silence, generational trauma, cultural dissonance, displacement, invisibility, the notion of belonging, poetry & creativity, her Chinese American identity and her relationship to her family. Many of the episodes and histories that inform her reflections appear to us in fragments, so that we often ‘only’ gain brief and incomplete glimpses into her family’s and her own experiences. This works really well stylistically as the letters never feel bogged down by too many dates & facts. Within these letters, Chang’s voice possesses a beautiful lightness that in many ways belies her subject matter, as Chang discusses death, ageing, and trauma. She also talks about her experiences with racism, how many of the offensive words and gestures were very much normalized in American media and classic literature, as well as her eating disorder.“In some ways, being born Chinese in America means not being born at all”Regret & longing permeate most of these letters, as Chang is writing to people who are no longer alive or able to find meaning in her words. But Chang never spirals into hopelessness, and her lyrical language mitigates the sorrow of her and her family’s experiences. There is an open-endedness to her enquiries and recollections, one that invites the reader to contribute to the discussion, and I really appreciated that. “A writer lives in an infinity of days, time without end, ploughed under.”...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jun 08, 2022","Jun 11, 2022","Jan 18, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/58067926-dear-memory

Set in America and southern India these narratives explore the realities of leaving one’s homeland behind, generational and cultural rifts, loneliness and connectedness, family and belonging. The first story, “Malliga Homes,”, which was selected by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for an O. Henry Prize, strikes the perfect balance between bittersweet and unsentimental. The narrator is a widow living in a retirement community in Tamil Nadu. She tells us that like most of the residents of Malliga Homes, she is there because she has lost her child to 'Foreign'. Kamala, her daughter, is the one who pushed her into ‘joining’ this community. She lives in America with her husband and child and has not visited the narrator in years, and in fact, keeps postponing and delaying her next visit. The author captures the microcosm that is this community, where parent(s) seem to outdo each other when it comes to their children's achievements and how close they are to them. The unaffected style really gives the narrative a rich sense of realism and results in a subtle yet resonant short story. Throughout this collection the author mines similar themes: characters struggle to reconcile themselves to their past actions or are forced to reassess the past; they may long and yearn for the ‘what-ifs’ of the roads not taken; they flit between hope and regret; they desire a place and a people they can belong to. The more effective stories are the ones that focus on a particular period phase of a character’s life whereas the ones that did not quite succeed in reeling me in were the ones that attempted to cover too much of a character’s life. In these instances, the author isn’t quite able to achieve the rich in detail storytelling that she showcases in her more concise stories, where we glimpse a day or a week in a character’s life (rather than their whole life).Nevertheless Seeking Fortune Elsewhere is a promising debut and I really loved the author's understated yet incisive writing style.some quotes: “We were in that stage of life and motherhood that is filled with fatigue, unimaginable to the young, forgotten by the old, unknown altogether to those without children.”“The offspring of the rich are rich, and they do not seek their fortunes elsewhere.” “The time between childhood and old age passes quickly, leaving you feeling like your entire life is a double feature with no intermission.” “What our children do, how much money they make, whether our grandchildren are bright or mediocre—all of this matters. It is a tragedy to have a brilliant child and a dunce of a grandchild.” “[F]or all the space and privacy that America offers, it is a country that longs for life. You go for a drive and the road is endless.”“He remembered the loneliness, the immense sorrow that came from going months without uttering a word of Tamil. There was no way for him to express certain thoughts, certain feelings, in the English language.”...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Apr 18, 2022","Apr 19, 2022","Jan 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57427936-seeking-fortune-elsewhere

Set in contemporary-ish Morocco these stories explore fraught gender and family dynamicsBlood Fest collects all of Malika Moustadraf’s short fiction. Set in contemporary-ish Morocco these stories explore fraught gender and family dynamics, highlighting the insidious nature of misogyny. Within these short stories, women are forced to marry men they don’t love, they are abused or mistreated by male relatives and struggle to retain freedom and independence in a patriarchal society. Many of these stories share a rather bleak outlook as they paint a depressingly realistic picture of domestic abuse and sexism. The men populating these stories are angry, confused, and guilty. They lash out against each other and the women around them. The results are not pretty and there are many upsetting scenes. We also read of how women themselves became perpetrators of misogyny, as mothers go on to police their daughters’ bodies, shaming them for the way they behave in a way they don’t/wouldn’t with their sons. There are also some lgbtq+ themes but these are only touched slightly and the author mostly interrogates heteronormative relationships. While I appreciated the issues Moustadraf explores within these narratives I found the stories unsatisfying. They have very choppy endings and are too short, lasting a few pages or so. The characters become devices through which the author can address and or exemplify a certain issue, and they often failed to convince me as ‘real’ people. There isn’t time dedicated to developing them and the stories consequently suffer from this lack. Also, I would like more variety in tone, subject, and style as many of these stories ended up blurring into each other. Still, I would not dissuade others from reading it and although it didn't really work for me I found certain aspects of these stories to be thoughtprovoking. Additionally, despite its heavy topics this collection makes for a very quick read.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Feb 13, 2022","Feb 15, 2022","Jan 18, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58516766-blood-feast

These chapters, which often barely last a page, capture an instant or impression experienced by our Vietnamese-Canadian narrator. The feelings, thoughts, images, and anecdotes, that appear on these pages have a snapshot quality, both because the author is able to capture these in a concise yet hauntingly evocative prose. The narrator is now married with two children, one of whom is neurodivergent. While we do gain an understanding of her life in the present, the narrative is mainly preoccupied with her past. The narrator’s recollections of her ‘disrupted’ childhood are unsparingly unsentimental. She remembers her experiences at a refugee camp in Malaysia, the difficulties of trying to assimilate into a culture that sees you as ‘other’, her early years in Vietnam, her beloved Uncle Two, while also reflecting on the limitations of language and of memory, on history and alternate histories, on trauma, and on cultural dissonance.  The vignettes her reminiscences present to us have a fragmented quality, so that much of the narrator’s personal life and past remains shrouded in ambiguity. There is also an aloofness to her narration that made much of what she was recounting feel remote, intentionally so I believe. By distancing herself from her past the narrator is able to approach it with, curiously enough, far more clarity. There is a neutrality to her inner monologue that could easily lead one to believe that she too is like us merely a ‘witness’ as opposed to the person to who these things have happened to. I liked the stark imagery, the narrator’s cool tone, and the ideas and issues weaving her ‘retrospective’.If you like proses that are so sharp you are liable to cut yourself or have a preference for non-linear narratives composed of a character’s past and present impressions (be it autofiction such as All Men Want to Know and On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, or literary fiction like as Gbost Forest) you should definitely add Ru to your tbr pile. While I understood that many of the things the narrator divulges to ‘us’ are meant to elicit feelings of discomfort and unease, the way she sees her son’s autism gave me pause (she is “waging war against autism, even if I know already that it’s invincible”). While I understand too well that many countries still have a negative view of autism here it struck me that the narrator was creating an unfortunate parallel between her son’s autism and the Vietnam war that rubbed me the wrong way. I’m sure other readers will not be as ‘bothered’ by this but to be perfectly honest this aspect of the narrative detracted from my overall reading experience. Nevertheless I will definitely read more by Thúy....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Apr 09, 2022","Apr 11, 2022","Jan 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12256885-ru

Once again Seanan McGuire sticks to the same formula: we have a focus on aesthetics, a fairy-talesque atmosphere, and a story revolving around a girl who is either lonely or made to feel different or insecure about something. Like its predecessors, Where the Drowned Girls Go critiques individuals and institutions that seek to impose conformity on those they deem ‘different’. Here the good/bad binary feels particularly lacking in nuance, and I miss the ambivalence that permeated the first few instalments. Still, McGuire’s prose has is always a delight to read. While here she goes a bit heavy-handed on metaphors involving smiles (we have, to name a few, wan smiles, bland smiles, terrible smiles, terrifying smiles...the list goes on), her hypnotic style is rich with tantalising descriptions and lush imagery. I also appreciate her darker take on fairy tales and magical worlds. As we can see, those who go through magical doors do not always make it ‘home’ unscathed. They carry physical and psychological scars from their time there and struggle to integrate themselves back into 'reality'. In Where the Drowned Girls Go we are reunited with Cora who we previously followed on a rescue mission to Confection in Beneath the Sugar Sky. She’s haunted by the Trenches, the world she fell into, and fears that she will once more be transported to that world. She believes that at Eleanor’s school she won’t be able to resist the Trenches so she decides to enrol at the Whitethorn Institute. But, she soon discovers, Whitethorn is not kind to ‘wayward children' like her. The school instils fear in its students, punishing those who mention their experiences in other worlds and rewarding those who come to view magical doors as the product of a delusion. Cora is bullied by some of her roommates who make fun of her appearance and such. Eventually, Sumi comes to her rescue and Cora has to decide whether she does want to leave Whitethorn. There are a few moral lessons about friendship, not being mean, or not letting others dictate who you are.While there were fantastical elements woven into the story and setting this volume lacked that magic spark that made the first few books into such spellbinding reads. I also found Cora to be a meh protagonist. Her defining characteristic seemed to be her body, which wasn’t great. Sumi was a welcome addition to the cast of characters as I found the girls at Whitethorn to be rather samey (which perhaps was intentional). I don’t entirely get why Cora got another book. She was the main character in Beneath the Sugar Sky. Her insecurities etc. were already explored in that book…and this feels like an unnecessary continuation to her arc. Still, I love the aesthetics of this series and the wicked/virtue & nonsense/logical world compass.Hopefully, the next volume will be about Kade......more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 17, 2022","Jan 17, 2022","Jan 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693537-where-the-drowned-girls-go

Ladee Hubbard hones in on family dynamics and I appreciated all the different familial relationships we get to see in these stories: from the classic ones focusing on the bond between parents and their children to ones between grandparents and grandkids. Many of these stories delve examine the criminal justice system, focusing in particular on the criminalization of young Black men.Through different perspectives and contexts, these narratives explore systemic discrimination of minorities, the realities of those who are affected by social inequality, and the shifting landscape of American politics. In many of these stories, characters are faced with choices that blur the line between right and wrong, good and bad. I appreciated the author’s nuanced approach to difficult topics and her empathetic portrayal of characters who embody both flaws and virtues. Some stories stood out more than the rest and overall, although I found this a compelling read, as collections of short stories go this feels rather run-of-the-mill. The storytelling is solid but I can't say that I remember specifics about the characters and or their arcs. Still, I am aware that I am quite picky when it comes to short story collections so this is by no means a negative . Also, I will definitely be checking out more by Hubbard, perhaps I will find her full-length work to be more memorable....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Mar 15, 2022","Mar 17, 2022","Jan 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58341750-the-last-suspicious-holdout

It’s like my own body has become foreign to me.” The premise for Diary of a Void promised a ‘surreal and wryly humorous cultural critique’ and I am afraid that while the commentary within this novel is fairly on point, it was by no means ‘thrillingly subversive’. Sadly, I found the execution to be lacklustre and part of me thinks that I might have found it more effective if this premise had not been stretched out beyond its capacity. Sure, Diary of a Void is a slim novel but I still found myself bored by the writing and the direction of the story. If this premise had been contained within the scope of a smaller medium, such as a short story, I probably would have felt more enthusiastic about it.“As I wrote in my notebook, I wondered: How many other imaginary children were there in the world? And where were they now? What were they doing? I hoped they were leading happy lives.”Despite its absurd premise, the storyline is presented in a cohesive manner and the tone of Shibata’s narration remains for the most part casually unadulterated. This last thing is what initially drew me in. Shibata’s blasé attitude towards her ‘fake’ pregnancy. In the office where she works, she is routinely asked and bullied into cleaning up after everyone else or preparing drinks/food for meetings or whatnot purely because she is a woman. To get her lazy and sexist coworkers and superiors off her back, Shibata one day announces that she can’t clean up because she is pregnant and the smell makes her sick. Shibata then proceeds to act as a pregnant person is expected to in contemporary Japan, for example, she gets a maternity badge on her bag (speaking of which i came across an article that mentions a survey in 2016 showing that over 40% of pregnant ppl choose ""not wear the badge at all or not to wear it most of the time in Japan"" and ""roughly 10% of [those who wore them] experienced some sort of harassment""...which is f*cking depressing), starts using a diary app (hence the title), joins a prenatal aerobics class, and uses the time she would have been working over-time to binge-watch films & series on Amazon Prime, and chooses a name for her child (now this last thing funny). There are a few recurring characters, most notably a male colleague of Shibata who becomes far too involved in her pregnancy and proffers unsolicited advice to her all the time. The weeks and months go by and Shibata uses a towel for a baby bump (you can buy fake ones only but if i recall correctly shibata could not procure one).There was nothing that I actively disliked about this novel, I was just thoroughly bored and rather underwhelmed. Shibata’s voice was monotone and although I usually liked deadpan & listless narrators, hers just didn’t win me over. I also really love slice-of-live stories, detailing the menial activities and generic conversations most people have day-in-day-out, and novels heavy on the navel-gazing, after all, I am a huge fan of Elif Batuman's The Idiot and Either/Or, but Shibata’s life just didn’t interest me, which is curious given that she is faking a pregnancy. I was hoping that the latter half of the story would be more rewarding or bizarre or anything really but it keeps chugging alone at the same pace. I wish the author could have amped up certain absurdist elements in this story, I think this could have been a far campier and strange tale (the premise had potential...it could have given us Lars and the Real Girl by way of Woman Running in the Mountains & Mieko Kawakami with sprinkles of Kevin Wilson, Helen Oyeyemi, and Hiromi Kawakami...maybe even a dash of Han Kang?). Look, I wasn't expecting the pregnancy element to be as out there as Julia Ducournau's Titane but...it could have been presented in a less vanilla way or at least not have given us such a bathetic 'resolution'. The social commentary highlights the way women are still pigeonholed (as wives/mothers, or as having to choose between family and a career, being seen as inherently domestic), and how some people idolize pregnancy (the good ol’ Madonna/Whore dichotomy i guess). I guess I wish that the story had explored in more depth the realities of being a single parent in a fairly conservative country that still stigmatizes those who do not uphold so-called traditional family values (bleargh).Anyway, I just didn't get into this book but I can't say I actively disliked it either. It was very much a meh reading experience for me. If you are interested in this novel I recommend you check out some more positive s (there are some very well-written ones out there too!)....more",Notes are private!,1,105,1,"Jul 08, 2022","Jul 09, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59629744-diary-of-a-void

Some people said that there was power in her blood, a gift from her ancestors that she could endure.”  Megan Giddings’s sophomore novel is highly evocative of those The Handmaid’s Tale inspired dystopias where readers are presented with a near-future where women—sometimes men—live in authoritarian societies where they have limited rights and freedoms and are under near-constant surveillance. When Women Could Fly does offer a more topical take on this genre, especially with what is going on with abortion laws in the States, and although the reality it presents us with is embedded with fantastical elements, reading this story still sent a chill up my spine. While this has been also compared to Shirley Jackson and Octavia Butler, personally I don’t quite see it. If anything Giddings’ novel was highly reminiscent of those early 2010s YA, where the female protagonists are often forced into marriage (this is not meant as a 'snub' as i remember being quite into them). Expect that Giddings’ more mature tone allows for more in-depth conversations about gender and racial discrimination, female bodily autonomy, reproductive justice, surveillance and privacy, and the ye old fear of that which is deemed ‘other’. The imagery and aesthetics did make me think of several horror films produced by A24, and part of me believes that maybe this story would translate better to the screen. That is not to say that it was badly written, far from it. However, several lacunae in the world-building really took me out. Additionally, the pacing was a bit all over the place, particularly in the latter half of the novel.In this America witch trials are still a thing. To prevent women from becoming witches, the government closely monitors them, watching for any signs of ‘witchy’ stuff. While false allegations are punishable by law, most girls and women live in fear of being accused. The government also requires women over 30 to either marry (a man) or lose almost all forms of autonomy (such as having a job). Some women do choose this option, and are registered as witches, and (if memory serves) under house arrest. Women of color, Black women in particular, are even more heavily scrutinized, especially those like Josephine Thomas, whose own mother is believed to have been a witch after she ‘vanished’ overnight. Josephine, now 28, is ready to accept that her mother will never come back. Josephine has come to resent her mother: for leaving, for leaving without her, and for making her ‘suspect’ in the eyes of the government. With her 30th birthday approaching Jo finds herself forced to consider her options. She doesn’t want to give up her job at the museum, where they are actually somehow allowed to have an exhibition by a verified witch. She is seeing this guy who she kind of likes but feels frustrated by the societal pressure to marry him. Her father, a white guy, is not particularly close to her and he offered little support when Jo was under investigation after the disappearance of his wife.The narrative opens with Jo having decided to officialize her mother’s death. Her mother’s will includes some specific directions she is to follow in order to then access her inheritance. Jo follows said directions and finds herself coming into contact with a reality that is very different from her own one.I really liked the writing style, and the ambivalence permeating much of Jo’s narration, in particular in moments when she thinks of her mother or of the way women are treated. I also liked some of the vaguer aspects of this ‘reality’, and I was briefly at times reminded of Kazuo Ishiguro’s ‘what-ifs’, where he very much focuses on a group of people and is able to capture their experiences without delving into many details about their world and the society they live.Alas, here the author is inconsistently vague. We will learn that other countries have possibly banned witch-hunts/the monitoring of women but that’s more or less it when it comes to the outside world (“I cry sometimes thinking about how we’re the only developed country to let this still happen.”). Why don’t more women leave the States? Are they banned from doing so? The story may mention this but so briefly that it didn’t really sink in. In addition, we have a registered witch being allowed to have her art in a gallery… which threw me off a little. Why would the government allow her to do that? Her installations and pieces are fairly unsettling and very ‘witchy’...wouldn’t they worry about this being some sort of witch propaganda? The author is also quite inconsistent when it comes to lgbtq+ visibility and rights. In this extremely authoritarian and deeply conformist country, people identify as lgbtq+...Jo included. She’s bi and ‘out’. Her father isn’t keen on it and she knows she will be unable to marry anyone other than a man but I still wasn’t sure of the kind of rights lgbtq+ ppl had. Jo refers to herself as cis and acknowledges that the whole “women=maybe witch” thing her country has going on excludes ppl who identify outside of the gender binary…but we don’t really go into much depth with that other than once Jo mentions that gay men are sometimes suspected of being witches…it also seemed weird that such an oppressive and reactionary government would ‘allow’ ppl to openly identify as lgbtq+. Still, we do get Angie’s perspective on this, who is using a matchmaker who specializes in arranging safe marriages for gay women (for example by choosing gay men as their spouses).Also, how are YA books with dragons in them being allowed to be published in a country where magic is considered a real threat? Surely the fantasy genre would be banned?! minor spoilers:When we reach the halfway point, the story offers us insight into a community that is very different from the one Jo grew up in and once again I found myself having more questions, and the answers we do get didn’t entirely satisfy. The narrative suggests that they have been undetected due to ‘magic’ but I didn’t quite buy that. It also seemed weird that they would not reach out to more ppl. Jo’s motivations in the latter half of the novel were not entirely believable and the ending felt kind of rushed.Still, despite my issues with the world-building (one too many holes, inconsistent) and plot (which is slow, fast, slow, fast, and with a few situations that clearly just exist to further the plot, even when they are not entirely convincing) I loved the author’s writing style, the parallelism between Jo’s world and our world (“Sometimes, people say Isn’t it lucky to be a woman now?”...kid you not a male colleague of mine said something along these lines and followed with “it is men who have it hard nowadays”), the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for ‘otherness’, the soft magic, the aesthetics, and the friendship between Jo and Angie.The author does pose some interesting questions about the ‘cost’ of personal freedom, and throughout the narrative she interrogates themes such as love, equality, guilt, and forgiveness. Additionally, I appreciated the nuanced mother-daughter relationship. Part of me was annoyed at the romance subplot, which in my opinion takes away from ‘page time’ from non-romantic relationships. The writing has this hypnotic, remote yet sharp, quality to it that brought to mind Lucy by Jamaica Kincaid. Giddings is certainly able to articulate thorny and ambiguous thoughts and feelings with clarity, however, she also allows Jo to retain a certain air of impenetrability. Jo's introspections were compelling and I was thoroughly spellbound by her voice. Like I said, the world-building and plot did get in the way of my totally loving this but to be honest I can see myself re-reading this and not minding as much. Some quotes:“But there was always an objectiveness that insulated me, always allowed me to stay cool and defuse the situation. It was better for everyone if I remained at least six inches distant. A space far enough for me to evaluate, assess, and then fix things.” “But all the magic in these museums is the magic of the dead—corpses and curses and in its own way reminding women that if there is anything inexplicable in the world, it is dangerous.”“I had expected a tightening as I grew older; I would like what I liked and that was the essence of who I was. But my personality gets easily seeped now with new details. I read something new, I watch something new, I eat something new and the world feels again like a place where I want to stay.”“Magic was everywhere. It felt like when you’re young and with your best friend in the world and you look at each other and feel as if you’re both the most attractive, interesting, fun people in the entire room. There’s nothing embarrassing about this confidence because it’s the truest thing and it lets you both be your best selves for hours.”“For years, my mother had been a wound I could never fully stitch, one that when I was being honest with myself, I didn’t ever want to scab over, fade, disappear.”“[My] mother’s absence had been—I was sure—the source of some of the biggest, ugliest parts of me. And because of all that empty space around her, because of time, because of sadness, I had idealized her, too.”“What is it about love? Why does it make everything seem so important when most people give their love so carelessly to people, to pets, to objects that will never love them back?”“What was it like to be loved in a way that felt immutable? To not be told I was loved, but to feel it, to see it most of the time?”...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Apr 24, 2022","Apr 27, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55851367-the-women-could-fly

Of feeling alone and excluded.”While I can’t quite satisfyingly articulate or express why I find such comfort in Jhumpa Lahiri's writing, I can certainly make a stab at it. In many ways, Translating Myself and Others reads like a companion piece to In Other Words, as Lahiri once again reflects on her relationship to languages, in particular, English and Italian, and the precarious act of literary translation. These essays are profoundly insightful, eloquently written, and erudite without being inaccessible. Lahiri’s illuminating meditations on writing and translating draw from her own personal experiences and from those of others, as many of the essays included in this collection expand on the works, ideas, and experiences of other authors and historical figures, many of whom Italian. Lahiri’s interrogation of their work, which hones in on their multilingualism and their own efforts with translation and self-translation, added an intratextual dimension to her essays, one that enriched her overall analysis. In many of these essays, Lahiri focuses in particular on her relationship to the Italian language: from the way people have questioned her choice to study this language and the validity of her written Italian, to the feelings brought about by writing in and speaking Italian.  In her speculations and contemplations on languages (who do they belong to? and if they do, to whom and why?), writing & translation Lahiri often refers to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, in particular the myth of Echo and Narcissus. In examining the acts of translation and self-translation Lahiri utilizes many apt metaphors, viewing translating as a ‘door’, a form of ‘blindness’ (this one is a bit unahappy comparison to make), a ‘graft’, a ‘traversing’, an act of negotiation and metamorphoses. I also appreciated her contemplations on the function played by writers and translators, the differences and similarities between these two roles and the way their work is perceived or not.Translating Myself and Others  presents its readers with a panoply of thoughtful and thought-provoking essays. Lahiri’s writing struck me for its clarity and gracefulness and I look forward to revisiting the essays here collected in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"May 19, 2022","May 22, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59149236-translating-myself-and-others

Its biggest ‘sin’ is that it tries to be the dark academia equivalent of Not Like Other Girls. For all its attempts at being ‘not like’ other dark academia books, The World Cannot Give was one of the most generic books I’ve read in a very long time. From its poorly rendered setting to its wafer-thin characters, The World Cannot Give reads like a been-there-done-that boarding school novel. This is the kind of novel that thinks it is a lot smarter than it is (in reality it is as intellectually deep as a puddle, of the shallow variety). For all its attempts at intertextuality and self-awareness (we have few throwaway lines on the dangers of romanticizing elitist institutions and idealizing the past and historical figures), it has nothing substantial or new to say. The author's writing style and the tone of her narrative brought to mind two novels that I am not fond of, The Silent Patient and An Anonymous Girl. If you liked them chances are you will have a more positive reading experience with The World Cannot Give than I was. If you like cheesy shows such as Riverdale or self-dramatizing books such as Plain Bad Heroines ,Belladonna, A Lesson in Vengeance, Vicious Little Darlings, Good Girls Lie (where characters are prone to angsty theatricals) you may be able to actually enjoy The World Cannot Give. As I warned above, this  is going to be harsh so if you aren’t keen on reading negative s you should really give this  a miss.minor spoilers belowSTORY/PLOTContrary to what the blurb says, The World Cannot Give is no ‘The Girls meets Fight Club’. Nor is it a satisfying ‘coming-of-age novel about queer desire, religious zealotry, and the hunger for transcendence. And the only ‘shocking’ thing about it is that it is shockingly bad. On the lines of, how was this even published? The first page is misleadingly promising. I liked the opening line and that whole first paragraph. Alas, with each new page, my high hopes dwindled.Laura is on her way to St. Dunstan’s Academy in Maine. She’s ecstatic about attending this school because she hero-worships Sebastian Webster who used to go there in the 1930s. Angsty Webster wrote this book about the “sclerotic modern world” and the “shipwreck of the soul” and goes on and on about wanting to be “World-Historical”. Webster died at 19 fighting for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Anyway, our sensitive Laura is enthralled by his writings and his fake-deep ideas so of course, she wants to study where he did. She gets to St. Dunstan goes to her room and meets two girls who from this scene onwards will not change. That is, this one scene establishes their one-note characters. There is Freddy who is a tertiary sort of character who just glares, snorts, scowls, and grimaces because that’s the kind of mean-ish one-dimensional sidekick she is. Then there is Bonnie who is all about her followers and using her boarding school as a prop for her dark academia inspired videos & photos. Laura eventually goes to the school’s chapel (Webster is buried there and there is a statue in his honour in that area) and she hears the choir. Her spirit is so moved by what she experiences at the chapel that she feels lifted to a higher plane of existence or something. But wait, the choir is rudely interrupted by a girl with a shaved head who is a queer feminist who is just like so done with the institution and wants to abolish mandatory church attendance. Laura, our innocent, is shooketh by her actions and somehow, despite her wishy-washy personality, ingratiates herself with the choir president, Virginia. We learn virtually nothing more about the school, nor do we get any real insight into how Laura’s classes are going, what she’s studying, her teachers, their methods…Laura joins the choir and what follows is a lot of scenes that are just filler leading up to the real ‘conflict’. The choir, this ‘clique’, did not make for interesting people, consequently, I was bored by the limited banter that didn’t reveal anything significant about them or their surroundings. Laura is Virginia’s lapdog, so she starts emulating whatever Virginia does (comparing herself to other literary sidekicks), Virginia spends her time ranting about the ‘sclerotic world’, her aversion towards matters of the flesh, and bemoaning the ye olden days and is mad that she has to be in the proximity of so many sinners. She also doesn’t want Brad, who is also in the choir, and Bonnie to be together. Brad is loyal to Virginia so he is conflicted. Bonnie is in love with Brad for reasons. And why the hell not at this point. The only ones in the choir who came across as devoted to Webster, his ‘insights’ into the ills of the modern world, were Laura and Virginia. But they just have the same conversations about this guy. They don’t expand on his views, they merely reiterate the term ‘World-Historical’ and his other catchphrases. Anyway, time goes by and eventually things come to head when Bonnie decides to encroach on Virginia’s territory (the chapel) as retaliation for her interfering in her love life (instead of taking issue with Brad…ugh). Isobel, the queer feminist, comes into play but her presence is very much kept off-page. Virginia becomes increasingly fanatical and decides to go all Old Testament God on the people who have betrayed her or revealed that they are not 'virtuous' (quelle surprise...).TONE/WRITINGYou see the cover, you read the blurb, you come across someone comparing this to Donna Tartt (comparing book such as this to the secret history should be made into a punishable offence…ahem, i’m jesting of course), you think, this is going to be DEEP and possibly even intellectual and emotionally stimulating. You are, of course, dead wrong. This book reads like a spoof. But not a fully committed one. It actually reminded me of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey. There the narrative makes fun of the heroine for wanting to be in a Gothic novel and seeing the world through Gothic-tinted lenses and overdramatising everything. This is exactly it. Except, it also takes itself seriously…kind of? The writing and tone try to mirror the way Laura sees the world. She yearns for Webster and, like Virginia, finds the present-day intolerable. So the writing uses this exaggerated and self-dramatizing language reminiscent of historical novels. Some of these are actually decent. But then we get a lot of short sentences and exclamations marks. This kind of style can work. For instance, in Dorothy Strachey’s Olivia, which actually happens to be a far superior boarding-school book exploring queer desire. The language there is very high-flown but it worked because Strachey could write some truly beautiful and playful passages.Here the writing verges on the ridiculous and more often than not it comes across as just plain bad. We had clumsy, inharmonious, and even cheesy sentences: “Barry Ng blushes at this. Virginia glares at him. Brad sighs a long and heavy sigh.”; “She looks from Brad to Bonnie and back again. Brad sighs a long and exhausted sigh.”; “Shame floods Laura’s face; she curdles it into fury.” (lol); ““One choir. One family.” Her smile twitches.” (twitching smiles? what is this? fanfic i wrote at 15?); “Her smile glints.” (ugh); “Virginia didn’t know. Virginia couldn’t have known. Virginia would never. Virginia always would. Of course, of course, Virginia would.”; “Isobel is wrong, Laura tells herself. Isobel has to be wrong. Isobel’s just jealous; Isobel has no sense of transcendence;”. And these are just a few examples…the writing & tone did nothing for me. Very few writers can make third person present tense work and Burton isn't one of them I'm afraid...I struggled to take it seriously and even if it was intentionally trying to be satirical, well, even then I would have found it ridiculous. THEMES/ ‘IDEOLOGY’Like I said above this book tries to be different from other boarding schools/dark academia books by referencing the rise in popularity that dark academia aesthetics & media have had in the last few years…but that doesn’t result automatically in a thought-provoking commentary on the dangers of romanticism elitist institutions such as universities and or private schools. One of the two only poc characters in the story has a few lines that highlight how institutions like St. Duncan are built on inequality and that we should be more critical about those Old White Men who likely committed Bad Things and should not be therefore uncritically revered. Yeah fair enough. But that’s it. Laura and Virginia spend the whole bloody book going on about the ‘sclerotic modern world’ and are contemptuous of anyone who isn’t in awe of Webster. They believe in God..sort of? For all their talk about sins and transcendence, I was not at all convinced that they even had a strong relationship to their faith. Virginia wants to be baptized, but her decision to do so is made sus because she’s portrayed as sort of unhinged so she truly isn’t ‘genuine’. Laura instead is more mellow about her faith so I don’t understand why she would Virginia’s fanatical rants to be of any appeal. You do you babe and all that but come on…Virginia wasn’t even a charismatic orator. Their ideology actually brought to mind the kids from The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea. Like those lil creeps, Virginia and Laura find the modern world to be disgusting. They particularly don’t get why people are obsessed with sex. They merely want to transcend their bodies and reach a higher, more enlightened plane of existence. I think the author was trying to do her own version of “Beauty is terror” but yikes. It just came across as stagy. Additionally, I found it annoying that characters who could have been on the aroace spectrum are actually just ‘repressed’. Anyway, this book had nothing interesting to say about faith, romanticizing the past, or the dangers of idealizing the ones you care for.The story towards the end takes a weird route in that it becomes all about how boys/men exploit women and betray their trusts by sharing explicit photos and videos of their gf or sex partners with their male friends and this plotline worsened the already existing disconnect between the tone and the content of the book.CHARACTERS/RELATIONSHIPS I understand that people are incongruent but these characters did not make bloody sense. They were extremely one-note and then for plot-reasons they would do something really random. Laura is boring and annoying. I can cope with characters who are obsessed with a friend or who are introverted or even naive. But Laura was just embarrassing. Her devotion to Virginia lacked substance. Their dynamic was uneventful. Bonnie was depicted in a purposely grating way and grated my nerves. Isobel was gay and a feminist and stands against the bullshit Virginia and Laura believe in. That’s it. The boys are either milquetoast assholes who don’t see the problem in sharing nudes or doing whatever Virginia says because why not. There is this one guy in the choir who exists just to say ‘that’s cringe’ or ‘that’s completely cringe’.Virginia was the worst offender. She had no redeeming qualities but we were meant to feel some degree of sympathy towards her. Come on. She wasn’t a convincing or compelling character. I didn't find her an intriguing or cryptic mystery. She was nasty and I didn’t like that everything she does or says is basically chalked up to her being a total religious zealot. All of her reactions are so extreme as to make her into a caricature more than a person. I didn’t like the way her eating disorder was portrayed as it The obsession and desire promised by the blurb were just not really there. I mean, yeah, the girl was obsessed but there was something perfunctory about it. The sapphic yearning I was hoping to find in these pages was largely absent. There is a f/f couple, but they had barely any scenes and they had 0 chemistry whatsoever. They came across as friends or sisters even. Then we are meant to believe that someone like Isobel would fall for Virginia because they shared a past? Surely Isobel, who is supposedly clever, would be a bit sus about Virginia's sudden change of heart. Also, shouldn't Virginia's decline in her physical and mental health be a red flag of sorts? Shouldn't Isobel have shown more concern over Virginia's state of mind?SETTING0 sense of place. There are barely any descriptions of the school and very few passages detailing the nearby landscapes. The novel takes place nowadays I guess but there were barely any contemporary references. This could have worked if then we didn’t have a plotline involving Bonnie’s online following, sexting, or even certain terms (such as cringe) being used. It just took me out of the story as the majority of the narrative and dialogues were trying to conjure an ‘old’ timeless vibe. I think if the novel had had a historical setting it would have actually worked in its favour. Its modern social commentary after all is very half-arsed and had a vague tokenistic vibe to it (isobel existing just to oppose the establishment etc.). I’m going to recommend a few books that in my opinion do what this book tries to do a lot better: Frost in May (coming of age, all-girl school, Catholicism), Abigail (coming of age, WWII Hungary, all-girl school, fraught friendships), Catherine House (Gothic, college, creepy), Old School (all-boys schools, jealousy, ambition, privilege, self-knowledge), Sweet Days of Discipline (queer desire, obsession, order vs. chaos, all-girl school), The Inseparables (all-girl school, obsession, queer desire, Catholicism),These Violent Delights (college, obsession, toxic relationships, queer desire), Olivia (all-girl school, France 1890s, unrequited love, queer desire), A Great and Terrible Beauty (fantasy, fraught friendships, all-girl schools, f/f side), Passing (jealousy, race, queer repressed desire), Ninth House (dark academia, Yale, urban fantasy, tackles privilege, corruption, misogyny), The Wicker King (dark academia vibes, queer desire, obsession, toxic relationships).Maybe if this novel had gone truly committed to being a parody, and upped the camp factor, maybe then I would have found it a little bit amusing. But it didn't so nope, this novel did not work for me at all. The story was stupid, the characters were either bland or neurotic (in a really exaggerated, possibly problematic, way), the themes were poorly developed and relied on the usage of a few certain key terms (without delving into what this term truly means), the sapphic element was largely absent...you get the gist by now. I actually wish I'd dnfed but I hoped that it would improve along the way. When will I learn the lesson?

The author captures how all-consuming first love can be through the unnamed narrator’s non-linear recollection of her relationship with another girl who she addresses as ‘you’. We know their relationship ends in flame, but what has caused them to play with fire? There is an attempt at a countdown and a timeline, so each ‘chapter/section’ begins with x days before the fire. While giving specific dates in non-linear narratives can work, such as in the case of A Prayer for Travelers by Ruchika Tomar(which actually has some similar vibes to this book so if you liked that one definitely check this one out), here it felt superfluous as the narrator doesn’t stick to the memories/experiences from that specific day. Anyway, we learn that these two girls share a really intense bond, one that causes some adults around them to worry they may be too ‘close’. They feel rebellious and seem to find their daily existence untenable. While their friendship does evolve into a more sexual relationship, ‘you’, and to a certain degree the narrator as well, seem unwilling to label themselves. Their love and affection for each other is clear, and the narrative zeroes in on the meaningful moments that make up their ‘history’ together. While I appreciated that the author did not paint either as the ‘bad’ influence, as they are both shown to feel ‘other’, different from their peers, unable and or unwilling to fit in at school and pretend at ‘normal’, here well, it just made their eventual conflict kind of forced. Also, their whole ‘we are so toxic for each other but’ thing they had going on reminded me a bit of new adult books such as the one penned by Anna Todd and Colleen Hoover, and I am not keen on those. While I could believe in the narrator’s internal monologue brimming with flowery and grandiose metaphors about love, girlhood, and ‘you’, there were instances where she describes her relationship with ‘you’ to others and she uses such lyrical yet the overwrought language that I had a hard time believing in those scenes. Even if she were a poet it seemed unlikely that she would just come out with such ott allegories on the spot. Maybe fans of allegedly ‘realistic’ teen shows like Euphoria won’t mind but I did. Anyway, while I did find this to be the kind of book that prioritizes language over character/story (the two girls have no distinct personalities, just vibes), I would be lying if I said I didn’t like this book. It was atmospheric, full of gorgeous scenes honing in on some sapphic moments with some vivid and sensual imagery. At times, as I said, I did find the writing to be trying too much, and in this way, I was reminded of the poetry of Ocean Vuong. I know there is an audience that will find these types of metaphors stunning, so do not let my criticism of this book dissuade you from giving it a read....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Apr 05, 2022","Apr 07, 2022","Jan 09, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56654666-nothing-burns-as-bright-as-you

The premise made me think that this would be a whodunnit with some noir undertones, but it soon became apparent that the mystery driving the narrative was more of the whydunnit variety. There was a cat-and-mouse sort of dynamic that had the potential of elevating the story into the realms of a work of psychological suspense that is never utilised to its full potential (the characterization for both cat and the mouse is too surface-level). Nevertheless, the writing is concise and clear-cut, and the plot develops in a cogent manner. There are some unlikely coincidences (our detective is questioning someone who after claiming they can’t remember X or Y, all of a sudden come up with some vital bit of info). The atmosphere is the driving force of the story, as I found the setting (1950s Japan) and ambience in Tokyo Express to be strongly rendered.Our unassuming detective, Torigai Jutaro, is convinced that the death of a young, attractive woman and man was not, contrary to what evidence suggests, a lover's suicide. Jutaro is certain that a key witness connecting the two deceased is somehow involved in their death. Trains and timetables are crucial to exposing this person, and Jutaro spends much of his investigation travelling trying to understand how to break his suspect’s alibi. Jutaro was kind of a blank, and I happen to prefer my detectives to be either pompous eccentrics or walking disasters. Jutaro has this vaguely hinted-at personality that doesn’t really emerge given the pace and brevity of the story. The culprit is revealed too early on, and I would have found Jutaro’s investigation more intriguing if that had not been the case. There is an attempt at a twist later on in the story which utilizes a femme fatale/vixen sort of figure, and I happen to have a love/hate relationship with this trope.For the most part I enjoyed the train motif in this story even if it wasn't quite on the level of Agatha Christie's train-related whodunnits. Still, Tokyo Express made for a quick and fairly engaging read that I would recommend to fans of Georges Simenon and Keigo Higashino....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jul 27, 2022","Jul 29, 2022","Jan 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59238510-tokyo-express

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is one of those rare books that has me really torn up and confused. The love I felt for the first half of the book was slowly eroded by the mounting frustration I felt during the latter half. I loved one of the central characters and really hated the other one. At first, I found the dynamics and relationships at play within the story compelling and rendered with both realism and empathy. As the story progresses however I began to long to read of an actual relationship, platonic or not, between the two central characters. But what we have is the echo of a childhood friendship, more than actual friendship. The characters believe that they care for one another, or that they have a complex and fraught bond…but we don’t really see that beyond a fight here and there. I felt that their supposedly iconic yet thorny friendship was absent from much of the narrative. There was the promise, in the early chapters, of a meaningful connection...but beyond that first scene, where they see each other after all those years, there isn't a spark between them. I also found it predictably tedious and exceedingly heteronormative to have the three male characters with most page time be attracted/in love with the one female character (there is a minor female character later on but she just exists to affirm how special & interesting our female protagonist is). But I am getting ahead of myself…  Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow follows two (former) childhood friends who are reunited as adults and find themselves collaborating on a game. Sam Masur, who after the death of his mother grew up with his grandparents. His disability impacts most aspects of his life but he avoids asking for help, not wanting people’s pity. At Harvard, Sam’s college roommate, Marx, who is wealthy, attractive, and popular, dotes on him, without making a big deal of it. Eventually, Sam comes across Sadie Green, who he’d met during one of the darkest times of his life. Despite the abrupt end to their friendship, the two rekindle their friendship and plan on making a game together. Through Sadie, who is from a moderately wealthy family, we witness just how sexist and competitive the gaming industry is, from college classes to the actual workplace. She becomes involved with one of her teachers, a man who designed a really famous game. The guy is a sleaze and incredibly toxic, but Sadie Green suffers from Sally Rooney female-protagonist syndrome and therefore for reasons unclear to us beyond the trite old approval/validation from a successful older man, she believes she is in love with him. Sam and Sadie, aided by Marx, (whom sadie, as with most female protagonists who happen to be the only prominent female character in their stories, pretends to dislike), manage to make Ichigo into a real blockbuster. There are obvious creative disagreements, and later, financial ones. Sadie spends most of the narrative blaming Sam for choices she made and for things that are out of his control. Yet, the narrative never paints as self-pitying, rather, it tries to make us sympathize with her. I however could not bring myself to do that. I found her as boring as a cardboard box. She thinks she is brilliant, and later on, after a creative misfire, misunderstood. Everyone else, such as Sam, Sadie’s on-and-off lover, and even Marx and his girlfriend, believes that she is clever and unique. But having other characters tell us that this other character is smart and interesting doth not make a smart and interesting character (far from it actually). The way she blames Sam for everything was sickening frankly. She emphasises how as the years go by, she does more work than Sam does…as if Sam was lazy or taking advantage of her or wanted to take her credit…rather than having to cope with his declining physical health and later on recovering from a major surgery. It was sickening to see how Sadie and the narrative itself made it seem as if they were both to blame for their misunderstandings and their fraught relationship. But the thing is…outside of the time they spent gaming together as children, I did not believe that they were ever actual friends. Sam’s traumatic experiences and present-day health issues make us understand why he may find it hard to articulate his feelings or thoughts. But Sadie? She was a righteous selfish stronza who only blames others for her own mistakes. Also, she often made it seem as if Sam and Marx could never understand the kind of sexist microaggressions she experiences as a woman in a male-dominated industry…when Sam and Marx, unlike her, are not white so they would have also inevitably experienced discrimination. Sam, unlike her, is disabled and does not come from money. Sadie holds it against Sam that they choose to sell Ichigo to a company that would pay more (sadie believed that the one offering less was a much better deal as it would allow them to have more control/creative freedom)…but she knows that Sam pushed for the bigger offer because of all his hospital bills and college debt. Like…wtf Sadie? How can you hold it against Sam? She was infuriating. I genuinely disliked her and that 3 out of 5 major male characters fall for her or find her to be leagues above other boring women (the 2 who do not fall for her happen to be a couple…). The guy she dates to being with…what was the point in them? Make us feel bad for Sadie? Her martyr like act really grated on me and so did the narrative's attempts to paint her in a good light.Sam…I loved him. He has flaws, sure, but he felt real and three-dimensional in a way that Sadie just didn’t. His sadness and pain are rendered with empathy and clarity, so we gain an understanding of why he behaves a certain way: from his tendency to withdraw to his unwillingness to express his real feelings. The only thing I did not understand about him was his love for Sadie…Marx too, despite his behavior in the latter part of the book (despite the queer-baiting jokes about his devotion to sam…the guy ends up with the one person he knows sam loves) made for a fantastic friend and character. While we know thanks to some flashforwards that Sam and Sadie eventually no longer work together, I still found myself frustrated by the latter half of the novel which mostly consists of ingroup arguments. There was something slightly manipulative and sensationalistic about the finale, which left me feeling rather disgruntled. I am ultimately left feeling deeply disappointed by how this novel turned out to be. I would have much preferred it if the story had focused on the friendship between Sam and Marx, without even bringing Sadie into the picture. Still, at first, I did love the prose, and I grew to care deeply for Sam. I will say that in addition to less Sadie, less schmaltz, and less recursive yet slightly stilted arguments, I could have done without the story’s throwaway inclusion of bi-curiosity. Last complaint: why did the love Sam feels for Sadie have to be romantic?!Would I recommend this? The me who had only read say the first half definitely would. I would say that sure I cared more about Sam's storyline than Sadie's but I would say that the writing brought to mind Hanya Yanagihara, Brit Bennett, and Ann Patchett as well as friendship-focused novels by Rosie Price, Kayla Rae Whitaker, and Rebecca Kauffman. I definitely appreciated the scope of T, the pacing of the story, the way Zevin seemingly incorporates flashbacks and flashforwards within the narrative, as well as her exploration of loneliness, ambition, creativity, insecurity and her portrayal of grief, trauma, and guilt. Zevin is able to give us insight into the gaming industry without boring us with unnecessary details. She makes us understand why Sam and Sadie want to create the games they do and makes us care about the problems that inevitably crop up when trying to translate an idea into one's reality. There were moments of such tenderness that I found deeply affecting. Learning about Sam's mother and Sam's own relationship with his grandparents, made for some of the best passages and scenes in the whole book. If you happen to find characters like Sadie relatable or compelling, and you don't mind when potentially complex friendships devolve into banal (requited or not) romantic ones, well, chances are you will find Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to be an engrossing and moving tale charting the coming together and the coming apart of two childhood friends. If you, like me, have a low tolerance for self-pitying characters whose self-absorption is excused by the narrative itself, or stories that ruin platonic relationships in favour of devolving into petty jealousies and cheesy yet sensationalistic plot points...well, you might be better off steering clear of this one....more",Notes are private!,0,184,1,"Dec 05, 2022","Dec 07, 2022","Jan 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow

Although torn, Stella doesn’t rush to the victim’s rescue and calls the police instead. When they show up the senior officer is quick to dismiss her, as there is no ‘body’, just some blood, and believes that she merely saw some ‘gang violence’. Scott, the younger officer, who is of Métis heritage, is not so sure. We eventually learn that the victim’s identity and that she happens to be related to Stella. The girl, a self-identifying ‘good’ girl who is an all-around good egg, is hospitalized and both physically and psychologically traumatized. Her mother, aunt, grandmother and great-grandmother are all deeply affected by her attack. They question who would do it and how to best help her in her recovery. Some want answers, others believe that finding the people who did this to her will not solve matters. We are also given the perspective of Scott who is hellbent on ‘solving’ this case, to the point where he disregards the magnitude of what the girl has experienced (pushing her to talk even if she shows signs of distress etc.). We learn of his struggle over his identity, from his colleague’s microaggressions to his own partner’s unfunny remarks about indigenous people. Although we are given insight into his experiences I had a hard time sympathizing with him as his voice stood out (and not in a good way) from the rest. I would have much preferred if the narrative hadn’t included his perspective and had focused on the women making up the girl’s family. There was something gimmicky about his chapters and it seemed to me that the author couldn't’ choose between making him into a flawed yet ultimately empathetic guy or an unscrupulous ambitious dick. Another pov that felt unnecessary was Phoenix’s. She is an older teen who has severe mental health issues (from body dysmorphia and disordered eating to extreme anger and violent episodes). There were aspects of her character that struck me as gratuitous and sensationalistic. Also, having her pov didn’t really make her into a more nuanced character. While I understand that often abuse breeds abuse (so we have someone who was abused becoming an abuser) I am tired of how often this is ‘used’ in fiction as a way of not quite condoning but of making ‘sense’ of an abusive character’s actions. I also found it frustrating that her pov featured more in the story than the girl (i have forgotten her name, even though she is meant to be the figure tying all of these narratives together) who was attacked. She and her friend have a chapter now and again but I found them somewhat simplistic compared to the others. That the first time that they sneak out and 'lie' to their mothers ends in such a horrifying way also struck me as a wee bit much. Still, this book certainly packs a punch or two. Katherena Vermette doesn’t soften the brutality of what the victim experiences nor are she quick to condemn characters like Stella. Throughout these perspectives, Vermette also explores the discrimination, violence, and abuse directed at indigenous women. Some of the characters are trapped in a stark cycle of violence, addiction, and or abuse and Vermette doesn’t shy away from portraying the harsh realities that many of them live in. The story also dabbles with magical realism as there are chapters from the perspective of a character who is no longer alive. Their identity isn’t quite a mystery but I appreciated that Vermette didn't feel the need to over-explain their presence in the overarching narrative. I would definitely read more by this author and I would encourage readers who can tolerate graphic descriptions of violent/sexual assault(s) to give The Break a chance....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Mar 08, 2022","Mar 10, 2022","Jan 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29220494-the-break

Kevin Kwan's engrossing and entertaining storytelling made me speed through his book and I ended up finishing it in less than a day. As retellings go, this manages to be both (fairly) faithful and rather refreshing. What kept me from wholly loving this book was Lucie, the book’s central character. She's the kind of self-absorbed, self-pitying, and milquetoast type of heroine that I have come to abhor, so much so that I actively root against them (especially since they are presented to us as likeable/good heroines who are not wholly responsible for their 'bad' actions).  Kwan’s reimagining of Forster’s A Room With A View  features a contemporary setting and focuses on Lucie Churchill, a Chinese American young woman who is tired of feeling like the odd one out in her social circle. Her deceased father’s relatives are insufferably wealthy WASPs who see and treat her like an ‘oddity’ (the grandmother repeatedly refers to her as a ‘China doll’...yikes). To avoid being the subject of further gossip Lucie, now aged 19, has cultivated a good-girl image. Whereas A Room With A View opens in Florence, Sex and Vanity transports us to Capri where Lucie is staying to attend the wedding of her friend Isabel Chiu. Lucie’s chaperone is the snobbish and fussy Charlotte, her older cousin on her father’s side, who both in name and character is very faithful to her original counterpart. The wedding is decidedly over-the-top and Kwang certainly seems to have fun in envisioning the opulent foods & beverages and extravagant activities that would seem like musts to filthy rich ppl like Isabel and her cohort. As with the original, the two cousins end up in a hotel room with no view and are offered to trade for one with a view on the Tyrrhenian Sea by two other guests, George Zao and his mother (in the original it was George and his father). Lucie dislikes Gergeo on sight. She tells herself it's because he’s too handsome and too un-American, but, over the course of the wedding celebrations, she finds herself growing intrigued by him. As with the original something happens between Lucie and George that could very well lead to a ‘scandal’. This is witnessed by Charlotte who makes it her business to separate the ‘lovers’.The latter half of the story takes place 5 years later in New York. Lucie is engaged to Cecil, who is ‘new money’ and therefore not wholly accepted by Lucie’s set. We are introduced to Lucie’s mother and her brother, who due to his gender and possibly his ‘WASP’ appearance, isn’t as scrutinized as Lucie herself is. Lucie’s future is jeopardized when George and his mother arrive in town. Lucie is horrified at the discovery that George knows her fiance and that the two will be forced to be in each other’s proximity at the various social gatherings they attend. Of course, even as Lucie tells herself she’s not interested in George and that he and his mother represent everything she does not want to be (the gal sure has a lot of internalized racism to deal with) she can't stop obsessing over him.Whereas the tone and atmosphere of Forster’s original struck me as gentle, idyllic even, Kwan’s brand of satire is far louder and sensationalistic. This suits the kind of people he’s satirizing, their obsession with status, brands, and reputation, as well as their lack of self-awareness. The rarefied world he depicts is certainly an insular one and while Lucie does experience prejudice, for the most part, the problems his characters face are very much rich people problems.Given that this novel is far lengthier than Forster’s one I hoped that George would get his time to shine, or that his romance with Lucie could be depicted more openly. But Kwang prioritizes gossipy dialogues over character development.Most of the conversations and scenes in this novel are of a humorous nature, and Kwang is certainly not afraid to poke fun at his characters (their hypocritical behaviour, their sense of entitlement, their privilege). Still, he keeps things fairly light, and there were even a few instances where the narrative veers in the realms of the ridiculous.While there is no strictly likeable character, Lucie was perhaps the most grating of the lot. Whereas I excepted Cecil to be a conceited, condescending, wannabe-aesthete (kwang and forester’s cecils pale in comparison to daniel day-lewis’ cecil), I wasn’t prepared for such as wishy-washy heroine. While I could buy into the motivations of Forester’s Lucy (her self-denial, her inability and or unwillingness to articulate her feelings towards george), I could not bring myself to believe in Kwang’s Lucie’s ‘reasonings’. She acts like a child experiencing their first crush, not someone in their mid-twenties. Her antipathy towards George and his mother also made her into an extremely unlikable character. Her actions towards the latter, which as far as I can recall were not inspired from the original, made me detest her. Not only was her ‘plan’ was completely inane but inexcusable. She struck me as bratty, self-involved, superficial, vapid. At times she acts like a complete cretin. I could not see how other people could stand her, let alone how someone like George could fall in love with her.Even if her character lowered my overall opinion of this novel, I nevertheless had a blast with Sex and Vanity. I liked how Kwang adapted certain plot elements to fit with his modern setting (instead of a book revealing that ‘scandalous’ moment, it’s a film; instead of the carriages there are golf carts). Part of me would have preferred it if Kwang had not made George and his mother ultra-rich given that in the original George and his father are certainly not well off. I also liked that in the original Lucy refuses Cecil twice, whereas here (as far as my memory serves) Lucie immediately accepts Cecil’s request. Sex and Vanity is a gleefully ‘trashy’ comedy of manners. Kwang’s droll prose and drama-driven narrative make for the perfect escapist read....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 30, 2021","Dec 31, 2021","Dec 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52064314-sex-and-vanity

It felt as if the gap that had dogged me all my days was knitting together before my eyes—so that, from this point on, my life would be as coherent and meaningful as my favorite books. At the same time, I had a powerful sense of having escaped something: of having finally stepped outside the script.”In Either/Or we are reunited with Selin as she continues to navigate the trials and tribulations of adulthood. Now a sophomore student at Harvard, Selin has plenty to keep her occupied: her studies inspire her to question the choices she and others have made, the direction of her life, the meaning of love, sex, and connection, the limitations of language, and, of course, her relationship with Ivan, the Hungarian student whose mind remains to Selin, and by extension us, as unreadable as ever. Did she care for her at all? There was something abstract and gentle about the experience of being ignored—a feeling of being spared, a known impossibility of anything happening—that was consonant with my understanding of love.Selin’s propensity for long asides is as present as ever and I loved losing myself in her inner monologue. Her long acts of introspections do often come across as navel-gazing (curiously enough the narrative itself mentions navel-gazing), but I never felt bored or annoyed by it. If anything, Selin’s solipsistic inclination for self-interrogation made her all the more realistic. That she refers to books, music, films, and authors to make sense of herself and others results in a deeply intratextual narrative that will definitely appeal to literary students. While Selin isn’t wholly enamoured by academia, we can see how her studies and the books she reads inform the way she understands her world and those who populate it. She often draws parallels between her own life and those of historical and fictional figures. Some of the authors/artists/etc. she mentions include: Kazuo Ishiguro, Fiona Apple, Charles Baudelaire, Pushkin, Shakespeare, André Breton, and of course, Soren Kierkegaard’s Either/Or.“There was something about crying so much, the way it made my body so limp and hot and shuddering, that made me feel closer to sex. Maybe there was a line where sex and total sadness touched—one of those surprising borders that turned out to exist, like the one between Italy and Slovenia. Music, too, was adjacent. It was like Trieste, which was Italian and Slovenian and also somehow Austrian.”Of course, at times these books and figures only add further confusion, so Selin is unsure whether she’s idealizing herself and others so that her life can resemble those she encounters in fiction. More often than not knowledge fails her, so she’s unable to decipher not only the motivations of others but her own true feelings.Her writerly aspirations too preoccupy her and so do the changes that come about in her life. Selin’s intense friendship and rivalry with ​​Svetlana is threatened when the latter finds a boyfriend. Her roommates too have plenty of things that keep them occupied so Selin finds herself going to parties where she meets less than ideal men. Yet even as Selin forms sexual relationships with them, she longs for Ivan and obsesses over what his infrequent emails leave unsaid.“It seemed to me that the elements whirling around me in my own life were also somehow held in place by Ivan’s absence, or were there because of him—to counterbalance a void.”Either/Or shares the same structure with The Idiot so we follow Selin month by month during her academic year before tagging alongside her as she once again goes abroad for the summer. In Turkey she finds herself forming unexpected connections but remains somewhat remote to them. Sardonic and adroit Either/Or makes for a fantastic read. While Selin does change over the course of her sophomore year, she also remains very much herself. She can be reserved and slightly baffling at times, and yet she’s also capable of making some very insightful or relatable comments. She’s intelligent, somewhat naive, and has a penchant for overthinking and obsessing over minor things. Her deadpan sense of humor and little idiosyncrasies make her character really pop out of the page. I could definitely relate to her many many uncertainties, as well as her fixation with understanding the person who never seemed to reciprocate her feelings. The one that started “Days like this, I don’t know what to do with myself” made me feel certain that I had spent my whole life not knowing what to do with myself—all day, and all night. “I wander the halls . . .” That was exactly it: not the streets, like a flâneur, but the halls. Oh, I knew just which halls.As I mentioned already over the course of her second year at Harvard Selin grows into a more self-assured person while also remaining strangely static. Her mental meanderings often included reflections on things such as desirability, belonging, love, heartbreak, self-fulfilment, choice & chance, and I found her perspective on these things deeply compelling. At times her mind is preoccupied with mundane thoughts, at times she loses herself in philosophical and existentialist questions about human nature.Batuman’s inclusion of the minutiae of her protagonist’s life (such as inserting a tampon: “I tried again to put in a tampon. ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WAY.”) made Selin’s reality at Harvard all the more vivid. I could easily envision the different environments she occupies, as well as the people who inhabit those places. This combined with the mumblecore dialogues and Selin’s recursive inner monologue, which borders on being a stream of consciousness, give Either/Or quality of hyperrealism. That is, even when confronted with moments of surreality or scenes of a comedic nature, I believed completely in what I was reading. A sense of 90s nostalgia permeates her story which adds to the narrative’s overall atmosphere and aesthetic. “It was the golden time of year. Every day the leaves grew brighter, the air sharper, the grass more brilliant. The sunsets seemed to expand and melt and stretch for hours, and the brick façades glowed pink, and everything blue got bluer. How many perfect autumns did a person get? Why did I seem always to be in the wrong place, listening to the wrong music?”I loved this novel so thoroughly that I was sad to reach its inevitable conclusion. I hope with all my heart that Batuman will write a third instalment where we will follow Selin during her third year at Harvard. If you enjoyed The Idiot chances us you will, like me, love this even more (perhaps because batuman is expanding on the 'universe' she already established). If you are a fan of the young-alienated-women subgenre you should definitely consider picking these series up.

Not a great start to my reading year… “What could be more normal than making people into clothes or furniture after they die?”A lot of things... As Life Ceremony happened to be one of my most anticipated 2022 releases, I was very happy to learn that my request for an arc was approved by its publisher. Sadly, it turns out that Life Ceremony was not the offbeat collection I was expecting it’d be. If you enjoyed Murata’s Convenience Store Woman but found Earthlings too grotesque, well, my advice is that you steer clear from her short stories. I loved the former and found the latter to be, if not enjoyable, certainly a striking read. Life Ceremony, on the other hand, feels like a rather forgettable collection of stories designed to disgust & shock its readers. Even the scenarios they explore are certainly weird, their weirdness was almost too predictable and samey. While the disturbing elements that made Earthlings into such a memorable read felt ‘earned’, and did not take precedence over the story’s characters & themes, here those elements feel obvious and as if they were the whole point of the story. As with her two novels, Murata’s short stories explore alienation, loneliness, humanity, and contemporary Japanese society. But, to be perfectly honest, Murata’s insights into these topics here feel banal and entirely derivative of her full length works.Most of the stories in this collection are set in the near-future or in an alternate reality where certain characters, often the narrator, finds themselves questioning the social mores so readily accepted by others. Because of this they feel alienated from other people and don't feel that they truly fit into their particular society. Most of the stories question the notion of right and wrong by challenging the characters ethical and moral ideologies (why do they really think that x is bad? is it because they are told that is what they should think? etc etc). In the first story for example our protagonist lives in a society that uses human skin to produce all sorts of objects. While this use of human skin is completely normalized now the protagonist remembers vaguely a time where this was not the case. Her partner, to everyone’s bewilderment, is openly against this practice and refuses to have items that are made of human skin. When his father dies and his skin repurposed, the partner reconsiders his stance. In another story, the main character has a sister who, in a similar fashion to a character from Earthlings, believes she is not a human. This causes others to bully and make fun of her. In the title story, Murata envisions a world where the deceased are made into food for the living in a ceremony of sorts. This ceremony apparently makes people really horny and they tend to have sex after consuming the ‘flesh’ of their loved one. People attach no shame to the act of sex and apparently it is perfectly normal to walk down a street and see pools of semen all over the pavement. Our main character initially claims that she is not keen on the practice but when a colleague she cares for dies suddenly she relishes the meal his relatives make him into. She comes across a man who says he’s gay and decides to give her his sperm. Amongst other things, I found myself wondering how gay people fit in in a society where you only have sex to procreate. I found this scenario particularly illogical. Not so much the eating of the deceased, I mean, endocannibalism was (is?) practised by certain communities, but the whole sex on the streets thing?! Uncomfortable much! Anyhow, we also have a story about a woman who observes other people and describes them as human beings, which kind of implies she is not one. She is particularly obsessed with things such as blood, bile, and other bodily fluids. At one point she observes someone she’s just had a meal with and this happens:“Sanae quietly gripped the plastic bag in her hand, thinking of all the excrement filling Emiko's body.”Which, ugh, let me gouge my eyes out. I didn’t find this funny or shocking, just low-key gross. Gross is actually the perfect word to describe this collection. Alongside garish, vulgar, perverse, trite, and gratuitous. At times I felt that I was reading the writing of a teenager trying to be edgy and writing about edgy things like shit, sex, blood, and cannibalism. There were also lines such as ""I felt so happy at the thought that I was among his innards"" that just...why?! Then an orgasm is described as ""it's kind of like your body becomes innocent, like a child""...which. Yeah. Something about that does not sit right with me.Contrary to what one might believe reading this , I don’t mind gore, body horror, or works that are fascinated with what is abject. I recently watched and was blown away by Titane which definitely delivers on the body horror and the body is abject front. But this collection prioritizes these aspects in an ineffective way. They were far from subversive, and in fact, I found it predictable how almost every story features a society where something we consider taboo has been normalized. While I was deeply dissatisfied by this collection, and I will certainly be avoiding her short-form work from now on, I do consider Murata to be a remarkable storyteller (even if this collection was, in my opinion of course, a dud). If you are interested in reading this and you are not put-off my intentionally & ott gross content, well, go for it....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Dec 30, 2021",Jan 2022,"Dec 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59793324-life-ceremony

The scenario too brought to mind another novel I read fairly recently, The Sleepwalker's Guide to Dancing, which also centres on an Asian American woman in her 30s moving in back temporally with her parents because her father is showing signs of memory loss. Still, even if Goodbye, Vitamin didn’t quite strike me in the way Chemistry or even Edge Case by YZ Chin (which is yet another similar read) it was by no means an unpleasant read. The humorous tone was fairly engaging and the complex father-daughter dynamic that is at the heart of this story was certainly poignant. The questions the narrative raises and tries to answer (what we owe to each other? what does it mean to care for someone? is forgiveness always possible?) were certainly thought-provoking and I also appreciated the author’s portrayal of love, break-ups, and illnesses, as well as her depiction of the every-day realities of looking after an ageing parent.  Characterized by an offbeat and occasionally surreal tone, Goodbye, Vitamin is narrated by Ruth, a thirty-something woman reeling from her recent break-up with her longtime partner. Add to that the fact that so far she’s been leading a rather directionless career and Ruth is far from okay. Her mother, who works full time, asks Ruth to move back home so that she can keep an eye on her father, a history professor whose Alzheimer diagnosis has resulted in his ‘temporary’ dismissal from his college. Ruth and her mother try to help him in the only ways they can: they give him supplements and vitamins, design an ideal diet with foods that have plenty of health benefits. Additionally, they try to be ‘stealthy’ about their efforts to look after him as he seems unwilling to admit that he is experiencing any of the symptoms related to Alzheimer. In an effort to make him feel normal again Ruth teams up with her father’s former students and organize unauthorized lessons.Ruth’s ‘quirky’ narration did at times feel a bit heavy-handed and it seemed a bit of a stretch that all of the various characters would share the same silly & weird sense of humor. The bittersweet nature of the relationship between Ruth and her father was perhaps the strongest aspect of this novel. Her father is not a particularly likeable person to start off with but to see his ‘change’ through his daughter’s eyes definitely made me more sympathetic towards him. Part of me would have liked for Ruth’s mother to be in the picture more as her presence is often relegated off-page.Despite the subject matter—Alzheimer’s, breakups—Goodbye, Vitamin makes for a breezy read. I look forward to reading more by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Dec 26, 2021","Dec 29, 2021","Dec 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27746288-goodbye-vitamin

Through the faint light of the room, I looked over the words, which came together in the strangest way. On the one hand, they felt new to me, like something I’d never heard or seen before, though I also felt like maybe I had read them somewhere, in the title of a movie or a song;Previously to reading All the Lovers in the Night, I’d read Breasts and Eggs, Heaven, and Ms. Ice Sandwich, by Mieko Kawakami. While I was not ‘fond’ of Breasts and Eggs, I did find her other books to be compelling. As the premise for All the Lovers in the Night did bring to mind Breasts and Eggs, I was worried that I would have a similarly ‘negative’ reading experience. Thankfully, I found All the Lovers in the Night to be insightful and moving. Even more so than Kawakami’s other works, All the Lovers in the Night adheres to a slice-of-life narrative. Yet, in spite of this, the story is by no means light-hearted or superficial. Kawakami approaches difficult topics with this deceptively simple storytelling. She renders the loneliness and anxiety of her central character with clarity and even empathy.“I couldn’t think of a single thing about me that would be worth sharing. My name is Fuyuko Irie, a freelance proofreader, thirty-four years old. I’ll be turning thirty-five in the winter. I live alone. I’ve been living in the same apartment forever. I was born in Nagano. Out in the country. One of the valleys. I like to go out on a walk once a year on my birthday, Christmas Eve, in the middle of the night.”Thirty-something Fuyuko Irie leads a solitary life working from home as a freelance copy editor. Her inward nature led her former colleagues to single her out, and she was made to feel increasingly uncomfortable at her workplace. Working from home Fuyuko is able to avoid interacting with others, and seems content with her quiet existence. Fuyuko receives much of her work from Hijiri, an editor who is the same age as her but is very extroverted and possesses a forceful personality. Hijiri, for reasons unknown to Fuyuko, regularly keeps in touch with her and seems to consider her a friend. Perhaps their differences cause Fuyuko to begin questioning her lifestyle. Compared to her glamorous friend, Fuyuko sees herself, to borrow Jane Eyre’s words, as “obscure, plain and little”. But venturing outside the comfort of her home has become difficult for Fuyuko. To work up the courage she begins drinking alcohol, even if her body doesn’t respond well to it. She eventually begins going to a cafe with an older man. While the two speak of nothing much, they seem happy to exchange tentative words with one another.I can see that this is not the type of novel that will appeal to those readers who are keen on plot-driven stories. However, if you are looking for an affecting character study, look no further. Through Fuyuko’s story, the author addresses how Japanese society sees and treats women who are deemed no longer ‘young’. Marriage, motherhood, and a career seem to be the requirements for many Japanese women. Those like Fuyuko are considered outside of the norm and because of this, they find themselves alienated from others. Fuyuko’s self-esteem is badly affected by this to the point where she feels that she has to go outside her comfort zone, even if the only way to do so is through inebriation. At a certain point, I was worried that Kawakami would make Hijiri into the classic fake/mean female character who is portrayed as aggressive, promiscuous, and a woman-hater to boot. Thankfully that was not the case. While Hijiri is not necessarily a likeable person Kawakami doesn’t paint her as a one-dimensional bitch and her relationship with Fuyuko isn’t sidetracked in favour of the romantic subplot. And yes, on the ‘romance’...I will say that this man wasn’t as nuanced as Fuyuko. I found him slightly boring and generic. I did like that the relationship between the two forms has a very slow build-up to it and the ending will certainly subvert many readers' expectations.Anyway, overall I rather enjoyed this. I liked the melancholic mood permeating Fuyuko’s story, the descriptions of Tokyo, the mumblecore dialogues, the way Kawakami articulates Fuyuko’s discomfort, anxiety, etc. Now and again there were even moments of humour and absurdity that alleviated Fuyuko’s more depressing experiences. I also appreciated the novel’s open-ended nature, which added an extra layer of realism to Fuyuko’s story. While some of Fuyuko’s actions aren’t given a ‘why’ or closely inspected, as we read on we begin to understand more fully her various state of mind and how these affect her behaviour.“I was so scared of being hurt that I’d done nothing. I was so scared of failing, of being hurt, that I chose nothing. I did nothing.”While the dialogues did have a realistic rhythm, the secondary characters (who usually did most of the talking given that our main character isn't a talker) did tend to go on very long and weirdly specific monologues that seemed at times incredibly random or oddly revealing. This is something I noticed in other works by Kawakami. Secondary characters go on endless rants or whatnot while our main character gives little to no input. It seems a bit unusual that Fuyuko would come across so many people who are willing to go on these very long monologues that reveal personal stuff. Even so, I did find the majority of the dialogues to be effective.“If I thought about things long enough, I would always lose track of my own feelings, which left me with no choice but to proceed as usual, without taking any action.”All the Lovers in the Night is a work of subtle beauty and I look forward to revisiting it again in the future.re-read: the narrative possess a quality of impermanence that is truly rare in literature. i love the attention that the author gives to Fuyuko's various environments and the incredibly tactile descriptions. the way the author writes about light reminded me of Yūko Tsushima. i loved re-reading this and i really appreciated how the author prioritises female relationships in this narrative. the relationships and interactions between the various women within this narrative are by no means positive or easy but they speak of the kind of images and norms that their families, communities, and society have inculcated into them. additionally, the author shows how women can perpetuate misogynistic views and attitudes (casting judgement on how other women dress, their sex lives, their marital status) as well how all-consuming and toxic female friendships can be. Fuyuko's unwillingness to conform to widely accepted ideals of womanhood and her (partly) self-imposed isolation brought to mind Charlotte Brontë's Lucy Snowe. additionally, the way kawakami navigates her loneliness and creativity reminded me of Lily King's Writers & Lovers. despite the issues addressed within the narrative—sexual assault, alcoholism, misogyny, alienation—Fuyuko's voice has this lulling rhythm that made it easy for me to become immersed by what i was reading. while in my original  i criticised the novel for its 'monologues' this second time around i actually found these far more credible as it was easy to see why people would open up to Fuyuko. sad and wistful, All the Lovers in the Night ultimately struck me as luminous character analysis that captures with bittersweet accuracy the realities of leading a lonely existence, missed connections, and the long-lasting repercussions of traumatic experiences....more",Notes are private!,0,96,3,"Jul 2023May 08, 2022Dec 13, 2021","Jul 2023May 11, 2022Dec 17, 2021","Dec 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59316317-all-the-lovers-in-the-night

Jesmyn Ward recounts her experiences growing up poor, female, and Black in the rural South during the late 80s and 90s. Ward interweaves her personal account with a brutal social commentary that highlights what it means to be poor and Black, and of how racism, specifically in the South, remains an insidious and widespread phenomenon with tragic consequences. Interrupting those chapters in which Ward recounts her childhood and teenage years are chapters focusing on the lives of five Black men, all of whom died young as a result of addictions, suicide, and accidents. Some of these men, we learn, were her friends growing up. We see how the school system either pegged them as problem students or ignored them, which inevitably would make them feel ‘less than’ and worthless. Ward’s younger brother, Joshua, is one of these young men, which makes these chapters all the more hard-hitting.Ward shows how deep-rooted institutionalised racism is and how it results in social and economic disparities. In looking back to the past, Ward tries to understand the motivations behind the actions and behaviours of the adults around her, in particular, her mother and her father, a serial cheater who would eventually leave them behind. In discussing the lives of these men she cared for, Ward considered the high mortality rate among young Black men, and of the way in which their community is affected by generational trauma, drug addiction, etc. Ward ultimately feels conflicted about the South, a place that has played a fatal role in the deaths of the people she loved. Yet, even after moving away to pursue higher education, she finds herself longing to return to it. Ward, in some ways, appears to be haunted by it and by the role it played in the deaths of so many men she knew and loved. With heartbreaking clarity and piercing insight, Ward writes of her childhood, of the lives of those young men who died such violent and sudden deaths, of her own family and her relationship to her parents, of her community, and of social inequality. More impressive still than Ward’s talent for vividly portraying a specific time and place is her ability to articulate her grief over the death of her brother and her friends.While this memoir is by no means an easy read, it did in fact distress me, ultimately, I think it’s a necessary read. Ward’s lyrical prose reads like an elegy, both to the men that died at such a young age and to the South. Men We Reaped is a powerful, poignant, and thought-provoking read. While this memoir is mired in pain and grief, Ward's elegiac prose and empathy balanced out its bleaker aspects. With admirable lucidity Ward attempts to reconcile herself with the confusion and anger brought about by the inequalities experienced by her community and by her loved one deaths. Some quotes that will haunt me: “[T]he message was always the same: You’re Black. You’re less than White. And then, at the heart of it: You’re less than human.”“We inherit these things that breed despair and self-hatred, and tragedy multiplies. For years I carried the weight of that despair with me;”“But this grief, for all its awful weight, insists that he matters. What we carry of Roger and Demond and C. J. and Ronald says that they matter. I have written only the nuggets of my friends’ lives. This story is only a hint of what my brother’s life was worth, more than the nineteen years he lived, more than the thirteen years he’s been dead. It is worth more than I can say. And there’s my dilemma, because all I can do in the end is say.”“We who still live do what we must. Life is a hurricane, and we board up to save what we can and bow low to the earth to crouch in that small space above the dirt where the wind will not reach. We honor anniversaries of deaths by cleaning graves and sitting next to them before fires, sharing food with those who will not eat again. We raise children and tell them other things about who they can be and what they are worth: to us, everything. We love each other fiercely, while we live and after we die. We survive; we are savages.”“I thought being unwanted and abandoned and persecuted was the legacy of the poor southern Black woman. But as an adult, I see my mother’s legacy anew. I see how all the burdens she bore, the burdens of her history and identity and of our country’s history and identity, enabled her to manifest her greatest gifts.”...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Dec 18, 2021","Dec 19, 2021","Dec 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54619464-men-we-reaped

While the narrative tries a bit too hard to be quirky, I did find certain scenes and or sections to be fairly amusing. Chemistry implements those ‘in’ literary devices such as an unnamed narrator and a lack of speech marks that I find somewhat predictable. Still, the story focuses on a Chinese American woman in her thirties who is studying for a PhD in chemistry. She’s in a relationship with a seemingly ‘good’ white guy who seems ready to take their relationship to the next stage (marriage). But, like a lot of contemporary female narrators, our mc is not feeling sure of anything. She’s struggling to keep up with the demanding hours of her PhD, overwhelmed by the pressure of other people's expectations, and confused by her own feelings and emotions (she feels too much, nothing at all). While our narrator is initially able to go through the motions of her everyday life, she eventually slips behind her PhD. Her partner begins to grow restless at our narrator’s perpetual ambivalence towards the future, and soon enough our protagonist’s life begins falling apart. As we read of her present tribulations we are given insight into her experiences growing up. Her focus on academic success was instilled in her by her parents who always seemed dissatisfied with her, even when she studies what they want her to. In examining her relationship with her parents and the way they brought her up the narrator discusses the stereotypes about Asian parents. She also talks about the everyday microaggressions she experiences, particularly working as a woc in a field that is predominantly male. The author also captures those quarter-life crisis uncertainties that make you question whether the ‘path’ you are on is leading somewhere and if it is, whether you really want to reach that destination. The narrator’s growing discontent over her studies certainly resonated with me as I’m currently in my final year of my masters and I feel academically exhausted to the point where I considered (and still am) dropping out. It is particularly frustrating to see that no matter how hard you work or try, you don’t get the results/grades you hope for. On top of that, the narrator also has a dissolving relationship to cope with. While her partner is presented as this supportive nice guy he repeatedly fails to understand where she’s coming from, seems unable to understand her point of view, and remains blissfully unaware of his own privilege (as a cis straight white man from a financially and emotionally stable family).Our main character’s best friend, who is also nameless and referred to as 'the best friend', is also having troubles of her own as soon after giving birth discovers that her husband is betraying her.While these may all sound like heavy topics the tone of this story is very much light and comical. As I mentioned above, the narrative goes for this offbeat kind of tone that at times comes across as contrived. There were numerous instances where I did not find the narrator funny. There is a running-gag of sorts where she explains a joke to someone because her sense of humor is just so quirky that people don’t always get it. I did find her somewhat endearing. For example, in this scene, where her best friend is once again venting about her cheating husband: “This is all your fault, she says to one of the posters. You did this to him, you and your female wiles. Then she moves on to next poster. I follow and apologize to each woman in turn.”. Or when she imagines what her best friend's baby is thinking: “The baby has become sentient. When we walk, she screams across the street at other babies, baby expletives, we think. Something along the line of Goddamn it, other baby, don’t try to out-cute me. To make matters worse, she is very cute, so we have a hard time correcting her.”. The writing could certainly be effective and I appreciated the way the author articulates these difficult to pin down feelings & fears. The narrator’s inner monologue is punctuated by scientific anecdotes that certainly fitted her background. While some of her jokes were misses, and her never-ending silly witticism did detract from her actual story, there were a couple of times where I found her genuinely funny. “It is a double-edged sword.To be smart and beautiful, says the best friend, and this is probably very close to what every woman wants. I too had high hopes of growing up into both a genius and a bombshell.To be Marie Curie but then to also look like Grace Kelly.”While the dialogue often rang true to life (in a mumblecore sort of way), some of the characters struck me as thinly rendered. The boyfriend for example is incredibly generic and exceedingly dull to the point where I did not feel at all affected by his departure. And, while I believed that the narrator is lonely, I wasn’t at all convinced that she loved him. Similarly, I didn't buy into her bond with the math student she's tutoring. I would have liked to see more of her parents or that they had not been painted in a negative light for 80% of the story. Still, overall, I liked Chemistry. I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Julia Whelan, who, bear in mind is one of my favorite narrators, wasn’t the best ‘voice’ for this. That is to say that there are plenty of talented Asian American female narrators who could have narrated Chemistry. If you are looking for a humorous take on failure, self-fulfilment, parental and self-pressure, loneliness and connection, Chemistry might be your perfect next read. I can see this novel appealing to fans of Win Me Something by Kyle Lucia Wu, Edge Case by YZ Chin, and Days of Distraction by Alexandra Chang, all which also focus on young(ish) alienated Asian American women who feel stuck or caught in a directionless spiral. If you are a fan of the contemporary literary trend which is disaffected/directionless female protagonists who don't feel so good, well, this title may a great addition to your tbr.I look forward to reading whatever Wang publishes next!...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Dec 11, 2021","Dec 12, 2021","Dec 11, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31684925-chemistry

As I kept on reading however my initial excitement over the story incrementally decreased to the point that I no longer looked forward to picking it up. This is by no means a bad novel but it certainly bore the signs of an ‘unseasoned’ writer. The prose was weighed down by repetition and overdone metaphors. Some of the dialogues struck me as odd, unconvincing, and I found that the narrative relied too much on rhetorical questions. Additionally, sections of the text consisted of a barrage of ‘what if x’ or ‘why is y’ or ‘how is xy’ questions that were really unnecessary. At one point there is a whole paragraph that just consists of these very, dare I write, basic questions that were far less effective than actually discussing the subject matter at hand (rather than circling around it).The novel follows three characters, with very few if any secondary characters. This does lend a certain intimacy to the narration and the drama unfolding between these three characters. After his acting career takes off Achike Okoro acquires a swanky flat in Peckham. Staying with him is Ekene, his best friend of twenty years. Despite their different temperaments and careers, the two share a very close bond. Both have had less than ideal upbringings and they found solace in one another. It is hinted that the two had a ‘moment’ in Berlin and back in their twenties. Achike has proclaimed his love for Ekene but the latter seems reluctant to take their relationship down that path. While Achike is presented as this patient sort of figure, he does seem to have grown restless and feels slightly bitter about Ekene always choosing someone over him. When Chibuike, Achike’s father, who is in the process of recovering from his alcohol addiction, moves in with them, tensions rise. There is the very long opening scene, in which we learn all of this, that takes place over the course of a day (possibly two?) and ends around the 30% mark. In between, we get some flashbacks that take us to Achike and Ekene’s early days as friends and Chibuike’s own childhood. The narrative explores the bonds between father & sons and friends & lovers as well as provides some thought-provoking conversation on masculinity, queerness, and Blackness. After a certain event, the story changes track so that in addition to these themes the narrative touches upon grief, guilt, and forgiveness.I wanted to love this, I really did, but I found the writing to be a bit too…Ocean Vuong-esque for my liking? Eg. “Maybe fathers could explain sons?”The first half of the novel is bogged down by this ‘will they won’t they’ storyline that seems to take priority over characterization. Because I didn’t really feel as if I knew these characters I was not particularly invested in their friendship/romance. The father/son dynamics occurring within this novel also struck me as corny. There were instances where I felt that I was reading the script for a soap opera or something. There were lines describing how beautiful the characters are, which at times went on too long or were a bit too much. But I digress. This was not a terribly written novel. At times the writing was a bit clumsy, and in other instances, lyrical passages or observations give way to purple metaphors. The three major characters were at times too fixed in their role and I'm always fond of tragic events being used as plot devices or to 'help' other characters 'grow'. There were a couple of scenes that I found well-executed but there were far too many instances where I wasn't sure where the characters were or if this scene was taking place on the same day as the previous one, etc. etc. While I would not call myself a fan of this I am grateful to the publisher for having sent me an arc and I urge prospective readers to check out more positive s. out...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Dec 11, 2021","Dec 13, 2021","Dec 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58366877-here-again-now

Out of the 12 stories, only 2 really stood out to me while the rest blended together somewhat. The author uses fantastical elements to explore familiar themes and dynamics. I liked her use of magical realism and found that it suited her story’s subject matter. In the second story for example a girl on the cusps of adolescence sprouts wings. There is a story about an insomniac who receives visits from the Sandman. Another one features a haunted doll. Grief, guilt, and mortality are the running motifs in this collection. The author's use of the absurd permeates her realistic scenarios with a sense of surreality. Her prose was not only compelling but interspersed throughout there were some beautiful descriptions and clever observations. Despite this, I did not find her collection particularly memorable. While I did find the first two stories to be touching and creative, the ones that followed played around with vaguely formulaic concepts that are very much staples of the magical realism genre. Additionally, some of these stories just came across as writing exercises (and they stuck too closely to the ‘how to write a short story’ formula). Still, even if I wasn’t blown away by this collection it was far from an unpleasant read and I will probably check out more by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,Feb 2022,"Feb 03, 2022","Nov 21, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58476152-lesser-known-monsters-of-the-21st-century

While both works explore single-motherhood in 1970s Japan, Woman Running in the Mountains struck me as far more accomplished. This is a very introspective narrative that examines the repercussions of motherhood on a young woman named Takiko. From detailing the changes her body experiences during her pregnancy to interrogating how her sense of self has been irrevocably changed after she’s given birth to her son, Takiko engages in a long act of self-examination. We see how her shifting self-perception is affected by her being a mother and the numbness, exhaustion, and anxiety that overcome her as she tries to raise her son in a very conservative country. The father of her child is a married man and has no idea Takiko has given birth to their child. Takiko’s parents are deeply ashamed of her and physically and emotionally mistreat her. During the last months of her pregnancy, her mother insists that she should either get an abortion or give her baby up for adoption. Her father, who after a work injury stays all day at home drinking, who even prior to her pregnancy was verbally and physically abusive towards her, becomes increasingly hostile towards Takiko. Her younger brother is perhaps the only member of her family who doesn’t seek to shame and or punish Takiko but he also seems unwilling to involve himself in her ongoing fight with their parents.After she’s given birth Takiko struggles to find a daycare and is often forced to act as if she’s married in order not to face discrimination. She eventually finds a job and attempts to save enough money to leave her parents’ house.Despite the heavy themes Woman Running in the Mountains is marked by a lulling rhythm, one that lends an idyllic quality to the narrative. Takiko is particularly attuned to her environment and she describes in vivid detail the changing seasons and the sceneries of her city (from the maternity ward to her cramped family house, to the neighbourhoods she crosses). Her ability to recollect her dreams also adds to the evocative atmosphere of her narrative. Towards the end, the story lost me a little and I did grow tired of the lists detailing Takiko’s baby routine (i have no interest in newborns or small children). Still, I found this a deeply atmospheric read and there were many gorgeous descriptions of Takiko’s various environments. The motif of light was particularly striking and it really complimented Takiko’s narrative.Not a happy book but certainly an arresting one. The dreamlike vibe was certainly hypnotic and the scenes capturing Takiko's every day gave the narrative a slice-of-life feel....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Feb 26, 2022","Feb 27, 2022","Nov 21, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60428018-woman-running-in-the-mountains

It’s always easier to laugh about things than to cry about them.”  These Impossible Things an engrossing novel that would make for a great summer read & book club pick. Salma El-Wardany’s prose, which is by turns lively and poignant, is utterly absorbing. Her setting and dialogues were vibrantly rendered and made Malak, Kees, and Jenna’s stories all the more immersive. While I do have some issues with the El-Wardany’s tone, which often seemed to stray into the kind of sentimentalism I have come to associate with soaps or a certain subset of new adult novels, and how certain discourses (sl*t & victim shaming, casual sex, domestic abuse) are handled, I still found a lot to enjoy and appreciate in These Impossible Things. El-Wardany is able to present her readers with a fairly multivalent interrogation of love (romantic & platonic), sex, and faith, starring three best friends who are struggling to navigate adulthood, to reconcile their Muslim & British identities, to find a balance between self-fulfilment and family obligations, and to negotiate social & cultural pressures.While the novel is certainly trying to integrate intersectional & feminist beliefs in its portrayal of the trials & tribulations of these three young women, there are a lot of scenes and passages that struck me as vaguely moralistic, in the way they present/discuss a certain issue. I also could not help but notice that the one gay character is very much walking and talking cliché of the sassy & Oprah-quoting gay man who exists only to give our straight female heroine relationship advice. The thing that I questioned the most however wasn’t the predictably heteronormative narrative but the author’s choice to make the two Muslim love interests into Bad Men while the white guys are slightly flawed but ultimately Good Men…also, the premise made me think that the book would primarily focus on the bond between Malak, Kees, and Jenna but sadly most of their friendship plays a role in the beginning and in the ending of the book, and the majority of the narrative is spent on dating & romance drama…which maybe I wouldn’t have minded as much if the men in question had been given more shall we say nuanced personalities…but they weren’t. The dynamic between Malak, Kees, and Jenna was the most compelling aspect of the story and yet it is often sidelined in favor of these ‘romances’. Malak, Kees, and Jenna have been inseparable ever since they met as children during Islamic school. Despite their different temperaments and aspirations, the three are a unit and have always consulted one another when making small & big life decisions. In order not to break their ‘circle’ the three friends even go on to attend the same university and even when two of them get boyfriends, they still make time for one another (if anything the boyfriends are the ones to tag along…). And then comes the fight, a fight in which it is not Jenna, who is seen as the more impulsive and outspoken one in the group, but Malak and Kees who exchange words, the kind of words that do damage. The timing of their fight doesn’t help as Malak and Kees have just graduated and are about to embark on different paths: Kees has Harry, her steady & secret white Catholic boyfriend, and is about to start working as a lawyer at a firm that offers legal aid to disadvantaged; Malak instead feels that she has no choice but to break up with Jacob, who is white, as she yearns for a partner who can belong to her community. Reeling from the heartbreak of losing both the man she loved and her friendship with Kees, Malak decides to move to Cairo. Jenna is caught in the midst of Kees and Malak’s falling out, so she finds herself experiencing a newfound sense of loneliness. She has casual romantic/sexual encounters but like Malak she would like to marry a Muslim man. Mo seems to be the ideal candidate for a husband but she doesn’t feel a spark with him…Switching between their perspectives we see how their paths inevitably bifurcate. After she says yes to Harry, Kees can no longer avoid telling her parents about his existence, even when she knows that they will likely never be able to accept him or their love. The author depicts her dilemma with empathy and I appreciated that while other characters, such as Harry’s mum or that colleague of Kees’, are quick to condemn her parents for not being supportive of their union, the narrative doesn’t. When Kees’ sadness over the loss of her parents threatens her relationship with Harry she is forced to confront the depths of her sorrow. Jenna experiences a deeply traumatic event and finds herself attempting to forge a new identity, one that she believes will protect her from such an experience. She decides to pursue a relationship with Mo and ignores intentionally and non the signs that he is imposing his family values & conservative views on her and their relationship. Malak ends up in an increasingly toxic relationship with a Muslim guy who is all for upholding traditions only when others are concerned. But in Cairo Malak is away from her parents and brother, and most of all she doesn’t have Kees and Jenna to look out for her, so she, similarly to Jenna, ignores the many red flags in her new relationship.minor spoilers:With Kees and Malak no longer on speaking terms, the three are no longer the united front they used to be. While they do express regret over their fight, they don’t really try to attempt to mend things, which did strike me as not entirely believable, especially when the people in question were portrayed as being quite fair. Anyway, their minds are more often than not occupied by boy-related drama, and I can’t say that I cared to read about it. Malak is with an abusive asshole. If I had a cent for a book I read in 2022 featuring a woman of Egyptian heritage who grew up in a western country and is now in her 20s and in what some would call a spur-of-the-moment decision moves to Cairo around the time of the 2011 Egyptian revolution where she falls for an emotionally abusive man I would have two cents. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. Now, as I said, I would have much preferred if the friendship had remained the focus of these storylines. Even though they are no longer friends the three still could have thought about one another, and the story could have explored in more depth just how much their lives have changed now that they are no longer friends. I did think it weird that the parents didn’t ask more questions about why their daughters were no longer the inseparable trio they used to be…anyway, with the exception of Kees, family dynamics are also sidelined in favor of these romantic relationships, which was a pity as I thought that the story could have been enriched by having the parents and siblings play a more active role in the narrative. I also thought that Kees, Jenna, and Malak were a bit too defined by their dating status. And their personalities could have been fleshed out a bit more. Their lives outside of dating also remain somewhat unexplored, and we are only given brief glimpses into their jobs. At times they merely seemed like the generic idea of what a millennial woman is like...not so minor spoilers:I cannot stress how much I dislike novels where a young woman is shown to be into casual sex/sexual encounters only as a way of pointing to her loneliness. At first, it seemed that Jenna found casual encounters empowering but no, of course, she then has to reiterate the tired ‘I’m not one of those women’ kind of nonsense and she also has to be ‘punished’ by the narrative for being sexually active. And I hated how that whole plotline was handled. She has this friend, a white guy, and it was quite refreshing to read about a platonic friendship between a woman and a man (both of whom are heteros)...but then the narrative kind of ruins that by having him decide that he can tell her friends about her r*pe without asking her consent or anything but to ‘save’ her from marrying Mo. I mean wtf. But he is not the only white saviour. Harry & Jacob also have their moment and puh-lease. The narrative suggests that Kees, Jenna, and Malak rescued each other but it ignores the saviour-esque role played by these white guys. While I appreciated that the narrative doesn’t do the usual ‘all white cis hetero men suck’, and in fact there are a few instances where Harry, who is very much at peak privilege given that his parents are hideously wealthy, reminds Kees that his white/male privilege doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have feelings and that he can’t be hurt by having to be kept a ‘secret’ from Kees’ family, it annoyed me how unbelievably good he was. Come on. Kees treats him like sh*t and he is so understanding and patient and what have you that he never really snaps. He is shown to be on the verge once or twice but it doesn’t happen. And his goodness irritated me, especially in that scene where he tells a ‘hysterical’ Kees off for being ‘rude’ to her mother. And, I also must acknowledge something else that didn’t quite sit right with me. Out of three friends, Malak and Jenna are dating Muslim men…and they turn up to be different levels of abusive. Mo is a more vanilla type of problematic (he is jealous of other men, forcing jenna to end her friendship with lewis) whereas Malak’s guy is this walking, breathing, and talking Red Flag (his emotional abuse carries the threat of violence).That whole finale was beyond cheesy and required a prolonged suspension of disbelief. It had strong soap opera vibes.I didn’t understand why the characters’ names had to take the place of chapter numbers/titles….the book employs a 3rd pov, so we would know who we were reading about…and what is the point if in Malak’s chapters the perspective isn’t solely Malak’s one? Sometimes we are given insight into the states of mind of other characters or information that Malak/Jenna/Kees couldn’t possibly know.Lastly, there is this weird moment where two characters share a psychic connection of sorts that is unexplained and it was just jarring. I am all for magical realism, but here it was such an odd one-off that it just didn’t work. Despite my criticism, I still found this to be a captivating read. Sure, sometimes El-Wardany’s prose could be oversentimental in its imagery & metaphors (and as a lesbian i couldn’t help but roll my eyes by stuff like “Hearing her moan into his mouth is one of his favorite feelings but he doesn’t really know why. Doesn’t know why swallowing the sighs of a beautiful woman feels like collecting butterflies.” or “[she was] tiredly savoring the aches and stings that come from a man roaming across a woman’s body all night long.”) but it also included many affecting reflections on love, family, and faith. I also found the banter and discussions populating Malak, Kees, and Jenna’s narrative to be really engaging. There were some really witty moments and many heartfelt scenes. I found scenes featuring Kees’ father to be particularly poignant. As I mentioned earlier, the author doesn’t demonize the girls’ parents, nor does she condone their behaviour. While we may not agree with Kees’ parents we will find ourselves unable to dismiss them…I would have loved it if the girls’ familial relationship had been explored in more depth, as they were far more interesting than their dating/marriage drama. While reading this I was very much reminded of Dele Weds Destiny and Three Daughters of Eve, both novels explore love, marriage, and faith and focus on a trio of friends who lose touch after university. While here the ending was very corny and included one too many moments of melodrama, I liked that El-Wardany challenges a monolithic view of Islam and repeatedly questions her characters' idea of what being a ‘good Muslim’ entails and calls them out when necessary.My favorite scenes were the ones with Kees, Jenna, and Malak. Even when they were squabbling I found their chemistry undeniable. They are not perfect, they make mistakes, sometimes of the self-sabotaging variety, but they are given the opportunity to make amends & grow as people. I think we can all agree on the fact that there isn’t a lot of media focusing on the friendship between Muslim women (i can only think of We Are Lady Parts a fantastic series revolving around a Muslim female punk band) so if you are thinking of reading These Impossible Things, I recommend that you do. Sure, some of its dialogues on consent, female sexuality, femininity & womanhood, were a bit ‘dusty’ for my taste, and some could say deeply heteronormative, but I think it’s quite clear where the author ultimately stands on certain issues (such as sa & rape, abortion, domestic abuse, victim-blaming). I wish she could have reined in the drama a bit when portraying some of these issues but it seemed to me that the author’s heart was always in the right place…So, if you are searching for an engrossing summer read that delves into the misadventures of growing up and finding love in all of the right & wrongs places, search no more.“They sit, bodies folded around each other, women young and old who have gathered from different countries, all following the same lines of curled Arabic letters, bodies swaying ever so slightly as the word of God vibrates from a woman’s throat so beautifully that at one point or another, it brings them all to tears.”...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Jun 20, 2022","Jun 21, 2022","Nov 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59228196-these-impossible-things

She makes a few slips up on the job and wonders when her company is going to force her into retirement. Due to the nature of her job Hornclaw leads a solitary lifestyle, her only companion is an old dog whose presence she endures more than she enjoys. She is shown to be fairly apathetic and efficient even if the people around her are quick to dismiss her based on her gender and age. Not only does Hornclaw have to contend with the possibility of her motor and cognitive skills deteriorating but a young male colleague of hers seems eager to embarrass her, talking down to her and making jabs at her techniques. Although mildly annoyed by this Hornclaw doesn’t seem particularly bothered by him however when it seems that his dislike of her may be deeper than what their superficial colleague-relationship entails, Hornclaw can no longer be passive. When he begins to interfere with her jobs and her private life Hornclaw has no choice but to confront him. I was hoping for the story to be more about Hornclaw’s profession rather than the cat/mouse game between her and her colleague. That man is fairly one-dimensional and the way he is portrayed often veers into the cartoonish so I never took him as a serious threat. While we do get glimpses into Hornclaw’s past, in particular the circumstances that led to her entering this line of work and her relationship with her mentor, the narrative relies too much on the ‘telling’ of things. I would have preferred to read more scenes actually showing Hornclaw working, either on her first jobs or her most memorable killings. Hornclaw’s characterisation also seemed a tad uneven. It seemed to me that the author couldn’t quite bring themselves to portray Hornclaw as a ruthless and self-serving killer so we end up with a character who demonstrates very inconsistent characteristics that don’t quite add up. Also, we are told that at one point or another she has cared for two individuals but I didn’t quite believe that as the first instance is the cliched mentee has feelings for mentor shebang and the other was just kind of weird. Lastly, while for much of the narrative we are told about how remorseless and cold-hearted Hornclaw is she actually comes across as frustratingly unassertive and not incredibly good at her job. It would have been more refreshing to see a character of her age and gender be outspoken or even aggressive and arrogant. Hornclaw ascribes her ‘softening’ to her ageing but that seemed a bit of a cop-out. I’m sure that frailty or the possibility of frailty could make one feel more vulnerable or more perceptive and sympathetic of the vulnerabilities of others but it does end up making Hornclaw into a rather corny character. Still, I can't think of another book that is centred on a female assassin in her mid-60s so if you are interested in this kind of premise you should definitely check this one out for yourself....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Mar 09, 2022","Mar 12, 2022","Nov 21, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57910647-the-old-woman-with-the-knife

I wanted to be understood and accepted.” The Red Palace makes for a fairly suspenseful read, one that will definitely appeal to fans of YA mysteries where the lead girl goes all Nancy Drew trying to figure out who the culprit is. And of course, given the setting, Korea in 1758, The Red Palace will likely appeal to fans of historical K-dramas. Personally, I think The Red Palace is the kind of book I would have loved 10 years or so ago. Now, I am a bit more nitpicky and there are a few things that prevented me from being fully immersed in Hyeon’s story. “We are women,” she continued, “and nothing short of death stops us from doing precisely what we wish to do. That is what the laws and restrictions binding our lives breed: determination and cunning. The likes of you will not obey me. You will tell me that you intend to be as still as a rock, and yet I know you will dart from shadow to shadow like a fish.” Hyeon is the illegitimate daughter of Lord Shin, who refuses to acknowledge her as his daughter. In their kingdom, Hyeon is seen as ‘belonging’ only to her mother, one of Lord Shin’s concubines, and therefore belongs to the ‘cheonmin class’ which she describes as ‘the lowest of the low’. Hyeon refuses to grow up into her mother however and dedicates herself to the study of medicine, eventually earning the coveted position of palace nurse. Hyeon hopes that her hard-work and ambition will result in her father’s approval but he continues to largely ignore her existence.Hyeon’s life is upended when four women are murdered at the palace, most of whom were nurses like her. After her beloved mentor is accused and arrested for these murders Hyeon is determined to clear her name. Concerning rumours around the city claim that the Crown Prince is the killer, and Hyeon has no choice but to pursue this lead, even if doing so could potentially result in her ruin. Thankfully, Hyeon doesn’t have to navigate this world of dangerous court intrigues alone as she is aided by Eojin, an actual police officer. Eojin has some personal reasons for wanting to find the real killer so the two decide to combine their efforts. As they confront various people of interest they slowly begin to untangle the truth…of course, not everyone is happy with that and Hyeon risks losing what she’s worked so hard for.The stakes were certainly high in this novel so I found myself reading this in quite a short amount of time, wanting to find out how our leads would manage to bring the real killer to justice.The historical setting is the most well-developed aspect of the narrative. While there were some interactions that had slightly ‘modern’ dynamics (especially between the two leads), overall I liked the amount of detail that went into the setting. The author does use Hyeon as an ‘intermediary’ to the Joseon period (she sometimes forget certain key factors of her society, and asks someone to fill her in, other times she explains about Confucianism or other things that she would not really need to ‘explain’ to herself) but it kind of works as Hyeon does function as an extension of the reader. Her Daddy Issues™ and her role as a nurse are her main defining characteristic, which didn’t make for a truly fleshed out and fully dimensional character. All of the characters, in general, were fairly one-note, even Eojin. The story was more interested in establishing and exploring the setting and the mystery than in developing its characters. I am the type of reader who prefers character-driven stories (rather than plot-driven) so I wasn’t quite able to love this as much as I hoped I would. The mystery itself was a bit predictable, but that’s probably because I have read a ton of thrillers and whodunnits…(and watched one too many scooby-doo episodes/movies). Still, even if the storyline was vaguely formulaic I liked learning more about the Joseon era and I appreciated that the story isn’t romance heavy. Hyeong struggle for self-worth and self-actualization in a society that sees her as ‘less than’ was compelling, and the author also does a good job in regards to her conflicted feelings towards her father (wanting his love and respect while at the same time resenting what he stands for and the way he has treated her and his mother). The writing was at times a bit too dramatic and cheesy for my tastes (“silence fell, as chilling as the shadows enveloping us”, “a thought lurked in the far shadows of my mind”, “we seemed to have, in that moment, merged into one mind with one purpose: find the killer, find the truth”, “revenge begets revenge […] we become the monsters we are trying to punish”, “[her] mouth parted as though in a silent scream”). Still, I recognize that this type of style may very well work for other readers.The romance was surprisingly cute. In fact, the ‘partnership’ between our leads was one of the most enjoyable things about the story. During their shared scenes Hyeon character became a bit more rounded and interesting.All in all, I liked The Red Palace well enough! I would definitely recommend you check this one out for yourself and make up your own mind about it....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jan 25, 2022","Jan 28, 2022","Nov 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56978115-the-red-palace

In spite of what the people around her may think, Joan is okay…isn’t she? On paper Joan has achieved the American Dream, hasn’t she? She’s in her thirties and works as an ICU doctor at a New York City hospital, a job she finds deeply full-filling. Joan’s hard work ethic has earned her respect at the hospital and she’s even due a pay rise. When Joan’s father dies, she flies to China to attend his funeral but, unlike her older brother who stays for a longer visit, she immediately returns back to New York. Her colleagues seem puzzled by her refusal to take time off. Her now widowed mother is staying for a while with Joan’s brother and his family. They keep insisting that Joan should be around more. Her brother, who leads a fairly extravagant lifestyle, nags her about moving away from New York and opening her own practice where he lives. But Joan doesn’t seem to care about money, not in the way her brother does. She also shows no interest in finding a partner or starting a family. She’s content dedicating herself to her work and doesn’t seem to understand why other people may find her choices so baffling. As the narrative progresses Joan begins to feel overwhelmed by others. Her workplace forces her to take her time off to ‘grieve’, one of her colleagues is resentful of her raise and paints himself as somehow having been wrong by the hospital, and her new neighbour keeps encroaching on her private space, inviting himself over and offloading her with things he no longer wants. Then, towards the latter half of the novel, Joan is further troubled by the news of a virus…(you guessed it…covid cameo).Joan’s idiosyncratic narration is certainly amusing and engaging. She finds social interactions difficult and often takes what other people say too literally. Because she keeps to herself others see her as standoffish and weird. Her approach to her work and the unique way she understands the world around her brought to mind Keiko from Convenience Store Woman and Molly from The Maid. As with those characters, it could be argued that the reason why people view Joan as ‘different’ is that she’s neuroatypical. Yet, no one alludes to this possibility, even if Joan consistently exhibits neurodivergent traits…I understand that women and racial minorities ‘slip’ under the radar when it comes to being diagnosed (and are often misdiagnosed) but given Joan’s profession and the country she lives in…I would have excepted someone to mention this or keep this in mind rather than make Joan feel like an ‘alien’ because she doesn’t react or express herself in a neurotypical way. Anyway, aside from that Wang certainly brings to life the character of Joan. Her interior monologue is characterized by a dry yet witty tone. Joan’s acts of introspection are punctuated by sillier asides having to do with sitcoms and social niceties. When coming across other people she does have the habit of listing their height and weight which rubbed me the wrong way. No one can just look at someone and know their exact height, let alone their weight. It also seemed like an added 'quirk' that is a bit stereotypical (of a character who is heavily implied to be neuroatypical and is into a medical/science related field).We also gain insight into her everyday life working at the ICU. Her father’s death and her mother’s temporary move into Fang’s house makes her reflect on their experiences in America, the linguistic and cultural barriers they faced. Joan also considers how her experiences differ from her brother’s ones; unlike her, Fang was born in China and while their parents moved to America he was left in the care of some relatives. Does he resent Joan because of this? Is his fixation with wealth and status an attempt to prove himself?Wang is able to articulate complex and often hard to pin down feelings and thoughts. I also appreciated that there were instances where the author was able to point to what state of mind Joan was in without being explicit about it. We can see that Joan is numb without her telling us. Her deflection and minimisation of her own grief were also very convincing and felt consistent with her character.There are moments where Joan is interacting with her superior, her colleague, or her neighbour, that really convey how uncomfortable she is. Often nothing overtly ‘bad’ or ‘wrong’ has been said but their tones or line of questioning feels invasive or somewhat condescending. Wang also captures the realities of working in a predominantly male workplace. I was reminded of Severance, Edge Case, Days of Distraction, which also explore the experiences of young(ish) Asian American women who have jobs in typically white & male spaces. Wang emphasizes how often (supposedly) ‘well-meaning’ liberals such as her neighbour succeed only in making one feel even more ‘other’. The realism of Joan’s everyday life and inner monologue are contrasted with moments and scenes that verge on the absurd. Some of the secondary characters (such as this random girl who introduces herself as a 'post-millennial') came across as cartoonish, and their presence in Joan’s story felt jarring almost.As the narrative progresses my interest waned. There was a lot of repetition, and some of the situations Joan ends up in felt a bit…trying too hard to be quirky? Kind of a la Fleabag. The inclusion of covid also affected my reading experience. It just stresses me out reading about the pandemic given that we are still in it and no, I don’t care to ‘relive’ those first few months back in 2020. I would have liked fewer scenes with the neighbour or random characters and more page time spent on Joan and her mom, or Joan and her brother. Still, I did find her point of view insightful, particularly when she considers how growing up as the daughter of Chinese immigrants has shaped her and her sense of self. I did find it slightly implausible that she was unfamiliar with so many American things, given that she was born and lived her whole life there...but I guess if you are a truly introverted or asocial person you would have less exposure to popular culture. Still, I could definitely relate to feeling lost or a step behind as there are instances where my English friends and or colleagues say things or refer to things I just don't 'get'.While reading this I was reminded of Mieko Kawakami's All the Lovers in the Night. Both novels focus on women in their 30s who lead rather solitary lives. They do not seem interested in pursuing romantic relationships nor do they care about 'moulding' themselves into their respective society's ideal of a woman (who is often a wife & mother).

Like other fantasy coming-of-age tales, this novel features a talking animal who enlists our human protagonists in an adventure and acts as a guide of sorts into the magical world. Rintaro Natsuki, our protagonist, is a particularly introverted boy who sees himself as a hikikomori. When his grandfather, who was his primary carer, dies, Rintaro inherits his secondhand bookstore. Rintaro struggles to articulate his grief and is unable to truly express how much this loss has affected him. Rintaro stops going to school, staying instead at the bookstore. Here he meets Tiger, a talking cat who makes him join in a quest of sorts. According to Tiger, there are books in need of rescuing and Rintaro is the only one who can save him. Together they travel to four different mazes where they come across bad book owners who have lost sight of what caring & loving books truly means. One owner no longer reads for pleasure but because he wants to read the most books possible in his lifetime. Another one thinks that because people no longer make time to read, the only way to keep these stories alive is to literally ‘cut’ them. The third one cares nothing for old books and is interested in books that sell well. While the last one will truly force Rintaro to question what literature and books in general truly mean. The nature of Rintaro’s quest definitely brought to mind the structure of fairy tales. The lessons Rintaro teaches the owners instead reminded me of Scrooge from A Christmas Carol. Like the ghosts in Dickens' novel Rintaro shows them the error of their ways. While at first these bad book owners seem unbending in their ways, Rintaro is always able to make them reevaluate their attitude towards their books by challenging their behaviour (hoarding books, reading books simply for the sake of ‘reading’ them, without actually connecting to the story, trying to condense books to short summaries, or caring only about the books that sell, well, this is not how someone who professes they love books should act).Rintaro is the classic guileless male protagonist. More than once we are reminded that he is a nobody, no one of interest. And yet for some reason, Tiger chose him as his companion in his book-saving adventures. There is also the classic female character who is a bit of a busybody and for some bizarre reason kind of likes our male mc. There is also a popular guy whose function in this story is somewhat bizarre. He really served no purpose other than to remind us that Rintaro is not one of the cool guys. Tiger, the most interesting character of the lot, is largely underused.The moralistic nature of the mazes also struck me as fairly simplistic. Still, the author does ask some thought-provoking questions about what books/reading mean, whether one should prioritize discovering new voices or deepening their relationship to books they love by re-reading them. Also, in one of the ""baddies"" says that now-days books don't stand a chance as a source of 'entertainment' as one can't read and multitask. Clearly this guy has never heard of audiobooks (i know it technically isn't 'reading' but you nevertheless can 'absorb' a book). I also didn't like that the final villain, who is portrayed as cold and slightly 'off' (in a not-human kind of way), is a woman. I can see this book appealing to fans of Lonely Castle in the Mirror by Mizuki Tsujimura and Colorful by Eto Mori. Similarly to those novels The Cat Who Saved Books focuses on a Japanese teen who doesn't really fit in at school but over the course of the narrative, and thanks to the aid of some fantastical elements, begins to connect with other people his age. Overall this was a fairly engaging read even if it was a bit too vanilla for my taste....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Dec 07, 2021","Dec 08, 2021","Nov 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56755560-the-cat-who-saved-books

I found its protagonist’s lighthearted narration to be deeply compulsive and I was hooked to his story from the very first pages. Similarly to Frying Plantain and The Nakano Thrift Shop Love in the Big City is divided into self-contained parts/chapters, each one focusing on a specific period of our main character’s life. In most of these Young, our mc, is a writer in his early thirties living in Seoul. The gritty realism of his daily life, as well as his love & sex life, brought to mind authors such as Bryan Washington. While this book does touch upon things like homophobia, abortion, STDs, suicidal ideation, it does so in a very casual way that never struck me as offensive or careless. Young is easily the star of the show as he makes for an incredibly funny and relatable character. From his failed relationships to his day-to-day mishaps. Young makes for a carefree and admirably resilient character whose inner monologue and running commentary never failed to entertain me. Love in the Big City also provides readers with a glimpse into the realities of being queer in contemporary Korean society. Yet, while the stigma, shame, and or lack of visibility Young experiences (or is made to experience) are sobering, his voice remains upbeat and easy to follow. Additionally, the author’s vibrant depiction of Seoul makes for a vivid setting. My favourite section was probably the first one, which focuses on Young’s friendship with Jaehee, who for a time is his roommate. Things get complicated when Jaehee begins to lie about Young’s gender to the boy she’s currently seeing. The sections that centre more on Young’s partners, well, they did seem a bit repetitive. Perhaps because most of the men he dates or frequents share a similar kind of dull and off-putting personality. Still, I appreciated how unsentimental the author when portraying and or discussing love and sex.Although I have read a few books by Korean authors that are set in Korea this is the first time I’ve come across one that is so wonderfully unapologetically queer and sex-positive.

Kohda however does try to spice things up a bit by bringing into the mix vampirism: Lydia, our narrator, is in fact a vampire.Lydia is not doing so well. Her mother is a Malaysian/British vampire, her father was a human. Lydia grew up with her mother and knows very little about her father (other than that he was Japanese and a famous artist). Her mother hates what they are and has tried to instil this same self-hatred into Lydia. But now her mother is in a hospice and no longer remembers who and what they are.Lydia, alone for the first time in her life, moves into a studio space for young artists in London and begins working as an intern at an art gallery. In addition to navigating these new spaces and circumstances, Lydia has her hunger to preoccupy her. For some reason, she can’t find a way to get any pig blood and as the days go by she becomes increasingly hungry. She develops a sort of crush on Ben, a fellow artist in her building, but she isn’t sure whether it's because she’s starved (and wants him as a snack) or whether it’s something more genuine. She can’t seem to bring herself to produce any more art and at the gallery is either mistreated or ignored. Worse still, the director of the gallery, Gideon, is also giving her some serious creepy predatory vibes.Lydia is fascinated by human food and spends a lot of her time watching mukbangs, reading food recipes, and wondering how different food tastes. She reflects on her nature, if she has any of her father’s humanity or whether her mother is right and they are monsters. Her vampirism, which leads her to be obsessed with and averse towards human food, does read like a metaphor for an eating disorder. And the vampire trope does indeed lend itself to exploring alienation, as well as things such as EDs.In an interview, Anne Rice described ‘the vampire’ as being ‘outside of life’, thus ‘the greatest metaphor for the outsider in all of us’. And Lydia struggles with her otherness, interrogating her own monstrosity and humanity. Additionally, Lydia is experiencing the fears and doubts that many people in their 20s do: what do you want to do with your life? What kind of job do you want? Where do you want to live? Are the things you want even an option to you? Lydia’s mixed ethnic heritage further exacerbates her sense of being ‘other’. Kohda addresses the kind of stereotypes and assumptions people make about those of whom are of East Asian descent. For example, a fellow artist in her building, and coincidentally Ben’s girlfriend, points out that because she’s Japanese people assume her work is ‘delicate’ (even when it is anything but). I would have actually liked more conversation on art than what we were given but still there are some thoughtful asides on modern art.Lydia spends most of her narrative in a state of misery. Her self-hatred and hunger occupy her every thought…until she finds something (or something) to eat.This was a relatable if depressing read. While a lot of other books from this ‘disconnected young women’ literary trend are characterized by a wry sense of humor, Lydia’s narration is devoid of any lightness. Her narration is unrelentingly miserable. This made her interior monologue, which makes up the majority of the novel, a bit of a chore to read through. Her navel-gazing was dreary and I often found myself losing interest in her introspections. The narrative felt oppressive, which in some ways does mirror Lydia’s lonely existence but it also makes her story repetitive. There were only three recognizable side characters, the others being little more than names on a page, and they all felt vague. Lydia’s mother was perhaps the most interesting figure but she mostly appears in flashbacks where she is preaching about their monstrosity and the danger of being discovered. Ben was a generic boy who came across as an only half-formed character (he only said things along the lines of ""i don't know..""). The gallery director…I appreciated how the author is able to articulate that specific type of unease (of an older man, possibly your colleague or superior, being ‘off’ towards you) that I am sure many young women (sadly) know. But then the role he plays was somewhat forgettable? He is there, to begin with, and then fades into the background only to appear at the very end. The storyline lacked focus. It meandered without any clear direction. And this can work if your narrator is engaging or compelling enough but Lydia wasn’t. She was pitiable but pitying a character has never made me feel inclined to ‘read’ on to find out what happens to them.Still, the author’s prose was fairly solid and certain passages even reminded of Hilary Leichter and Sayaka Murata (very matter of fact yet incredibly peculiar, especially when it comes to the 'body' or bodily functions: “My mum’s brain, which sits in a body just metres away from me now, must contain the memory of eating whole meals, of the feel of her body processing those meals, of tasting different flavours.” ).The way vampirism operates in this world is not clear-cut and I think that really suited this type of story. I did question whether pig blood would be truly so hard to get ahold of and why Lydia didn't try to get ahold of some other source of food sooner...This novel did not make for a satisfying meal. I never felt quite sure whether I liked what I was being offered and then once it was over I found that I was still hungry. While I liked certain elements and the central idea, the story, plotline, and characters were different shades of average. More than once I found myself thinking that Lydia's story would have been better suited to a shorter format (as opposed to a full-length novel). Still, even if this novel failed to leave a mark on me I look forward to whatever Kohda writes next....more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,"Jan 25, 2022","Jan 26, 2022","Nov 11, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57504855-woman-eating

Bearing this in mind, here goes my inexpert . Having read On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Vuong I was quite looking forward to dabbling in his poetry. Time is a Mother however proved to be hard to get into. Most of the poems in this collection made absolutely no sense to me, even if I read them twice. While there was the occasional striking line I found the imagery and language of these poems to be simultaneously too confusing and rather laboured. Many of the poems try too hard to be gritty, so we have lines about blood, pain, and other ‘edgy’ things. We then have a lot of lines that just struck me as tumblr poetry material. In all honesty, I just struggled to understand or make sense of these poems. Vuong’s style was (to my eyes of course) overwrought. Bar the occasional effective line, these poems did not resonate with me. His language was affected and ultimately lacking in actual depth and emotion.I will say that my mounting frustration at my inability to understand or enjoy them did inspire me to read more poetry in general so that hopefully one day I will re-visit this collection and find a newfound appreciation for it....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Nov 22, 2021","Nov 26, 2021","Nov 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58582927-time-is-a-mother

Similarly to a lot of these books, Queen of the Tiles takes place in a ‘confined’ setting, but rather than going for the usual prep school/high school type of backdrop, Hanna Alkaf freshens things up by having her story take place during the World Warrior Weekend, an annual Scrabble competition. This tournament takes place in a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, a setting that, you must admit, we don’t get to see often in YA. Additionally, our lead is Muslim, and we also get a very casual non-binary rep with Shuba. The story definitely has some strong The Queen’s Gambit vibes and the author depicts the various Scrabble games in a really fun and dynamic way (so that they are anything but boring) and we can see just how devoted and ambitious some of the competitors are.Najwa Bakri, our narrator, is taking part in this tournament, the first one she's done since the very sudden death of her best friend.“Every player knows that words can be twisted to suit your purpose, if the board allows it, and Trina knows this better than most. She is fantastic; she ignites fantasies. She is spectacular; she attracts spectacle.”Trina Low died during the previous year's World Warrior Weekend. Since her death, Najwa has distanced herself from the Scrabble world, but she finds herself going back to claim Trina’s former title, that of the Queen of the Tiles. She knows that people who didn’t like Trina, and who were in turn not liked by her, are also vying for that title, and Najwa isn’t ready to give them the satisfaction of winning. Competing again however proves harder than it used to be now that Najwa is struggling with anxiety and trauma caused by Trina’s premature death. The author is really thoughtful in the way she articulates Najwa's grieving process, capturing just how suddenly grief can engulf you, regardless of how much time has passed since the person you cared for died. Alkaf also shows how grief manifests differently in different people.Things get harder when new posts appear on Trina’s long inactive insta. Cryptic posts hinting that her death may have been very much not an accident. Joining a long tradition of kid-turned-detectives such as Nancy Drew and the Scooby-Doo gang (both of which get mentioned in the story), Najwa begins solving the posts’ ominous word puzzles and starts questioning the other competitors, most of whom were foes of Trina. There is the pompous boy she was competing against when she died, who seemed less concerned by her dropping dead than verifying whether her death meant he’d automatically won that final round. There is Trina’s ‘other’ best-friend, an ostensibly nice and obsequious girl whose subservience to Trina definitely gives off sycophantic vibes. There is that girl who was caught in a cheating scandal, and Trina may have been responsible for stoking those cheating rumours. And, of course, Trina’s off-and-on again boyfriend Mark, a possessive type who may have grown tired of Trina’s and what he perceived to be as her ‘blasé’ attitude. While Najwa has always been aware of Trina’s thorny character, and her need to prove herself and to one-up others, during the course of her ‘amateur’ investigation she will be forced to really confront the kind of person Trina was.“That’s just how she was; she saw something she wanted and she went for it with a laser-sharp intensity that could border on the obsessive. All or nothing, perfection or perish.”I liked the drama, the secrecy, the rumours and gossip. The Scrabble element was really well delivered and it worked really well for the mystery clues. My only quibbles are 1) throughout the story Najwa links words that are being used or were used in a game to her past or present situation. Sometimes this was effective, but the more this device was used, the less impactful it became, and at times I found the connection between word and situation to be a bit far-fetched 2) Najwa's 'tells' got pretty annoying.The characters weren’t particularly fleshed out or memorable, some were verged on being rather silly but this subgenre isn’t exactly known for having uber nuanced characters so it didn’t really negatively impact my reading experience. I would have however liked for Trina to have been portrayed in a slightly different light, as she ultimately seems a bit of a mean queen-bee cliché. I liked the lack of romance and Najwa made for a rather endearing protagonist. Their resolution to the mystery was a bit of a letdown, as I found the identity of the person behind those posts far too obvious. It would have been more satisfying to make someone else the culprit. There was also a metaphor about Mark being ""a conquistador, trying to impose his will on Trina, colonize her spirit and reap her charms for himself, bend her to his definition of what a girlfriend ought to be"" which struck me as a rather unhappy comparison to make. In general, I did like the references we get, especially when they added a dose of humor and levity to the story's ongoings (“Honestly. Murder. What do you think this is, an episode of Riverdale?""). Still, I found this engrossing and fun read. If you are looking for a light-hearted whodunnit that focuses on a group of ambitious and possibly backstabby professional scrabblers, look no further....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"May 13, 2022","May 15, 2022","Nov 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58476100-queen-of-the-tiles

In fact, one could even say that I quite liked The Embassy of Cambodia. Smith’s adroit storytelling is characterised by a razor-sharp social commentary and a trenchant sense of humor. While I was overall able to appreciate this short story, I still do find Smith’s brand of satire to be a bit too mean for my taste. Her portrayal of her characters sometimes strike me as exaggerated, and she does seem to have a propensity for ridiculing the people who populate her works (regardless of the role they play in their story). The Embassy of Cambodia follows Fatou, a young woman employed by a wealthy family based in Willesden, London. Unbeknownst to her employers, Fatou swims at the health centre that they are members of (using their membership). On her way to the pool, she walks past the embassy of Cambodia and occasionally catches sight of a shuttlecock going back and forward behind the embassy’s walls. We learn of Fatou’s friendship with Andrew, a fellow immigrant who is working a min. wage job despite his education. Together they talk about politics, history, and Christianity. The two for example discuss the possible reasons why in Europe very few people know, let alone speak of, the Rwandan genocide but seem ‘fixated’ on the Shoah. We also learn of how Fatou’s employers treat her, from their racist comments to the fact that they have her passport (meaning that Fatou is not free). While by the end of the story Fatou’s circumstances change, it isn’t sure whether her new path will lead to happiness or safety.The Embassy of Cambodia was a quick and relatively engaging read.

Rather than giving us ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ This is one of those cases where the blurb for novel spoils said novel. Rather than giving us a broad-stroke summary of the story, the blurb reveals almost every plotline in the story, so while I was actually reading the novel myself, and I kept expecting something ‘new’ to happen, well, I ended up feeling rather underwhelmed. That is not to say that Dele Weds Destiny is not a good debut, I mean, I didn't love it, but I recognise that the writing is competent, the dialogues are (for the most part) charged, and the setting is strongly rendered. Alas, the storyline just doesn’t offer much besides what is mentioned in the blurb. I can see this appealing to fans of Liane Moriarty or books like Nikki May's Wahala, where a group of friends reunite as adults, with some of them being married, others having children or wanting children, and others still are career-focused…I was hoping for Tomi Obaro to add something new to this rather tired premise but the dynamic Funmi, Enitan, and Zainab, the three Nigerian women whose friendship is meant to be the core of the novel, is sadly fairly one-note. The narrative very much reminded me of my least favourite novel by Elif Shafak's Three Daughters of Eve, which also presents us with an older woman looking back to her time at university where she (supposedly) became friends with two very different girls (one is more conservative, the other seems to embrace a more liberal lifestyle). In both books the girls don't really strike me as real friends... The first 40% of the narrative introduces us to former college friends Funmi, Enitan, and Zainab, who are now in their middle-age, as they reunite in Lagos to celebrate Funmi’s daughter’s wedding. As we follow Enitan and Zainab making their way to Funmi’s house, we are given an understanding of their current circumstances: Enitan, who is based in New York, and her husband Chalres, a white American, are getting divorced and their teenage daughter, Remi, now resents her, but not their father; Zainab’s has become a carer to her older husband Ahmed, after he suffered two strokes. Funmi seems to enjoy a lavish lifestyle and is not interested in asking her husband about his ‘shady’ business. Her daughter, Destiny, is by all appearances a devoted daughter, who is respectful of her elders and fulfilling the life her parents want her to. But Funmi wishes that she could have a more meaningful relationship with her, as Destiny seems to hold her at a distance. The story in this first part is very slow going, and a bit too heavy on exposition. The middle section of the novel takes us back to their crucial college days, where we are given an impression of 1980s Nigeria's climate of social and political unease as well as a more detailed impression of the friends’ respective upbringing and social statuses. Now, I wanted to see the friendship evolve slowly, as they find themselves putting aside assumptions they may have made upon first meeting one another, or bond over shared commonalities…but the narrative kind of skips over that. Their friendship struck me as one of convenience, and to be honest, even putting that aside, their bond… was not that much of a friendship even. Funmi and Zainab are obviously at odds, and they seemed far more involved with their respective men than anything or anyone else. Enitan was the classic inoffensive go-between whose characterisation also ends up getting sidelined in favor of introducing us to Charles. The men themselves were forgettable, and I didn’t really care for them or their supposed feelings for our protagonists. Anyway, I kept thinking that this ‘then’ section would unearth something more than what the summary had detailed but no, not really. So I was kind of frustrated by it having to occupy such a big chunk of the narrative, as it doesn’t reveal anything new or flesh out the characters either. The final section takes us back to the present where the narrative obviously parallels the experiences of their children with their ones at college. I wouldn’t have minded the focus on mother/daughter dynamics if said daughters had been credible. Destiny is the dutiful daughter, who is prepared to give up her dreams to live the kind of life her parents want her to (marrying the ‘right’ man, getting the ‘right’ degree). Remi is the kind of simplistic teenage girl that I have sadly come across one too many times in adult/literary fiction. This teenage girl often blames her mother for her marriage troubles (in some cases even if the dad cheated on her or worse). She has this supposedly liberal mindset and cares about social issues but when she goes to a different country or enters a different community or comes across people more disadvantaged than she is she will reveal how ignorant she is when it comes to politics, history, etc. If she’s rich or spending time with rich people she will act all outraged by their having cleaners or whatnot but then she isn't even capable of washing her own clothes or cleaning her room. If she blocks a toilet she will not think to unblock it herself but ask her mum for help…this girl inevitably has an eating disorder, or sometimes she self-harms because that’s what teenage girls do nowadays. I am just tired of reading about this kind of caricature of a teenage girl…Remi was embarrassingly childish and petty, the way she behaved towards her mother is so f*cking frustrating and I don’t understand why adult women portray teenage girls as so superficial and unlikable, whereas they will give other characters both flaws & virtues. Argh. Also, I kept thinking that Dele and Destiny would play more of a role given that they are the ones mentioned in the title but they do not. Anyway, Remi aside, the characters were okay. They weren't particularly nuanced but then again given the Liane Moriarty-esque premise I was expecting in-depth character studies. But this book lacks the in-group tension and the gossipy atmosphere that make Moriarty's books into such easily entertaining, sometimes even gripping, escapades. It's, by all means, an okay debut novel. I just wanted more drama, more friendship, just more. I didn't care for how the narrative incorporates plotlines including an abortion and a miscarriage, and treats these in a rushed and unsatisfying way...Now for some positives: as I said, Obaro's dialogues and setting were for the most part evocative, and I particularly enjoyed her insights into past & present Nigerian culture. I also appreciated that she doesn't moralise or judge her main characters. They are not perfect, and sometimes they act or say things that are downright yikes, but, she never judges them for their choices & attitudes (to have casual sex, to wait to have sex until you are married, to find contentment in being a housewife, to be silly and romantic, to be studious and serious). She may poke fun at them, especially when they are being a bit hypocritical or whatever, but she's playful, never cruel. If you are interested in this I encourage you to read more positive s as this may as well be your next great read.

Sadly, the structure and length of the narrative do the story no favors, as the final product ultimately struck me as formulaic in a-MFA-program type of way. Sure, Devi S. Laskar quite effectively utilizes a 2nd pov, which is no easy feat. Beyond this stylistic choice, the novel doesn’t have a lot to offer. This is the kind of narrative that strikes me as being more interested in presenting its readers with a certain evocative style than introducing us to dimensional characters. The structure of the novel struck me as somewhat inconsistent. At first, it brought to mind books like All the Water I’ve Seen Is Running, Friends & Dark Shapes, and Another Brooklyn, in that it honed in on specific moments of Heera's youth, but as the story progresses the narrative loses its atmosphere as it switches to a telling mode where it covers large swathes of time with little fanfare so that I felt at a remove by what Heera had experienced.  Circa is centred on Heera, ‘you’, an Indian American teenager who is coming of age in Raleigh, North Carolina during the late 80s. Heera hangs out a lot with siblings Marie and Marco, often in secrecy as her parents do not approve of her friendship with the Grimaldi children. Together they rebel the way some teenagers do, disobeying their parents, and sneaking behind their parents’ backs. Sometimes they steal from their parents or strangers, other times they do edgy eff society type of graffiti. Anyway, Heera is smitten with Marco, kind of. Eventually, something bad happens that changes their dynamic, and Marco reinvents himself as Crash, while Heera finds herself having to grapple between her sense of self-fulfilment and her parents' desires. Should she go to college? Marry? Can she or does she want to do both? The author does highlight the limited possibilities available to a woman, specifically a woc, at the time, juxtaposing her path to Crash’s one. Sure, the author does provide an all too relevant commentary on the American Dream, stressing its elusiveness, and a poignant enough portrait of a family caught between generational and cultural differences, however, the whole Crash/Heera dynamic really was deeply underwhelming. Marie is very much a plot device, someone who is used as a source of trauma for Heera and Crash, someone who is supposedly meant to make their bond all the more complex…but she was so one-dimensional and served such a disposable function in the story that I really felt like she wasn’t a character, let alone a rounded person. Crash seemed the male version of a pixie girl, not quite as extra ‘that’s literary me’ type of guy (who is thinks he is the narrator from fight club or the joker), more of a vanilla sad-meets-bad boi. Heera in many ways is rather a passive presence, and I was unable to understand her obsession with Crash, let alone believe that the two shared an intimate bond. I think the story is at its best when it hones in on domestic moments, in particular in Heera’s interactions with her parents or when exploring the tension between her family and the Grimaldi. I think I would have liked this story to have solely focused on familial and platonic relationships, rather than going for this wattpad type of romance (‘i can fix him’...come no). The latter half of the novel strays into melodrama, with quite a few characters disappearing because of actual reasons and or no reasons. A whole portion of Heera’s story is delivered in such a rushed and dispassionate way that it really pulled me out of her story. Given the premise, I was hoping for something with more oomph. The ‘crucial’ event isn’t all that important in the end, as the distance between Crash and Heera could have easily happened without that having to occur. The ‘betrayals’ mentioned in the summary lead me to believe in a story with more conflict, whereas here the will-they-won’t-they relationship between Crash and Heera brought to mind the milquetoast straights-miscommunicating-or-having-0-communication that dominated in much of Normal People. I think it would have been more effective if the author had either opted for a longer and slower-paced storyline (which would have allowed her to expand certain scenes, rather than just relating important moments in a couple of sentences, and made the characters more rounded) or if she had fully committed to a snappier snapshot-like narrative (a la What We Lose or Ghost Forest). I mean, this wasn't a bad read but it is the type of book I will forget about in a few weeks or so.

We want to be like Jesus. Or like Shiva. Or like whomever you pray to.”How to Escape from a Leper Colony presents readers with a collection of interconnected tales that are a blend between the fantastic and the prosaic. Tiphanie Yanique’s prose is striking: her style carries playful, fabulist almost, undertones that perfectly complement the dreamlike quality of her narratives. This sense of surreality is further intensified by the use of repetition and recurring motifs. The characters populating these stories are often at a crossroads, caught between who they want to be and what others (or themselves) think they should be. The choices they make are not always for the best, and they often experience heartbreak, loss, desire, and shame. Yanique explores familial relationships, in particular the fraught bonds between children and their parents. Religion too plays a role in these stories, but each character has a unique relationship to their faith. Many of the stories revolve around characters who are attempting to find out a place where they belong. Death too is a recurring theme, particularly in those stories centred on a funerary home. While the setting remains unnamed and is only referred to as a Caribbean island (presumably Saint Thomas?), Yanique is still able to evoke a strong sense of place and there are some truly vibrant descriptions of the landscapes surrounding these characters. The dialogues too convey a strong sense of place as Yanique is able to capture different lilts and vernaculars.The only reason why I am not giving this a higher rating is that I believe this is the kind of collection that is meant to be re-read in order to be truly appreciated. I sometimes felt a bit disorientated by the way these stories were interconnected.My favourite stories were the titular 'How to Escape from a Leper Colony' and 'The International Shop of Coffins'. I loved how within these stories Yanique strikes a perfect balance between melancholy and humor. The unresolved nature of these narratives also added to the collections' overarching magical realist tone. How to Escape from a Leper Colony is a promising collection that will definitely appeal to fans of Edwidge Danticat and Mia Alvar. I definitely plan on reading more by Yanique!...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jan 17, 2022","Jan 18, 2022","Oct 26, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/15795042-how-to-escape-from-a-leper-colony

While there were scenes within Kaleidoscope that struck me as witty & moving, the pacing and sort-of-but-not-quite non-linear timeline didn’t feel particularly compelling. In the opening chapter, we witness one of the Brighton sisters' most difficult experiences, and we are given a glimpse into their intense yet sometimes uneasy relationship. The following chapters switch to the younger sister’s pov, and sadly I am rarely a fan of books switching between 1st and 3rd povs. Anyway, a good chunk of the story is told directly by Riley Brighton, who is Chinese American, and has always felt in her sister’s shadow. Riley is a rather aimless loner who struggles to reconcile herself to life. Her beautiful older sister, Morgan, has always played a more active role in the family’s business, Kaleidoscope, a shopping empire started by her parents and a friend of theirs. While we don’t learn too much about Kaleidoscope, other than how it started and the kind of merchandise it sells (a lot of goods imported from india) and the kind of demographic it appeals to, many aspects of this business remain unexplored, which is a pity as I wish the narrative could have incorporated more fully discussions on consumerism and cultural appropriation. Anyhow, we learn that Riley and Morgan’s bond was a bit codependent, and once they reach their college years, their relationship becomes somewhat fraught. Add to the mix James, who is Morgan’s new bf, and Riley’s sort-of-crush and things get complicated. When tragedy strikes, Riley is left reeling. Her parents offer no comfort, and Riley is drowning in guilt. As her relationship with her parents' sours, Riley decides on a ‘healing’ journey.“At what point, she asks herself, is a person entitled to feel badly for themselves? Who gets to judge? What are the criteria for comparing heartbreak?”A lot of the time the motivations of the characters escaped me, but not in a way that made them realistically idiosyncratic or compellingly ambiguous…I just found their actions random and to very much serve as convenient plot-devices to get us from A to B. Riley, our protagonist remains a mystery to me. She tries to articulate her difficulties in life, her feelings towards Morgan, James, her parents, and her own identity..but does so in a way that really succeeds in conveying her various states of mind, fears, and desires. That the narrative switches to a 3rd after ‘it’ happens, also distanced me somewhat from the events of the story. There is a large chunk of the book where nothing really happens, nor are we given much insight into the characters…and then around the halfway mark, possibly even after, we finally get that ‘trip’ that was mentioned in the book’s summary. I rather disliked it when book summaries mention something that happens waaaay late in the story, especially when they imply that this will be a major aspect of the storyline….and here it just wasn’t. I didn’t like the trip at all, as it struck me as and bordering on eat-pray-love vibes.I also really didn’t like that Riley and James’s relationship takes precedence over Riley and Morgan’s bond. I just can’t help but compare this to two of my favourite novels that explore complex sister dynamics, Sunset and Yolk. There, the sisters are messy, sure, and we don’t always understand them, but the authors are able to portray them in such a vivid way as to make them utterly believable. Here Morgan is at best a very thinly rendered character…maybe if we had more flashbacks exploring the sisters’ relationship prior & after Kaleidoscope, Morgan & Riley's relationship would have come across as more rounded…as things stand I struggled to take them seriously, and it was frustrating that Morgan’s character is sidelined in favour of this boring & dodgy guy. Maybe if Riley and his grief had been rendered in more depth, maybe then I could have been more willing to accept the idea that she & James found solace and comfort in each other…as things stand I didn’t like how their romance is framed as if it’s the real deal, and even if Morgan was perfect James could only love Riley because she’s just so ‘real’ and different. Ma fammi il piacere...The ‘discovery’ they make on their trip seemed convenient as it gives their romance more legitimacy (that morgan had hidden stuff from them).Now, one of my biggest complaints actually has to do with the parents. The mother is ridiculous, and nothing she did or said struck me as realistic (she's even named karen). The father barely has a role so I can’t say anything about him. If the focus had remained on the family dynamics I would have probably been able to appreciate this more. The non-linear timeline and the switching of perspectives didn’t really contribute much to the story, if anything they detracted from would have been an intimate and nuanced drama about sisterhood, grief, loneliness, and identity. Those chapters following the opening (which felt a bit random now that i think back to it as i don’t get the point of starting the story with that scene) were actually quite promising, and the 1st pov made Riley feel more real and sympathetic. But after the tragedy, not only are we distanced from the ‘action’ thanks to a switch to a more detached 3rd pov, but we get far too many melodramatic scenes involving Riley’s mum, her ‘journey’, and her romance with James. I can’t stress enough just how much I disliked the romance, which was cheesy & predictable.I wish that Wong could have addressed certain issues & realities into more depth, as certain serious topics receive a somewhat rushed & superficial treatment. All in all, I can’t say I liked this. Riley’s earlier moments of introspection did appeal to me but as the narrative progressed my interest waned. The sisters should have remained at the forefront of the story, and they don’t. Most of the characters are cartoonish. The pacing is all over the place. And the romance was yikes. This is a pity as the story did have the potential of presenting its readers with a complex interrogation of identity & grief as well as the messy dynamic between sisters.

That is not to say that is bad but I did find the story and characters to be bland and very much been-there-done-that. This could have worked if the narrative had presented us with a more compelling protagonist than Rosie who is a painfully generic teen who yearns to be seen as one of older teens and not a kid. Every summer she and her parents stay at a lake house in Awago Beach. There she reconnects with Windy, her childhood friend, who is a year younger than she (a fact which rosie is low-key embarrassed by). Rosie’s parents are going through something and Rosie acts like an entitled brat. She begins renting horror films in order to impress a boy who is clearly a bad egg, going so far as to slag-off other girls. Windy, however one-dimensional, was a much more likeable character. Rosie’s angsting, however ‘understandable’ given that her parents are fighting and she’s currently traversing those painful & awkward teen years, still irked me. She elicited very little sympathy on my part. Whereas the story in Skim never bored me, here I found many scenes to be redundant and repetitive. There was something vaguely moralistic about the ending too and Rosie’s ‘growth’ didn’t entirely ring true. Still, the illustrations, while a bit more conventional than Skim, are lovely and if you are a fan of the Tamaki duo, well, you should consider giving this one a chance....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Nov 16, 2021","Nov 17, 2021","Oct 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18465566-this-one-summer

Skim is a compelling coming-of-age story that is bound to make you feel nostalgic for the mid-2000s (even if you, like me, didn’t strictly ‘come of age’ in that time). Skim captures the angst, confusion, heartache, and loneliness experienced by its titular character with empathy and insight. Kimberly Keiko Cameron, who goes by the nickname of ‘Skim’, is an aspiring Wiccan goth enrolled at a private girls school. She has a best friend who is very much vocal about her dislike and contempt for the ‘popular’ girls or anything she deems mainstream. When Katie Matthews, one of said popular girls, is dumped by her boyfriend who then goes on to commit suicide, well, the school is thrown into chaos. Some students are very much into performing their grief, exaggerating their connection to the boy and the impact that his death has had on them. Others cluster around Katie, their attempts at comforting her bordering on the oppressive. The staff is made newly aware of the importance of their students’ mental health and identify Skim, a quiet Goth, as someone to keep their eye on. Skim herself sinks further into depression as her only friend becomes increasingly toxic. When Skim develops an infatuation with one of her teachers, well, things get even more complicated for her.I liked how this graphic novel avoids the usual teen coming-of-age tropes. Skim may be a bit of an outsider but, as we see, the social hierarchies within her school aren’t wholly inflexible (not all of the popular girls hate her or are portrayed as boy-crazed & vapid). Additionally, just because you aren't part of the popular clique, does not mean you are necessarily a nice person (take Skim’s BFF for example). At times you can grow apart from a friend without any real ‘reason’. Much of the story reads like a slice-of-live dealing with suicide, depression, alternative culture, sexuality, and first love. The narrative never felt moralistic or contrived and I loved the pacing of the story. Skim was a likeable and relatable character who is dealing with a lot of different emotions and can’t quite make sense of what she wants or who she wants to be.In addition to loving Mariko Tamaki’s storytelling, I adored Jillian Tamaki’s illustrations. Her style has a sketchy edge to it that goes hand in hand with Mariko’s narrative.I loved how at the ending two characters come together and it is left open to interpretation whether their relationship is platonic or romantic. I did wish for a slightly longer conclusion, but then again, that just may be because I did not want to leave Skim and her world behind. The teacher-student relationship could also have been addressed a bit more. Still, these are minor things and I would happily read this graphic novel again & again....more",Notes are private!,0,34,2,"May 17, 2022Oct 20, 2021","May 19, 2022Oct 22, 2021","Oct 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2418888.Skim

After reading it, I went into this novel expecting to be a tale about this couple who buy a possibly evil home smart speaker only to discover that said home speaker is a mere speck in the story and that the events described in the blurb don’t really happen on the page but have already come to pass by the start of the novel. This Thing Between Us opens with Vera’s funeral. Her death leaves her husband, and narrator, Thiago bereft. He refers to Vera as ‘you’, a stylistic choice that might as well appeal to other readers, but one that does zilch for me. I find this device gimmicky at the best of times and in this case it contributed nothing to the story or it did not help in making ‘you’ (aka Vera) into a fully dimensional character. Maybe this was intentional, after all, she’s dead by the start of the novel so we never truly ‘meet’ her, however, I would have still preferred it if her character had been fleshed out (flashbacks, for instance, would have helped). Anyhow, Thiago is definitely not doing so well after her death, a death which turns out was very much a public affair. The media and various political parties try to spin her death in their own favour, or try to use it to further their agendas. Thiago couldn't care less, he just wants to be left alone. Other people’s grief and sympathies alienate him further and he finds himself increasingly aware of a sense of wrongness in his house. He eventually leaves Chicago for a remote cabin where, surprise surprise, things take a turn for the worst. Here the story definitely brought to might The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones. This is yet another horror novel that did not really affect me all that much. I wasn’t creeped out or horrified or even preoccupied. Part of it is because Thiago as a character bored me. I found him very generic and despite the majority of the narrative constituting his internal monologue, well, I did not feel as if I knew all that well. The guy is grieving for sure, but I would have liked to see more of his personality (other than he’s sort of an introvert). His voice didn’t captivate me nor was I invested in his character. While the author does dedicate a lot of time to Thiago’s grief and grieving process, he seems to lose focus of Vera. She’s very much a blank, and I wish that her death had not happened off-page prior to the beginning of the story. The horror/paranormal angle of the story was also ultimately a letdown. As I said above, I thought this would be more about Itza, the speaker, but, turns out this was more of a supernatural/cosmic horror kind of tale. At times I was reminded of Pet Sematary (but lite). The lack of secondary characters also made the story harder to get through. So much of the narrative revolves around Thiago, a guy I was not particularly keen on. In the latter half of the novel things pick up somewhat but I found a lot of the events predictable. I was hoping it would subvert certain horror tropes but it ends up dishing out the same tired horror stuff (your protagonist has a dog? guess what happens…). The gore was eeh...not quite as gratuitous as other horror novels but nevertheless unnecessary if you ask me. Having those scenes didn’t upset me, however, they made me roll my eyes once or twice.If you want to read this novel I recommend you check out more positive s. If you, like me, added this to your tbr thinking it would be about a knock-off Alexa gone bad, I suggest you look elsewhere because this book has very little to do with technology (but rather it gives us the same ol’ cosmic horror)....more",Notes are private!,1,69,1,"Oct 12, 2021","Oct 15, 2021","Oct 12, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56269269-this-thing-between-us

Despite the introspective nature of this work (there are no dialogues and the few conversations that occur are summarized by our narrator), I felt a certain distance from the narrator and her musings had a remoteness to them that I was never quite able to immerse myself into her story. That is not to say that this was not an enjoyable read. It brought to mind authors such as and Rachel Cusk as well as María Gainza (Optic Nerve is a personal favourite of mine). These kinds of books are not plot or necessarily character driven but they present us with a series of observations regarding art, travel, places/spaces, memory, connection, and human nature. Similarly to Jhumpa Lahiri's Whereabouts, the people that our nameless narrator speaks of remain unnamed, and the vagueness surrounding her and others struck me as very much intentional. The narrator, who lives in, you guessed it, an unnamed country, and her mother, who is based in Hong Kong, meet up in Tokyo for a holiday.“It was strange at once to be so familiar and yet so separated. I wondered how I could feel so at home in a place that was not mine.”The narrator describes the various landscapes and locales she visits, all the while thinking back to her and her mother’s pasts. We are given brief glimpses into their lives that are often somehow connected to their present journey. This is the kind of novella that is more about creating and sustaining a certain nostalgic mood than of presenting us with a particularly immersive story. While I did appreciate the narrative’s melancholic and reflective atmosphere, I did find my attention wandering away from our protagonist’s contemplations and introspections. Her relationship with her mother often fades into the background, sidelined in favour of eloquent observations that don’t really leave a lasting impression. The title in many ways is rather apt as this novella is in many ways like snow. At first, you are taken in by how beautiful it is but within a couple of hours (or days), well, the snow has melted. That is to say, the beauty of Cold Enough for Snow is of a temporary nature. Still, if you are a fan of travel journals or the authors I mentioned above you may find this to be your kind of read.“I had wanted every moment to count for something. I had become addicted to the tearing of my thoughts, that rent in the fabric of the atmosphere. If nothing seemed to be working towards this effect, I grew impatient, bored. Much later, I realised how insufferable this was: the need to make every moment pointed, to read meaning into everything. ”...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Nov 17, 2021","Nov 20, 2021","Oct 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58470820-cold-enough-for-snow

Like that novel The Swimmers at first seems to implement a playful choral ‘we’ as our perspective. The ‘we’ in question are the people who regularly swim at a local pool in an unnamed town. Otsuka details the swimmers’ relationship to the pool and swimming, often poking (gentle) fun at them. While she does often differentiate between the swimmers, contrasting their routines etc., they remain a united entity for much of these chapters. The pool becomes a microcosm of the real world and Otsuka’s satire is particularly effective when a mysterious ‘crack’ appears in the pool, causing confusion and uncertainty among the pool-goers. Some panic and flee, some quit swimming altogether, some begin spreading conspiracy theories about who is behind the crack, some keep on swimming and refuse to look at the crack, and so forth.The tone is definitely the defining characteristic of these two chapters as the characters are beside the point. They serve a comedic function and their personalities are intentionally kept off the page. Repetition is of course a consequence of employing a choral point of view, especially one that at times comes across as a joke that has gone on too long. These two chapters/stories could have easily been condensed into one and I think it would have made for a more effective and engaging read.The following chapters/stories revolve around one of the swimmers, but once again the author implements more indirect narrative devices (often there is the ‘you’). The character in question is Alice, a Japanese American woman who shows signs of dementia. While the author does give us an overview of her life and background, by referring to her as ‘you’ or by avoiding using her name she effectively makes Alice into a blank-slate, or perhaps, less of a blank-slate and more of the 'every-elderly-woman', ie. the epitome of the elderly person experiencing memory loss, confusion, and an increased lack of motor skills. Her daughter, who happens to be a writer, too was very much a non-character, as she is often referred to as ‘you’. There was a lack of intimacy and depth in these characters (and their relationship to one another) that diluted the impact of what could have been a potentially poignant story. There is even one chapter from the point of ‘Belavista’ a ‘memory residence’ where Alice is eventually taken to. Here the author wryly points to the way elderly people who are no longer able to live independently and need more help than what their relatives can provide them with are treated by these places (eg the patronizing language).The specificity with which Otsuka writes about Alice’s ‘dementia’ definitely rang true to life as I am temporarily living with someone who has dementia and boy oh boy it is definitely not a walk in the park watching someone slowly lose their physical and mental capacity.

Jacob combines different media to discuss a number of issues and topics. Jacob transports to the page the difficult conversations she’s had with her son about race, while also recounting her own experiences growing up as a first-generation Indian-American. Much of Good Talk takes place against the 2016 election, which doesn’t necessarily make for easy or enjoyable reading material, especially when we discover that her white in-laws are Trump supporters. Jacob struggles to ‘gloss’ over their political stance, especially when her son begins asking difficult questions about Trump and racism. While her husband, who is white, also struggles to make sense of his parents’ behaviour he does at times minimise Jacob’s experiences with discrimination and racism (chalking these episodes to misunderstandings or claiming that supporting someone who is openly racist and misogynistic doesn’t mean you are those things too). While many of the conversations that are depicted in Good Talk have to do with America (or at least view these topics through an American lens) certain, Jacob does also touch upon colorism in India.In addition to discussing Trump and 9/11, Jacob also gives us insight into her private life, from talking about her family to her experiences moving in predominantly white spaces and to the everyday microaggression that results from that. The dialogues populating this memoir always rang true to life, so much so, that I felt as if I was truly listening to people talking. While Jacob does discuss serious topics, such as racism, sexism, islamophobia, discrimination, colorism, she often injects humor in these discussions. I especially loved her talks with her son and her parents. I’d happily revisit this and I’m looking forward to reading more from Jacob.Candid, thought-provoking, and ultimately moving Good Talk is a quick read that is a must-read....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 06, 2021","Oct 07, 2021","Oct 06, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36700347-good-talk

Alas, as it often seems to be the case, Our Wives Under The Sea did not work for me. If you are interested in this novel I recommend that you check out more positive s.At first, I gave this novel the benefit of the doubt, but with each chapter, my expectations sunk (ah-ah) lower and lower. This is one of those novels that prioritises language over say characters or story, which is something that I’m sure will work for many types of readers, it just so happens that I am not one of them. Through alternating chapters, Our Wives Under The Sea follows wives Miri and Leah. Their marriage and relationship are very much in limbo after Leah returns from a deep-sea mission gone awry. The experience has clearly altered Leah and Miri struggles to reconcile herself to the fact that the woman she married is no more. In Miri’s chapter, we read of Leah’s strange behaviours: she takes long baths, avoids leaving the house, has frequent nose-bleeds, and seems wholly disassociated from her surroundings. Miri’s chapters also give us some insight into their relationship prior to this disastrous mission (how they met, how they were as a couple, etc.). In Leah’s chapters, which are far shorter, and are meant to highlight her alienated state of mind, we mostly learn about what went on in that mission. “Every couple, I think, enjoys its own mythology, recollections like notecards to guide you round an exhibition.”In spite of the intimacy achieved by focusing solely on Miri and Leah (secondary characters are very much at the margins of the narrative), I found the novel’s overall tone cold. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, I like plenty of authors who write in this slightly ‘distancing’ way (Jhumpa Lahiri and Brandon Taylor come to mind). However, I have to care or be interested in the people they write about. Here, surprisingly enough, I found myself feeling nothing for either Miri or Leah. Their voices were too similar, something that I found rather frustrating. Their inner-monologues and their observations (about others, the past, themselves) were eerily alike. Which made it difficult for me to see them as individuals, but rather they merged into this one water-obsessed figure. And speaking of water, gesù. We have water metaphors and imagery, water-related speculations, and conversations on water/sea/ocean/sea creatures. I understand that the water & the sea are central themes of this novel (if not the theme) however it got repetitive and, worse still, contrived. The author’s language was impressionistic, trying too hard to be direct and gritty (""red mouth in the morning, red chin, red spill into the sink"" / ""Miri bit at her skin of her lip so often that kissing tasted bloody; metallic zip of a licked battery""). Her prose was too dramatic, full of flashy metaphors (""beneath her shirt, the bones of her shoulder swing the way a hanger will when knocked inside a wardrobe""). There were paragraphs or reflections that I liked or that struck me as insightful and sharp but I wish that I’d felt more attached or emotionally invested in the story. I had a hard time ‘believing’ in our two main characters, perhaps due to a combination of their voices sounding too much alike and they were both so...water obsessed? Their personalities were vague and the author seemed more intent on evoking a certain atmosphere than on providing us with fully dimensional and nuanced characters. All in all, this novel was a big disappointment. I went in thinking that I would love it, realised a few pages in that the writing was going for this simultaneously dreamlike and raw sort of vibe (which did nothing for me here) and found myself bored by most of the narrative. It didn't elicit any particular feelings or reactions in me. This is the kind of novel that screams MFA. It wants to be stylish and edgy but (and here i remind you that i am merely expressing my own entirely subjective opinion so please don't @ me) but feels contrived and unconvincing. A lot of the dialogues didn't ring true to life, characters' reactions were slightly off, and the narrators' voices were much to similar (that occasionally they address the reader or say things like 'you see' made it all more gimmicky)....more",Notes are private!,5,416,1,"Oct 12, 2021","Oct 14, 2021","Oct 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58659343-our-wives-under-the-sea

It’s not just a job or a passion, but it is at the very heart of how I exist in the world, and I am addicted to the adventure of storytelling as my most powerful means of communication.” In Manifesto Bernardine Evaristo presents us with a retrospective of her life: from her childhood and family dynamics to discussing her love life and career. Her candid, often humorous, voice grabbed me from the get-go and I found myself speeding through Manifesto. Not only does Evaristo have a knack for bringing various episodes and periods from her past to life but she always pairs these with a piercing and thought-provoking social commentary.“You feel hated, even though you have done nothing to deserve it, and so you think there is something wrong with you, rather than something wrong with them.”Manifesto is divided into several sections, each one exploring a different aspect of Evaristo’s life. In the first one, ‘heritage, childhood, family, origins’, Evaristo recounts her experiences of growing up in England in the 60s with a white mother and a Nigerian father. She describes her early encounters with racism, from witnessing the discrimination aimed at her father to the racism she herself experienced at school and in her neighbourhood. Her mother’s side of the family was openly against Evaristo’s parents' union, some of them refusing to speak to any of them or treating them with open disdain. While Evaristo is critical of their behaviour she does take into account the social mores that people like her grandmother grew up with, and while she doesn’t condone or minimise their behaviour and actions she does acknowledge how hard it is to free oneself of such a deeply ingrained mindset.“It was an early lesson for me as a child, witnessing how people who are victims of oppression can turn into oppressors themselves.”In addition to discussing race and racism Evaristo looks at her relationship with her father, and once again demonstrates admirable self-awareness as she considers how when growing up she saw her father as a strict tyrant, whereas now she recognises that his parenting was simply reflective of a different culture. Additionally, she realises how alienating his life in England was (being more or less out-of-touch with his family, to being deemed a second-class citizen, an ‘undesirable’). Evaristo’s account of her father’s experiences in England highlights the racism and discrimination endured by the Windrush generation. I found her exploration of her relationship with her father to be deeply moving and this section, despite its subject matter, was easily my favourite in Manifesto.In the following section, ‘houses, flats, rooms, homes’, Evaristo looks back to the various spaces she’s lived in since leaving her home. Many of the episodes she recounts are rather humorous, as they feature eccentric housemates & landlords as well as some bizarre living arrangements. This section reminded me of the tales my mother (who is a few years younger than evaristo) used to tell me about her odd living situations in London and Berlin when she was in her 20s. In describing the various rooms she’s lived in Evaristo considers the meaning of ‘home’.“Writing became a room of my own; writing became my permanent home.”In ‘the women and men who came and went’ Evaristo gives us a glimpse into her romantic and sexual exploits. In detailing her various partners she speaks about her own sexuality and power dynamics within a relationship. Once again Evaristo demonstrates a great understanding of human behaviour and is unafraid of challenging her old views/ideas. While I loved how open Evaristo is in examining her sexuality and her past and present relationship, I was frustrated by her binary view of sexuality. On the one hand, she says that sexuality is a spectrum and yet she also compares her sexuality to a sandwich (my lesbian identity was the stuffing in a heterosexual sandwich) and speaks of having had a ‘lesbian period’. The thing is, saying that one had a ‘lesbian era’ carries certain implications ( that this period is over, that it was a phase). After a particularly toxic relationship with an older woman Evaristo only actively seeks relationships with men, ‘rediscovering’ them, so to speak. Which, fair enough...but that does negate her previous interest in women? Why only use labels such as straight and lesbian rather than queer, pan, bi (etc etc)? That Evaristo couples her lesbian era with her discovery of feminism and politics is even more...sus (as if it was simply an accessory in her counterculture outfit). FYI, I’m a lesbian and I’m not a fan of people saying that they have had lesbian periods or phases (or people assuming that my own sexuality is a phase and that i will inevitably 'revert' to heterosexuality). And given that Evaristo did initially speak of sexuality as a spectrum, well, it makes it even all the more disappointing that she would go on at length to talk about her queerness as an ‘era’. Still, even when discussing her sexuality Evaristo incorporates other issues & factors into the conversation (class, gender, race, politics, age) so that even this section (in spite of its somewhat dated view of sexuality) has an element of intersectionality.In ‘drama, community, performance, politics’ writes about theatre. While her love for theatre is apparent she’s once again able to be critical, in this case, she highlights how racist and sexist this particular sphere of the art was and still is (from the roles made available to poc to the few opportunities that woc have in comparison to their white, and often male, peers). Evaristo goes on to discuss performativity and rejection. In the fifth chapter, ‘poetry, fiction, verse fiction, fusion fiction’, Evaristo continues to consider her ever-evolving relationship with her creativity, this time focusing on her writing. She gives us a glimpse into the early stages of her writing and provides us with some insight into her creative process. The way Evaristo talks about her work made me want to read it, a great sign I believe. While she now and again expresses some criticism towards her earlier ideas and stories, you can tell how proud she is of what these have achieved. While her experimental style is not something I usually would go for, the way she discusses her ‘fusion’ style is certainly inspiring and interesting. In ‘influences, sources, language, education’ Evaristo talks about the books and authors that influenced her as a writer. She speaks about the importance of representation, of finding one’s voice, and of resilience (in face of rejection etc.). In the final chapter, ‘the self, ambition, transformation, activism’ Evaristo discusses politics, the publishing industry and the academic world (both of which still are very white) and the various prizes and schemes she created or had a hand in creating that seek to elevate Black and Asian writers. There was one paragraph here that was a bit jarring as it starts with “The impact of Geroge Floyd’s murder in May 2020” and ends with “Many plans are afoot to open up. These are exciting times”. We then have a concussion in which Evaristo gives us a quick recap of what we’ve so far read and briefly writes of the impact of having won the Booker Prize.All in all, this was a solid piece of nonfiction. My favourite sections were the first one, which focuses on her childhood and family, and the second one. While I did appreciate the other chapters they at times had a textbook-like quality. I also got tired of frequent ‘back in those days’ refrain (we get it, “there was no internet” back then) and at times she explained things that didn’t really necessitate an explanation (again, just because some of your readers are younger than you does not mean that they are ignorant of what came before them). But apart from her occasionally patronising asides, I did find her voice equal parts compelling and incisive. Her wry wit added a layer of enjoyment to my reading experience. This is a work I would certainly recommend to my fellow book lovers, especially those who loved Evaristo’s fiction. I liked Manifesto so much that I have decided to give her Girl, Woman, Other another go (fingers crossed).

While it bears many of the same elements and stylistic qualities as Intimacies, which is Katie Kitamura’s latest novel which I did not particularly care for, here, well, they kind of work. Similarly to Intimacies, A Separation is narrated by a nameless and nondescript female character. We never learn anything substantial about their backstories and their personalities remain blank. For some reason, in A Separation, this narrating voice works. Whereas reading Intimacies felt to me like an utter waste of my time, A Separation proved to be a much more thought-provoking novel.A Separation follows a woman who is separated from her husband, a serial cheater. They have not officialized their separation and not only are they legally still married but his parents still believe they are together. When he goes missing on a research trip in Greece his mother pressures our narrator to go find him. Our narrator, who is now in a new relationship, acquiesces hoping that she will be able to get her husband to agree to a divorce. Once there however she realizes that he has truly vanished. She obverses the staff in the hotel, speculating on the whereabouts of her husband, wondering how and why he has seemingly disappeared, leaving his possessions behind.I was transfixed by the descriptions of the landscapes and people encountered by our main character. The uneasy scenario our mc is in resulted in a taut atmosphere. Her ambiguous narration proved hypnotic and I felt transported alongside her to this remote region in Greece. While the uncertain nature of her journey and her husband’s unknown whereabouts resulted in a gripping storyline, this was not a fast-paced or plot-driven story. This is a very introspective and reflective work that explores themes of unity and separation, absence and presence, longing and loss, foreignness and belonging, deception and clarity.I loved the mood of this story. The drawn-out waiting for our mc does may bore some but I found this wait to be enthralling. The tension between her and the other characters (the employees, the husband, her mother-in-law) captivated me. Her piercing narration was particularly rewarding. Not only does she express herself in such an adroit, articulate, and alert way but I found her speculations and observations to be razor-sharp. The author juxtaposes her clarity of vision with her intrinsic vagueness. We learn virtually nothing about her history or who she is. Her crystal-clear narration is in fact rather deceptive as all the while she keeps herself hidden. This ambivalence certainly complemented the precarious atmosphere of her stay in Greece.While I did find much to be admired in this novel it is not the type of reading that will leave a long-lasting impression on me. It did succeed in making me a fan of this author even if I did not care for her latest novel. I can see why many gave A Separation a low rating. Nothing much happens and for all her navel-gazing the narrator remains a stranger to us. It is the type of novel that at the end may very well make you say ""what was the point of all that?"". But, if you are in the right mood for a more muggy exploration of a fractured marriage and the limits of language, that succeeds in being both elusive and incisive, well, look no further. Subtle, erudite, and meditative, A Separation will certainly appeal to fans of psychological fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,34,2,"Jul 09, 2023Sep 26, 2021","Jul 13, 2023Sep 27, 2021","Sep 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30407998-a-separation

This is one of those books that was ceaselessly frus❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ Ponti, Ponti, Ponti...what a vexing read. This is one of those books that was ceaselessly frustrating and, dare I say, ultimately pointless. What was this book even about? There is no story, not really. We don’t even get satisfying character studies to make up for the plotlessness of Ponti. The characters are thinly-rendered and unfunny caricatures that for 99.99% of the novel remain unchanged in their behaviours & attitudes. Given the comparison to authors such as Elena Ferrante and Emma Cline, I went into this hoping for a story about fraught and complex female friendships and found myself bitterly disappointed as the one friendship we get is not really a friendship, not at all.I will try to give an impression of what this novel is about but you will have to bear with me as, as I stated above, this novel doesn’t really have a plot. The narrative is set in Singapore and the chapters alternate between Szu, Circe, and Amisa. Szu’s chapters take place in 2003 when she’s sixteen, Circe’s in 2020, and Amisa’s take us from the late 60s to the 80s. Amisa once starred in an indie horror trilogy called Ponti. After that, her acting career never took off and she goes on to live a rather miserable life. Her daughter, Szu, both reveres and is discomfited by her. Because of her ‘horror’ past, Szu becomes obsessed with the genre and the Ponti trilogy in particular. Szu is alienated from other girls and spends most of her school days creeping her classmates out. She eventually falls in with Circe, who is from a wealthy and fairly stable family. The two allegedly become friends but in adulthood, they no longer are in touch. I guess the reason for their falling out is what is meant to propel the storyline but my god did it drag. I felt no interest in seeing how their falling out would unfold as I never bought into their friendship. The two are horrible people. Szu’s personality revolves around her supposedly ‘macabre’ love for horror and gory stuff. That’s it. If you were to strip off that, she would have no discernible traits. Circe is an acerbic bitch who spends most of the time being a selfish little brat. As an adult, she manages to be even more grating. Amisa’s chapters, which are told in the 3rd person, do not give us much insight into her or her past. What we learn about her life there, well, we’d already learnt about it in Szu’s chapters. The ‘humor’ involves a lot of girls being catty about other girls, more often than not Szu thinking mean things about Circe & Circe saying bitchy things to Szu. The way they describe other women/girls is fairly vile.This kind of toxic dynamic does work when say done by authors such as Ottessa...but here, it just fell flat. The characters were so one-note and often sounded very much like the same person. The dark humor promised by the summary doesn’t really come through. The narrative tries to be edgy and gritty by having passages dedicated to Circe talking about her tapeworm or our various characters taking shits. Wow, how s u b v e r s i v e. I’m shook. Most of the chapters came across as repetitive as they give us time and again the same glimpses into these women’s lives. Their inner-monologues added no depth to them, if anything, they made all the more unbelievable and indistinguishable from each other. Everything is abject: one’s body, other people and their bodies, Singapore, womanhood. Every character has greasy hair and oily skin, which is fair enough, but these are often regarded with repulsion by our mcs. Again, if the author had managed to pull off’s Ottessa’s biting humor, maybe this could have worked but as things stand it just felt forced.I kept on reading hoping that at some point the story would take off but it never does. Nothing major happens nor do we gain more insight into the characters and their various dynamics. This was a waste of my time. The only thing this book succeed in was in establishing the setting of Singapore. That's about it. The characters are 1 dimensional & vile, the non-existent story goes nowhere, and the prose tries & fails to be edgy/gritty.

Even Having already acquainted myself with Jen Beagin’s absurd realism and fucked up humor in Pretend I'm Dead, I knew what to expect from Big Swiss. Even so, I was surprised by just how unhinged a read Big Swiss is: it is bizarre, gross, offensive, hysterical, and over-the-top. This is the type of narrative that is difficult to pull off. But Beagin does. She doesn’t try to make her central character more palatable to the audience, she doesn’t sanitize Greta’s internal and external monologues, nor does she try to excuse or provide reasons behind her most deranged actions. A lot of books try to pull off this type of character but few authors commit to really writing about a woman, in this case, a woman in her 40s, who is able to be so convincingly and unapologetically gross, pathetic, horrible, and inappropriate. Thankfully, Beagin doesn’t try to make her central character edgy, *looking at you boy parts*, instead we are presented with an uncompromising yet ultimately compelling narrative about a woman’s outlandish, selfish, and delusional antics as she searches for love, meaning, physical and emotional connection in some very questionable places.Big Swiss is an outré romp populated by bizarre characters and ridiculous, surreal even, interactions, that manages, despite its freewheeling humor, to be surprisingly endearing and emotional. Thematically and stylistically reminiscent of the work of Mona Awad and Ottessa Moshfegh, the central character in Big Swiss, Greta, also brought to mind Sabina Murray’s awful yet fascinating narrator in A Carnivore's Inquiry, and, surprisingly, Emerence from The Door, an unreliable housekeeper apt to behave irrational (fairly sure she regularly gets her employer’s dog drunk). Greta, our main character, is a woman in her 40s who is living with her friend Sabine in a rundown Dutch farmhouse in Hudson, New York. She transcribes the sessions of a sex therapist who calls himself ‘Om’ and soon grows deeply obsessed with one of his clients. This client, a Swiss married woman in her 20s, is dismissive of wellness culture and despite having been assaulted some years before, she abhors terminology such as ‘trauma’, ‘victim’, and ‘survivor’. Stoic and blunt, this woman fascinates Greta. Eventually, the two meet while out with their respective dogs, but Greta avoids revealing who she really is. The woman, who Greta refers to as ‘Big Swiss’, is very much unlike Greta, both in her outlook on life and in her present circumstances.Greta uses the knowledge she has accumulated through Big Swiss’ therapy session, about her personal life and beliefs, to give the idea that she is far more perceptive and in tune with Big Swiss than she really is. Despite the little in common they have, Big Swiss is serious, restrained, repressed, and even, humorless, whereas Greta is uninhibited, frenzied, and a bit of a slob, they are both very intense. Their electrifying affair seems to hinge on their mutual feelings of attraction and repulsion, which results in a very, to use a word they would both hate, toxic dynamic. The knowledge that the man who attacked Big Swiss has just been released exacerbates Greta’s paranoia, as she believes that he is following them. The novel comprises a lot of weird, unlikely, and puzzling, interactions as every single character who populates this book is strange. There are a lot of running gags almost, and much of what Greta does or thinks is tinged with a note of hysteria so that we never quite predict what she will do and what she is capable of. Far from condoning her behavior, the author makes Greta into a rather pathetic character who is not particularly self-aware, the opposite really. Not only does she disregard social norms and pc-language but she is very neglectful towards herself and has no qualms about crossing people’s boundaries. There are so many elements that give her story an absurdist quality: the farmhouse Greta lives in is also home to a dyeing beehive, Greta's codependent relationship with her dog, the fact that Greta almost never uses Big Swiss’ real name, Om's practices, his patients, Greta’s ex (that whole section really reminded me of pretend i'm dead) , and Big Swiss herself. No one acts really ‘sane’, or how you would expect them to, which gives the narrative a rather boisterous energy.As we learn of Greta’s childhood and her fraught relationship with her mother we gain an understanding of the possible roots of her oddness, from her lack of self-preservation to her inappropriate behavior, yet, learning this will no means make her into less of a terrible person in our eyes. I appreciated how Beagin manages to capture the resentment and sadness that are specific to a child or young person who is living with a suicidal parent.The fucked up sense of humor sometimes wasn’t always effective, and there were some instances where Greta’s remarks about the ‘woke’ youth of today or her diagnosing her dog with ‘“trans-breed dysmorphia of the soul ” or thinking that Sabine was “anorexic—both traditionally and sexually”, that tried to be provocative but struck me as obvious. Still, Greta’s unpleasant commentary about the people around her is certainly captivating. She’s childish, sordid, selfish, and impossible, yet also strangely magnetic and certainly very entertaining. Although the people around her could be seen as caricatures, they fitted with the narrative’s absurd tone. I liked her strange yet touching bond with her dog, Piñon, and the baffling yet comical discussions/interactions with the people around her (om, his patients, sabine). The one character who I wasn’t particularly fascinated/amused by was Big Swiss herself. If she did appear interesting, to begin with, it was only because she was the object of Greta’s desire. You want to know why Greta would become so fixated on this younger woman who sure is physically attractive but is certainly not particularly charming or intelligent. I think we are meant to find her aloof, but to me, her bluntness and stoicism did not make for a particularly gripping character. Especially when Greta often attributes her more 'surprising' responses to her being Swiss. The novel’s portrayal and exploration of sex and sexuality brought to mind Melissa Broder's Milk Fed and Susan Choi's My Education, both of them also revolve around the affair or secret relationship between two women. Similarly to them, Beagin opts for these very unsexy scenes that often rely on turgid imagery. Yet, Beagin succeeds in making Great and Big Swiss’ sexual exploits funny, and those scenes give us an idea of the dynamic between the two of them. Given the secretive nature of their relationship, the narrative also plays around with themes like infidelity, jealousy, and obsession. Beagin’s discussions around grief, loneliness, self-destructiveness and depression are often unconventional yet ultimately affecting. I found myself both deeply relating to Greta and feeling very much alienated by her. She rarely thinks things through, and tends to think only in terms of 'now'. Yes, she's awful, but she is also very funny and all too human. While I now that there are plenty of contemporary books focused on women who are not feeling good at all, they usually tend to focus on younger women (perhaps their youth is meant to make their flaws, their directionless, their solipsism, their numbness more 'palatable'). Here instead we have an older character who just keeps making mistakes and questionable choices but doesn't seem to particularly care about how the rest of the world sees her. Greta may be a looser but she's my kind of looser. Anyway, all of this to say is that she has the best lines in this book. Big Swiss is a madcap read. While I wouldn't recommend it to everyone if you are a fan of authors like Awad, Moshfegh, Broder, Choi, and Sam Cohen chances are you will find it to be a blast. If you also happen to be into female-orientated cringe comedy shows like Fleabag and Bubblegum, chances are this will be up your street. It's kinky, irreverent, silly. While Beagin's satire is by no means subtle I ended up buying into how preposterous her characters were and the weird scenarios and shoddy circumstances they find themselves in. Playful yet dismal Big Swiss makes for a candid read exploring love, sex, and obsession. ...more",Notes are private!,0,146,1,"Feb 07, 2023","Feb 10, 2023","Sep 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50361265-big-swiss

This is one of those cases where I am forced to ask myself: did I read the same book as everybody else? And before you @ me, no, I did not dislike this book because it is work of satire centred on an (exaggeratedly) intentionally unlikeable main character. Some of my favorite books focus on people who are varying degrees of horrible or 'messy' (my year of rest and relaxation, luster, madame bovary, sula, pretend i’m dead, you exist too much, apartment, symptomatic, these violent delights, and a lot of the stuff written by authors such as shirley jackson, danzy senna, and joyce carol oates). I also like characters like Hannibal or Villanelle. I read Lolita and while it did repulse me (as intended) I didn’t hate it because it was from the pov of a p*dophile. And I am fond of the 'she’s not feeling too good' subgenre, contemporary books that are characterized by a caustic tone and explore the lives of women who are, you guessed it, not feeling too good and are depicted as alienated and self-sabotaging … I also do not have a problem with books combining dark humor with violence, My Sister the Serial Killer is a fave of mine. And a few months ago I was enthralled and disturbed by Titane directed by Julia Ducournau (who actually gets a mention in boy parts). All of this to say is that I can deal with and even appreciate characters who for whatever reason do, think, or say things that are ‘frowned’ upon or downright evil. I would go as far as to say that I prefer flawed characters over flawless/uber-likeable characters (very edgy of me, i know). My only caveat is that I have to find said unlikable characters interesting: Emma Bovary, for instance, is not a particularly clever character, you could say she is quite the opposite. She’s naive, pathetic, obnoxious, solipsistic, cruel, and superficial…but I found her acts of self-dramatization to be both fascinating and a source of great amusement. Ottessa Moshfregh’s narrator in MYORAR is nasty (she is awful to her supposed best friend, callous, narcissistic, morbid, and says/thinks offensive things about many groups of people). Did I condone her actions in the novel? No. Did I find her f*cked up sense of humor to be highly addictive? Yes. This is all to say that Irina being a stronza who engages in ‘bad’ behaviour, is not why I didn’t like this book. The reason why I did not like this book has less to do with her being an unlikable c*nt and more to do with her being boring as f*ck. Her internal monologue is repetitive, but not even in a realistic navel-gazey way, like Selin’s narration is in The Idiot, but in an incredibly affected way that just comes across as the book desperately trying to present this character as some counter-culture edgelady, who repeatedly ‘transgresses’ accepted norms of behaviours and—shock horror—flips the ‘male gaze’ on its head by being the one behind the camera. Maybe if this book had come out in the 80s, I would be more inclined to forgive or accept its many shortcomings, but since it was published in 2020 I have a harder time reconciling myself with its unimaginative and superficial exploration of female sexuality, the male gaze, and female rage. There is nothing clever about the way the narrative represents and discusses these themes. The narrative is very much all flash, no substance (tutto fumo e niente arrosto) as it not only mistakes shock value for real horror but it operates under the false assumption that gratuitous or otherwise sensationalistic content is subversive and thought-provoking. If this book had actually been disturbing maybe then I could have overlooked its pulpy and overt storyline…but it isn’t. Funnily enough the story’s numerous floundering attempts at edginess, but these feel dated and painfully affected, on the lines of Awad's Bunny or Mariana Enríquez who at least do not settle for mid-tier levels of offensive but f*cking commit. Boy Parts reads like a short story that has been stretched beyond its expiry date. The ‘hook’, that of a ‘pervy’ female photographer, had potential for the first 30% of the narrative. Then things just get messy, and not a good kind of messy where I am enthralled by our mc’s unreliable and increasingly disconcerting narrative, but messy in a poorly executed kind of way. The writing changes slightly, but not in a believably organic way that reflects the main character’s spiralling mental health. The book’s satire is devoid of substance or bite. The caricatures populating this narrative are neither amusing nor particularly provocative. Some characters come across as heavy-handed attempts at capturing a certain type of person, while either serve no function other than to exist so the narrator can prove to the readers how nasty she is. The story could have been a lot more effective if the tone had been camped up, so we could have something along the lines of Jennifer’s Body (which is by no means a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and self-aware). Or maybe if the book had gone for a more elliptical stream-of-consciousness type of storytelling, a la Clarice Lispector, maybe then I would have liked it more. But what we got just did not work for me at all. There was something profoundly simplistic about the way these themes are explored and the narrator is one of the dullest galls I have ever had the misfortune to read about. Being a tall and sexy white Northern who thinks she’s the f*cking hardcore because she likes to take kinky photos of men she deems ‘beta’...yeah. The way the book satirizes England's art scene is banal, we get unfunny lines about identity politics and artists such as Tracey Emin. The narrative doesn’t convey Irina’s creative process in a convincing way, in fact, I was left with the impression that—and here i must briefly break from my death of the author approach and acknowledge the existence of the author—whoever was behind the story was either not particularly familiar with photography or not interested in going into detail about it (as i said this an impression i formed, not a fact). As examinations of female creativity go, this one is derivative and unsatisfying. I mean, compared to We Play Ourselves, Self-Portrait with Boy, and Generation Loss  (all of whom happen to focus on queer young women who are not portrayed as exclusively interested in men and in replicating tired dom/sub dynamics) Boy Parts just doesn’t go much into depth when it comes to Irina and her changing relationship to her photography. I didn’t feel that she actually felt passionate about these photos, rather, we are told what she did at a school, and she relates the art she produced in that period in a very meh way, and now she gets horny when she tells men to pose in vanilla sub positions, while she occasionally plays the dom role (stepping on them and sh*t). Like, wow. How edgy. And you might say that the narrative is less concerned about mapping out the creative process preceding these photos than with over-emphasising what the photos themselves signify. Male gaze who? Uhm. Sure. Thing is, this kind of obvious ‘appropriation’ of the male gaze and the misogyny often underlining said gaze is not new nor thought-provoking. Quite the opposite in fact. I found the logic at play in the narrative to be highly sus: Irina experiences misogyny and is objectified by the male gaze; Irina perpetuates misogyny + misandry and objectifies men, her models in particular. Irina has a sexual encounter where the partner doesn’t listen to her when she says she wants to be on top. He ignores and demands her to scream for him, yanking her hair. She says that since he is going to ignore her he ‘could put his back into it’. He takes this as a confirmation that she ‘likes it rough’. Quelle surprise, she later has sex with someone she deems weak who asks her to slap him she starts hitting him until he starts crying and this leads to the classic ‘victim becomes abuser’ kind of observation that doesn’t really go deeper than that. If anything it is annoying that we get that scene just so the mc can have this dark eureka moment. Early in the story, Irina goes to a party where she is meeting up with a guy who is there to make fun of the ‘I’m a Nice Guy Really’ type of men who claim they are feminists while trying to wrangle themselves out of being accused of SA. Anyway, she goes to this party with her spineless friend who reminds her that even if she acts all hardcore she is a vulnerable woman. Our mc makes a joke about being raped by the guys she’s hanging out with and what later follows is an intentionally unclear scene where it seems that this guy the mc went to see tried to r*pe her while she was passed out or was otherwise incapacitated and therefore not being able to give consent. I really hated how timed this whole thing was. It was rather tasteless. I have come across other books that punish female characters who are confident in their sexuality or sexually active by resulting in scenes where they are SA or need a man to ‘save’ them. And here…this whole r*pe subplot seems just there for shock value and nothing else. The narrative seems to forget about it, more intent on emphasizing how edgy and obscene the mc is. F*cking hell. Can we not?! I am not saying that I want every story to include r*pe or SA to be serious and to exclusively revolve around this. However, the way the narrative meanders about without any real direction or without the kind of piercing commentary that makes up for vacuous storylines…I am left wondering why, why, why did we get this scene? Especially when the narrative seems confused about the kind of character Irina is. It seemed we were meant to perceive her as a vile character. Not quite a Humbert Humbert type of figure but someone who is working their way towards being the female equivalent of Patrick Bateman. She’s apathetic, has an inflated sense of self, experiences moments of dissociation where she observes the people around her with a mixture of superiority and detachment seems to categorize men in a way that is all the rage in the manosphere, and makes no compunction about transgressing accept norms of behaviour, engaging in sadistic behaviour, or deriving pleasure from what her society deems taboo (r*pe fantasies etc.). She can also perform certain roles, such as that of the Manic Pixie Girl, to her advantage, for example when she wants to attract the kind of men who would be into that type of girl. Irina, so far, seems a satirical take on the femme fatale. Yet, we also get so many instances that go against what this kind of characterization is trying to establish. For instance, she forgets that she has to perform a certain role and says whatever the f*ck comes to her because she’s such a girlboss. Sometimes she would make observations or remarks that would be believable if they originated from someone ‘normal’ or who was not shown to have psychopathic traits. For example, after that guy forces himself on her…she wonders about whether she really wanted rough sex and why do women feel that they have to say yes to rough sex etc…which is a valid af point but I did not believe that someone like Irina would even bother to have such thoughts. She should have been annoyed that someone of no consequence had physically overpowered her. Previously her response to being SA at the party was to be annoyed that that non-entity guy had the gall to try to r*pe her. But then we are meant to believe that she was in fact traumatized by this so much so that now she herself is subjecting others to the type of trauma she was victim to. Like…what is going on. And don’t get me started on how large chunks of the narrative make her abuse of men seem so f*cking transgressive and hardcore when it was anything but. There is a storyline involving, you guessed it, ‘boy parts’ that was just a rip off from American Psycho (in that we are meant to question the veracity of irina’s recollection of these violent events). Anyhow, the man who Irina abuses most happens to be a lot younger than her and, unlike her, despite the story's initial attempts at painting her as a struggling artist, her name is known in artsy circles and she can afford her living expense and the type of materials required to print out her edgy photos, he works at Tesco. Additionally, he is mixed-race, possibly queer, and was involved with someone abusive (emotional abuse is still abuse fellas). So, did I find Irina's SA him, gaslighting him, humiliating him, mistreating him, etc, empowering? Not really. Sure, the narrative shows us just how ‘pathetic’ and ‘sad’ he is about his messed up relationship with Irina but his experiences bear no real weight on Irina’s narrative. He serves as a plot device through which Irina, a character who is supposed to be very much beyond caring, can inflict the trauma she herself was subjected to. Also, for someone who goes on scathing takes about ‘white people’ who pretend they are not ‘white’ but dance to The Smiths in this 'post-racist-Morrissey’ era and expresses frustration about the misogyny and classism rampant in her day-to-day life…it seemed weird that she would think sh*t like this (""I know I’m white, but there’s just a lot of white people White People-ing in a very small area, like it’s just some very, very densely packed mayo, you know? Densely packed mayo, jiggling about, doesn’t know what to do with its arms, doesn’t know what to do with its feet, undulating loosely, barely in time to the rhythm."") but actually says sh*t like this to the mixed-race boy she is toying around with (‘It’s fine for you being out in this heat; you tan. You’re always tan. You look like you’ve just been on holiday or something,’) or this (Japenese/Korean girls being the 'same thing'). It would have made more sense if she’d said that first thing out loud, to impress her peers with how comfortably she can talk about whiteness and make them feel inadequate and less savvy (after all wasn't she supposed to enjoy feeling superior to others?), and to ‘merely’ think the other two as to say them out loud in front of someone who is not white, and who she had identified as ‘sensitive’, and risk that he would see her for who she truly was. She, later on, writes a transphobic email to someone trans which again, was just gratuitous yet seemed included for laughs, and made me question why she would do that if this person could use that to prove to others that she is in fact awful. Why bother with all that gaslighting of your acquaintances if you then don’t give a sh*t about being exposed...? We are previously told that she is manipulative AF. She fools men and has her pathetic bff convinced they are friends to start with. Although she wants to transgress accepted norms of behaviour she knows these norms are there to begin with so in certain spaces she comports herself in a certain way, her art is the only indicator that she is into some smutty kinky stuff. I did not find her inconsistencies to be realistic or to result in a nuanced character. It seemed that the story didn’t really know what kind of character it wanted us to read about so it went all over the place. I wish that the story had committed to paint her as a morally reprehensible character we were meant not to like. The other characters are one-note and just as unrealistic. They would not be out of place in an episode of Family Guy or Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction. Speaking of Tarantino if you thought that Uma Thurman's character in that or Kill Bill have some merit…well, you might like Boy Parts after all. This book radiates the kind of feminist energy that Cara Delevingne wearing that ‘peg the patriarchy’ outfit at the met gala gives. Trying to be provoking in a puerile way. And I can forgive a lack of intersectionality and dimension if say this, like Plath's Bell Jar, had been published in the 1960s. But it wasn't so…anche no.Anyway, the side characters are just as boring as Irina herself. Some of them are downright insulting. We have someone who exists to be the transman who is the butt of the joke for many comments made by Irina. He makes two or possibly three appearances where she makes comments about his height, barbs that are meant to make him feel inadequate and not masculine enough, and later on writes that disgusting email to him where she goes on about identity politics and claims that he is solely drawing upon his personal experiences to produce art (when she is doing that very same thing…get it? ah! ). Flo (i had to check her name, that's how memorable she is) is a rip off of Reva from MYORAR who exists to be the classic female friend in love with our female protagonist who does not and will not ever reciprocate her feelings. I am so f*cking tired of books that make the mc bisexual because it’s edgy and ‘different’ but then proceed to have said character almost exclusively engage in sexual/romantic relationships with men. This character will rarely if ever acknowledge or indicate that she finds people who are not men attractive. She will have a friend who is a lesbian or in this case a bi friend, who is in love with her. The narrative will mention towards the very start or the very end that she did have a relationship with a woman once and call it a day. They don't even try to explore the mc's internalised homophobia/biphobia. Here we have a line about Irina preferring men to women and that's kind of it.[ continued in comment section due to word count]...more",Notes are private!,3,158,1,"May 11, 2022","May 12, 2022","Sep 09, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/49083140-boy-parts

If you are approaching this thinking it will be something in the realms of shows like Black Mirror or Severance, well, you may want to readjust your expectations. The speculative element within the narrative is barely there and mostly appears in the form of a few skits featuring invasive personalized adverts and apps, which, to me, was a bit of a letdown. Still, there were parts of the narrative that I did find engaging, even if I was frustrated by how our main character’s arc becomes exclusively about the possibility of marriage and motherhood, her life outside of the ye old woman=wife/mother equation is given little to no page time.  Evelyn Kominsky Kumamoto is a burnout PhD student who is offered the opportunity to work as a researcher at ‘the third-most popular internet company’. The company is currently working on an app that is meant to track and improve its user’s happiness. To ‘quantify’ happiness the company has employed various researchers, including Evelyn whose research allegedly focused on the mind-body problem. While she does meet two of her colleagues, the narrative barely explores the realities of working for this company. It may seem bizarre but I like or am intrigued by books that explore, in whatever capacity, office dynamics (a few examples: Edge Case, Luster, Severance, If I Never Met You, The New Me, Promising Young Women, and Days of Distraction) maybe because I do not work in such an environment, and I was under the impression that convinced that Happy for You would focus in equal measure on Evelyn’s working and personal life…but it doesn't, not really.She is employed by this company, picks up on some weird vibes (which lead nowhere), and at some point goes on a work trip/retreat of some sort to discuss the app and happiness. That’s kind of it. The narrative does highlight how male-dominated the tech industry is, the commodification of non-western religious and cultural practices in the west, and the many microaggressions experienced by a person of dual heritage (for instance, the fetish-y comments about 'how cute your babies will look'). Evelyn is routinely questioned by strangers in regards to her ‘background’ and at times feels a sense of alienation when moving in predominantly white spaces. Readers will also notice that because she has always been at the receiving end of ‘guess their ethnicity game’, she too at times does the same (except she exclusively plays this ‘game’ in her head), which seems to point to the loneliness she experiences as the only woc in many predominantly white environments and how exposure to certain attitudes may eventually lead to you to imitate/perpetuate said behaviours/mentalities. Though Evelyn’s experiences the narrative touches on the realities and many microaggressions experienced by poc in a society that deems whiteness to be the norm.The author’s social commentary could be quite effective, and her stylistic use of repetition adds to the sense of otherness and claustrophobia that Evelyn experiences in this modern age.Her work life and her experiences as a student remain largely unexplored, which is a pity. The narrative doesn’t really give us any information in regards to Evelyn’s actual contribution to this ‘happiness’ app. Her relationship to the academic world is also given little consideration, which is a pity as her character supposedly had already spent a few years on her dissertation.I did enjoy those sections that focused on her somewhat awkward relationship with her father, who was born in Japan and spent most of his life in the United States. Evelyn seems to feel a certain degree of jealousy that his new partner is Japanese, especially when she perceives changes in his routine and beliefs, changes she attributes to his new partner, and worries that her presence in his life will erase her mother’s memory. The sections focused on the dynamic between them all were my favorite as I appreciated how the author is able to render an undercurrent of unease in their various interactions and to create poignant moments of mutual understanding or empathy. Now, as I mentioned above, I went into this thinking that it would be a book about this ‘happiness’ app and the tech industry (on a related note, i'd definitely recommend 'why does everyone want to break into tech?' by the lovely amanda), however, the story offers only a surface level understanding of modern workplace politics…instead we have pages and pages spent with her boyfriend who is easily interchangeable with the male ‘love interests from The Sleepwalker's Guide to Dancing and Days of Distraction who, funnily enough, are named respectively Jamie and J….in Happy for You we have yet another Jamie, of the white straight cis American male variety whose personality resembles that of sliced bread. He is well meaning-ish and fairly supportive, has a stable job and comes from a financially & emotionally stable family. He often isn’t aware of his own privilege and seems to either be oblivious or dismissive of the microaggressions experienced by Evelyn. Yet, while the narrative tries to paint him as this fairly innocuous & insipid guy annoyed me when the story concludes with him managing somehow to convince Evelyn to do things she initially was opposed to or unsure of doing.spoilers belowWe are told that Evelyn enjoys the financial stability offered by her new job and even if she’s not convinced by the app—from whether it is feasible to ‘quantify’ happiness, to the meaning and desirability of happiness itself and the actual benefit an app like this would have—she naturally feels a sense of satisfaction and pride when her boss implies that she is talented etc. We also know that at this stage in her life Evelyn doesn't want to get married and is unsure of ever having kids…by the end of the narrative, we are somehow led to believe that after becoming pregnant Evelyn has somehow reconciled herself to both of these things. She spends the latter of the narrative worried that she will be a bad mother, and eventually gives up her job because she doesn’t believe in it (it wasn’t clear to me whether she was interested in picking up her studies again). And, at the end, she also says yes to Jamie, who’d proposed early on in the book. Like..ugh. I am tired of narratives where the female protagonist initially doesn’t want marriage/kids and by then ends up marrying (or about to marry) and with kids (or about to have kids). This type of narrative feeds into ‘you will change your mind’/‘it is natural for a woman to be a wife/mother’ reactionary rhetoric. That is not to say that there is no palace for narratives where female characters go on to do so things should not exist, but given their abundance, I found it frustrating when a character who says they don’t want those things for themselves, ends up being persuaded into doing/becoming those things. Evelyn lacked agency, and I wasn’t convinced that she really had had a change of heart.Back to the app. This was very disappointing. Employees like Evelyn are ‘encouraged’ to be beta users for this app so we get to actually see it in action..and it basically consists of the classic questions you would get in any type of happiness quiz. Yes, Evelyn gets a lot of push notifications and she’s urged to improve her results but I wish the author had gone heavier on the speculative elements when it came to her portrayal of this company and app.And, I almost forgot, Evelyn has one single friend who is given two appearances where he exists only as an object of not quite ridicule but his depiction felt cartoonish. Later on, his character is completely forgotten by both Evelyn and the story, which made it really seem as if he was included as an afterthought.The narrative often doesn't name things directly. From Evelyn's company, which is constantly referred to as ‘the third-most popular internet company’, to things like Facebook and Ikea or even a book she's reading (missing husband? greece? i'm fairly sure the book in question was Katie Kitamura's A Separation)...anyway, the point is that this device was implemented in a rather gimmicky way.I have rather mixed feelings about this debut. On the one hand, I found its themes compelling and thought-provoking. I liked that the narrator questions the origin of some of her behaviours and attitudes, for example, there are several instances where she realizes just how pervasive and insidious stereotypes perpetuated by the media are. I also thought that the author truly captures her dissonance and her sense of discomfort. That is not to say this was a bad book, in fact, I would probably recommend it, especially to fans of the ‘she’s not feeling so good’ subgenre. I did find the resolution to her story and arc frustrating, as they were predictable. I would have found it more satisfying if Evelyn had left Jamie and truly focus on herself, her career, her studies, and her friendships (which were painfully absent). Her relationship with her father and her tentative bond with his new partner was far more emotionally stimulating than her bland and generic romance. Lastly, I would have appreciated a more intersectional approach to certain discussions as I found it a bit sus for a story exploring contemporary social issues that lbgtq+ related issues are very much not addressed or even mentioned.Anyway, if this book is on your radar I recommend you check it out for yourself as Claire Stanford is clearly a promising author. Sometimes her prose is a bit heavy-handed on repetition and her satire does stray into silliness but some of the ideas that are at play in the story and her storytelling herself have definite potential...personally, I just prefer when these types of books don't conclude with the mc getting married and having children....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Apr 19, 2022","Apr 22, 2022","Sep 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58844853-happy-for-you

We have a few stories that try to have ‘ambiguous’ endings and a few attempts at using the 2nd pov or having a character address someone as ‘you’. The prose didn’t really match the direction of the stories, and the characters didn’t show much consistency. They all seem to be on the verge of a crisis and tend to overreact to normal family disputes (going so far as to commit matricide). Not only were the characters different shades of unlikeable but they just did not ring true to life. They were caricatures of sorts: the women often painted as hysterical, the husbands distant and unaware, the mothers hyper-critical and unsympathetic. It's a pity as the author’s prose was far from bad, it just so happens that the characters and scenarios she wrote of, to be brutally honest, left me wanting. At times the author tries to go for this realism reminiscent of authors such as Jhumpa Lahiri, but then we also get stories that try to be creepy or fairytalesque but fall short of being either of those things and when compared to the stories of Shirley Jackson or Helen Oyeyemi, well, they didn’t strike me as particularly original or fantastical. The relationships explored in these stories were very one-note and ultimately unpleasant. Nearly all of the daughters hated or were reproachful of their mothers, they are married to bland white men who lack critical thinking and seem wholly unaware of their privilege, the daughters/wives themselves are portrayed as hysterical, moody, and spiteful. Additionally, although I read this collection last week, these stories failed to leave their mark on me. I can vaguely remember that a few of the stories take place abroad and include scenes set during awkward dinners or whatnot. That’s about it. Ultimately, they just did not leave a long-lasting impression on me as a reader.  I’m sure many others will be able to appreciate them in a way that I was unable to. As things stand I will approach the author’s future work with caution.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Nov 11, 2021","Nov 12, 2021","Sep 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58740628-things-we-do-not-tell-the-people-we-love

Charles Thomas Tester is a bit of a 'hustler' who sings and plays his guitar on the streets even if he isn't a particularly talented musician. Still, he gives it a go trying to earn some money to support himself and his father. Whenever he ventures outside of Harlem he’s subjected to racist slurs, stared/glared at by white people, and harassed by the cops. He eventually finds himself coming into contact with a mysterious tome, a sorceress, and a wealthy white man who may be dabbling in the occult. While the premise did intrigue me I had a hard time following the story. The first few pages are straightforward enough but once Tom comes into contact with that old man (i’ve forgotten his name) I just had a hard time understanding what was going and the characters’ motivations. It didn’t help that the narrative tone is slightly at a remove from the characters, which was a pity as we don’t get to delve into Tom’s character. He makes a few puzzling choices or says a few odd things that just...I’m not sure, I just didn’t fully comprehend what was going with his character. I also disliked that that cop, Malone or whatever his name was, gets so much page time. Towards the end, he seems to have more scenes than Tom himself. The narrative had already established that he’s racist and a genuinely abhorrent human being. So no, I didn’t feel particularly keen on spending time alongside him, especially when that time could have served to make Tom into less of a puzzling character. That wealthy decrypt white guy also...I didn’t buy into him. I get that his attempts to awaken whatever evil supernatural forces he wanted to awaken were meant to be OTP, however, I still found him to be a plot device more than a character (even calling him a caricature seems too generous).Still, I did for the most part like the author’s style. The story has a strong sense of place and there are some clever descriptions. However, I can’t say that, on the whole, I found this novella particularly gripping or insightful. If you happen to like modern takes on Lovecraftian/cosmic horror this may be the right read for you....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 06, 2021","Sep 08, 2021","Sep 06, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26883558-the-ballad-of-black-tom

It’s the lightest sketch of civilizations, caught between the forest and the sea. He doesn’t belong here”This is my third novel by Mandel and once again I have rather conflicting thoughts and feelings about her work. On the one hand, I recognize how talented a writer she is. Her prose has this cool yet delicate quality to it that brought to mind authors such as Hanya Yanagihara and Ann Patchett. I always found myself appreciating her subtle storytelling and her ability to make her characters retain a certain unknowability. I also find her use of imagery to be highly effective in that these motifs add a certain nostalgic atmosphere to her settings. So much so that I often read of her characters and or the landscapes which she writes of with a strong sense of Deja Vu. Maybe because Mandel often returns to the same issues or even goes so far as to refer to the same characters in seemingly unconnected/stand-alone books (a la mandel-multiverse). Here this sense of familiarity with her characters and their struggles is very fitting indeed given the story’s ‘crucial’ theme.“[T]hese moments that had arisen one after another after another, worlds fading out so gradually that their loss was apparent only in retrospect.”The book opens in 1912. Edwin St. Andrew is but a young English lad who after angering his father for the last time has been banished to the ‘new world’. His attempts at making a go of things in Canada don’t quite go as smoothly as he’d hoped. There are some stunning descriptions of the landscapes here and there was something about Edwin that appealed to me. There was almost an otherworldly feel to this section, partly due to the remoteness and vastness of Edwin’s new ‘home’ (i am not at all familiar with that type of environment hence my finding it surreal). This section comes to a close with Edwin witnessing something quite Other.We then are reunited with a side character from The Glass Hotel. It’s corona-time and Mirella (Vincent’s ‘friend’) has yet to fully recover from the death of her partner and the whole Ponzi fallout. She has a girlfriend but we learn virtually nothing about her or their relationship as this section is more of an ode to Vincent. FYI, I hated Vincent in The Glass Hotel. She was the reason why I didn’t really love that book, and, understandably then, I was not particularly enthusiastic when I realized that she would play a role here as well. Even if she is not on the ‘page’, her presence saturates much of Mirella’s narrative, to the point where it struck me as a bit unfair to Mirella herself. She’s an interesting character in her own right and yet we don’t really get to focus on her. Paul, Vincent’s brother, makes an appearance but his character here didn’t strike me as particularly nuanced. It turns out that Vincent too is connected to the bizarre phenomenon witnessed by Edwin and once again the narrative makes much of her ‘art’ (*cough*banal-as-it-is). That the narrative includes Mirella unfavourably comparing her gf to Vincent was kind of a joke. It really cemented why I did not like Vincent, to begin with. I am sick of Not Like Other People type of characters.The following section is set in the 2200s. Here we learn that some people now live on colonies on the moon, one of them is this famous author named Olive Llewellyn. She’s now on a book tour on Earth where she discusses her hit book which is, surprise surprise, about a pandemic. During her tour however Olive becomes preoccupied with the news about an actual pandemic…Olive struck me as a self-insert. There were so many lines that just came across as if they were coming from Mandel herself. Particularly the questions about what it feels like to have written a pandemic novel when there is an actual pandemic etc…I find this sort of stuff cringe and there was something slightly self-congratulatory and ‘special about Olive that just made it really hard for me to even believe in her (she was a bit of Vincent 2.0). Additionally, this section is set in the 2200s and I did not buy into it. Moon colonies aside the future envisioned here was not particularly thought out. Many inconsistencies have to do with the tech available (people still have devices?) and the way the characters spoke was just too contemporary, almost old-fashioned even (i could all too easily imagine someone saying 'old chap'). This worked for the sections before but here it was just prevented me from fully immersing myself in the events being narrated. The discussions about pandemics, epidemics, and writing about these things, were rather contrived, which again, pulled me out of the story. It turns out that Olive also is connected to the bizarre phenomenon witnessed by Edwin and Vincent. The final section is set in the 2400s and once again the world described here did not feel particularly ‘futuristic’. While the author does include one or two details that remind us that the people from this century write and speak differently to say now, these were not enough to establish a believable setting. Anyhow, here we follow Gaspery-Jacques Roberts who is a fairly bland character. The most interesting about him is of course his name. His sister is yet another Not Like Other People type of character (there is something about Mandel’s female characters that really annoys me…). She works for this ‘mysterious’ institution and eventually, Gaspery finds himself joining her ranks. He is assigned a mission: to find out more about the anomaly connecting Edwin, Vincent, and Olive. I was hoping that we would return to the previous perspectives, such as Edwin and Mirella, but the narrative from this point onward favours Gaspery. There was a very funny lil scene about his cat, but for the most part, his story struck me as vaguely predictable. The man was bland and the moral dilemma he faces was handled in a rather simplistic and hurried way.It would have been nice for the timelines set in the 2200s and the 2400s to be less heteronormative and gender-normative. We get a queer character and a sapphic side character but that’s kind of it (if memory serves). There were some interesting themes at play in the book such as human connection and loneliness, empathy and choice. I appreciated the motifs that were interspersed throughout these interconnected narratives, as they consolidated the connection between these seemingly unconnected people. The conversations around pandemics were rather been-there-done-that kind of thing. I actually believe that they would have suited to an article more than this type of piece of fiction. I did find the execution to be ultimately disappointing. While the truth behind this anomaly wasn’t ‘shocking’ I did like the way it was played out. I do wish however that we could have spent more time with the characters we were introduced to early on in the book (rather than sticking to mr. boring and the cringy self-insert).As you can probably tell by my somewhat incoherent  I feel rather conflicted about this book. Mandel’s prose is *chief’s kiss*. Her characters and her story however were a bit of a flop. I would have liked for the 'anomaly' to retain a certain mystery rather than it being explained away. I think I preferred the subtle magical realism of The Glass Hotel than the more sci-fi elements that were at play here, which were 1) not really convincing and 2) a bit sci-fi 101. I would definitely recommend it to Mandel fans (my mother among them). If you are, like me, not entirely 'sold' on her work well, it seems unlikely that this will be the one to win you over (then again, i might be wrong here)....more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Mar 05, 2022","Mar 09, 2022","Aug 30, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58446255-sea-of-tranquility

Schwab when I was a teenager the last couple of books I’ve picked up by her left me feeling rather underwhelmed. My reading tastes have definitely changed over the years but I hoped that I would always be able to appreciate her storytelling. I was sold on Gallant when I saw that it was being compared to Neil Gaiman and Guillermo del Toro and boy oh boy was I disappointed to discover that it was just a very tame take on the Gothic genre. I was hoping for something Dark a la Coraline or in the vein of Pan’s Labyrinth but what we have here is a very cheesy and vanilla attempt at crafting a Gothic tale. The story stars the classic Schwab female protagonist, ie, Not Like Other Girls (Schwab's books always leave me with the impression that they barely pass the Bechdel test). Olivia Prior is an orphan who has grown up in Merilance School for girls where she is mistreated by everyone for being mute. She also has a bit of a temper because she isn’t afraid of getting back at the mean girls and of ignoring her school’s rules. What a #girlboss. Anyway, Olivia’s only source of solace comes from her mother’s diary which details her descent into ‘madness’. Sections from her diary are interspersed throughout the narrative and these were truly over the top in their sensationalistic language and imagery. Olivia receives a letter from an uncle who says he wants her to come home to their family home of Gallant. When she arrives she discovers that her only living relative, her cousin Matthew, doesn’t want her there. Oh, I forgot, Olivia also sees ghouls. This aspect is sometimes forgotten and for the majority of the story appears only to crank up the Gothic mood. Nothing happens. Olivia’s inner monologue is as interesting as watching paint dry would be. She has no distinct personality even if the author tries to make her into this bold heroine who will not let people like those mean girls or her cold cousin tell her where she belongs. There are two other side characters who also live at Gallant and take care of Matthew and the property. Despite the small cast (you would think that more time was paid to developing these characters), the author doesn’t succeed in making these characters into compelling and or three-dimensional characters. Olivia is so vanilla as to be entirely forgettable. Her defining characteristic is that she’s an orphan and that she is mute. Personally, I don’t think it's great that these things are made to be her ‘personality’ and Schwab incurs the risk of portraying mutism as a sign of ‘specialness’ (she can see ghouls, she’s not like other girls etc…). This kind of thing feels dated tbh. Olivia spends her time at Gallant being rather nosy about the past and Matthew and those two older characters are clearly keeping something away from her. Olivia re-reads her mother’s journal in an attempt to uncover the truth behind her ‘madness’ and the secretive behaviour of the last inhabitants of Gallant. I foolishly thought that this was going to be a parallel/portal fantasy but this doesn’t come into play until the 60% mark or so. Which…by then my interest had already waned and died. The ‘villain’ has barely any page time and because of that I did not really feel creeped out by them. I did not feel the stakes and found myself skim-reading the last couple of pages just so I could be done with it all. The tone was very Middle Grade which could have worked if the author had gone for a more ambiguous overall tone (like Gaiman does in Coraline) but I found her portrayal of her heroine and the villain simplistic indeed. The blurb makes it sound as if Olivia is taken by them but that was not the case at all. Even a Disney villain has more nuance than this one. We have a poorly established setting (vaguely historical period in…england? i think? they name a few english counties/towns but if it was it was not convincing at all, the characters express themselves in a very un-English manner) and Gallant itself lacked oomph. There were too many descriptions that relied on very predictable imagery and the language too drove me up the walls. Whisper here, whisper there. Metaphors involving smoke, secrets, whispers, and shadows abound. There was no subtlety or variation whatsoever. The house(s) did not feel ominous or atmospheric.While I can get behind books that are very aesthetic focused (such books by Holly Black and Seanan McGuire) they have to have the prose to back that up. But here disappointingly enough given Schwab's usually stylish storytelling, the writing was flat. Because of this, the atmosphere felt flat too and the Gothic mood never truly convinced me. I also have a bias against books where the main female characters have no meaningful relationship with other girls her age. And in fact, they are shown to be jealous, petty, and mean towards her even if she’d done ‘nothing wrong’. Like, can we put a stop to this girls-hating-girls trend in YA? Thank you. A dull heroine, a slow-moving and predictable storyline, poorly developed secondary characters and setting…Gallant proved itself to be a milquetoast affair. I was hoping for a more mature tone and a more complex world-building and Gallant offered quite the opposite. A cheesy take on Gothic and the kind of flowery writing that is kind-of-pretty only if you post random quotes with no context on tumblr. This was a forgettable and lacklustre readbut just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a try.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,0,117,1,"Feb 16, 2022","Feb 19, 2022","Aug 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58064046-gallant

A few weeks before reading this I read Morgan Talty’s Night of the Living Rez, which also used the short-story format to tell a young man’s coming-of-age. Unlike that title, the stories in Calling for a Blanket Dance are not narrated directly by its central figure, Ever Geimausaddle, but rather, by the people around him. I usually prefer it when we either follow or hear directly from the central character themselves, rather than having their experiences recounted by second parties, however, the collective voices in Calling for a Blanket Dance are ultimately able to enrich Ever Geimausaddle’s story. Each chapter presents us with a different point of view, often of a character related to Ever (his grandfather, his mother, his sister, his nephew) transporting us from the 80s to the 2000s. Through their perspective, we gain a different understanding of Ever, an understanding that is shaped by that character and their experiences and ideas of who Ever is and what he should become. Some of these characters want to reunite him with his own heritage, such as his grandfather who after receiving a fatal diagnosis decides to teach Ever about Gourd dances. These chapters offer us snapshots not only of a particular stage of Ever’s life but they present us with a glimpse into the character whose perspective we are ‘inhabiting’. Ever emerges as an empathetic man trying to reconcile himself with his dysfunctional upbringing and relatives, as well as with his own multi heritage (Mexica, Cherokee, Kiowa).To describe this collection as heavy-going would be an understatement. It delves into the past and present experiences of indigenous people, rendering the realities and aftermath of generational trauma. These characters struggle against vicious cycles of displacement, dispossession, poverty, neglect, illness, and addiction. At times the characters try to help one another but more often than not they are unable to steer people away from spiralling into self-destructive behavior. Yet, despite the bleak and brutal landscapes painted by these stories, we are also given moments of hope and connection that make us in turn hopeful for these characters. The author writes about these characters and their experiences with exacting candor while also demonstrating empathy towards them in a way to mind the work of Benjamin Alire Sáenz.My only quibble is that I think that we should have given a few chapters from Ever throughout the collection (as opposed to one near the end). But like I said before, this is just a personal preference.Overall this was a very solid debut that is as incisive as it is compelling. If you like collections such as Night of the Living Rez, Crooked Hallelujah, and Lot or books such as Nuclear Family and Monkey Beach you should definitely add Hokeah's debut to your tbr list....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Aug 21, 2022","Aug 28, 2022","Aug 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58328439-calling-for-a-blanket-dance

The in-group drama, avoidable miscommunication, and one too many love triangles detracted from an otherwise compelling coming-of-age. If you are reading this expecting it to be a HEA romance, I recommend you adjust your expectations as Ophelia After All was more focused on Ophelia’s character arc and her coming to terms with her sexuality.  Ophelia Rojas is a Cuban-American teen who is known as the girl with the green thumb and a propensity for crushing on cute boys. The novel follows her during her last year of high school as she has to reckon with ongoing and new drama changing the dynamics of her friendship group and the possibility that she is not solely attracted to cute boys. Cute and shy Talia, the best friend of one of her friends, has caught her eye. Ophelia tries to fight her feelings, fearing the ‘ramifications’ of what this means. How will her friends and parents react if she ceases to be the ‘boy crazy’ girl they know and love? Initially, this line of thinking seems a bit questionable but as the story progresses her anxiety becomes better articulated. People have an idea of who she is, and Ophelia fears the possibility of not being the person they think she is. It was a bit odd that she would truly believe that her friends and parents (whom she is very close to) would see her just in terms of her crushes on guys but I could relate to her apprehension about ‘coming out’ and how that would lead her to make certain assumptions about the people around her. There are a few ‘key’ events that change the dynamics between the characters. Ophelia and her mother are for a long part of the book at odds with each other after the former does something very uncharacteristic and refuses to tell her mother why (but tells her dad). The guy who causes this was a throwaway one-dimensional bigot who…I mean, he was a bit on the nose (not that people like that do not exist but that he was in a very short scene and managed to tick all of these unsavoury boxes…given that he was a college student it seemed weird that he would be so public about his trash opinions especially since he surrounded by faculty and adults). Ophelia was 100% valid in what she did (the whole being ‘the bigger person’ is overrated if you ask me) but I found her treatment of her mother frustrating. Ragazza mia, just talk to your mum! In addition to the story’s focus on Ophelia struggling to reconcile herself with her attraction and feelings for Talia the story is also sadly very much about the drama going on in her friendship group. Her neighbour and best friend are in love with another friend. Talia’s best friend, who also happens to be a friend of Ophelia, is in love with that same girl. That girl is portrayed as kind of a bitch but she happens to have a best friend who isn’t (i can’t remember her name but if you’ve read this you know, she’s the most sensible and decent character in this whole book…i wish that she’d been given more page time). Anyhow, things are obviously awkward and tense. I found the miscommunication within their group stupid and not always believable. It also annoyed me that Ophelia called her bf and that girl he is in love with ‘promiscuous’ and implied that this made them less nice than that other guy who is also in love with her. Still, I loved that we get so many lgbtq+ characters, even if the ‘reveals’ at the end were cheesy (but i am all for it at the same time so there ya go). Some of the discussions around being queer and or part of the lgbtq+ community did feel a bit…patronising? They were vaguely… at one point I felt like I was watching an instructional 101 lgbtq+ video. There was this scene with Ophelia asking this other character why people used ‘queer’ when she heard it was a controversial term and something about it felt very studied. At one point a character starts rattling off different labels and identities and I felt that I was scrolling on the lgbtq+ wiki. The narrative in these sections seemed more intent on being informative and unproblematic than ‘real’.Some of the characters struck me as one-dimensional, especially the ‘unlikeable’ ones such as Talia’s relatives, Ophelia’s ex and her mother’s dick of a student. I did not find the love polygon interesting and in fact, it was tiring, especially since much of it hinged on a character that is for most of the narrative portrayed as having exclusively bad traits. Still, I liked that the author didn’t make Ophelia immediately accept her queerness and that her self-denial leads her to make quite a few bad choices. Her treatment of Talia was kind of horrible if you think about it but she owns up to it (which doesn’t cancel out what she did but it results in some solid character growth on her part). I also liked that her mother isn’t depicted as being horrible, which I feared she would be for a good portion of the book. Her talk with Ophelia towards the end was very touching. I just wish the story had focused less on the drama and fights between Ophelia’s ‘friends’. Her best friend in particular is done a bit of a disservice as his character seems reduced to him taunting his love rival. But I did appreciate how inclusive this group was. I would have liked for them to have more distinctive personalities (rather than a few chosen traits) but it isn’t that kind of novel so it worked all the same. There were some compelling discussions on Ophelia’s dual heritage and her struggle for self-knowledge in a society that is very either/or in its view of identity and sexuality. I also appreciated that Ophelia dismisses the idea of a monolithic Latin American culture, however, later mentions of her heritage do at times risk doing exactly that.While some of the discussions did feel a tad too American for my liking in that they simplified certain issues (i can’t explain but if you know you know), I did enjoy Ophelia reflections of Lacan and the nature of desire.Anyway, although I didn’t quite love Ophelia as a character and I didn't particularly care for her in-group melodrama, Ophelia After All makes for a refreshing YA in that it prioritizes Ophelia’s coming of age over any potential romance she may or may not have along the way (more of this please and less of the ‘i met my OTL in high school’). This story managed to subvert romance conventions which were unexpected in the best way possible. Still, other aspects were more predictable. Similarly to other contemporary YA novels Ophelia After All tries to be more self-aware of the cliches of the ‘teen coming of age’ genre but then they end up incorporating those tropes anyways. Despite my mixed feelings, I liked Ophelia After All more than not. It has its flaws sure and the tone was a bit juvenile and moralistic at times but I could tell that the author had good intentions and the story she tells does have heart.I would definitely recommend this to younger audiences and or YA devotees....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Jan 31, 2022",Feb 2022,"Aug 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56978109-ophelia-after-all

Perhaps that was because the inherent stillness of my nature made me crave the sight of things that moved.”   Whenever I am in a reading slump or going through a difficult/otherwise stressful period in my life, I seek out Banana Yoshimoto’s work. I can’t quite pinpoint what it is about her style that I find to be so oddly comforting but the themes, the characters, and the cadence of her storytelling all feel very familiar to me. I can see why some people might find her style simplistic or be frustrated by her characters’ propensity for navel gazing but time and again I find myself returning to her work. She very rarely deviates from her tested out formula, which usually follows a young woman who may have some daddy issues and falls in love with a generic guy, all of this usually happens against a hospitality backdrop. There are scenes detailing every-day interactions where characters go on from talking about nothing specific to having more existential conversations about love, life, and the past. The slice-of-life feel of the story is interjected with a dreamlike quality that lends some of her stories almost a magical realism sort of atmosphere. Some stories commit to this more fantastical feel, and we even have spirits & the like. A lot of her characters suffer from mysterious and unnamed illness, or drop-dead in a very soap-opera fashion. Yet, her tone and her characters’ reactions remain rather subdued. All of this is to say that when I pick up something by Yoshimoto I know what to expect and I am by no means put off by the sameness of her stories. Most of her protagonists share the same Yoshimotoesque personality: an observant and excitable young woman who is able to inject energy in the most mundane of thoughts or activities. Her short stories usually offer more variety compared to Yoshimoto’s full-length works.Having liked two of her other short-story collections (Asleep & Lizard) I was looking forward to Dead-End Memories, especially since the last few months of my life have been a wee bit much, and I mentioned earlier, Yoshimoto’s style is a balm to my uneasy soul. Anyhow, I liked most of the stories. My favorite story happens to be the one the collection is named after, which I actually already read back in 2019 but the italian translation (which has not aged well at all). It’s a wistful story about heartbreak and Yoshimoto captures with ease the feelings and impressions experienced by her protagonist. The other stories were just as pleasant and breezy except for the very first one . I will say that my main pet peeve with Yoshimoto is her romanticization of creepy guys. A few of her stories include or tease the possibility of incenstuous relationships…which yikes. Or we have guys forcing themselves onto girls. And the way this is portrayed is questionable at best…anyway, in ‘House of Ghosts’ we have the guy, I refuse to address him as love interest, whining about wanting to have sex with the narrator and he says the following: “But us guys, we only see holes. No matter how pretty a girl’s makeup looks, or what she’s wearing […] all we can think of is how somewhere deep inside this person, there’s a hole—a wet hole” to which she replies “Okay?” and he says “So that’s what’s been on my mind. Every time you laugh or say anything, I’m still thinking about that hole”. I am not saying that there are no guys like this, however the way the story presents him gives the idea that the shit is saying is okay, normal even. As opposed to disgusting and totally misogynistic (the man is dehumanizing women by seeing them as ‘wet holes’ he wants to enter). Bleargh. Yoshimoto, please. That guy ruined a really nice story. Thankfully, the rest of the collection is typical Yoshimoto fanfare. Dreamy and lighthearted with some the kind of observations that can range from thoughtful to corny. If you are looking for nostalgic stories exploring dreams, memories, and heartbreak, look no further....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Aug 10, 2022","Aug 19, 2022","Aug 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59892213-dead-end-memories

Yayoi, the 19-year-old protagonist and narrator of The Premonition, has lately fallen into a strangely pensive mood as she feels that she has forgotten something important from her childhood. She moves in with her eccentric aunt, Yukino, a teacher who moves through life as though half-asleep. Despite her unusual ways, Yayoi finds her to be a comfort and soon seems to adjust to the rhythms of her aunt’s lifestyle. Although there are no huge family secrets that emerge during this time we (readers) learn more about Yayoi’s past and present circumstances, for instance, that she has been harboring more than brotherly feelings for her adopted brother. Yayoi’s aunt retains an aura of mystery, one that is intensified by her sudden disappearance. As Yayoi and her ‘brother’ set out to find her, their mutual feelings for each other come to the fore. The motif of the house, forbidden romance, as well as the nostalgic atmosphere created by the narrative’s focus on memory, childhood, and old secrets, made The Premonition something of a slice-of-life-cum-fairy-tale, a meeting point between humdrum reality and dreamspace. As much as I found myself lulled by Yayoi’s simple yet whimsical inner monologue, or amused by the characters' peculiar antics, the story’s romantic elements left a lot to be desired. Not only do we get an incest-y love story but we also have a side romance that is anything but romantic given that it involves grooming (yet this whole teacher-student dynamic is made to seem quirky). So, yeah...icky on multiple levels. Still, Yoshimoto's storytelling has this soothing quality to it that is hard to dislike, no matter how twee or yucky her stories may get. I ultimately found Yayoi's realizations on life, remembrance, and growing-up, to be comforting, and I liked the melancholic ambience of her story.If you are, like me, a Yoshimoto fan, you'll likely enjoy The Premonition. If you happen to be on the fence about Yoshimoto, well, you might want to give this a miss given that The Premonition is typical Yoshimoto fare....more",Notes are private!,1,34,1,"Dec 14, 2023","Dec 19, 2023","Aug 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/122778203-the-premonition

Taking place in 1944 London, Winter Love is the type of unromantiPublished in the early 60s Han Suyin's Winter Love is an overlooked lesbian classic. Taking place in 1944 London, Winter Love is the type of unromantic love story that will definitely appeal to fans of Giovanni's Room and Madame Bovary. There was something about our narrator’s aloof, slightly disdainful, worldview that brought to mind Fleur Jaeggy and Magda Szabó. Whereas Suyin’s ability to render time and place brought to mind authors like Mary Renault and Kazuo Ishiguro. Like them, Suyin’s narrative hones in on indoor spaces, but the intimacy created by these enclosed spaces is ultimately stultifying, bringing to the fore unpleasant feelings and thoughts. Permeated by unease, Winter Love is a tale exploring desire and obsession set against the backdrop of a bitterly cold winter in 1944 London. Our narrator Red is a college student who is well versed in the jealousies and crushes that are bound to occur in all female environments. But she readily dispatches her bosom friends in favor of pursuing her new classmate Mara, who happens to be married. Red seems exasperated and slightly irritated by Mara’s naive attitude, especially when it comes to her husband and money matters. Yet before long the two are spending most of their time together, with Mara often staying over at Red’s place. We know from the start that their brief and volatile affair is doomed and that Red goes on to marry a man whom she’d on-and-off frequented (often she gives in to his advances to comply with social expectations). Red and Mara bypass the honeymoon phase and find themselves locked in a fraught stalemate. Red’s attitude towards Mara is awful. Red is the one who pursues Mara, knowing fully well that the latter is married, and even so, she guilt-trips Mara about it, she then seems to want Mara gone or for the husband to take responsibility for her and is forever short with her. Red is incredibly jealous, possessive, and obsessive towards Mara. Her behavior towards Mara (and other people in general) skated close to the emotionally abusive, making Red into a rather detestable character. She’s cold, mean, and mercurial, and Mara often finds herself apologizing over nothing (perceived slights and so on). Mara herself was rather pitiable, mocked by her arrogant husband, and mistreated by her lover. They manage to get away from London, but their stay away brings about the end of their doomed affair. Winter Love is a very unflattering and unforgiving portrait of a love affair, but the author’s ability to hone in on and describe her narrator’s darkest and most ambiguous feelings and thoughts is certainly impressive. I found the writing incisive, and the characters’ back-and-forths to have very realistic rhythms. Permeated by doubt and contempt, Winter Love reads like an antithesis to love. Red desires Mara, but the nature of this desire often seems akin to the desire to ‘have’ something. Yet, once she has her, Red seems bored and irked by Mara, especially when it comes to discussions around money and their living situations. Suyin's crisp storytelling and Red's dreary outlook complement the novel's winter setting. The novel succeeds in making readers aware of the pressures shouldered by Red and her classmates, and the short-lived freedom from social norms and gender expectations they find in each other. But in the real world, against the humdrum of everyday life, these relationships stand little chance of a happy ending.Not the ideal read for those who are looking for a melancholic, soft, sapphic love story. This novel is all hard edges. Strikingly ambivalent Winter Love is a deeply evocative yet uncomfortable read....more",Notes are private!,1,24,1,"Jan 03, 2024","Jan 05, 2024","Aug 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59441849-winter-love

With the exception of Either/Orby Elif Batuman and re-reads, I have only dished out 3, 2 and even a few 1 star ratings. So, when I got an arc for Mad About You I was convinced that McFarlane would be the one to break this cycle…regrettably that did not happen. Having loved her last two releases, If I Never Met You and Last Night, I was fully prepared to fall for Mad About You. After all, in my  for Last Night, I described McFarlane as a writer who outdoes herself with each new book. Sadly, Mad About You proved to be the exception to that rule as it felt very much like a step back rather than forward. It actually reminded me of McFarlane’s early releases (by no means bad but definitely not as good as her later ones). The pacing was rather meandering, Harriet was not a particularly memorable main character, and the romance was, to be quite frank, subpar.Like most of McFarlane’s releases, the book begins with a breakup, this time initiated by our heroine rather than her partner. Harriet is a wedding photographer in her thirties who has no interest in getting married. She lives with her boyfriend, who is from a very posh and snobby family who have never shown her any warmth or genuine affection. We learn that Harriet is an orphan who was raised by her grandparents (who have also passed away). Additionally, early on in the narrative, there are hints that point to Harriet having had a traumatic experience in her 20s. She doesn’t really open up to her boyfriend and feels guilty about it. When he puts her on the spot however Harriet realizes that he isn’t the Nice Guy he tries so hard to make himself out to be. Harriet rushes to find somewhere else to live and ends up living with Cal Clarke. When they find out that they are exactly strangers to each other things get a little bit awkward and Harriet overhears Cal making some rather disparaging remarks about her. Turns out they both have rather complicated relationship histories. Cal’s ex is very cartoonish and a lot of her inappropriate behaviours are played up for laughs. The story doesn’t take Harriet’s exes as lightly and much of the narrative delves into the repercussions of having been in an emotionally abusive relationship. Harriet eventually bonds with women who have experienced what she has and together they decide to confront their abuser. Things don’t go smoothly and the story also touches on the way internet mob mentality works. Harriet and Cal’s relationship didn’t entirely convince me as we get few ‘domestic’ scenes where we just them hanging out in the house or interacting while doing everyday things like cooking etc. That would have added realism to their living situation but we always seemed to get scenes where they are either confronting their exes or dealing with some other drama. I did find the way Harriet’s abusive relationship is handled to be a bit a la daytime tv. Usually, I love the way McFarlane portrays friendships but here Harriett’s friends amounted to nothing. There is the good-funny friend and the backstabbing-bad friend. There was no nuance to them and consequently, they did not come across as believable people. The love interest was such a non-person and consequently I never felt any chemistry between him and Harriet. It would be nice if McFarlane didn't always go for a white handsome guy as her lead...I found the pacing slow and repetitive. The story spends too much time on Harriett’s shitty exes and very little time on developing her character. Her relationships with Cal and her best friend felt very superficial. Also, at one point someone references Netflix’s Bridgerton which came out in December 2020…and yet no mentions of covid (as far as i remember of course). Is this book set in an alternate reality? it was a minor thing but it took me out nonetheless.I’m sorry to say that I found Mad About You to be a surprisingly disappointing read. Hopefully, McFarlane’s next book will see her going back to form....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,Mar 2022,"Mar 02, 2022","Aug 27, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59967355-mad-about-you

In a country where possessions counted for everything, we had no belongings except our stories.” The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen is a collection of short stories centring on the experiences of Vietnamese refugees & immigrants as well as Vietnamese-Americans. With one or two exceptions most of the stories in this collection take place in America, some soon after the Vietnam War. Through different voices, the author presents us with a nuanced depiction of the realities and difficulties faced by those who are either forced to or choose to leave their home country. In America they are confronted with prejudice and racism, treated as objects of fascination or pity, at times they are separated from their loved ones or find themselves growing apart from their families as well as the language and values of their early childhoods. I appreciated the author’s frank style, the humor that permeated much of his narratives, and his nonmoral approach to his characters, their struggles, fears, and desires. The stories that resonated the most with me happened to be the very first two in the collection: ‘Black-Eyed Women’, which is about a haunted ghostwriter, and ‘The Other Man’, which is set in San Francisco and follows Liem, a young refugee who staying with a gay couple. Many of these stories emphasize the linguistic and cultural barriers experienced by immigrants. Most of these stories, such as ‘I’d Love You To Want Me’, a story about an ageing couple, make for rather bittersweet reads.Like many collections of short stories, The Refugees was a bit of a mixed bag. None of the stories was bad but a few stood out. Something that dampened my reading experience was the weird way the author would write about breasts: we have “doleful areolas”, breasts that “sway like anemones under shallow water”, and breasts that “undulate” like “the heads of eels”. Like, what gives Nguyen? Why be so weird about breasts? I guess they were meant to be humorous but I happen not to have the sense of humor of an 8-year-old boy so, they didn’t quite do it for me. Also, it would be fairer than to have weird metaphors about other body parts.All in all, this was a fairly solid collection and I look forward to finally giving Nguyen's Pulitzer-winning novel a go....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Aug 29, 2021","Aug 31, 2021","Aug 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30358505-the-refugees

Both books make for harrowing reads, however, whereas I found Elif Shafak’s more thoughtful tone to be more appropriate to the subject fitting, here, well, Umrigar’s undermines her social commentary by throwing into the mix a rushed romantic subplot, a series of blatant plot points and coincidences, an abundance of mawkish metaphors, and one too many cartoonish side characters. At first, I found Umrigar’s Honor to be a rather gripping read as it promised to be an unflinching story tackling honor killings, Islamophobia, discrimination, and misogyny. The novel switches between two perspectives: Smita, an Indian American journalist who left India at a young age after a traumatic experience, and Meena, a Hindu woman who married a Muslim man. Meena has survived an attack that her husband did not. Her brothers, alongside other men from their community, tried to burn her alive. Now Meena and her newborn live with her mother-in-law who is resentful of her, blaming her for her son’s horrific death. Smita is given this story after her colleague is hospitalized. Initially, Smita isn’t too keen on this as she’s very uneasy about returning to India. A friend of her colleague becomes her travel companion. While she’s initially reluctant about his presence she quickly discovers that travelling alone is inadvisable.Smita interviews Meena and learns the details of her vicious attack. She later on also interviews her brothers and a powerful man in their Hindu community. While they deny their involvement it is clear that they were not only responsible but have no remorse about having murdered their sister’s husband and disfigured her. Smita’s feelings towards India are repeatedly challenged by her companion who forces her not to dismiss a whole country on the basis of the actions of some. As Smita witnesses how Meena is treated by her mother-in-law and learns of how she was treated by her brothers, she becomes aware of her the privilege she carries being Indian American. Still, as a woman, she’s also exposed to the misogyny that is rampant in Meena’s community. Umrigar doesn't paint Smita as a hero and I appreciated that sometimes, even when she’s trying to help someone, her actions do not have the desired consequences. In this way, I was reminded of The Far Field, another novel that is very much about privilege and guilt.I did find Meena’s chapters to be a bit…condescending of her? Her vocabulary also struck me as inconsistent. Her chapters are in English for our eyes only, in reality, she’s speaking a dialect of Marathi, right? So why do her chapters occasionally seem to play up that she’s not well-spoken? Only for then to use complex sentences or allegories that really stood out in comparison to the rest of her narration? I don’t know…it seemed to me that the author was going to great lengths to portray Meena as this ‘simple’ village girl and it kind of annoyed me.Smita also had her fair share of incongruities. For one, she claims to be good at her job yet she behaves really unprofessional. She tells off her companion, Mohan, for getting ‘emotional’ during one interview but she repeatedly does the same thing. She makes some really poor decisions and her line of questioning struck me ineffective.For the majority of the narrative, the author does demonstrate her knowledge and insight into her story’s various subject matters (honor killings, religious conflicts, cultural and class divides). However, I did find her execution soap-operasish. At times her language, as well as her imagery, struck me as hackneyed, for example, “Smita could see the awful, irregular geometry of Meena’s face as past and present, normalcy and deformity, beauty and monstrosity, collided.” I also found it a bit predictable that Smita’s ‘past’, which has made her feel so conflicted about India, echoes in some ways Meena’s situation.The pacing is fairly slow and I did not entirely understand why Meena’s chapters were even included given that, if anything, they made her relationship with her husband seem very rushed and random. The guy basically sees her once or twice while they are working and declares his undying love for her. His naivete about the fact that she’s Hindu and he is Muslim also struck me as a bit…unconvincing. I mean, he isn’t a child nor a hermit who is wholly unaware of his country’s political or social climate.While the hearing’s result did strike me as sadly believable, I did find that section of the narrative somewhat rushed and illogical. Smita’s decision not to do something seemed a clear choice on the author’s part to force her character to feel guilty and haunted, indebted to stay in India. Smita’s relationship with Mohan also rubbed me the wrong way. It seemed a bit insensitive to have it so soon after yet another horrific plot point. The whole finale was corny, extremely so, and I hated how illogical it all was. Even if you have the character point out how ‘crazy’ or ‘insane’ they are by believing that they have just been given a ‘sign’ from above, it still doesn’t make it believable to have that character uphold their lives because of that random sign. The secondary characters were very one-note, the majority of them are horrible, ignorant, or a combination of the two things. Most of the Indian female characters, with the exception of Meena, are really nasty to Smita for no good reason. I didn't understand the point of her American colleague, Shannon, either. Her translator, Nandini, also served no purpose other than having scenes where Smita thinks her devotion to Shannon is' weird', and in a very childish manner wonders whether she's in love with her. Grow up Smita, ffs. Sadly, while I appreciate that the author has tackled such important issues, I found her storytelling to be too…shall I say, ‘book-clubby’ for my taste. I did like that at the end she makes a point of stating how absurd it is that ‘honor’ killings are referred to as such when there is truly nothing honorable about them.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,0,103,1,"Jan 06, 2022","Jan 09, 2022","Aug 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56271394-honor

The prose of these novellas is smooth and engaging, contrasting with the sometimes stark realities experienced by the characters populating these stories. The backdrop to most of these stories is Shenyang, which the author renders in gritty realism. The characters struggle to find stable employment and fulfilment as they attempt to navigate a perilous social and economic landscape. Many experiences or are close to people affected by poverty, addiction, and domestic violence. Some find themselves embroiled in murky businesses, while others attempt to make their dreams come true even when the cards are stacked against them. An element of magical realism reminiscent of the work Murakami comes into play in some of these narratives, lending an air of surreality to many of the events and scenes being described. The humor present in many of the character interactions also made me think of Murakami’s books, as Xuetao effectively incorporates humorous asides or funny lines into his otherwise bleak narratives. These moments of levity also add to the surreal, occasionally dreamy, atmosphere of these stories. The author's insights into contemporary Chinese society also are characterised by an almost rueful tone, one that lends itself to his novellas' subject matter(s). The family dynamics were lively and I appreciated how the author establishes generational gaps without resorting to the usual clichès. What I struggled with was the shift in perspectives. I have never been a fan of shifts between 1st and 3rd povs, and here I sometimes had difficulties telling who was speaking and their connection to the other pov. To be fair, this issue I had may have something to do with the fact that I listened to the audiobook version of this collection. I think I would have been able to follow the storylines better if I’d read it for myself. I will probably revisit Rouge Street as I would like to gain a more in-depth understanding of its novellas....more",Notes are private!,1,26,1,"Apr 09, 2022","Apr 11, 2022","Aug 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57771220-rouge-street

He was just a Black person. That’s all they saw and that’s all he was.” While I did find The Violin Conspiracy to be a bit all over the place the author's acknowledgements hit hard. The book opens in medias res with Ray McMillian, our main character, discovering that his Stradivarius has been stolen. Ray is preparing for the international Tchaikovsky Competition and without his fiddle, he feels unmoored. The narrative then jumps back in time where we meet Ray in his teens and learn more about his family situation. His mother wants him to drop school so he can work full time and so she can buy a new tv. When Ray begins to earn good money by playing at various events she quietens down somewhat but she still clearly disapproves of his violin playing and often ridicules him and his belief that he could pursue a career as a violinist. The only supportive member of his family is Ray’s beloved grandmother who loves him to bits. She also wants him to play and gifts him her grandpa’s fiddle. Ray eventually ends up getting a scholarship for a prestigious college. His mother doesn’t want him to go but Ray is determined to follow his path. He eventually learns that his violin is a Stradivarius. His family wants him to sell it and claim that it was never his, to begin with. To keep them at bay Ray begins to send them large sums of money but they never seem satisfied. He also begins to receive thinly threatening letters from a family that claims to be the righteous owners of the violin, and it turns out that they are descendants of the people who had once enslaved Ray’s great-grandfather. Eventually, the narrative reaches the beginning, where Ray’s beloved violin has been stolen and the competition is just around the corner.Throughout the narrative, the author highlights just how racist and elitist the classical music world is. From when he played as a teenager at venues to his time as a teacher and a professional violinist, Ray experiences racism. Classical music is something that is often associated with whiteness and because of this Ray has to fight to be accepted into this world. No matter how hard he proves himself he will be confronted with people dismissing his skills, claiming that he is a ‘diversity token’ or diminishing his talent. There are many harrowing scenes where Ray is mistreated and abused, and the realism of these scenes made it clear that these episodes had likely been experienced by the author himself (such as the wedding one early on). From outright racist remarks to more ‘veiled’ ones, Ray has to fight tooth and nail to claim a space in this extremely white elitist world. That he has no support from his family certainly doesn’t help as with the exception of his grandmother and an aunt, they are all keen on him selling his violin. The novel tries to combine a Bildungsroman novel with a more suspenseful storyline but the two don't quite mesh together. The flashbacks into Ray’s teenage years do add context to his life and the violin but they fail to make him into a more rounded character. I found him rather flat, at times a little more than a vehicle to move the story forward. I would have liked for him to have a more defined personality and a more developed characterisation. Other characters were similarly one-dimensional, Ray’s mother in particular. She’s portrayed as a horrible person: every scene she is in she says something awful. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and I could not understand why Ray would bother with her at all. He also has siblings but we never see him interact with them. His other relatives, with the exception of that one aunt, are all greedy and nasty to him. The bad characters in this book are also extremely one-note. This is fair enough, a simplistic approach could have worked but I found it annoying that the author would describe these characters as physically ‘ugly’ and are often ‘fat’. The woman who claims that the violin belongs to her family for instance has ‘jowls’ covered by ‘downy hair’. All of the policemen are of the doughnut-eating variety, but this, I didn’t mind as much given my less than warm feelings towards them. Anyway, the story suggests that either Ray’s family or this white family are behind his missing violin. The novel then takes a weird turn by making someone else responsible and forgetting almost entirely of Ray’s family or that other one. It just seemed an odd choice and a predictable one at that. I also did not care for the way Ray spoke about or describes women (“the tawny-haired woman with the tight dress running her fingers suggestively around her wineglass”; “The attractive women who seemed to take an interest in him were mostly in the look-but-don’t-touch category”; “A young athletic woman was crossing in front of them, her toned ass bouncing with every step in her black leggings.”). The writing too could be quite cheesy, especially in its efforts to tie everything back to classical music (“He tried to breathe but his ribs had been wrapped in piano wire”; “Why was he so terrible at talking to this woman? She was violin-shaped, right? So why was this so hard?”). Still, while I wasn’t a huge fan of the writing or the characters, the story was relatively engaging.

The novel itself has plenty of cute moments, however, various elements prevented me from truly appreciating it.  Before her parents’ separation 17-year-old Evie Thomas was a lover of romance and a believer in happy-ever-afters. When she becomes aware that her dad not only cheated on her mum but left them to be with the ‘other woman’, well, she’s pretty shaken up by it. A newly disillusioned Evie decides to make the very dramatic gesture of getting rid of all of her romance books (i mean, really?). After dropping them off at a ‘little free library’ a mysterious old lady seemingly appears from nowhere and encourages her to take a book titled Instructions for Dancing, a book about ballroom dancing. From then on Evie has the ability to see how peoples’ romances begun and how they will end. They just have to kiss in front of her and *wham* she gets a That's So Raven vision that shows her a fast-forwarded version of the couple’s relationship, from their first meeting to their breakup/separation. Her new gift seems to confirm that, as she feared, in real life love always ends in heartbreak (lil’ bit ridiculous, i know…).She eventually returns the manual for dancing to La Brea Dance. Once at this dance studio she just happens to come face-to-face with the kind of heartthrob guy who is very much the real-life embodiment of the LI in a romance (“For a second, I feel like I’m a character in one of my old romance books. Raising a single eyebrow is such a Classic Romance Guy Characteristic.”). The guy, X, and Evie end up competing as a pair for a dance competition in the Amateur Under 21 category with the intention of promoting the studio.As you can imagine, in spite of Evie vowing that she’s done with love and romance and would certainly not fall for X because “Tall, hipster-hot and in a band? I mean, he’s the definition of a heartbreaker, right?”, the more they practice together, the closer they get.The story focuses on their romance and on Evie’s feeling conflicted about love and romance. While the angst is at times outweighed by the sweeter moments, overall, I could have done with the elements of melodrama (between evie & x, between evie & her ‘friends’, between evie & her dad). I do feel bad for not being able to write a more positive  but I’m afraid that honesty always wins out in my s so I will be detailing all of the reasons why I was unable to like this novel. If this book happens to be on your radar or on your TBR pile I recommend you check out some more positive s. Here are a few of the things that dampened my enjoyment of this book, SPOILERS BELOW:☞The Magical ElementWhat was that all about?! At times the story seems to forget all about Evie’s ability to see how other peoples’ romantic relationships start and end. These glimpses into a couple’s story give us very incomplete visions of their relationship (let alone who they are). The visions were jarring, something that stood out against an otherwise realistic & contemporary YA backdrop. Maybe had they remained one of the main preoccupations of the narrative they would have not felt so out of place but as I said mentions and scenes featuring Evie’s power remained very inconsistent. There’s a lot about them in the first few chapters where Evie is immediately able to establish that her visions are real. And that they only serve as a way to add more angst to her character. You see, now she has proof that love is fake and true romance doesn’t exist. It just so happens that, except for one couple towards the end, all of the couples she has visions of break up/separate.☞StorylineThis ties to the 1st point. I would have liked the storyline to be more consistent. At first, we get a lot about her visions and her ‘i don’t believe in love anymore’ act, before switching to the dancing side of things, before honing in on her romance with X and her arguing with her friends. Personally, I would have liked more family dynamics. She hates her dad because he cheated on her mom, which is fair enough, but that this made her go through such a dramatic ‘i’m getting rid of all of my romance books/love doesn’t exist/in case you didn’t notice i’m a cynic now’, well, I just a hard time putting up with the same information being repeated over and over again. We get it, she feels betrayed by her dad (even if one could argue that, given that she’s nearly 18 and about to leave for college, she should not feel so involved in her parents’ relationship with each other...they are individuals of their own). She spends most of the novel dissing her dad and acting like he’s a monster before arriving at the classic plot-point where she tries to understand his perspective etc. Like, why did she have to be so immature? Her character development was predictable and her relationship with her parents would have benefited from more page-time. Her sister too! They were at one point close and yet for extended periods in the novel the sister is very much forgotten. Speaking of family dynamics I would have loved to see more of x and his own family (as opposed to him mentioning a call or two from his dad). His grandparents (as far as i can recall) own the dance studio where they are training at and yet we don’t learn too much about their relationship with one another. The point is that to me, the story meandered too much and had one too many unnecessary ingredients that ended up ruining the final product. We have Evie angst-ing over her parents’ break up and her dad cheating, we have the little library and the visions, we have the dancing sessions, we have her romance with X, we have the fights with her friends, we have miscommunication and reconciliation, and then, in a very soap-opera-ish move, bam, a tragic, but ultimately entirely forced bittersweet ending that teaches Evie a valuable life lesson (that just because something comes to an end does not make what came before worthless or any less meaningful). It all felt vaguely calculated and moralistic while at the same time, we get sudden changes in the storyline direction that amount to a less than cohesive story.☞EvieWhile not wholly unsympathetic, I found her selfish and immature to the point where I wanted to finish the book so I could get out of her head. Supposedly 17, Evie is as emotionally mature as a 10-year-old. So, she caught her dad cheating and is traumatised, and begins acting like he’s some heinous human being and seems to believe that her mom owes her an explanation on why their marriage ended like this. Evie refuses to talk to him and acts like a brat. Her newfound attitude towards love and romance contributed to my impression of her being far too childish for her actual age. I would expect this over-the-top behaviour from a Disney movie, not a contemporary YA novel that is so clearly striving for depth and, visions aside, realism. Her visions confirm her love ends in tears stance (i mean, at one point she throws at us the following: “Heartbreak = love + time”...which is something i could have written in one of my angsty poetry phases i went through aged 13 or so). Her dad betrayed her mom so it makes for her to seemingly overnight dismiss the notion of love/romance. I disliked how intrusive she was when it came to her parents' relationship but I actively hated her behaviour towards two of her friends (one of whom is the nasty-type-friend, usually white and rich, that is all the rage in contemporary YA). They become a couple during the course of the novel (their personalities remain very much one-dimensional and their romance is rushed indeed) and Evie sees them kissing so of course she gets a vision that ends with them breaking up. She decides that they shouldn’t date because their eventual breakup will break their friendship group...so what does she decide to do? She refuses to see them! She isn’t all that concerned for them and their relationship, no, what worries is how their romance affects her. Selfish much? And the narrative goes on to prove that Evie was right and that of course, their failed romance ends up ‘breaking up’ their clique (really?).It was just so frustrating to read her constant whining about her dad or making childish statements on how love ends in heartbreak yadda yadda. Why was it so hard for her to realise that yes, over the course of your life you will likely be with multiple people (as opposed to having only one 'true love')And then her romance with X...yeah. At first, I found their interactions cute and understood to some extent why Evie was somewhat hesitant to admit her feelings towards him (after all, didn't she swear off love?). But then, his presence in the novel amounts to serving as a plot device. He exists to teach Evie that it's okay to fall in love and that even if said love ends with heartbreak that doesn’t change what came beforehand. What irked me the most is how his death is utilised by the narrative as the final step in Evie’s ‘learning to trust/love again’ arc. It wasn’t believable, it was clichéd and predictable from those rounds of questions earlier on in the story (where evie & co + X asks each other supposedly ‘philosophical’ questions that amount to: would you want to know when you are going to die or is true love real?). His death enables Evie to ‘grow’ as a character. That her reaction to learning of his approaching death is that of ghosting him...shit. Evie, sei una vera stronza. But it’s all good cause someone comes and tells her that she should not always be focusing on the end of things and think about the memories you make along the way (cheesy af). She apparently spends the next few months with him knowing that he will die but not telling him because earlier on he said that in a what-if scenario he would not want to know when he’s going to die….I mean really? She doesn’t even tell him to go to the doctor? ☞And they are meant to be teenagers?The teenagers in this novel were so unbelievable. Their banter, as well as the ideas and opinions they express, were so vanilla. As I said earlier, with the exception of one or two lines here and there, these teens would have been better suited to a Disney movie. I guess they will appeal to fans of Netflix's teen romance/drama/coming-of-age movie. The novel's message too felt more in line with those kind of movies. ☞Self-Aware Romance (?)Because Evie is a romance connoisseur she often lists tropes of the genre of says things on the lines of ‘it feels like i’m in one my old romance books’ or ‘he’s behaving like the LI in a romance’...yet, despite this supposed self-awareness the novel still implements many tired clichès and plot points. ☞The Dance Angle + FifiI liked the dancing sessions but after the halfway mark the dancing aspect of the novel seems largely sidelined in favour of angst between characters. Which, in my mind, is a pity. I would have preferred the novel to be more about dancing (esp. given that title + cover).Fifi is X and Evie’s instructor and boy-oh-boy isn’t she a walking caricature. I struggle to understand why American authors (i’m looking at you casey mcquiston) write Eastern European characters this way. Not only do they have a thick accent but they have a funny way of expressing themselves and say borderline offensive/inappropriate things but it’s all good because accent + foreign = lol. All in all, while now and again there were moments or exchanges that I found sweet (mostly between the main couple or evie and her bff martin), on the whole, I did not ‘vibe’ with it. I’m sure many others will love it and the points above are merely expressing my very subjective impressions of said book. Maybe the novel’s target demographic will have a more positive experience with it than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Aug 14, 2021","Aug 16, 2021","Aug 14, 2021",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/55784444-instructions-for-dancing

It was a bland and repetitive affair, which is a pity given the hype around it. It didn’t help that a few weeks ago I read another ‘Cloud Atlas-esque’ novel. And while I didn’t fall head over heels in love with To Paradise, I cannot deny that Yanagihara’s prose is superb. Here instead…Sequoia Nagamatsu’s prose brings to mind the word turgid (examples: “Moles and freckles dance around your belly button like a Jackson Pollock painting, and I fight the urge to grab a marker and find a way to connect them into a Tibetan mandala, as if that would unlock some secret about who you were and what, if anything, I really meant to you.” and “your ass the shade of a stray plum spoiling behind a produce stand”). Additionally, to compare this to the work of Emily St. John Mandel seems misleading, as How High We Go in the Dark lacks the atmosphere and subtlety that characterizes her books (and this is coming from someone who isn’t a devoted fan of hers). Anyway, even if I were to consider How High We Go in the Dark on its own merits, well, the verdict isn’t good. While this is by no means the worst novel I’ve read, it has been a while since I’ve been confronted with a novel that is so consistently and thoroughly mediocre. I will likely forget about ever having read this in a few days. Already I struggle to remember most of its stories (let alone its characters). Even if I was tempted early on to DNF this, I kept on reading hoping that the next story/chapter would deliver something more substantial than its predecessor but no such thing happened. I guess I could say that it was ambitious? I mean, it doesn’t pull off what it’d set out to do but at least it had aimed high? Of course, as we know, if you aim too high you end up crashing down (a la Icarus).Ugh, I’m really trying to think of some positives to say about How High We Go in the Dark but it seems that I have nothing good to say about it other than it has an ambitious premise (whether it actually delivers on its premise is up to debate...). I guess, I like the book cover...not sure if that counts as a 'positive'...So, to give prospective readers an idea of what to expect: How High We Go in the Dark takes place during and after 2030. A lot of the population is decimated by the Arctic plague which is unleashed onto the world after some scientists ‘stumble’ upon the thirty-thousand-year-old remains of a girl. Additionally to the plague climate/environmental disasters are causing further chaos. Each chapter reads like a self-contained story. While some characters, we learn, are connected, or even related, to each other, these stories ultimately fail to come truly together. By the end, what we have isn’t a tapestry but a series of samey fragments that don’t really succeed in bringing to life the characters or relationships they are supposedly focused on. Out of 14 stories only 4 are centred on female characters. If the characters we are reading of are shown to be in romantic and or sexual relationships, these will be painfully heteronormative ones. It seems that Nagamatsu’s vision of the future has no place for the gays, let alone for those who do not identify with their assigned sex at birth. That we get so few female voices also pissed me off. Like, come on, 4 out of 14? Anyhow, the first two stories actually held some promise. In the first one, we follow a scientist whose daughter, also a scientist, died while ‘unearthing’ of the thirty-thousand-year-old human remains. This father goes to Siberia to resume his daughter’s work. Here we hear the first echoes of the plague: after these remains are found the facility goes under quarantine. Like the majority of the stories in this novel, this first one is all about parents & their children. There is the dynamic between the narrator and his now-dead daughter as well as reflections on his daughter’s (non)parenting of his granddaughter. The following one, 'City of Laughter', almost succeeds in being memorable but ends up falling similarly short. The central character is once again a bland and inoffensive man, just an average Joe who is only slightly interesting because of his job. This guy works at a euthanasia park. The plague initially affects children and those with vulnerable immune systems (i think? we never gain an entire picture of this plague so what do i know) so some governor proposes the construction of “an amusement park that could gently end children’s pain—roller coasters capable of lulling their passengers into unconsciousness before stopping their hearts”. The main guy falls in love with a woman who is there with her son. The juxtaposition between the amusement park setting and the true purpose of this 'park' does give this story an air of tragicomedy (at one point a distraught and grief-stricken parent hugs our protagonist who is wearing a furry animal costume).The following stories are harder to set apart from each other. There is one with a scientist/lab-person who has lost his son to the plague. He ends up forming a father-son bond with a talking pig whose organs will be used to save/help those with the plague (once again, i don’t entirely remember because it wasn’t made very clear). You would think that the talking pig storyline would be far from boring but you’d be wrong. That this ‘son-figure’ is a pig is a mere gimmick. The pig could have been a monkey or a doll or a robot. I would have preferred for the pig to be more of a pig. This story has even the gall THE Pig movie (with the scientist telling the pig: 'that'll do'). Anyway, once again the author explores this, by now, rather tired parent-child dynamic: what does it mean to be a good parent? Do you protect your child from the harsh realities of their world? Maybe if he would have allowed for more subtlety in his storytelling and character interactions, maybe then I could have felt more connected to the parents and their children. But that wasn't the case. The conflict is made so obvious, that there is little room for interpretation or even nuance.We have a couple of stories where boring men fall for boring women and vice-versa (here the writing veers into the overwrought). Some do so online, but the author doesn’t really add anything new or interesting to the VR experience. I mean, if anything, these VR-focused ones read like subpar Black Mirror episodes. Social media goes largely unmentioned...We then have quite a few that go on about new funerary traditions because apparently so many people have died of the plague and cemeteries cannot contain so many bodies. Here Nagamatsu tries to be inventive but I found the idea of funeral hotels and funerary towers rather, eeh, underwhelming? Even that one chapter that follows a spaceship on its way to make a new Earth failed to be interesting. There are two chapters that try to subvert things: one is intentionally disorientating in that the narrator and some other people are someplace else, another one tries to tie things back to the 1st chapter, to give this novel an overarching story, but t it just came across as jarring.I don’t understand why the author chose 2030 as his starting point. The future he envisions feels generic and wishy-washy. There are self-driving vehicles (i think?) planet earth is dying, and this plague is decimating the human race. How refreshing. Maybe I’ve read too much speculative fiction but the sci-fi & dystopian elements of How High We Go in the Dark felt tame, vanilla even. Been there, done that kind of thing. While Nagamatsu strives to achieve that quiet realism that characterizes the dystopian novels of authors such as Mandel, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Ling Ma, he misses the mark. Tone-wise too these stories seem lacking, especially if I were to compare them with the unsettling work of John Wyndham. In addition, the future he envisions pales in comparison to the ones you can find in the stories penned by N.K. Jemisin. Throughout my reading experience of How High We Go in the Dark I just kept being reminded of better speculative books & films. Almost all of the narrators sounded exactly like the same dude. Which was odd given that these characters are meant to be at different stages of their lives. Additionally, it seemed sus that all of the characters used the same vocabulary, articulated themselves in identical ways, and they all shared a love for ‘vintage’ music (we have the Beatles, Patti Smith, The Strokes, Smashing Pumpkin, Siouxsie and the Banshees). The story is set in 2030. The characters are in their 20s, 30s, possibly early 40s. Yet, they all came across as belonging to the same generation. While I know that the whole idea of there being different generations is somewhat reductive, you can admit that people who are born in the same time ‘periods’ and in the same countries (the majority of the characters are Japanese American and live in America) share certain experiences/similarities. Here, none of the characters came across as believable older millennials or gen-zers. The popular media that is mentioned too was ‘old’. Why not then set your Artic Plague during the 90s or early 2000s something? It would have been made for a far more convincing setting. At least then the characters (from their worldview to their vernacular) would have not felt so out-of-place (come on, these guys do not sound like they are born in the 2000s). The parent-child conflict that was at the heart of so many of these stories was cheesy af. We have a parent trying to connect to their child. The child is like, NERD. Okay, I’m joking but still, you get the gist. The children are grieving and confused, the parents are grieving and confused. Yet, what could have been a touching book about human connection reads like a parody, starring difficult children who wear headphones 24/7 and answer back because of teenage angst, and emotionally repressed parents who happen to be scientists and because of this, they are cold and clinical. On that note, there is one character who is not a scientist and is in fact 'an artist' and her art was beyond ridiculous (it gave me the impression that the person who had created said character had only a vague and clichéd idea of the kind of person that goes on to become a painter).This book is full of grieving people, which should elicit some sort of reaction from me but nada. Nothing. My uncle and grandfather died respectively in November and December. I was unable to attend one of the funerals due to travel restrictions. The other died soon after testing positive for covid. Surely a book about losing your loved ones to a pandemic should hit close to home....except that it didn't. I felt at a remove from the characters who were often defined by their job and or whether they had children.  The world-building, as mentioned above, was full of lacunae. Some of the gaps in the world-building seemed intentional as if to provide us with too much information on the plague and the state of the world during and after it would take away from the ‘human’ relationships and the existential quandaries experienced by the characters….but still, I could not envision this future nor could I bring myself to believe in it. One of the stories seems to suggest a lack of resources but later on, this doesn't seem the case. I also found it hard to believe that the relatives of those who could easily be seen as culpable of this whole plague (the wife and granddaughter of that first scientist) would be allowed to go off to Earth 2.0 (as far as i can recall of course, maybe the narrative does address this...).Choppy and repetitive, How High We Go in the Dark is a rather subpar novel. I would have almost preferred it if had just been your bog-standard speculative fiction book but no, this one aims higher and it shows (not in a good way). The dystopian elements are gimmicky and given our current pandemic…derivative (apparently the author wrote this before covid but i am reading it now so..).The writing vacillated from decent to unintentionally hilarious to plain bad (""Aki still avoided speaking to me when he could avoid it.""...this book had an editor? really?!). We get a few clumsy attempts at the 2nd person which were...the less said about them the better actually. Nagamatsu's prose was not my cup of tea. This was not the genre-bending novel I was hoping for. The supposedly interwoven storylines did not feel particularly 'interwoven'. There are characters who are mentioned in more than one chapter, or we read of someone who is close to a character we previously encountered but that’s about it. These chapters and characters failed to come together in any meaningful way.Anyway, just because I thought this was an exceedingly bland affair does not mean in any way that you will feel the same way. If you loved this, I am happy for you. At least one of us was able to enjoy this book.If you are interested in this novel I recommend you check out more positive s.find me on: ❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ ...more",Notes are private!,-1,273,1,"Jan 18, 2022","Jan 20, 2022","Aug 13, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/56554299-how-high-we-go-in-the-dark

I, however, found it rather generic and clichéd. As the title itself suggests The Summer of You is very much a light summer romance. The manga follows Chiharu and Wataru, two boys who attend the same high school and find themselves bonding over their shared love for film. When Chiharu confesses that he’s in love with Wataru, and while the latter is surprised and confused he claims that this won’t affect their friendship. During summer break they embark on various day trips to see various filming locations from some of their favourite films. During this time, you guessed it, Wataru starts questioning his feelings for Chiharu…This is a very mellow shounen-ai that makes for easy reading. While I wasn’t all that taken by the mangaka’s art style (something about the faces didn’t vibe with moi) I’m sure many other readers will fall in love with it. I liked the slow-burn friends-to-lovers dynamic between Wataru and Chiharu; however, I could have done without the ‘past meeting’ storyline. It was obvious and rather contrived.All in all, The Summer of You was a more than decent read and I’m sure that will appeal to ardent shounen-ai fans.ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 14, 2021","Aug 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54993842-my-summer-of-you

I wanted to cry for her, and for myself.” Superbly written The Inseparables is a novella that pairs an enthralling depiction of female friendship with a razor-sharp commentary on gender and religion. This is the kind of work of fiction that reads like real life, unsurprising perhaps given that Beauvoir created Sylvie and Andrée after herself and her real-life friend Zaza Lacoin.Written in a controlled and polished style The Inseparables presents us with a beguiling tale in which Sylvie, our narrator, recounts the enigmatic nature of her bond with Andrée. The two first meet as young girls while enrolled at a private Catholic school and, in spite of the divergence between their religious beliefs, they become, as the title itself suggests, inseparable. Due to the conventions of their time and society—the French bourgeois of the early 20th cent.—they cannot be too close and so have to refrain from being too intimate with one another, for example by addressing each other with the formal you.Still, they keep up a correspondence and talk at length to each other, earning themselves the disapproval of Andrée’s mother who frowns upon their, God forbid, long and possibly intimate conversations.Sylvie is fascinated by Andrée, in particular, she seems hyperaware, intrigued even, by her self-divide. On the one hand Andrée, a devout Catholic, expresses conservative ideas and opinions, which make her appear particularly naive. On the other Andrée possesses a clever mind and a propensity for expressing surprisingly subversive thoughts. Andrée is a magnetic individual who oscillates between irreverence and conformity. Sylvie, who did not grow up to be a staunchly religious individual (apropos, in a diary entry beauvoir wrote: ""i have no other god but myself""), cannot always reconcile herself to Andrée’s way of thinking and struggles to understand the loyalty that Andrée has for her family, which Sylvie herself views as suffocating.As the two grow up we see how Andrée continues to struggle with understanding her own emotions, trying and failing to contain her fiercer self. We also see how her mother’s constant reprimand have affected her self-worth and distorted her view of herself. When she falls for Pascal, a puritanical young man who seriously considered being a priest, Andrée’s resolve to lead the kind of life that her family, as well as her society, is tested. She desperately wants to escape her present circumstances but this desperation ultimately results in self-sabotage. We witness her unravelling through Sylvie’s eyes, who, as much as she yearns to be of help, cannot ultimately save her.Beauviour’s piercing commentary on gender, class, and religion was profoundly insightful. She addresses these things with clarity and exactness, illustrating how fatal oppression and repression are on a person’s psyche. What I found particularly touching, and relatable, in this novel was the unrequited nature of Sylve’s love for Andrée. Regardless of whether the love she feels for Andrée is a platonic one or a romantic one, we know that Andrée doesn’t feel the same passion for Sylve. Whether she’s unwilling or unable to reciprocate the iSylve’s feelings, we do not know for certain, however, we can see how deeply this realization cuts Sylvie. Sylvie is shown to be both jealous and resentful of Andrée’s family, holding them responsible for her friend’s unhappiness. This novella’s subject did bring to mind Fleur Jaeggy’s Sweet Days of Discipline, which also explores an intense female friendship, Dorothy Strachey’s Olivia(which is far more flowery and sentimental than this but also capture a youth’s unrequited love and longing for another) as well as novel such as Abigail and Frost In May (which are both set in all-girl schools and touch on female friendships and religion). While Sylvie is both attuned and attentive to Andrée, her moods and beliefs, she does, like we all tend to do, idealise her given that she is her object of desire (whether this is desire is platonic or sexual, it's up to the reader to decide, i, to no one's surprise, felt that it was the latter).This was a riveting read. The prose is sublime, the story an equal parts evocative and tragic exploration of young & unrequited love, heartache, independence, kinship and intimacy.I will say that as much as I loved this I couldn’t help but the publisher’s short bio of Beauvoir, as well as Levy’s and the translator’s mentions of her, felt very incomplete. As far as I can recall they all omit to mention Beauvoir’s more ‘unethical’ behaviour. As a teacher, she had ‘relationships’ with her underage pupils and went on to sign a petition seeking to abrogate the age of consent in France (because of course age is just a number!). Here you might argue that those things have nothing to do with this novella or her friendship with Zaza (discussed by both Levy and the translator). But I maintain that they do. You can’t just mention the fact that she’s a feminist and try to analyse her real-life friendship with another woman or her commentary on female sexuality while at the same time omitting that in her lifetime she ('allegedly') groomed her underage female students and seemed in favour of pedophilia. That she did those things did not detract from my reading experience however it certainly made me a little bit more critical of our narrator's obsession towards her friend. Some of my favourite quotes:“Secretly I thought to myself that Andrée was one of those prodigies about whom, later on, books would be written.”“No, our friendship was not as important to Andrée as it was to me, but I admired her too much to suffer from it.”“What would I have daydreamed about? I loved Andrée above all else, and she was right next to me.”“I thought to myself, distressed, that in books there are people who make declarations of love, or hate, who dare to say whatever comes into their mind, or heart—why is it so impossible to do the same thing in real life?”“The errors I admitted were those of the soul above all: I had lacked fervour, too long forsaken the divine presence, prayed inattentively, regarded myself too complacently.”“Andrée was unhappy and the idea of it was unbearable. But her unhappiness was so foreign to me; the kind of love where your kiss had no truth from me.”“Never. The word had never fallen with such weight upon my heart. I repeated it within myself, under the never-ending sky, and I wanted to cry. ”“No doubt she loved Andrée in her way, but what way was that? That was the question. We all loved her, only differently. ”“Happiness suits her so well, I thought.”““Don’t be sad,” she said. “In every family there’s a bit of rubbish. I was the rubbish.”“For Andrée, there was a passageway between the heart and the body that remained a mystery to me. ”ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Aug 24, 2021","Aug 25, 2021","Aug 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56155180-the-inseparables

Everybody was yelling or cowering or sneering, angry or afraid.”  My Monticello is a suspenseful novella that presents us with a scarily imaginable scenario (given all the alt-right & neo-nazi rallies that have happened in the last couple of years & the Capitol assault) where a group of violent white supremacists engulf Charlottesville. Our narrator, Da'Naisha Love, escapes the violence and finds a momentary refugee in Monticello, which happens to be Thomas Jefferson's historic plantation. Alongside her are strangers, her white boyfriend, her elderly grandmother, and other people from her neighbourhood. Over the course of nineteen days, this cobbled group tries to carry on. Their fear is palpable, and more than once they find themselves faced with possible threats from the outside. Tensions run high and various members within the group inevitably find themselves disagreeing over what to do. Da'Naisha also happens to be a descendant of Jefferson and Sally Hemings, and her ancestry makes her view Monticello through a very specific lens. Throughout the course of the novella, Da'Naisha also reflects on racism in America, slavery, white supremacy, and interracial relationship. Also, that this group has found refuge from white supremacists in a former plantation adds further complexity to their circumstances.“But mostly I knew my lineage the way most families know theirs: I knew because Momma told me, because MaViolet told her.” While I appreciated Da'Naisha’s piercing commentary, I did find her, and every other character, to be very paper-thin. So much so that they didn’t really strike me as characters but names on a page. The narrative is not particularly concerned or interested in fleshing them out but in addressing issues related to race and American history. Which, as I said above, I did find compelling, however, at heart, I am drawn to character-driven stories, and in this regard, this novella just wasn’t it. There is also some attempt at drama involving Da'Naisha, her bf, and the man she, unbeknownst to him, cheated on him with (who of course happens to be there as well).Lastly, the lack of quotation marks...ugh. It just put me off reading, to be honest. This stylistic choice didn't seem particularly necessary/fitting for this kind of novella.

Destiny Birdsong’s compelling and vibrant storytelling is certainly immersive. She also has a knack for rendering a strong sense of place as Shreveport, Louisiana almost functions as a character itself. The dialogues too flow easily and ring true to life. The novel is divided into a triptych structure, each one revolving around Black women with albinism. While they do share similar experiences, they each had their own distinguishing voice. We begin with Suzette, a sheltered 20 something who begins to bristle against her father’s domineering rule. She wants to learn to drive, go to college, work and do all of the things her peers are doing. Her father however is unwilling to let her grow into herself and goes out of his way to control her. Her mother is on her side but she too ultimately has no choice but to comply with her husband’s demands. When Suzette begins to experiment with her sexuality things come to head and she is forced to confront what she is willing to do for her own independence. I liked the author’s non-judgemental approach to Suzette’s sexuality and her desire for self-fulfilment (which could have easily been depicted as selfishness). While the author does underline the privileged existence that Suzette has led so far, she also includes scenes in which Suzette is discriminated against and or treated as other. Is she to blame for her own naivete when her father has kept her away from the world? The following narrative follows Maple who comes from a very different background than Suzette’s. Maple’s mother has recently been murdered and Maple is still reeling from this loss. Her grandmother is unwilling to accept that her mother was very much a ‘free-spirited’ individual who would go on to lead a ‘risqué’ lifestyle. Maple eventually gets to know Chad, someone who is also grieving a loved one. The last narrative is about Agnes, an older woman who becomes involved with a security guard. After a failed interview Agnes makes a dangerous choice that will lead her on the run with this security guard. She seems to be using him to protect herself from the consequences of her actions, he seems to believe that because she has albinism she is ‘magic’. I didn’t really get this last narrative nor did I find Agnes a particularly sympathetic character. I thought her behaviour somewhat irrational and didn’t find her to be a fully fleshed-out character. Still, out of these three stories I really liked the first two. They were engaging and thought-provoking and I appreciated how realistically imperfect the main characters were. But the third one tonally was just eeh…and had a rather meandering narrative. While the first two stories do follow a coming-of-age type of narrative this last one was just stale-ish. Still, Birdsong is certainly an author you should keep your eye on and I look forward to reading whatever she writes next....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Feb 08, 2022","Feb 11, 2022","Aug 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58340949-nobody-s-magic

One writes to plumb one’s own depths, to understand what’s inside.” Having found Optic Nerve to be a puzzling yet thoroughly compelling book I was very much eager to sink my teeth into Portrait of an Unknown Lady. Whereas Optic Nerve loosely ties together the unnamed narrator’s meditations on history and art, in Portrait of an Unknown Lady Gainza contains the narrator’s reflections and inquiries into these subjects into what appears to be more of a semblance of a plot. This by no means results in a plot-driven narrative, as there is no urgency to the protagonist’s introspections. Her ruminations are given a freewheeling tempo, one that reminded me of lazy summer days from my childhood. In spite of her philosophical speculations, the narrator’s internal meanderings had a buoyancy to them that saved them from coming across as verbose or laboured.Set in Buenos Aires the narrator of Portrait of an Unknown Lady is an auction house employee who follows her mentor into the more shady recesses of the art world. When her mentor dies our narrator feels lost, lacking purpose, and direction. She eventually finds solace in rejoining the world she’d left behind, as she begins to search for the identity of a forger, best known for their Mariette Lydis forgeries. In her investigation of this unknown person, the narrator finds herself considering just what a forgery is and whether there is a thing as ‘authenticity’. The first quarter of this slim volume was certainly engrossing as I found the narrator’s recollections of her early days on her job and her relationship with her mentor interesting indeed. As the book progresses however I found myself bored at times. The narrative at times seemed to stray away from its original plot so I found myself forgetting that there was a plot in the first place. I would have probably preferred a more experimental and unconfined narrative, In Optic Nerve, for example, each chapter was very much self-contained, whereas here we have this overarching storyline that never comes to the fore. Still, I always love reading about art, and Gainza demonstrates a vast knowledge of this subject. I liked reading her impressions of certain artists or art movements and the insight she gives into the more administrative aspects of the art world. Gainza is as adroit and insightful as ever but overall Portrait of an Unknown Lady left me wanting more. The snapshot-like stories that make-up Optic Nerve stayed with me longer, as they captured in vivid detail the life of an artist and a moment from the narrator’s own life. The parallelism between her experiences and those of the people she discusses gave the narrative further dimension. Here instead we lack that very specific comparative element, and even if identity, loneliness, and authenticity are central themes, both to the protagonist and her subject, well, it resulted in a far looser comparison.Still, I can see myself returning to this book as a re-read may result in a newfound appreciation for its story.

Alas, the story reads like a very generic high-school shoujo. うるわしの宵の月, translated as In the Clear Moonlit Dusk follows Yoi Takiguchi, a high school girl whose princely appearance has earned her the nickname of 'Prince'. Often mistaken as a boy, Yoi is not used to being seen as a 'girl'. This premise did ring a bell as I remember reading a manga years ago in which the heroine had a masculine appearance and the hero a feminine one. There it kind of worked as the two leads (as far as i can remember) were comfortable quite comfortable with the way the looked. Here, sadly, Yoi isn't keen on being seen as a 'prince' as seems to be indifferent to her female classmates' attention (they routinely confess their feelings to her or simply stare at her in awe). Then she meets Ichimura, who is also nicknamed 'Prince' (i guess they couldn't come up with something more creative?), and he seems to see her as a girl. Shocking. The guy calls her cute and Yoi becomes all flustered in a ""who me?"" way. I found the both leads quite bland. I wish Yoi hadn't been so easily taken by Ichimura. That the other girls become jealous of Yoi does not bode well as it promises a classic girl-on-girl hate side-plot that we could well do without. The main male lead is boring and so far his personality revolves around his beautiful appearance and his 'ability' to see Yoi as a girl.The art is lovely, the story & characters mediocre. Maybe those who haven't read many shoujo manga will be able to enjoy this more.ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Aug 09, 2021","Aug 10, 2021","Aug 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56436381-1

Beside the predictable lack of quotation marks, her prose is certainly polished and there were manyDNF 30% Imogen Crimp is a clearly talented writer. Beside the predictable lack of quotation marks, her prose is certainly polished and there were many razor-sharp observations that caught my eye. It saddens me then that the story she choose to tell, well, it's a rather tired one. We have a milquetoast protagonist in her twenties who feels remote and vague. Anna allegedly wants to be an opera singer but she seemed very much to be going through the motions...her passion and drive for singing didn't really come through. She meets an older man who is cold and kind of closed-off but there is something alluring about him that supposedly makes Anna feel things. The two begin seeing each other in a casual way but it's quite clear that the man's behaviour will eventually escalate (gaslighting/possessiveness/emotional abuse etc...). Maybe if I hadn't read Promising Young Women I would have been more patient towards this story but ugh, I've reached the 30% and I'm bored. This reads like an amalgamation of other novels following directionless young women, specifically, Happy Hour, Exciting Times, and Acts of Desperation. Similarly to Happy Hour this novel presents us with that clichéd friendship dynamic: our narrator is the more giving one whereas her friend is ""louder"" and mean (in this instance she shows pleasure at our protagonist's hardships). Their landlords are caricatures that would have been more suited to a show like Fleabag which went at odds with the Sally Rooney-esque tone of the narrative. I am also tired of protagonists like Anna who will present themselves as so disadvantaged when they aren't. Anna isn't wealthy like the other ppl attending her prestigious conservatory but she's still white and conventionally attractive. Don't tell me now that those things don't work in her favour when she's auditioning. I wanted the narrative to expand more on her career and her relationship to art, music, etc. than her ""toxic"" relationship with that man. But no, we just have scenes of her being kind of passive in a way that will later inevitably make us (and her) question or revaluate her role in this ""toxic"" romance. I hope that Crimp's next novel will tell a more original story....more",Notes are private!,0,32,0,not set,not set,"Aug 09, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52696974-a-very-nice-girl

While the unfolding drama between a trio of ‘friends’ was fairly amusing to read of, Wahala wasn’t quite the suspenseful domestic thriller I’d hoped it to be. Still, this was, for the most part, an entertaining read and Ronke alone kept me turning pages. Set in London, Wahala is centred around three mixed-race friends, Ronke, Simi, Boo. They met in Bristol and their shared experiences drew them together. Over the years they have all embarked on different paths but they remain close friends, eating out together or meeting up to vent about their partners or lives. Ronke, a dentist, doesn’t have the greatest dating history but she hopes that her current boyfriend, Kayode, is ‘the one’. Simi, married to Martin who lives and works in New York, is tired of putting up with her boss’ microaggressions. Boo is growingly dissatisfied with her life as a stay-at-home mum. She begins to resent her husband, Didier, and even her four-year-old daughter.And then Isobel arrives. She’s hideously wealthy and an old acquaintance of Simi. Soon enough she inserts herself in the group, spoiling them with expensive gifts and seems more than willing to let them vent about their lives. While Boo falls completely under Isobel's wing, and Simi too, finds herself confiding her secrets to her, Ronke remains suspicious of her motivations. Each chapter switches between Ronke, Simi, Boo, so that we get to see their perspectives equally. We also begin to sense that Isobel is up to no good as she seems intent on stirring trouble, and soon enough cracks begin to form in the bond between Ronke, Simi, and Boo.I liked the author’s sense of humor as well as her commentary on race, marriage, motherhood as well as her insights into Nigerian culture (her descriptions of Nigerian food are *chief’s kiss*).Ronke, Simi, and Boo have very different personalities and, while they do share many similar experiences, backstories. Boo, for example, grew up not knowing her Nigerian father and because of this seems to distrust Black men like Kayode (her friends do call her out on this). Ronke, on the other hand, loved her father, who passed away when she was young and does not see herself dating a man who isn’t Black. Simi doesn’t want children, Ronke wants to start a family, and Boo has a child she seems to hate.There were things that prevented me from truly loving this book. For one, the story could have benefited from an extra dose of suspense as the ‘thriller’ aspect comes into play at the very end. The narrative seems mostly driven by the miscommunication between the various characters (couples & friends alike) and after a while it became repetitive.I also hated, and I mean it, Boo and Simi. They were awful, to their partners and Ronke. Ronke, who was honest, kind, funny, I loved. But seeing her remain friends with these two horrible people…? Why would she do this to herself?Boo’s chapters were a chore to get through. She complains constantly about her husband and daughter, both of whom are actually far more likeable than she is. She’s also really stupid in that she jumps to idiotic conclusions without using any common sense.Simi was more of a cypher and I did not feel particularly sympathetic towards her.Isobel was very hard to believe in. Those ‘twists’ towards the end managed to be both predictable and totally OTT. Isobel seemed just to exist as the bad guy and maybe I would have found her more credible had she had her own chapters.All in all, while Wahala is not exactly a riveting read, it was for the most part an amusing read that doesn’t take itself too seriously (the author pokes fun at her characters’ histrionics). I do think that Ronke deserved better and that Simi and Boo had it too easy...ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,-1,95,1,"Aug 08, 2021","Aug 11, 2021","Aug 05, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54569266-wahala

From the aesthetics permeating the story to the combative & codependent character dynamics, Summer Sons share a lot of similarities with that book. Lee Mandelo’s older cast of characters however allow for them to employ an edgier tone, one that at times reminded me a bit of Leigh Bardugo'sNinth House (both mcs have spend most of their respective narratives chasing paranormal shit, to the detriment of their academic, getting repeatedly emotionally and physically bruised and pissing off ppl left and right). The first time I approach Summer Sons I ended up dnfing it. While I do agree with some of my initial criticisms I think this second time around I was able to just ignore the few bumps along the way and just let Summer Sons take me for a ride. Written in snappy prose Summer Sons follows Andrew, who is in his early twenties and is about to begin a graduate program at Vanderbilt where he will be joining his best friend and (adopted) brother Eddie. Their bond is very much of the codependent variety, as the two were irrevocably bound together by a traumatizing childhood experience that has left them with, in the case of Andrew, some unwanted abilities. But then, just before their long-awaited reunion, Eddie commits suicide leaving behind a grief-stricken and confused Andrew. Eddie left everything to him, including a ridiculous amount of money and a house in Nashville (roommate included). Andrew moves there, but he couldn’t really care less about his studies. He is determined to find out what happened to Eddie. He is immediately suspicious of and antagonistic towards Eddie’s former roommate, Riley, and his cousin, Sam. Andrew is jealous of the time they spent with Eddie and is reluctant to reveal anything about his past or his intentions to them. The first half of the novel has very little if no plot going on. I mean, things are happening but they mostly consist of Andrew feeling unwell, hitting someone, getting hit, getting drunk, getting high, ignoring his uni inbox, and making wild speculations about what happened to Eddie. He does have a few meetings with his advisor and tutor, but for the majority of the first half of the novel it’s more about the very charged dynamics between Andrew and Sam, and to a lesser extent, Andrew and Riley. There is a party or two, some drag races, and buckets of toxic masculinity. The chemistry between the various characters more than makes up for the lack of, shall we say, plot. The author also explores Andrew’s very intense relationship with Eddy, capturing the duo’s power dynamics.I appreciated how thorny Andrew is. He is so careless about his own well-being that he engages in some pretty self-destructive behaviours. He is also repressed af, and struggles to reconcile himself with the possibility that his love for Eddy may have not been strictly platonic. And of course, his attraction to Sam complicates matters. And yeah, there was something about them that definitely reminded me of Ronan & Kavinsky, except not quite as messed up, as here both Andrew and Sam embody what I can best describe as an exceedingly Ronan-esque chaotic energy. I liked the realistic way Andrew responds to the queerness of this group of friends, and that it takes him time to truly allow himself the possibility of being attracted to men.To exacerbate his alienation are recurring nightmarish visions of death and rot. Eddie’s phantom is stalking him, resulting in periods of dangerous dissociation. Riley and Sam claim they want to help but Andrew. being the hard-ass he is, is not so sure about letting anyone in. The latter half of the novel has more to do with his amateurish sleuthing, as Andrew is forced to confront the likely possibility that what occurred to him and Eddie as children has something to do with Eddie’s death.We have old family curses and blood rituals, eerie visions, and disturbing occurrences. Additionally, Mandelo dedicates time to critiquing how insular colleges are as well as the elitism and racism that pervade the academic world.I liked the uneasy relationships the characters have with one another, and that Mandelo holds their main characters accountable for their past and present actions without writing them off as ‘bad’. There were a few things that I wish could have developed differently. The paranormal element had potential but was implemented in an inconsistent and in some places sparse way that ultimately does it a disservice. I liked how it remains largely ambiguous but it could have been amped up in quite a few instances. Also, in the scenes where this paranormal element comes to the fore the descriptions could have been more vivid. It would have been nice to learn more about haunts/revenants or other spooky occurrences that Andrew & Eddie may have experienced after ‘it’ happened. Similarly, it would also have been nice to have more of a background about their childhood and teenage years (their relationship with Andrew’s parents, their high school days, etc..). We know about their tattoo and their ‘shared’ gf (who thankfully speaks up about being used and tossed aside like a toy) but very little about anything else. In some ways it makes sense since they were each other’s worlds, so everything else would barely register, however the complete lack of presence of Andrew's parents was felt.The resolution to Eddie’s death was too derivative, especially within the urban fantasy genre. She who shall not be named did that a few times in her series. Maggie Stiefvater subverts this trope by making readers, but not our main characters, aware of who the ‘antagonists’ are. Barudgo also does it in Ninth House, but in a far more twisty way than Mandelo. Here instead that finale seemed vaguely formulaic and entirely too predictable. That the ‘villains’ lacked a certain ‘oomph’ factor also made that last action rather lacklustre. I do think that at the end Andrew gets a bit too much of the blame for how things went down with the villain. The boy is an asshole sure. But he was just trying to find out the truth and how could he have possibly predicted that things would go down that way?! The writing had a certain fanfiction-y quality but I found myself really enjoying it (so we have a lot of growling, flashing teeth, dangerous expressions, an overuse of ‘the boy’ instead of the characters’ names). The prose was snappy and intentionally edgy which makes for highly engrossing storytelling. I do wish that the author had reigned in on the more anatomical descriptions of his characters. There are whole paragraphs dedicated to describing whose leg is on whose ankle or how someone’s hand is dangling or touching somebody else's body part). Yeah, in a way these add a certain sensual element that makes these scenes really pop, but there were moments where they ended up sidelining the actual storyline or drawing attention from the dialogue. There were also way too many random highfalutin words dropped in for no reason (such as 'cadre') and they had the same energy as me during my first year as an undergraduate student using archaic terms for no reason other than to make what I was writing sound clever (but i just ended up with some seriously jarring phrases). Despite these criticisms, I did like Summer Sons. Andrew is a tortured and somewhat impenetrable character that is equal parts frustrating and lovable. Mandelo articulates Andrew’s inner conflict without resorting to cliches or moralisms. The interactions between the characters seamlessly alternate from being funny and entertaining banter to more heated and tense confrontations. The friendships and the romance we see develop between Andrew and others really make the book. I loved how the author is able to dedicate a lot of page time to Andrew’s unresolved and complicated relationship with his sexuality but also present us with some very casual lgbtq+ rep (we have a trans character, a positive portrayal of polyamory, and a character who uses they/them pronouns makes has a cameo appearance). The pining and sexual tension between Andrew and Sam were *chief’s kiss*. I’d love to read more by this author (maybe something with wlw characters…? or just more girls in general cause i don’t think this book would pass the bechdel test test..at least in trc we have the women of 300 fox way).If you like spooky summer ya novels, like Beware the Wild, The Wicker King, Wonders of the Invisible World, or the gritty aesthetics of urban fantasy series like Holly Black's The Modern Faerie Tales, Summer Sons should definitely make it onto your tbr pile. I look forward to whatever Mandelo publishes next and I can definitely see myself re-reading Summer Sons.ps: i did think it would have been nice for mandelo to mention in their acknowledgements stiefvater as her series clearly inspired this book....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Apr 13, 2022","Apr 15, 2022","Jul 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53290204-summer-sons

Our words—even when spoken from a position so powerless that all that’s produced is a moth-like squeak—can be loud enough to wake the house: a house that is often sleeping peacefully and does not want to be disturbed; a house in which perhaps you’ve found a home. I’m very much in awe of Michaela Coel. While I liked Chewing Gum well enough, I May Destroy You blew my mind. It made me cry, it made me laugh, it gave me friggin goosebumps. If you haven’t watched it, do yourself a favour, and do it ASAP.I would recommend Misfits to those who haven’t watched Coel's MacTaggart Lecture. That talk, transcribed here in Misfits, is powerful indeed. Honest and incisive, this talk is definitely a must-listen/read. Coel recounts growing up Black in London, from the racism she experienced at school (from both the students and the staff) to her time at drama school. She describes a few specific episodes that highlight her love for theatre and creativity. Coel also discusses how racist, sexist, and toxic the filming industry is. Later on, Coel also speaks of being sexually assaulted, and while she doesn’t go into too much detail, this part is particularly brutal. Additionally, Coel expands on her idea of being a misfit and exploring notions of belonging and identity.As much as I loved Coel's words, I’m not entirely sure why her talk was published as a book. The talk is sandwiched between two short new pieces, the first one preceding said talk where she writes about having anosmia, moths, and recalls a peculiar dream she had some years ago (it felt a bit disjointed).

After reading the first few pages I was reminded of Luster by Raven Leilani but here I found the narrator quite irritating. The prose too tries too hard to be snappy and edgy, both through its imagery and its, often flowery, metaphors. I am not too keen on narrators who present themselves as wronged on all fronts, and, for quite some time, Willa struck me as self-victimising, especially when it came to her parents. Her passivity too was a source of frustration but, as I continued to read, this unwillingness and inability to act on her part endeared to me. She’s so used to minimising or straight up dismissing her experiences and encounters with racism and sexism that her immediate response to someone saying something offensive is to doubt herself (is she overreacting? is she misperceiving their words/actions? are they just being ignorant or malicious?). Willa is one of those main characters who is in her early twenties and leading a rather directionless life. Her divorced parents have gone on to have ‘new’ families and she rarely is in touch with them. Willa feels conflicted about her Chinese American identity. She often doesn’t feel or is made to feel, neither Chinese nor American enough. Willa’s sense of otherness and aloneness are further exacerbated by her disconnection from her parents, in particular her father.After a lukewarm college experience, Willa ends up working for the Adriens, who are a wealthy white family based in Tribeca. Willa looks after their only daughter, Bijou. Similarly to the narrators of Luster and Lucy, Willa feels drawn to Nathalie, Bijou’s mother. Willa tries to act as the nanny the Adriens’ want but tries as she might to fit in with them she cannot reconcile herself to their extremely privileged lifestyle. They, in turn, seem wholly unaware of Willa’s true family history, partly because Willa herself omitted and or lied about quite a few details, partly because they are rather self-absorbed. They also make unfortunate remarks about Willa, at times patronising her or making her feel small and obscure. The novel strings together many every-day moments from Willa’s life as Bijou’s nanny so we get quite a lot of scenes revolving around cooking or that take place during mealtimes. I liked the tensions that the author is able to create in these seemingly ordinary environments (such as the kitchen). There are many instances where Willa messes up or makes some (sometimes downright idiotic) mistake that make me feel both embarrassed on her behalf and rather sympathetic towards her. The author captures the confusion and anxiety many people feel in their twenties. Time and again Willa is made to feel as if her job as a nanny is not a ‘real’ job or that she has yet to become a fully-grown adult. While the Adriens’ are often oblivious of Willa’s real feelings and when with them Willa does put a front, she does become infatuated with their family. Her routine as a nanny offers comfort, in fact, it shields her away from actually confronting her parents and or her future.Of course, as I said, the Adriens’ home is not a perfect refuge. Willa is often confused by Nathalie’s confiding in her, only to, later on, treat her like ‘house staff’. She also comes into contact with their relatives, and they turn out to be pretty vile. She endures humiliating jabs and or dismissals at her expense and has to put up with looking after sexually inappropriate young boys. The worst of the bunch is Nathalie’s younger brother whose microaggressions make Willa feel understandably ill at ease.I can see how many readers will find Willa infuriating. She rarely acts or speaks up for herself. Her fear of rejection and abandonment are such that she retreats inward, keeping her true self hidden from others. Her general confusion about her identity is exacerbated by her Chinese American heritage. Time and again she’s asked questions on the lines of ‘what are you’, which serve only to alienate her further from others. Willa makes plenty of stupid choices along the way (do not read if you can’t stand second-hand embarrassment) and rarely thinks things through. Even so, I ultimately found her to be an endearing character. She’s so lonely and alone that you can’t quite bring yourself to judge her as you would someone with a ‘solid’ support system. And, boy oh boy, the discomfort she feels around others, especially Nathalie’s brother was so well-conveyed. His looks plus the way he accompanies his offensive comments with plenty of ‘I’m just joking’ smiles and laughs, well, they succeed in making Willa doubt herself.Willa's story arc was truly compelling and I appreciated just how self-critical she comes to be by the end. I did find myself wishing for her to confront certain people but I guess that we don't always have the opportunity to do that in real life. I will say that not all of the characters were as nuanced as Willa. Bijou’s father is more or less a non-presence. Bijou, well, she didn’t strike me as a, particularly believable child. I get that the author was being satirical, but she sacrifices authenticity in her attempts to poke fun at this type of wealthy, white, & wannabe-sophisticated American family. Quite a few chapters take place during Willa’s childhood and they struck me as a bit artificial. This type of narrative structure (alternating between now and then) is a bit overdone and here it wasn’t wholly necessary.I think that readers who enjoyed YZ Chin's Edge Case and Alexandra Chang's Days of Distractions and are looking to read more books exploring the realities of being a young Asian American woman in contemporary America should definitely check this one out. Additionally I can see this book appealing to fans of Brandon Taylor, Rachel Lyon, and even Lily King.re-read: as I suspected re-reading this made me like it a lot more. I loved Willa's introspective nature, the way she articulates her loneliness and sense of otherness, and the remote yet intimate quality of her voice. I also appreciated the flashbacks a lot more this time around and I found the moments they explored to be quite fitted to whatever was just happening in the 'now'. The ending was both believable and satisfying although part of me still wishes that we could have seen Willa become less passive....more",Notes are private!,0,62,2,"Mar 12, 2022Nov 04, 2021","Mar 14, 2022Nov 05, 2021","Jul 06, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56889467-win-me-something

Astonishing to come across such a friendship at this point in life. At any point in life.” Ann Patchett is easily one of my favourite authors of all time. The Dutch House and The Magician's Assistant are absolute favourites of mine and I’ve also loved her previous collection of essays, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage, which managed to bring me hope during one of my ‘down in the doldrums' phases. This is all to say that I will read anything by Patchett. These Precious Days, her latest, is yet another winning addition to her already impressive oeuvre. While many of these essays are preoccupied with death and mortality they ultimately struck me as life-affirming. In some of these essays, Patchett writes about her family, in particular of her relationship with her three fathers. There are also essays in which she looks back to her ‘youthful’ days, for example, of that time when she and a friend were so taken by the tattoos of a Parisian waitress that they were determined to also get tattooed. Patchett also gives us insight into her married life, writes of her love for dogs, of her relationship to Catholicism, of that year she gave up shopping, and of authors, she admires such as Eudora Welty and Kate DiCamillo. It is difficult for me to articulate just how much comfort I find in Patchett’s ‘voice’ but within a few pages of her first essay, I found myself immersed in that which she was recounting. Patchett has a knack for rendering both people and space and it was easy to be transported by her writing. Of course, the ‘These Precious Days’ essay is this collection’s crowning glory. In this essay, Patchett writes of her friendship with Sooki, Tom Hanks’ assistant. This was such a moving and thoughtful essay, one I look forward to revisiting again.Patchett’s meditations on death, mortality, family, friendship, and creativity definitely struck a chord with me. I loved learning about her childhood and I appreciated those glimpses into her everyday life.Reading this inspiring and beautifully written collection of essays was a balm for my soul....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Nov 24, 2021","Nov 25, 2021","Jul 06, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56922687-these-precious-days

The novel tells yet another tale about an alienated millennial woman having a quarter midlife crisis. While Mona At Sea is far from terrible it is a novel that is clearly riding the coattails of its betters (to name a few that i liked: My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Luster, Pizza Girl, Severance, You Exist Too Much, Pretend I'm Dead, books by Caroline O'Donoghue; to name a few i did not like all that much: Milk Fed, Exciting Times, Hysteria, The New Me, Everyone in This Room Will Someday Be Dead, Three Rooms, and Nobody, Somebody, Anybody). Not only does almost everything about Mona At Sea read like a poor imitation of these novels—from its trying but failing to be sardonic tone to its ironic characterisation (we have the ‘dudebro’, the rich friend with body image problems, the leery 'this is a boys' club' businessmen) and, the pièce de résistance, its self-sabotaging main character—and doesn’t bring anything new to this ‘alienated women’ subgenre.Set in 2008 the story is narrated by Mona Mireles, a twenty-three-year-old who majored in finance at the University of Arizona. After the job she was promised at an investment bank in New York falls through due to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Mona, a high-achiever who has dedicated herself to her studies and future career, is unemployed and struggling to keep afloat. She sends hundreds of applications but is unwilling to look for jobs outside the finance sector as she is unwilling to compromise.What follows is a rather typical narrative in which Mona engages in self-destructive and antisocial behaviour, pushing those close to her away, until she eventually finds herself lowering her ‘expectations’ and getting a job at a telemarketing business and re-assessing why she’s so set on getting into finance.We don’t learn much about her relationship with her parents, other than her mother seems to have always pressured her into aiming high while her father has encouraged her to take time to ‘find herself' and pursue something that she actually likes. The two are having marriage problems but these are broached superficially, partly due to Mona’s solipsism, which leads her to ignore those around her, and partly because the narrative just doesn’t seem all that intent on giving depth to those two characters, let alone their marriage.Her younger brother is a typical dudebro who is far more likeable than Mona herself. The men Mona begins frequenting are similar shades of dickish. Mona’s relationship with her best friend seemed a poor imitation of the toxic one from My Year of Rest and Relaxation.A clip starring Mona goes viral and she's occasionally approached because of it (she's nicknamed 'Sad Millennial' as she was crying during this interview which occurred after she discovered that she would not be getting her 'dream' job after all).As Mona struggles to make it through each day, she engages in self-harm. Here the novel became off-putting, especially in its sensationalist approach to this subject matter. Fyi, not that it should bear any weight on the ‘validity’ of my opinion on this (after all, this is my own personal opinion, others readers will undoubtedly feel differently and all that jazz), I used to self-harm throughout most of my teens. Mona’s self-harming is portrayed as being ‘different’, ‘artistic’ even as the scars she’s inflicting on her thigh depict Leonardo’s Mona Lisa (and yes, her second name happens to be lisa). Now, I know that there are those who carve words & probably images on themselves however here Mona’s self-harming is elevated into being an artistic expression, she who for so long had focused on engaging and pursuing those kinds of activities that will enhance her career prospects, is creative after all! Wow! Amazing. And (minor spoilers i guess), the guy she dates later in the novel (a douchebag to be honest) takes photos of her ‘Mona Lisa’, telling her the usual patronising bullshit on the lines of ‘your scars are beautiful’ and ‘they show you are survivor’ and pressures her into accepting his request to showcase these photos. When she refuses she also snaps at him for other reasons and is shown to be the unreasonable one (there she is blaming him for her parents’ troubles or her own insecurity or her not so great career prospects). In the end, guess what? She gives in! And it all works in her favor! The guy was right after all. Puah-lease. And I hated that Mona’s self-harming is portrayed as being ‘different’, Not Like Other Self-Harmers. I came across an interview with the author where she said that she had no sensitivity readers (quelle surprise) but she did a lot of research on the topic of self-harming and that anyway Mona’s self-harming is atypical. First, I’m afraid I will dislike anyone who shows too much fascination with something like self-harming. It makes me feel like a subject, a rat lab. Second, why, why, why does her self-harming need to be so on the nose? She’s called Mona Lisa and here she is carving Mona Lisa into her thigh. Like, wtf?The narrative tries to go for this caustic tone, but I found it painfully unfunny and not particularly amusing. Its satire has no bite, its social commentary was not particularly insightful, and its depiction of unemployment, depression, self-harm were shallow indeed.But the worst offender in this novel is Mona herself. I usually end up loving or rooting for supposedly unlikable characters (they can be vain & cruel like Emma Bovary, or assholes like Ronan Lynch, or fucked up like Moshfegh's narrator) but Mona was just so annoying. She’s a perfectionist, we get it. She’s been ‘made’ that way, it isn’t entirely her fault. Her mother and her teachers and professors have had a hand in making her so career and goal obsessed. To have a successful and prestigious career is to be happy...right? Except that things don’t go as per plan for Mona and she feels understandably lost...and yet, even bearing this in mind, I still found her insufferable. She wasn’t funny, or clever, or sympathetic. For most of the narrative she’s self-centred, ungrateful, and just painfully annoying. And yes, she does ‘grow’ (supposedly) but even so I did not feel invested in her arc. People call her out on her shit and she learns to be a better person. And could I bring myself to care? No. I did not. Part of me thinks that she had it easy all things considered (especially if we consider that she got to age 22/23 without having to work so that she could fully dedicate herself to her studies...).Maybe if you haven’t read any of the novels I mentioned above and you are not particularly bothered by how a story handles self-harming you might find this a more rewarding read than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jul 25, 2021","Jul 27, 2021","Jun 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54579035-mona-at-sea

Which isn’t a good sign. According to t| |  blog |  tumblr | ko-fi | |I read Lemon only a few days ago and yet I can barely recall what it was about. Which isn’t a good sign. According to the summary, this was meant to be a suspenseful work exploring trauma, grief, and guilt but to be perfectly honest, it was anything but suspenseful and its themes felt barely touched upon. This short narrative consists of various chapters narrated by different characters connected to Kim Hae-on, a beautiful young girl killed during the summer of 2002. The story opens with Hae-on being interrogated by a detective in what seems to be a poor take on a police procedural. The remainder of Lemon consists of other characters talking about this murder. They all seem to have way too much information about the investigation and other events (events they did not witness first-hand) and that resulted in me feeling relatively disengaged and disbelieving of their words/accounts. We don’t know who’s speaking as each chapter doesn’t specify who’s pov we are reading and that quickly became annoying, especially since their voices sounded suspiciously similarly. There were two chapters that are meant to be one side of a phone conversation and these ones were so over the top. The way the person we were ‘hearing’ just happens to repeat the questions of the person at the end of the line (""Pardon me? What did you say, Doctor? What am I doing right now? Talking to you, of course."")...why just not include both ends of this conversation? I’m afraid I found this novel’s execution lacking. The characters, if we can call them such, are barely there, the narrative more intent on impressing readers through the way these various accounts are structured than on presenting us with an intriguing mystery. Many of the phrases struck as me clichèd (here the translation may be to blame) and/or banal ""Life begins without reason and ends without reason"", ""her beauty seemed not of this world"", ""What kind of life is this? Is this living?"". Then there were the odd phrases that I found really annoying in that they"". Some of the descriptions also rubbed me the wrong way because they were going for an edgy tone (""the hairy black patch between my legs"") or were simply a bit antiquated (call me a snowflake or whatever but i wish this expression ceased existing: ""joined together like a set of Siamese twins""). If you are interested in Lemon I recommend you check out more positive s as I have 0 positive things to say about this.ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jul 18, 2021","Jul 20, 2021","Jun 24, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56773168-lemon

Because of this, I was looking forward to Noor as I’m a fan of Okorafor’s take on Africanfuturism and of the way she seamlessly fuses folkloresque fantasy elements with sci-fi ones. While Noor certainly delivers on the Africanfuturism front, pairing this with a commentary on biotechnology, on humanity, and on the realities of being ‘other’, its plot and characters, to my disappointment, struck me as extremely derivative. A bare-bones version of Noor would go like this: we have a dystopian setting where the evil capitalist government is after the heroine who is not like other people and has special powers & her man who is also persona non grata and they eventually join a group of rebels where she comes across ex-lover before final ‘battle’ with the baddies. Anwuli Okwudili, who goes by AO, initials that stand for Artificial Organism, lives in a dystopian Nigeria. She was born with various physical disabilities which were later aggravated by a car accident. To her parents and her society’s disapproval, she goes on to have many body augmentations which enable her to be mobile and pain-free for the first time in her life. The opening sequence is rather clumsily executed as we are given vague descriptions about AO’s world (just how far in the future is it?). After splitting up with her partner who is openly repulsed by her ‘machine’ parts (why were they even together in the first place? she already had augmentations by the time they met, and all of a sudden he’s disgusted by her?) she goes to her local market where she’s attacked. AO is forced to flee and comes across DNA, a Fulani herdsman who is at first quite hostile to her (i’m pretty sure he threatens her...how romantic). The two have to survive the desert together and come across very few other characters, and if they do, it just so happens that those characters are just there to play the role of plot devices to further their story. The narrative allegedly takes place over a week but to be entirely honest the passage of time is rather unclear. It seemed to me that the events that transpire within these pages could have all happened in 1 or 2 days. AO and DNA’s bond felt forced and eye-rolling. They just have to fall in love because she’s a woman and he’s a man and they are both on the run from the evil government. While the first half of the novel is rather vague in terms of worldbuilding we, later on, get a ton of exposition that leaves very little room for interpretation (this is something i would expect from a ya novel, not an adult one). Noor has the trappings of a generic dystopian novel. What ‘saves’ this from being an entirely forgettable and uninspired read are the setting and the overall aesthetic which blends together folklore and technology. Okorafor also adopts the story-within-a-story device which works in her novel’s favour. I just found AO to be hard-to-like and at one point there is a scene about choosing your name which just didn’t go down that well with me (that this novel lacks lgbtq+ characters made it even worse tbh). AO’s ideologies were kind of murky and incongruent so that I found it hard to relate to her. The final section introduces a few more characters who are given very little room to shine as they are sidelined in favour of AO and DNA.All in all, Noor was disappointing, especially considering how much I loved Remote Control. Ao is no Sankofa and in spite of the longer format, well, here the extra pages do more harm than good (they don’t expand the world or flesh out the characters but end up being about a weird romance and a final act that gave me major martyr vibes )....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Nov 17, 2021","Nov 19, 2021","Jun 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57632292-noor

All identity became ambiguous, semi-opaque.”  As the fickle creature that I am what drew me to Untold Night and Day was its cover. The first few pages intrigued me as they focus on Kim Ayami a former actor who now works at an audio theatre for the blind. The narrative that follows is rather metaphysical in nature, most of the discussions that occur within these pages are abstract and or relating to sensory experience, with, as the title suggests, special attention paid to night and day, darkness and lightness. This slim tome repeatedly obfuscates the line between dreams and reality, so that everything we read of is tinged by an air of surreality. At one point we read of a character who seems to be stalking Ayami before returning to her and a foreign poet nicknamed Wolfi. The novel was certainly disorienting, and in that, it evokes one of the story’s earlier episodes when Ayami meets with ‘the director’ in an exclusive ‘blackout restaurant’. We can’t really discern a story nor do we become familiar with the characters, and familiar settings and conversations are made unfamiliar. Alas, the discussion they have about art, poetry, performance, life, did not strike me as particularly profound or clever, in fact, they expressed rather tired ideas. I can safely say that I did not get this novel. While I usually like surrealist narratives but here...well, I just did not care. If you are looking for an experimental read and you have a higher tolerance for novels that are confusing for the sake of being confusing, well, you should give this one a try.❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jul 23, 2021","Jul 24, 2021","Jun 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45893865-untold-night-and-day

So, naturally, I was somewhat surprised and saddened to discover that Boy, Snow, Bird lacks any of those qualities. I can’t honestly say that Boy, Snow, Bird has any real strengths. There are far more superior books out there examining race in the 1950s and 1960s America, such as ReginaPorter’s The Travelers, and to call this novel a Snow White retelling seems overarching. While Oyeyemi does incorporate within her narrative certain recognizable fairy tale motifs—mean stepmothers who hate their angelic stepdaughters, magical mirrors and or reflections—the story she recounts struck me as painfully prosaic. We have a vague, and unconvincing, historical setting, cardboard characters, and an uneventful storyline that drags on too long.The novel is divided into three parts. Part one and three are narrated by Boy. She’s white and the daughter of a pest exterminator who she often refers to as ‘the rat catcher’. In a manner reminiscent of Dickens and She Who Shall Not Be Named, Oyeyemi gives her characters names, or nicknames, that convey their personality or profession. I may sound overly critical here but why do characters whose professions are often openly looked down upon—janitors, cleaners, pest exterminators, etc.—are so frequently cast in the role of sinister and/or obsessive creeps? I mean, just because someone whose job requires them to kill rats doesn’t mean they have to be ‘unstable’ and rat-obsessed (this guy makes rat noises and is apt to go off on anti-rat rants). Anyhow, this rat catcher is horrible through-and-through. He treats Boy in a rather appalling way and understandably she decides to run off once she’s done with high school. She ends up finding a job (what that was i cannot recall) and eventually becomes involved with a man named Arturo who is entirely void of a personality. This man has a daughter called Snow who is biracial, and Boy decides to exile her. Why? I can’t say for sure. It seemed that Boy found Snow’s ‘goodness’ grating or felt threatened by her.Boy and Arturo have a child together, Bird. Part two is narrated by her and it mostly consists of a series of boring episodes. She exchanged letters with Snow, who she has never met. Whether they got on or not, I have no idea. Their responses to each other’s letters were almost jarring. There is an attempt at exploring doubleness but the story never has anything interesting on this matter.We then return to Boy who has nothing really interesting to say. Up to this point, it was safe to say that I did not care for this novel. The characters were dull, poorly developed. Our mains were very one-note and their voices failed to elicit any strong emotions in me. The secondary characters are barely there, and most of the male characters—regardless of their age—blurred together. We also have that one Italian character who just has to say 'cara' this and 'cara' that. Ffs. Still, I would not have discouraged others from attempting to read it as this could have easily been one of those ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ cases but then Oyeyemi drops a rather unpleasant surprise near the end.SPOILERS AHEADTurns out that the ‘rat catcher’, turns out his name is Frank, who up to now has been portrayed as this abusive possibly ‘deranged’ villain, is a trans man. Frank is Boy’s mother. Frank used to be a gay woman who was raped and became pregnant with Boy. After this traumatic experience Frank ‘became’ trans: “You know how Frank says he became Frank? He says he looked in the mirror one morning when he was still Frances, and this man she’d never seen before was just standing there, looking back. ”Leaving aside the fact that Frank’s ‘story’ is recounted by someone who keeps misgendering and deadnaming them (this story is set in the 50s and 60s after all), I find this whole ‘reveal’ to be a poor choice indeed. Not only does the story imply that victims of sexual abuse cannot ever recover (which, unfortunately, sometimes happens to be true but here it struck me as intentionally sensational) but they will inevitably become abusers themselves. Which, yikes. Can we not? And don’t get me started on the whole ‘woman wanting to escape womanhood by becoming a man + lesbians becoming men because of trauma and the patriarchy’ terfy combo. Fuck sake. And to make your one trans character into an unhinged abuser is decidedly questionable.To prospective readers of this book: I would like to dissuade you. Give this one a wide berth. Oyeyemi has written far better, and certainly a lot less dubious, things, so I recommend you check those out instead....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jun 08, 2021","Jun 11, 2021","Jun 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079683-boy-snow-bird

Except for the one thing that shouldn't have terms or conditions. That should be a given. That should be so easy. Acceptance.”  Written in a simple conversational style Fifteen Hundred Miles from the Sun is a tender love story, equal parts funny and heartfelt. Julián Luna’s voice is exceedingly authentic and it will be easy for readers to form a connection to him. Jules lives with his father in Corpus Christi, Texas, and he is in his last year of high school. He has a tight group of friends, most of them Latinx like him, and a supportive older sister. His relationship with his father however has become increasingly strained in recent years. Jules’ father has a fixed vision of what being his son should be like. His rather passè notions of manhood and masculinity lead him to abhor anything he perceives as 'different'. He's also quick to anger and is verbally and physically abusive towards his son.Even if Jules is not ashamed of being gay he isn’t willing to ‘come out’ in this kind of environment. His plans to ‘lay low’ are however sabotaged by one drunken tweet. The author does a brilliant job in depicting the, shall we say, highs and lows of coming out. On the one hand, Jules feels as if he can finally be himself, and many of the people around him are incredibly supportive and ‘there’ for him (i particularly loved his bond with his sister and jordan). On the other, well, given that his father has always been outspokenly homophobic it is unlikely that he will have a sudden change of attitude. As Jules goes through this particularly difficult period in his life he becomes close to Mat, who lives in Los Angeles and whom he ‘met’ via Twitter. Mat, also in his last year of high school, is an immeasurably sweet and empathetic guy and their texting was the perfect blend of cute, funny, and real. When they both start catching feelings they decide to try a long-distance relationship.What follows is a touching coming-of-age. There are many light-hearted and romantic moments that balance out the more heartbreaking ones. The author demonstrates great empathy in the way they portray and address abuse and struggles faced by lgbtq+ teens. Jules’ story, however painful, is one that needs to be told. Sometimes the people you love the most are the ones who will reject you or hurt you just for being yourself. Jules’ makes for a relatable and likeable protagonist. The author articulates Jules’ insecurities (about being ‘out’, his future, his relationship with his dad and others) in a very realistic manner. I also appreciated how bilingual the novel is—through Jules’ inner monologues and his conversations with his friends/family.The love story was probably my favourite part (was the moon/sun thing a bit cheesy? yes. did i care? no). While the story itself isn’t the most ‘original’, we have quite a few classic YA tropes, and some of Jules’ friends are rather one-dimensional, I overall really enjoyed this. Some of the pop culture references did go over my head, the kind of music the characters listen to in this novel is the kind that would make my ears bleed (just kidding), and having a character say ""OTP"" in real life is cringe, but whatever, these are minor things that probably won't bother other people. Fifteen Hundred Miles from the Sun will definitely appeal to fans of the YA coming-of-age genre and I would 100% recommend it to those looking for an engrossing story filled with romance, heartbreak, and hope....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jun 07, 2021","Jun 09, 2021","Jun 05, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55144174-fifteen-hundred-miles-from-the-sun

This memoir opens with Danielle Geller’s mothers' death. Geller’s mother was homeless when she died of withdrawal from alcohol, and Geller is forced to return to Florida to sift through her mother’s possessions. Using her archivist skills she ends up reaching out to her mother’s side of the family, aside she’s been estranged from, and visits them in their home in the Navajo Nation, where she learns more about her mother’s history and her Navajo heritage.Alongside these sections that follow Geller as an adult, there are chapters delving into her disrupted childhood, which often honed in on a particular episode.After her parents, both addicts split up, Geller and her sister go on to stay with their father. Their father, who is white, is an alcoholic whose emotional abuse of his children goes on to become physical when he assaults Geller’s sister. Geller recounts with disturbing clarity his erratic behaviour, for example of the way he would harangue them, telling them the same tired stories from his own childhood and adulthood, fixating on the wrongdoings he’s been subjected to. Although it's been years since I’ve shared a roof with my father, reading Dog Flowers was an uncomfortable reminder of just how overwhelming it can be to have (and live with) a parent with substance abuse issues. And boy, does Danielle Geller capture how devastating it is on a young person to be exposed to this kind of chaotic and vitriolic presence. It was distressing just how much of my father I recognised in Geller’s own one so reading these sections was by no means an easy activity. Geller and her sister eventually end up in the custody of their grandmother but things take a downward turn as Geller’s sister begins to ‘act out’.Geller’s prose is unsentimental and matter-of-fact, even when discussing traumatic episodes. In many ways, this memoir reads like a long list of tragedies. Geller’s mother, father, and sister all struggle with addiction and mental illness. Geller is exposed from an early age to emotional, physical, and self-abuse. Neither of her parents is capable or willing to look after her and her sister, and their attempts at sobriety and lucidity are short-lived. If anything, their attempts at a ‘normal’, or at least ‘stable’, life just give Geller (and us the readers) false hopes as they inevitably fall off the wagon. Time and again Geller has to look after them, often with little choice on her part as they emotionally manipulate her into helping them out. All of this sadly hit too close to home. When I saw some ers expressing surprise or shock that Geller would not cut ties with her ‘toxic’ family, well, I can’t help but think that their family situation may not be as dysfunctional as Geller’s. There are people out there who are able to cut off ties with their abusive parents or siblings. But, more often than not, you are unable or unwilling to cut someone off. Especially if you start questioning whether many of their ‘vices’ stem from trauma or mental illness. And again, hope. You hope that they will get clean, get a steady job, or lead a ‘normal’ life. And, in Geller’s case, well, all of her closest relatives have struggled with addiction. Is she going to cut them all off?! It was saddening to see that Geller’s relationship with her Navajo side of the family is far from idyllic or rosy. While her connection to her cousin struck me as moving, her relationship with her aunt was saddening indeed as she is revealed to be a woman who is full of anger and sadly seems to turn this anger towards her relatives. There is a lot of pain in this memoir. Geller captures with gut-wrenching clarity the realities and aftermath of a childhood marred by neglect, abuse, addiction, and trauma. Geller’s forays into her own past are brutally honest and are not accompanied by ‘moral’ lessons or ‘wise’ insights into human nature. I appreciated Geller’s honest depiction of her family and, more importantly, herself.While Dog Flowers deeply resonated with me, I did find its execution early on a bit clumsy. The author introduces too much too soon, and I wasn’t sure what had happened when. The ending too seemed a bit abrupt, and I would have appreciated more insight into Geller’s life (her friends, partners, work, etc..).Nevertheless, I found this a powerful and piercing read. It is by no means an easy read and I did find much of what Geller recounted to be extremely distressing, then again, I was also able to relate to many of her experiences. I appreciated that she neither villainizes nor condone her parents nor her sister and that in delving into her past she tries to understand their motivations or states of mind, even if ultimately, much about their identities remains a mystery or incomprehensible to her.Geller’s memoir is a haunting account of a family mired in pain. If you are looking for a challenging read, well, buckle up because Dog Flowers is it. Geller's portrayal of her family disrupts the myth of the happy family and the widely held belief that parents love their children. While there is love in this memoir it is often obfuscated by years of self-destructing behaviour and or by hatred, sadness, and weakness....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Nov 20, 2021","Nov 21, 2021","Jun 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53305670-dog-flowers

I can see what this novel was trying to do (something in the vein of The Chosen and the Beautiful by Nghi Vo) but it just lacked depth and subtlety. The foreshadowing was cheesy and so were certain descriptions that were meant to add to the 'aesthetic' but made 0 sense the longer I thought about what they were describing. The narrator is not particularly compelling, she's boring and her narration reflects that. What really took me out was her reasoning for going ahead with poising this evil patriarch. Like, she sees their rarefied world and goes to this party which wasn't particularly shocking tbh (not even one orgy? come on!) and jumps to several conclusions that lead her to believe that her father injured himself at one of these parties? I think? It wasn't very clear to me what made her think 'enough is enough'. So they throw wild-ish parties. She assumes that the people who attend them aren't aware of how wild things get but...why? Why does she think so after going to 1 single party?Anyway, it also seemed weird that she wouldn't have made the connection between her employers and the company/family responsible for her father's misfortune before or that she wouldn't research them before going for her interview. Maybe I would believe in her more if we'd been given more (or any really) scenes developing her relationship with her family (her mother shouts at her once or twice) but so far nada and so I have a hard time buying into her thirst for revenge. The other characters are all extremely one dimensional. The prose is okay-ish but nothing is holding down my interest, not even the prospect of a sapphic romance. The story/setting/characters are all meh.Maybe one day I will give this another shot and fall in love but for now tis' just too vanilla for me....more",Notes are private!,0,30,0,not set,not set,"May 27, 2021",,,view (with text),/book/show/55073801-tripping-arcadia

More often than not I find short story collections to be a mixed bag (with some good ones, some meh ones, and even a bad egg or two). But, I found myself drawn to all of the stories in Five Tuesdays in Winter. While the stories focus on characters who don’t always have much in common (be it their age, the time when and/or place where they are living, their fears or desires) their narratives are characterised by a bittersweet tone that will elicit feelings of nostalgia in the reader (regardless of whether they have experienced what the characters are experiencing). Despite the title of this collection many of these stories are set during the summer and easily transport us right there alongside the characters so that we too are experiencing the heat, elation, and almost-surreality of their summer holidays (that feeling of being free from the usual routines etc). King captures with unsparing clarity the thoughts and feelings of her characters, and conveys their wide range of emotions, honing in on the longing, unease, giddiness, and sadness they experience over the course of their stories. Some are in love with someone who may or may not reciprocate their feelings, others are in a phase of transition, for example, from childhood to adulthood, or mired in the confusion of adolescence.In the first story, ‘Creature’, Cara, a fourteen-year-girl, is employed by a well-off family as a babysitter for the summer holidays. During the time she spends at this family’s house she becomes infatuated with Hugh, her employer's son, who is much older than her. Our narrator is an aspiring author who likes to envision herself as a Jane Eyre sort of figure but, one thing is to daydream about Hugh, another is realising that Hugh has no compunction about making a move on her (when she’s very much underage).In ‘Five Tuesdays in Winter’ a single-father and bookseller falls for his employer who is also tutoring his daughter in Spanish. Mitchell is however unable to express his feelings and spends much of his time longing to confess his love to her. In ‘When in the Dordogne’ the son of two professors bonds with the two college students who have been hired to housesit his home and keep an eye on him. In ‘North Sea’ a mother and daughter are on vacation together but their strained relationship results in a less than idyllic time. While the following stories also present us with different perspectives and scenarios they explore similar themes (hope, connection, love). I liked how King manages to be both a gentle and an unflinching storyteller, that is able to make you happy one moment and sad the next. I also appreciated that the stories didn’t have neat endings or ‘valuable’ life lessons but often read like a slice-of-life that is providing us with a glimpse into a specific period of her characters’ lives. King captures how confusing feelings can be sometimes, so that we have characters both longing for something or someone while at the same time feeling uneasy at the possibility of attaining what, or who, they’d thought they desired. My favourites were ‘Creature’, ‘When in the Dordogne’, ‘Timeline’, and ‘Hotel Seattle’.King’s understated prose is a marvel to read and I had a wonderful time with this collection. If you were a fan of Writers & Lovers you should definitely pick this one up. Moving and wistful Five Tuesdays in Winter is a scintillating collection!ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 15, 2021","May 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57812401-five-tuesdays-in-winter
