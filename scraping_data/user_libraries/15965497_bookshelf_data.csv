The characters feel reliably sympathetic and realistic in their ups and downs. This is pleasurable reading material.In this one, Moriarty tries some new things by dipping her toe into issues of class (a little bit) and mental health (slightly more). We have three couples, the fairly regular Clementine and Sam, the socially awkward, traumatized-by-their-upbringing Erika and Oliver, and the not-quite-belonging-to-the-same-suburban-class-as-the-others Tiffany and Vid (who are seen as nouveaux riches and a little gauche).  And they all take part in the Fateful Barbecue.""Six responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It’s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong?"" goes the description. And about 60% of the book is a slow buildup to what has gone wrong. Unfortunately, this is where the narration doesn't quite stand to the task. The chapters more or less alternate between the present (two months later) and the Fateful Day. The characters are traumatised by the event and think/speak about it only in oblique terms. ""What if we didn't go?"" ""What if it never happened?"" is a common refrain. The refrain of plot contrivance, as it turns out. The problem is that everyone in the book knows what happened, but the author chooses to withhold it from the reader - which, quite frankly, is just dishonest. For a moment you wonder, maybe the characters don't remember the events exactly and the book will be about reconstructing their memories of the day (which would validate the premise) - but nope. They remember. They're just not telling.So you wonder - what is so terrible that they don't want to talk about it? Did someone die? Was someone permanently injured? Did they accidentally barbecue one of the kids? Or maybe it wasn't terrible, just shameful? DID THEY HAVE A HUGE ORGY? (view spoiler)[Nah. One of the kids got into the fountain, wasn't breathing for a minute, but they saved her with expertly administered CPR. She's completely fine in the present. (hide spoiler)]My point isn't that the idea itself is not interesting, but, rather, that the story could be just as engrossing if the major point of suspense wasn't ""what happened"" but ""how it happened precisely"" or ""who was responsible"". And Moriarty has the chops to write it! But instead, the narrative cannot but result in an anticlimactic reveal.And there is also a tertiary story concerning a grumpy neighbour, (view spoiler)[which just didn't work for me, because the characters never figure out that their barbecque antics were to blame for the neighbour's death, and they draw no conclusions from it. So the neighbour's tied into the story with some coincidences, but his plot could easily be extracted and the book would not be poorer for it.  (hide spoiler)]Still, I want to emphasise that it is a good reading and overall enjoyable - it's just that, frustratingly, a few different writing choices would have made the book so much better......more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27831371-truly-madly-guilty

I had previously read Sarah Pinsker's short story collections, which I mostly loved - the writing, the language - save for one story. The one on which this novel is based.This is perhaps a little disingenuous, because I didn't dislike that story. I just thought it was the least exciting of the bunch, because... I'm not huge on reading about music and musicians and how music is made and about live performances (unless it's non-fiction, but even then, not in every case). And, welp, this is my problem with A Song for a New Day: it's a book about musicians and live performances and (to a lesser degree) music industry in a world that has survived a smallpox pandemic, and where most human interactions have moved to virtual reality. On the plus side, the writing is very good - I really enjoy Pinsker's way with language, her sensitivity - and the worldbuilding is compelling (especially given Covid). Unfortunately, in addition to all the music (and YMMV, maybe other readers will love that), the plot gets didactic in a pretty annoying way. Capitalism is BAD and big corporations are only out to get your money - oh, of course, but there's surely a way to write about it that doesn't make the reader feel like she was repeatedly hit over the head with the message.Overall, I will be on the lookout for Pinsker's future works - I do have high hopes for her.

In many ways, I think these are perfect books for that age, and I would have loved having all 130 (or however many had been published by that time) to read then. One thing, though, is that when I was 7 or 8, I thought that the protagonists of BSC were so adult and responsible. Clearly, much much older than me.They were 12.But in some way, that feeling stuck with me, and even now, reading the following books, I often feel like I'm reading about 16-year-olds at least. And then I get this weird dissonance from their having to get home early from their sitting jobs, and I remember - 12. So now I read the first 21 BSC books - mostly due to the Netflix series having come out. And I still think they are very nice reading. Sure, they are formulaic and get repetitive, but there is some fun stuff: focus on friendship, focus on overcoming difficulties (together with your friend group, or on your own). The ""mystery"" books are pretty fun (Claudia and the Phone Phantom, Dawn and the Haunted House). And you basically read them in one afternoon*, which is also nice. Good summer reading, especially when you have some nostalgia for the series. (* Or three in a day, as it were.) What is weird: (1)that 12-year-olds in the books are so into boys and having boyfriends. You are 12! You have plenty of time to get coupled up! It's NOT strange for kids your age not to be interested in dating! (Yeah, having first crushes, sure, but somehow Kristy's lack of interest in boys is ""babyish"". No, it's not!) (2) that diabetes is treated like it were an STD - super shameful and strange. It was strange when I read it first, it remains strange now. The last book I read was the one where Kristy starts a softball league and... sorry, nope. That's it for me. I can deal with babysitting and strict parents and family conflicts and issues with friends and stepfamilies and so on, but sports give me the zzz. So that's it for me.But it gives me a lot of satisfaction that I finally got to read the 4th and the 5th volume, actually!  They had been teased in the back of the Polish vol. 3 all those years ago and they never got published in Poland, which, as my wife aptly realised, means that we got books for three out of four core friends. And that's how I learned what betrayal was when it came to books never being published although you you hoped for them....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 15, 2020","Jul 15, 2020","Aug 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/233790.Mary_Anne_Saves_the_Day

And then I went and read Philip's 1 star , and I got scared that the book would be terrible, so I put it away. But no, it does get better. Not entirely brilliant, but good. What I realized while reading Middlegame is that I really like books that follow two characters that we know belong together (not necessarily romantically) but who are separated and reunited in various stretches of the narrative. So that was really nice. The separation of abilities was also fun (although the seven-year-old girl criticizing the ""girls can't be nerds"" thing was... off). I think that once the book gets going, it gets space to become really good, though.One problem is that McGuire writes a lot of her characters as slightly off-kilter, and it doesn't make sense with all of the characters.
