I read it in 1.5 sittings, which is the way to do it, I think; I would have been happier with a single sitting, but my plane ride was 25 minutes too short. Like SOMEDAY THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU, this book is largely about nothing. No, let me back up and 'splain. HUMMINGBIRD dives so deeply into the details of a Marco Carrera's life that it forms a naturalistic snapshot rather than a plotty page turner. Letters from a childhood friend/ possible flame offer some delicate structure, but the real propulsive pleasure is in meeting Marco and getting to know him better and better and better, through Veronesi's careful observation. Marco's a kindly, durable soul, and we want the best for him. Unfortunately, he doesn't always get the best. That's pretty much the only point of the novel. For me, that was enough.I offer this recommendation in much the same way I offer recommendations for THE NEW POPE (another piece of media that is both full of Italians and often about nothing), knowing it's not for everyone, but also knowing it was only a recommendation that made me pick it up in the first place.

A single man nominated them for removal and assessment.Pabel, the author of this memoir, was sent by the Nazis to ""liberate"" Ukraine on the Eastern Front, finding out how false the hero narrative was many months into the war. He spoke both Russian and German, and as a bibliophile, he visited libraries even in the countries he marched through. He wrote at length about the different ways both Germany and Russia censored books-sometimes by altering content, sometimes by simply limiting access. He also writes of how shocked he is to find Americans able to say and read anything they like, speaking against atrocities. Eventually, he became an American.It's a hard, graphic memoir of war, obviously severely biased by the era and author, but it really drove home how censorship and book banning, no matter what you call it, is not about a particular political party: it is simply about consolidating power.My kids are now about to turn 18 & 19 and both will tell you that I was a strict parent. But I never felt threatened by the contents of my school library, because I talked with my kids, read what they read, made sure the door was open for them to be curious and critical.This openness is what made us a brilliant place to live; I sincerely hope we don't let fear shrink our world to a place we don't recognize....more",Notes are private!,0,205,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2023","Apr 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/128849991-enemies-are-human

How agreeable it is to discover my reader heart has not become a complete husk! The jacket of this novel says it's about a bookstore haunted by the ghost of a longtime (and annoying) customer, but really, that's just an excuse for pages and pages of a classily written, Gilmore-Girls-esque collection of Native women living complex found-family lives in 2019-2020 Minneapolis. This novel is also full of books, as one would expect in a book about a bookseller, and I like the recommended book lists at the end! The ghost plot gallops and then tip toes and then eventually shrugs along, which I think will drive some readers batty, but I generally felt the carefully drawn portrait of the main character Tookie was enough to pull me through. Speaking of Tookie, I read a few s here before I wrote this one and was surprised to find some people saying they didn't find her realistic or 3D—she reminded me so very uncannily of someone I know, both good and bad, that I felt Erdrich must have had someone like her very much in mind. It seems appropriate that the first book to break me from my reader slump is a book about readers. A long time ago, I spotted a little girl reading a board book in a bookstore.

The Housekeeper is a gentle but stubborn single mother who never finished school; the Professor is a math genius with a short term memory of only 80 minutes following a long-ago head injury. The plot of the book, in its entirety, is: will they become friends?In between their first meeting and the ultimate culmination of friendship, there is a lot of math, baseball, and math about baseball. Personally, as someone who comes from a more genre reading background, I was really longing by the end for a little magic, or a little murder, or a little mayhem. I think it reads like a long-form poem about relationships and math and truth than a novel, and if that is what you are in the mood for, you'll love it—the stakes are quite low and the vibes are quite high.

Brand. New. This shining black tower of decadence had been decorated only a few monthYears ago, I stayed at a brand new Vegas hotel for a conference. Brand. New. This shining black tower of decadence had been decorated only a few months before I got there. It had all the ambiance of a freshly vacuumed rental car. In time it would wear Vegas, or vice versa, but for now: it was the new, gormless kid on the block.So imagine my surprise when, on the last day of my stay, I was tormented all night long by something that turned on the jets in my hot tub, stomped heavily to and fro every time I turned the lights out, and, eventually, after I told the room audibly to ""cut it out, I've got an early flight,"" slammed a shaking blow into the headboard directly beside me to remind me who had seniority in this place. In the morning, I confessed to the front desk I'd had a bit of an exciting night, and not in the usual Vegas way. With a glance at the room number, the clerk said he bet that I had. Later, I found out the brand new hotel had only been a few weeks old when a man had jumped to his death from one of the rooms; the stylish glass balconies I'd enjoyed were an aftermarket part, designed to keep other tortured guests from following suit. Unclear if my room had been the unlucky suite. Unclear if my room was like that because the man had jumped, or if the man had jumped because my room was like that. So: that's The Shining. I'm sure I'm the last person in the world to have read the book (I haven't seen the film still, but now I will), but better late than never, right?Sucks to shine in a hotel hungry for it, I guess....more",Notes are private!,1,293,1,"May 05, 2022","May 05, 2022","May 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11588.The_Shining

I bought it based upon the prologue alone—I thought, if the rest of the book is even half this specific, wry, and surprisingly observed, I'm in. It's better.Written and illustrated by Will McPhail, whose cartoons often appear in The New Yorker, IN is about a young, intelligent man who wants to feel, but can't. His journey to letting emotional truth in is laugh-out-loud funny, eye-burningly sad, and strikingly true. And the art—THE ART, THE ALLCAPS ART. McPhail's use of gesture is unbelievably precise, describing the sorts of people we recognize with just a single shoulder slouch, spread open palm, twist of the hips, narrowing of the eyes. Do I have time to talk about metaphor? No. No. I will let you admire it for yourself when you buy it. IN is less a graphic novel and more a sweet, brutal poem about facing the world head on.
