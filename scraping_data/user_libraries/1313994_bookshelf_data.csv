It follows in the post-modern, (movie) theatre of the absurd tradition you either like because you also like to trip out, or, because you got your PhD in literature. Either way, it begs attention to the confusion and disjointedness of daily, contemporary life. In my opinion, this is somewhat redundant to most post-modern lit; as in, it was done before. Famously, in Beckett's novels that are very much at play in this novel. But Kaufman's awareness of that is what gets a pass.Others might think this too dense, pretentious, confusing, long, etc. It's both the long para and short para above. I gave it 5 stars because, as a work of literary art, one that I had to keep with me for 700 pages, I largely enjoyed the experience. Kaufman is brilliant and insightful, tragic and funny, and the book rides on so many contemporary issues: from identity politics to divisive politics. It forces you to pay attention by softening your focus on the absurdity and fixating more on the experience...wait, kinda like a movie. Eureka!

They're all present, and it is mildly interesting how Irving connects all to come to a plot point. The problem with the book is that it wants to be too long. Irving, you get the sense, wanted to write a long, winding, novel; and does so by adding long passages that are largely irrelevant. He also, about halfway through, starts repeating himself. Here's an example that really isn't an example: ""Own was short, so he couldn't reach the rim. The rim was too high for Owen to reach because he was short."" I kept finding myself saying ""I know already"" to each second sentence where this happened.And I like really long books. I like being taken for a ride. But this just has too much wanting to be a big book. The beginning is really interesting and full of some keen writing. Then, just before they get to high school, the scenes lengthen, the writing withers, and I ended up just waiting for the final coda, which is foreshadowed ad nauseam all book.And man if this isn't contrived. So much of it is wildly unbelievable. And don't lay into me about believability and faith and whatnot, purportedly topics of the novel. I don't mean here virgin birth or precognition or anything. I mean basic things, day to day things, that happen in the book that would never ever happen. The reader has to bring his own salt lick with him to swallow some of Irving's fantasy.Still, it's not in anyway a bad book.

Zinn's admittedly biased (he understands that an analysis of history cannot be delivered without bias) teaching of history focuses not on those in power but in the voices of the disenfranchised, largely through capitalistic systems.It is well-researched, written, and aims to counteract the evasive aspects of American history taught at-large by institutions invested in the lie that things like democracy and equality are primary principles of the American experiment. Rather, Zinn's honest look at how power corrupts flies in the face of proto-patriotic notions of a country divinely constructed.

I was engaged, laughing, and impressed throughout the first third of the book, before Bryson and Katz left the trail. Like many criticisms, I was put off by the pedantry and egoism of Bryson, but allowed for it because the uniqueness of his AT adventure made for fun reading.When they left the trail, however, the book took a downturn. Disclaimer: I am an AT hiker but not one who believes there is some sort of pure way to do it: ie all of it or straight through or whatever. I think the trail belongs to each hiker and means something unique for each. However, when they left the trail, the narrative lost all of its focus. Replacing wilderness discourse were numerous asides about songbirds, global warming, industrial recklessness, etc. I'm not antagonistic to the agenda, per say, but it detracted from what I thought was the thesis of the book in the first place. In other words: it became very obvious that Bryson didn't write a book about hiking the trail but hiked the trail to write a book. It reads like he had an idea for a book rather than a real intent to connect with hiking, nature, etc. (which, his philosophizing seems to claim).There was also a lot of faulty journalism. See: he talks endless s*it on the Pennsylvania portion of the trail (ostensibly, because everyone does), going so far as to say there are no views and that it is all rocks...all without hiking ANY of the PA section. Additionally, for the sake of enhancing the drama, there were clearly elements that were made histrionic and (dare I say) were just not true. Like, the wristwatch on Mt. Washington, really? The latter 2/3 of the book, in short, seemed an attempt to just finish a book. He's got all the writing chops, he seems pretty confident (read: smug), but on the whole, there are better AT books out there...by a long shot....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 07, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods

These things do not disqualify the novel themselves; in truth, there is a genius to Faulkner's ability to spin a story that seems to make absolutely no sense only to lead the reader to understanding exactly everything.There are some unique narrative tropes: different characters piecing together the wild plot, but even Faulkner jokes on occasion about how gimmicky the effect is (Shreve and Quentin become one, thinking the same narrative). It's quirky, and the writing is good as always, but the story does not hook the way some of the other novels do. The emotion, the hook and heart, aren't as there.

There's a lot of lazy liberalism in the book: taking shots at conservatives with no real reason other than her trying to distance herself from a reputation of being affiliated with conservatives. But the greatest offense here is her analyses of books. Every Intro to Lit student learns that literary analysis is not plot summary but a profound, argumentative look into context and content. Nafisi basically just offers plot summaries and disorganizedly connects them to strange notions of Americana.She loves Huck Finn but her two other book choices get cursory glances and her random Baldwin epilogue is rich only when she's quoting him.

A haunted house, then, is just an allegory for our ceaseless need to be stimulated when we feel alone and directionless. That, of course, is the true horror, and Jackson's positioning of this in a ghost story while examining the interlocutions of a struggling person, make this short book worth the time....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House

In fact, throughout the book, Russo is often beyond clever in his prose.Where the novel lacks is any semblance of profundity to which it is worth bearing witness. He gambles with mid-life crises, totters on ignobility in marriage, and almost--just almost--criticizes academia subtly enough to not be cached as satire.

But the novel is unfinished, unedited, and pales against its vibrant progeny.The novel does not jeopardize Atticus's legacy, as Atticus's final genesis is what we get in Mockingbird, not here. Still, it was viscerally painful to read him, what with his penchant for moral barometerism, say the terrible things that move Scott to vomiting.

This last bit was very believable too; the oscillation between studying and ""extra-curriculars"" on a student's mind were, I think, fair.What hurts this novel is that it is exceptionally, apologetically, and abhorrently misogynistic. It reaffirms all of the stereotypes of sexism in the African American community without seemingly being aware of it.

Microcosmically, the concerns of the novel's protagonists are how to progress against the latent, deeply-rooted prejudices of higher education. With its origins in Greek culture, academia (note the Greek word) remains in a system of hierarchies which subjugates members of groups not associated with the hegemony. On Sutton University's campus, the black students no longer wish to participate in an education that falsely promises a future for them.At a macro level, the novel represents far more complex issues with racial progress, particularly within the black community. Earl, the SGA president, has ideas of using the system for the advantage of his people. The radical MJUMBE student group, conversely, believes the system must be destroyed altogether and be rebuilt. These interests collide with the black president, Calhoun, who has given up his progressive ideas for a seat within the academic hierarchy.Well-written (except for sentimental sections concerning boy and girl relationships) and poignant, it's also important to point out the occasions of sexism in the novel, suggesting Scott-Heron is not beyond recognizing the multi-layered effects of prejudice.Ultimately, Scott-Heron seems to advocate for non-violent approaches to racism.

A mixture of Korean mythology and social criticism concerning the problems of homosexual identity in a heteronormative culture propels the novel to its tidy ending, something of an exhale, something of a sigh.I was intrigued about how the Fee, the narrator, tries to rationalize his sexual abuser's pedophilia toward the end; it did not seem to strictly come off as condoning the act but rather indicated how Fee was using his query to deal with the remnants of himself after the abuse. This was an angle I wasn't expecting, which added an intriguing layer to the discourse of abuse.My only complaint is that the second narrator, Warden, sounded much too much like Fee; it is as if the novel was so much in Chee's voice that his characters spoke in harmony.Still, a beautiful book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Apr 23, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/272433.Edinburgh

Frank and Gabler are sociologists and do not make note of the potential experimental bias of their research. Granted, their data is collected well, but the interpretation of such is whimsical, reductive, and highly problematic.They base their ideas on the argument that the university exists to understand and teach universal truths: a hegemonic, Western, and widely opposed construct. It's been a long while since Plato's great Truth was valuable to anyone outside of the Anglo heteronormative traditions. Still, Frank and Gabler seem to think the Humanities sustain these hierarchies rather than topple them. I point to political literary theories (Feminism, Critical Race, Post-Colonialism, Queer, etc.) to suggest how the Humanities have in fact evolved to consider parity and multiculturalism when other fields (ahem, sciences) had no cause to do so.Their interpretation of the Humanities is reductive and misinformed. They suggest the only application of Humanities is in law, and somehow clump education, journalism, communication, and advertising under the social sciences. Hmm. They completely ignore capitalism and personal interest in the modern University, as well as the critical thinking, creativity, analysis, metaphysical considerations, problem solving, abstraction, open-mindedness, and communication skills that are vulnerable with a decline of the Humanities.Perhaps Universities do train folks for jobs, advance technology, and attempt to ""map reality""; but they also develop the human--which is for what the Humanities exist.

Langer is often hostile, angry, and unreasonably violent in his s. He seems to advocate for the belief that Nazi war criminals got off too easy. That isn't to say that they didn't, but he seems to put forth his own agenda in saying so rather than contemplate compassion, a word he finds to be somehow evil.He also makes strange and presumptuous claims about how Anne Frank (for example) would feel if she survived. The text became less and less academic and more and more self-serving.I just couldn't help, while reading the banal last essays, that he, a learned scholar on these matters, fails to see how his hostility doesn't counter what he so studies and shuns, but uses its own energy to call contemporary readers fools and those with compassion too lenient.

While I don't feel like a kool-aid drinker in any pejorative sense, there is so much genius to this work that I can help but feeling energized with every perusal. Campbell's knack is comparative mythology; his thesis is that contemporary society has lost touch with the collective unconsciousness that myth explains as the human condition and the existential problem; his solution is to ""Follow your bliss."" Easy, right? It certainly seems so, when reading his words.What I like is how Campbell doesn't attempt to disprove any religion, but academically looks at the similarities all philosophies and religions share, where they came from, and how we can construct a master myth that helps us govern a life that is truly and mostly unknown.

While at first pretty slow, the dynamic character development and scope make up for the winding intro (although, perhaps this is his ""In the beginning..."" allusion that itself, is slow-developing). Strangely, the scope of the book is not temporally nor generationally wide, as perhaps you'd see in a Marquez book, but is more broad in its development and sure in its motives.I was particularly struck by the character of Sam Hamilton, who is one of the most endearing characters I've encountered in literature. He is simple, wise, and so attached to his circumstances that he emanates a feeling of sincere love for his life, which I view as something to emulate. Halfway through the book, when Sam and Lee begin to decipher the Hebrew of the Cain and Abel story, the prose and Sam's character really shine. The paragraph where Sam discusses his love for his horse almost brought me down. The story also has a number of meta-fictional asides by Steinbeck himself (interestingly, there's even a Roman a clef as Steinbeck includes a ""John Steinbeck"" as a character). These philosophical quips, along with the Biblical retelling of the C & A story, add to the genius of this work. The allusion, though obvious enough to recognize what Steinbeck's intentions are, is reasonably executed, and adds a unique perception of Biblical morality: Steinbeck pities Cain. The moral ambiguity of the Bible does not survive Steinbeck, and the novel comments on the myth of human experience while being true to the foundation of good writing....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 09, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden

Not only do we engage with a doomed man who petitions god, does not lose his faith in god, then almost goes to far as to blame god and demand from him (all within a few paragraphs); but we get the interesting metafictitious journey of the text as a historical artifact, its contraversy demanding conversation on the validity of fiction in depicting terrifying reality by assuming empathetic experience. Yosl is so compelling that he transcends his narrative and, with a few publishing snafus, becomes the autobiographical author. He had, in a sense, usurped the agency of the author to instill his own voice in historic canon.

Naturally, this shows the more horrific idea of how the West presumes to know what is best for Southeast Asia and remains ignorant to the succeeding results of its presence there.Fowler also harbors some interesting philosophical parlance (mostly with himself): rushing toward death out of a fear of it, fidelity and morality in marital monogamy, guilt in partisanship during military conflict, etc.As short and non-complex as the novel is, it nevertheless holds a large store of criticism and beautiful writing....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Nov 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3698.The_Quiet_American

And while humans argue the purposefull/lessness of existence, whether it is chaos or design, it seems Vonnegut ultimately just doesn't care; with lines about the sanctity of love and the joy of dog ownership, Vonnegut seems more of a Buddhist than a scientist.And the clincher: there isn't a pretentious word in the novel. Reading my , one would be apt to think they were getting a Stephen Hawking perspective of the Universe and existence. Au contrair (sp?), it's written so basically, so meanly, as to get the most poetic distance out of commonplace prose. Only, and I really think only, Kurt Vonnegut has been able to do this so effectively, so beautifully.Greetings....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4982.The_Sirens_of_Titan

Mitchell's level of genius is so stout that I literally had to stop reading at every meta-fictitious turn, only to be coerced back to the text with lingering ideas, questions, and enthusiasm. The novel is written well, and that's what matters most. For lovers of books, perhaps a variety of genres of books, Mitchell dons varied hats: from journal entries, to epistolary fragments, to corny detective fiction, to sci-fi; the very different writing styles all seem authentic, and all seem Mitchell. His voice resounds in them all.For the literary scholar, Mitchell is everywhere. Ideas of Postcolonialism, Marxism (Socialism), Feminism, Minority/Gender/Queer Theory, Corporate Capitalism Criticism, etc. are featured; it's as if we're reading a PhD dissertation without the pretentious seven-syllable verbosity. Though the stories are loosely linked, they can almost be considered by themselves (my favorite was “Letters”). Common themes seem to include the value of text: how texts themselves translate to human connection over space and time (for the sake of this , I define text as book, music, film). Text is, in a sense, an extension of language, which is the vehicle of communication. Mitchell senses this, and uses it as his major theme: human connection. The narrators all have a metaphysical conceptual connection (reincarnation) but what's more here is how humans relate to one another in our shared...atlas. The ending of the novel, in its beautiful albeit socialist discourse, exemplifies this.Societies lusting over power over the rights of the individual will destroy themselves.

I was taken by Franzen's prose style froThe Corrections is a long contemporary novel in a time when long contemporary novels have become dino-tarpit. I was taken by Franzen's prose style from the onset, and swam relatively quickly through this thick work. At its heart, The Corrections is a critique on Americana (not to be confused with anti-patriotism, but the sort of Americana that causes Americans to take an introspective look at themselves in relationship to their culture and perhaps criticize the system to which they belong). Franzen's constant crosshairs seem to be on family and the hegemonic approbation of one's life into the family paradigm. Franzen examines how children ""correct"" the faults they find in their patriarchs in themselves, and finds that those ""corrections"" are what prompt progeny to make similar mistakes. Franzen's language is humorous, smart, often sad, and often brutal; but he has a well-read scholar's tone. This is mostly beneficial to the novel, but often has that pretentious academic flair of many post-modern novels that makes most of us cringe. Still, it's not enough to hurt the book too much.It seems Franzen is a little bereft of the feminine in the novel; the two female protagonists (see particularly: Denise) have relentless masculine qualities. Denise is bi-sexual, hyper-sexual, dominant, and successful. This isn't to say a woman cannot violate the prescribed gender roles of their sex, but is somewhat indicative that Franzen ascribes masculine gender roles in his female characters out of a possible disconnect with women in general. (It should be noted that as a man, this ain't no big thang. Most men fail at this, right brothers?). In general, this is a very masculine novel. Wrought with sex, wrought with violence: it tips the scales toward testosterone.The Corrections's characters are all very strong.

I rate it so low only because it's not very pleasant to read: a social commentary in Middle English=brain fatigue. Still, it's an important text. What More suggests is reflective of our society even today: that penal punishments do not prevent crime, which in and of itself is a result of the inequity of wealth in our society, etc. More's goal seems to be to suggest a perfect socialist state but in doing so, makes the glaring mistakes that Bellamy would three centuries later. In short, Utopia eliminates free will and champions conformity, which is contrary to human nature (at least in part). I'm down with the dissipation of all money and the social equity, but how More goes about producing an example of absolute socialism obviously delivers the sardonic intonation of our common usage of ""utopia.""Interestingly, More himself seems to presume it wouldn't work, having his own literary self doubt the feasibility of that society.

Fitzgerald has the uncanny ability to be witty, observant, and uniquely descriptive at once. Following in the vein of Joyce's Portrait of an Artist (published only 4 years before) and to be followed by Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (only a few years after), Fitzgerald opines on the age-old Lost Generation problem: to be an egotistical youth interested only in making one's stamp on the world and finding that egoism problematic in a Post-war world that seems to care less and less about anyone's particular stamps (I'm finding, in my reading, this to be a decidedly masculine enterprise, especially for authors of first novels; I'll have to read some female authors of the era to get a complete view).Amory Blaine is born of wealth, loses it, and becomes a sort of socialist toward the end. Throughout are the common perturbances of youth: young ridiculous love, college days, benders, and a whole ship's hull of regret. Though Amory seems to find self-peace in is oscillating demeanor, I reckon that if there were a next chapter, he'd be somewhere near bottom again.

WhetheI began my journey with Dickens's large book in Clark Park, Philadelphia, which I hear is the only park in the world that has a Dickens statue. Whether or not this melodrama is true, I thought it fitting...because I'm melodramatic.Dickens has the wonderful ability to make you look silly, laughing out loud in public places like libraries or coffeeshops, where everyone else is trying to be serious. I found at least half the sentences of this book to be smart funny; not pretentious funny (see Salmon Rushdie, late-night political pundits, all of your professors from all time) but smart and funny. Dickens was educated and he doesn't pretend not to be.The soul of this story has to do with social class and ideas of elevations inside of one's personal situation. The titular Pip, whose name even suggests something puny or subjugated, feels his personal human worth in comparison to those around him at a higher social or economic status. When he achieves a bit of status himself, he quickly tramples upon those who'd always supported him as members of society champion his status over his person. Later, when Pip learns the dubious source of his financial winnings (and dire straits concerning them), he goes though the moral withdraw that accompanies the vacuum of want in a capitalistic society. What I think makes this book so appealing is that contemporary audiences will recognize Pip's desire to better himself as a sociological characteristic of perhaps all of us.

In his own conceptual justification of the ""ways of God to man,"" Milton elaborates where the Bible is general, and anthropomorphizes the characters of Judeo-Christian drama.I am most intrigued by the first four chapters, where the focus is Satan, who laments with his minions his first and more fierce fall. Though Milton comes close to preachy in the text, he never outright lambasts Satan. Rather, it is interesting the way Milton anthropomorphizes the fallen angels, including Satan, giving them humanesque ideas and sentimentalities. The reader develops almost a pity for them as they realize their error but find repentance too late and distant. As humans ourselves, we recognize immediately personal mistakes, egoism, and burnt bridges that we expect God or life itself to forgive us for, yet these fallen angels are without hope of forgiveness. The reader feels sorry for them. Satan is condemned to Hell for his “pride” and “worse, ambition,” while Adam and Eve, the poem's protagonists, seem nubile and foolish throughout. All of this reinforces the mysteries of biblical mythology, hardly illuminating them.The middle chapters and final two (which were not of the original poem) were drab, but worth it overall.

King is imaginative, and if you can get passed the juvenile writing, you get a pretty decent story of what home means to people, how we often leave home, and the ramifications of finding ourselves in relation to re-examining our birthplaces. Pennywise represents the fear that comes latent with admitting your home is where your heart is (King would say, ""where the heart was, which upon getting a scratch, bled buckets for infinity, and was like a Red Sox game."")But really, everyone in the book laughs too much and laughs inappropriately, when a real human being would NOT laugh. Sometimes King’s over sexualization of female characters and use of sexual description to describe innocuous things was teenage. And when you find the metaphysical/mystical characters of the text (IT and a Turtle, yeah) they talk like teenage skateboarders, like the rest of King's characters.There's a reason King is the best-selling author of all time but will never be a classic writer.

I would start with etymologies and end with sentimental pinings and anecdotes. I would drive most of you away.I was in love with the first 100 pages, where Ishmael's voice is truly his own, and where Melville's absolute wit forced me to put the book down and chuckle page upon page in succession. Mind you, these first 100 pages are before Ishmael even boards the Pequod and takes to ocean. Then, many things happen over the course of the next 400 pages that distract the reader from realizing that nothing is happening over the next 400 pages. Look, I knew, coming into this, that Moby Dick wasn't going to be a big plot story. I realized we might not ever even see the white whale (we do....with 60 pages to go!) long before picking the book up. But what happens is through most of it, Ishmael spends encyclopedic chapters numbing the reader into learned submission. He annuls the variety of whales, the color white, the processes of sailing and whale capture; etc. At times, the book reads like a graduate class in cetology rather than a novel. Many of my friends and contemporaries put the book down, or bemoan it, for this. But let's look at why Melville does it.I'm giving Herman the benefit of the doubt. After reading stories like Bartleby, we know he is purposeful in his actions. But is Melville doing the Joycean ""I'm screwing with my readers"" thing? I think, in part. Bottom line: this novel is about one man's dark obsession (referred to as monomania) and how it affects the lives of those in the periphery of that obsession. It is largely a philosophical text, told through the yarn of sea-story, examining man's place in the Universe and the ""reality"" of God. Got that? Ok. So why, then, all the pragmatic instructional videos? (ed. note: I'd like to pause and say I really did learn how to catch a whale at sea; time will tell if I'll ever need this skill). What I think Melville is doing is, by Ishmael's obsessing of the menial details of the novel, the reader gets the impression of how deeply rooted Ahab's obsession truly is. In short, we have to be almost obsessed with finishing this novel in order to finish it. Moreover, we learn that Melville, as an extension of Ishmael, must be obsessed with this novel to write such a painstaking tome (we know he intended it to be is masterpiece). He was obsessed with the novel, Ahab was obsessed with the whale, Ishmael was obsessed with telling the readers the details, the reader is obsessed with finishing the tale. The point remains the same: obsession. And the reader, unless wedded to stories tied tight with bows, is the only of the aforementioned quotients to leave the process unscathed. Even Melville himself died in obscurity over the public failure of his obsession, the book.Also, a whaleboat, despite the random excitements, must be a boring place, allowing Ishmael to ruminate on such seemingly petty additions. I think Melville cleverly insinuated the ""downtime"" of whaling by making us readers feel we were in a constant downtime while reading. One literary violation Melville commits, that I cannot wholly forgive, is that Ishmael, after those first 100 pages, loses his voice. The book starts as a first person narrative than moves to omniscient perspectives of various characters without maintaining Ishmael’s early witty voice. Melville, seemingly for lack of a better idea, just abandons Ishmael, in favor of telling the story from almost a third person perspective. This is a big no-no in my book. Ishmael’s early voice was the best part.White whales, the Holy Grail, or verbose tomes, we all have focuses; Moby Dick is the cautionary tale of how our focuses may blind our peripheral instincts....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 21, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_The_Whale

The reality is, thisFor anyone who would venture upon this novel as their first trip into Hemingway, I'd presume a rating of far less celestial body. The reality is, this posthumously published, three-part story is not Hemingway's best. In fact, the novel has some pretty uncharacteristic flaws. It is full of the very traditional Hemingway: startling one-liners, little plot with heavy emotion and warmth, intense scene recognition and spatial consideration, machismo oozing out the ears. You name it.But, for the Hemingway aficionado, this book is a keen look not into the end of a great's bibliography, but into the great himself. It is a Roman a clef, like all of his other novels, essentially. Hemingway only ever wrote about himself, which I don't think was an effort of egoism as much as it was an effort to write honestly; and how does one write completely honestly?, by writing about what one knows the best (presumably): himself.And no one loves Hemingway's plots. I mean, how could you? 500 pages to blow up one bridge? Liver psoriasis bullfight? Old man fishing? Quitting the army with a nurse? Plots are nothing to Hemingway. What we love is the coursing energy of honesty flowing directly and forcibly through the text. We breathe truth and cringe at its brutality. Joy at its beauty.Then you get Islands in the Stream: a lie.The first section, Bimini, is the best, far and away (ignore the 100 page fish fight). Here we have classic and dependable Hemingway, now typified through a painter, Thomas Hudson, while his sons visit from their jilted mothers, Hem's wake. The story is nostalgic, poignant, and laced with morosity, which, if you know anything about Hemingway the man, was also the end of his life. He lamented Hadley, his failed fathership, and a writing career that was less and less appreciated. Thomas Hudson in Bimini was this: truthfully and honestly.Then, between the end of Bimini and the beginning of Cuba, all three of his sons die, which is not true to life. Rather, it sort of sets the reader to feel more sorry for Hudson (nee Hemingway), who is now a sad alcoholic creature. He really wants us to pity him! Never before have I felt the need to pity Hemingway's amorphisms, not even while dying, or not getting Brett, or having your lady die during childbirth. Was sad, but never pitied. Hudson is pitiful.Then, out of nowhere, Hadley Hemingway comes along. Now, we all know that Hadley remarried after Hem and happily lived out the rest of her days. We also know that she was a homely, not flashy sorta gal (read A Paris Wife for a good depiction). In this novel, she makes an appearance in Havana and is a ... wait for it ... movie starlet!?, who can't resist Hudson and makes love to him while blaming HERSELF for the dissolution of their marriage (a plot problem because earlier Hudson claimed he left her). I mean, the audacity of Hemingway to make Hadley into a sluttish starlet to vindicate his own evils.So of course, in good conscience, he kills Hudson.Very flawed and very dishonest. It gets four from me because I loved how much it showed me about Hemingway's personal instability at the end of his life.

Austen seems to stab into the tragic class system and superiority complexes of the gentry, but ultimately vindicates them (Emma, of course, marrying the most gentlemanly gentleman of all gentlemen, with the richest estate and highest propriety, ad barfeam.)One interesting thing that Austen does in her writing is she has the readers know what the plot twists well be before her characters know. Never was I nearly as surprised as her characters.

What Roth then does is show a contrast in these two phenomena through the situations Cantor finds himself in. As a phys ed teacher and playground superintendent, his duty and responsibility elevate him to the social archetype of heroic shepherd of children. Later, as a polio sufferer and potential Outbreak Monkey to the children that were his charge, his duty and responsibility result in self-chastisement. Cantor blames God in the obligatory way that those of religious backgrounds make sense of the unpredictable cruelty of the Universe. He is a tragic character that was once a hero, fallen not because of dubious act, but because he could not himself reconcile the happenstance that every man is victim to with his own destiny.Roth is often a bit redundant and the narration of the book was very strange and at first bothered me: a child from Cantor's playground gang who remained removed from the story until the very end, delivering an Ayn Rand-esque final soliloquy on the moral of the story.

What I found in my study was more a literary rhetoric on emancipation that mirrored some of the famous abolitionist publications in the American Literary tradition: see Phyllis Wheatley and Frederick Douglass.Stowe made no suggestion that her novel was anything outside of a propaganda piece against slavery, and its wide popularity shows that the American public was (at least at that time) open to perspectives illuminated by literature.I do understand more modern ideas of antagonism to the novel: black stereotypes, etc; but I harken back to Stowe's intention and the change of ideology that this novel inspired. Like all abolitionist literature, the goal was to humanize the African slave so that moral and religious people could not justify the insidious nature of slavery. Thomas Jefferson, in his ""Notes of the State of Virginia"" goes as far as to conclude that the African race is biologically different than whites and resemble characteristics of an ""Oranootan [Orangutan]."" To counter these animalistic comparisons, abolitionists published the likes of Wheatley and Douglass to show the African races ability for intellectualism and to produce poetry, leading people to thusly conclude that they were in fact human, and ready for equal rights.Stowe's novel is of the same vein. Written just before the Civil War, she smartly chooses to present Christian values (of great rhetorical use in the mid-19th century) and motherly affection for children to garner just the same empathy as the other abolitionist writers. Although there may be a lot to criticize the novel with, and although it certainly follows an expected structure of rhetoric, I respect the book greatly as a prime example of responsible literature's value to society and the sympathies of mankind, who absorbs it in its relative sensibilities....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 22, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46787.Uncle_Tom_s_Cabin

It’s fiction, as much as the book jacket says it is, but she uses not just Papa’s works, but those of Pound, Fitzgerald, Stein, and others to illuminate the situations her protagonist, Hadley, is perceiving. For those who’ve read the histories and fictions of these people, most scenes and scenarios will be recycled for you. But one of the best qualities of the work is that all the stories (particularly A Moveable Feast) are retold through Hadley’s eyes, which presents us with emotion and personhood that Hemingway’s bravado is so often devoid of. We emote with Hemingway because of the situations he puts us in. We emote with Hadley because she makes us see her tragedy. We live it with her. And knowing what we do about Hemingway: that he regretted his disintegration with Hadley and ultimately killed himself due to this, among other unfulfillments and mental illnesses; helps us believe her story, even if it is fictitious.Basically, the book is beautiful. It belongs with all of the other stories and biographies of the Lost. There’s such playfulness, luminescence into these lives, and longing to understand greatness as it touches the fringes of normalcy. Ultimately, though, I view it as a cautionary tale: Hemingway chose his work and impulses over Hadley, but those in the know would bet it all that he would have traded it to go back and not make his mistakes, greatness be damned.

They deliberated, by reading and assessing all of the novels nominated for the prize that year (and offering outsiders), and overruled the Roth novel originally picked with Henderson the Rain King (as if Bellow needed any more National Book Awards, Pulitzers, or Nobels). Now, I haven't read the Roth book, so I cannot engage in the discourse, though I think the panel was more about how taste and perception of (literary) art ages as do the books themselves.I can, however, assess this novel. Expanding from the very common Zeitgeist of Americana concerning fear of death with the directionlessness of life, Bellow casts his protagonist into savage and bizarre Africa, to find...ready for it...meaning.As hokey as that all sounds, Bellow makes a sort of satire out of the whole thing. The protagoinst is very flawed, but knows it, and his bumbles through Africa, often from viewing Africans as messianic pets in a zoo, create a cartoonish effect. Case in point, note how many metaphors Henderson offers for his own face. The entire plot is somewhat slapstick, but makes us invest in Henderson and his folly.Despite this caricature of travel and life-experience, Bellow touches on such subtle and wonderful oddities of the human spirit: imagination, the acceptance/rejection of reality, desire, and fulfillment. We don't ever grab Henderson by the collar and shout, ""By George, you've got it,"" but we respect his search, as maniachal and egocentric as it is.

I appreciate the mystical literary happenstance as I am sure both aforementioned authors would as well.Reading Lolita in Tehran is a multi-tiered book. On one level, it is a novel about women's rights in a place where those words are equivalent to sin and breaking the law. Secondly, it is an academic text, with analyses of popular Western literature that come from someone intensely passionate about the works. And finally, it is one woman's--one teacher's--memoir about subjugation, violence, and the horror of a totalitarian regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran.What I appreciated most about this book was how much I learned about Iranian culture and the evolution of what we now consider modern-day Iran. This part of the world is very foreign from the West, particularly Americans, and Nafisi does a wonderful job making it accessible. I began, while reading, to understand yet again how these folks, some of whom consider Americans to be brutal enemies, have more in common with Americans than they'd perhaps like to admit.Nafisi, though at times masculigist (I made this up!!!!) and often pessimistic about love, exhibits a tenderness for her students that any teacher can respect and wish to emulate.

In my view, the best parts were West's discourses on individuality and the self, when tampered with by striking one's own environment. What becomes of a person when we distort the context of the person?As most know, this is less a novel and more philosophical rhetoric on socialism. If we understand this, then we can forgive the poor narrative devices in favor of the propaganda. Still, the middle section of the book is largely pages upon pages of esoteric talk that makes you wish you read faster. As to Bellamy's Socialism itself, let me be the first to say that I am humanly in love with ideas of social equity, proper education systems, and the dissolution of class warfare and poverity, but Bellamy's utopia is just that, a utopia. And based on human experience, we know that utopias are fictions. What's more, the deeper you get into the text, the more you begin to see Bellamy's (nee socialism's) ignorance concerning Darwinism (if you so believe that), independence, constitutional US rights, and basic human morality. To boot, within are laced old fashioned ideas of homophobia, sexism, and religious intolerance. The individual is completely sacraficed to the system in a way more frightening than in 1984 and Bellamy goes as far as to suggest that there is no jealousy or crime any longer because of social parity (!!!). It's strange to me that he would suggest human nature is a result of the system. In my view, as it was built by humans, the system would be better described as a result of human nature. Case in point, Bellamy asserts through his characters that it was ""natural"" that man would ""evolve"" into the modern system of socialism by the year 2000 because that was their natural inclination. Update: it's 2011, and he was wrong. Not very natural after all.He's also very critical of other ages. I have an intolerance for intolerance.

(Though seriously, the word ""sad"" appeared in this novel double the times the word ""fuck"" was in Pulp Fiction, or even perhaps all of Tar's films). The writing is constantly fluid, a departure from what I remember about Jack's most famous Duluoz legacy books, which are more disjointed and stream of consciousness. The events are still a Roman a Clef, with much from Kerouac's real life following Peter Martin very closely. I gathered, however, that many of the characters' personalities were alive in Kerouac. Joe: the mechanic romantic road warrior. Francis: the aloof intellectual; Martin: the sprite serious youngster; Liz: the jazz singing vagabond; etc. Kerouac seems to shatter his personality and delegate the pieces to his people.The novel is, not surprisingly, separated into two main chunks. The town. and the City. The town is Galloway, based directly on Kerouac's own home milltown of Lowell. This section of the book is by far the longest (3/5s) and has the most tender, beautiful and truly American portions. The lower-class bucolic country family, the detailed football games, the horse-betting, the Christmas mornings, the small-town bar hopping. I loved this section of the book because it was one of the first times I saw true American ideology shine through so perfectly in literature.The second substantially smaller section of the book is the city. NYC. Here, everything is compact, chaotic, poetic, and insane. This obviously shows Kerouac's feelings on the matter: i.e. The Town VS the City. I know Kerouac loved the metropolis, but the chaos of the city sections shows his despair that comes from being swallowed by it. Still, this section is written very much like a long poem and is an obvious precursor for On the Road, which comes next. The end of this book finds Peter about to hit the road, in much the same fashion that Jack himself was about to do. Seven years later, he would pen what would be the Bible of the Beats. I think an astute reader should back up one chapter in Jack's life and see how it all began.A sad but honest and beautiful big book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Oct 06, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/154392.The_Town_and_the_City

Barf.Rushdie's prose is very intelligent; actually, it's academically pretentious throughout, which is challenging to read and disengaging but in all honesty, fun to encounter. It's just that the academic tone really pulls the reader well out of caring for the characters and situations. The first chapter is extremely clever and overtly academic. After this, the novel subtly touches on the life of its protagonist, making him completely inapproachable to readers.I was also turned off by the dialogue. Every single character, regardless of cultural background, education, or class, speaks with the exact same unbelieveably pretentious discourse, which is, obviously, Rushdie's own voice. In short, it prevented me from giving a lickity split about any of these fools.Also, America. I get it: you're criticising American culture. And although there are some poignant responses to the more repulsive aspects of Americana (trust me, many of us Americans feel a great distaste for much of our [pop] culture) there is a overreaction and disorganization of the true concept of the country. It almost seems like Rushdie is basing his claims on prejudicial sterotypical complaints against America rather than concrete empiracal evidence. I would expect an educated and cultured writer to know better.There are some interesting plot developments, but they are generally unbelievable, outside the scope of the reasons for the story, and tend to go nowhere.

Devil in the White City was a spectacular example of this; In the Garden of Beasts is not.Capitalizing off of the concept of telling parallel stories in the same setting as he did in DWC, Larson attempts the same trick in IGOB by telling the historic tale of Dodd as ambassador and the more literary romantic story of Martha (his daughter) as a Berlin harlot with possible KGB ties. What bothered me even more was the premonitory tone of impending doom that Larson laces into each section and chapter. I understand the tone he was trying to set: the Nazi usurping of Germany and impending war, but the foreshadowing he illustrates ends up being constantly redundant and histrionic. For example: (paraphrase) Dodd was usually such a great driver, it would be very ironic WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY HAPPEN TO HIM!!!!!! This makes you believe he would eventually die in a Nazi organized car crash or something. No, twenty years later, back in the US, he hits a kid with his car.Another: (paraphrase) Martha loved Germany but on this trip she would SUDDENLY EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT WOULD FOREVER CHANGE HER INNOCUOUS VIEW OF THE COUNTRY AS THE TERRIBLE EVENTS SEWED THEMSELVES INTO HER VIRGINAL FLESH. Making you think that gestapo goons rape her and kill her lover or something only to find out she witnessed a Nazi beating.I'm not minimalizing the latter events; all I'm saying is that Larson really over-employs the technique of cliffhangerism.And the ending thumps down like an old boot.The only positive is that Larson effectively establishes what many contemporary Americans cannot fathom: how Germany, Europe, and the world allowed Hitler, the Holocaust, and WWII to happen.

The copy I have was bought at a bookstore in Stratford upon Avon, where I visited as a student studying in London a great many years ago, and a certain nostalgia packed with literary posterity thusly exists in the empirical book itself; however, I couldn't get over the fact that the book was very dull in comparison to his other great successes. I felt as if the tone was bland and displaced, and that the blossoming love between Frederick and Catherine was very contrived and unrealistic. (I think I vomited at least once).Then, of course, I read the second half, which is far better than the first. It makes me wonder if Hemingway didn't take a lesson from The Sun Also Rises and neglect to cut out the first half of a novel to make its superior posterior shine through. And yes yes, I know, his blasé, absentee writing style reflects the narrator's tone as a person distanced from life through war; I get it.

Still, the book reads like a lecture, and a bad one at that.

Russian literature, even adeptly translated into English, violates (minus the pejorative) the norms we Westerners value in literature, which often automatically subverts a genuine interest, appreciation, and understanding of the works, often rendering arbitrary three-star s in virtual biblio-blogispheres.Let me cite for example:-There is no central character through which we can see development, struggle, give allegiance, etc., which is so common to Western Lit.-All characters have extreme (sometimes caricature) sensibilities, often crying unconventionally or hypo-masculinely (approve or not, it is unrealistic in Western culture) and often offer despicable characteristics, leading readers to wholesale dislike everyone in the book at least once.-The narrative is not linear but rather interwoven with a variety of time periods, perspectives, and intellectual philosophizing.-The author randomly (and increasingly as the novel continues) breaks from narrative to offer pragmatic and expository explanation for penning the tome.-Et Cetera.The novel, as any 1400 page book, is taxing to read, and is provoking an eye exam next week; but despite its exhausting nature, it does one thing very well: present historic events. As Hemingway illuminates the Spanish Civil War, so too does Tolstoy illuminate the War of 1812. Tolstoy himself grants that his mission with the novel is to examine history through the scope of more microcosmic matters (i.e. viewing its effects on the individual) and to quarrel with popular representation of history by historians (man does he seem to hate them).An enormous drawback to the novel is that it seems infinite. There are many very unnecessary scenes that seem to pad the narrative for little reason and the reader is constantly tempted to put the project down.Conversely, it succeeds in its philosophical titular paradox: the book is literally about ""war"" and ""peace"" in its depiction of such times in Russia, but it is also about the adjacent wars and peaces in the lives of each man, as they go on living, those internal struggles that propagate our actions (Tolstoy does not go as far as advocate destiny, but argues against free will).In all, it's a worthy book to read, but any sprite daredevils venturing into its world must do so with ribald stubbornness and patience, as it's a doozy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/656.War_and_Peace

It's easy to get over the more pretentious passages. At times, Gardner is so egotistical that it makes the reader laugh, which can't be a bad thing, right?

He claims that the book is for beginning writers though some of his thoughts and analyses are grad level. Moreover, I don't know how much this book would help a new writer who wasn't taking a class to supplement it. The book gets weaker and weaker as it goes on (the first two chapters are the best) and Gardner never really gives a pragmatic approach to writing. Also, he only mentions fourish authors in some favorable way, suggesting (of course, erroneously) that he's only read these four writers.I like his style and his abruptness (however academic), and he certainly knows his stuff.

A Moveable Feast is just that, but it falls very short of the beauty that is typically Hemingway.I think it may have to do with its posthumousness. I know that Hemingway wrote The Sun Also Rises in a short amount of time then spent many moons revising it. There is a potential here that the book was finished and that Hem iced himself prior to revising the manuscript. In the end, the narrative is exciting to read, for a Hemingway fan, but it in no way has the beautiful prose normally ascribed to Hem's work.I hate to say it, but throughout the first half of the book, I found his Parisian life drab and boring. The narrative really caught stride when we found Hemingway and Fitzgerald together; we got to see Hemingway's perspective on Fitzgerald (and mind you, this novel was written long after Fitzgerald's death, so Hemingway's opinions of him overall are expressed in this young part of their relationship) and Zelda, F.

Perhaps they are finally operating under the concept of their namesake: random.Not that I think all scholars and biographers need to be professors or writers themselves, but seriously, Slawenski operates a corny looking fansite called DeadCaulfields (of all things) and doesn't have any other noteworthy criteria met to suggest he is the authority on the subject.The writing makes me feel like I am in a History class with an octogenarian professor lecturing through cotton balls. It's dry and painfully tedious. I did learn a bit about Salinger, who is certainly one of my favorite authors. What I garnered most from this book was Salinger's publication history and the plot summaries (analyses, blah) of unpublished works.What bothers me are the long winded presumptuous passages; for instance, we don't have a lot of information that describes Salinger's role in WWII, so Slawenski goes into a hefty diatribe with evidence from neighboring sources that ""may"" have been close to Salinger in battles to suggest what the writer himself was going through. Slawenski takes so many liberties with describing Salinger's place in the war that I forgot I was reading a bio of an author rather than a war account.Aside from that, while Slawenski does provide some insights into analyzing Salinger's literature, I can't align myself with a lot of what Slawenski suggests. There are some points of his analyses where I thought he was so off, that I stopped reading to complain about it to random local coffeeshop denizens who had the misfortune of sitting near me.Poor J.D., even one of his most obsessive fans can't respect his anonymity.

There's really a simple sweetness to the work, despite Buddy's attempt to be overly academic in his ponderings. Buddy (nee Salinger) attempts to present Seymour in perhaps an analytical objective way, but the reader is immediately immersed in the abject affection Buddy has for Seymour, wrought from incessant asides that ruminate on small anecdotal snippets from their years together. The book is touching, a display of familial love retarded by--not so glancingly--war, death, and the inability for genius to survive in its own time.Well, it's done.

Clare's ""passing"" off as a white woman and what it means in her infidelity to her native culture is distinctly vilified by Larson, who punishes the character with death. Conversely, Irene, who is truly the protagonist, as our gaze is wholly upon her, acts out of a defense of her race, mostly, but shows the insidious side of human vengeance when posed against moral ethics.The only thing that got to me was the setting of the story. Though African American, Irene leads a very affluent lifestyle, and behaves in the Southern Gothic tradition of pampered aristocracy, which is unsettling, considering her symbol of African American righteousness in defending the value of fidelity in one's own race. In short, Irene is not the best population sample of the African American plight. Still, I think Larson was very brave and direct with this simple tale of two women, who felt the walls of racial pressure gently brushing their arms as those walls slowly moved in to crush them....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 14, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/349929.Passing

The pen marks are my own, from when I first tried to read the novel, back in college. Mysteriously, the pen marks stop around page 200, where I seem to have put the book down. Even more mysteriously, I hadn't remembered a single part of the novel when I picked it up recently for a second try.I am not sure why I don't remember The Sound and the Fury from my first read. Perhaps I wasn't ready for it; I truly believe that we mature into books, the way our taste buds mature into bitter foods. Perhaps this is why I was more open to it the second read than I was the first. Or maybe it's because I read and understood Joyce's Ulysses, which makes every other complex narrative seem coloring-book-simplistic.Whichever the case may be, I can say, with some pride, that I've ever only put down two books that I had started in my entire life. Perhaps this is just a suggestion of my fidelity, or a simple case of stubbornness. The first, Heller's Catch 22, was because nothing changed for hundreds of pages, and the gist was got. Really got. Heller, short story. Please.The other, was this. The Sound and the Fury. Upon opening the book again and seeing the collegiate scribbles of my former self, I was immediately returned to the Mississippian South, where Faulker's family (The Compsons) live their dysfunctional lives in the symbolic ""the south has seemed to fall again"" fashion. After putting the book down in frustration as a rosy cheeked freshman, this time I read the book in under a week. I feel manipulated. That's the only way I can describe it. Faulkner makes his readers feel what he wants them to feel and leads them where he wants them to go. Just as soon as I think I've misunderstood something (the androgynous double naming of Quentin: is it a guy or a girl? Oh. Both.) Faulkner lets me realize that he intended to distract me before letting me know I was in fact, on track. It’s a weird world, to be in Faulkner’s, where first person narratives of persons with mental retardation and the poetic stream of consciousness of depressed quasi-incestial Harvardites aim to distress the reader just as much as they aim to impress them. I always thought that I was missing something, only to find out that he purposely withheld that something until he was ready, while always leaving subtle hints all the way.I felt like the idiot who watches The Sixth Sense a second time and can’t believe he didn’t see it coming.In the end, the reader gets four sections, each distinct, and each incredible in its own way. We are confused by Benji, our first narrator, whose mental retardation plays with time like the old Quantum Leap show (yep). We fall in love with Quentin, whose narrative (June second 1910) is one of the most beautiful pieces of writing I’ve ever read, subtle and tragic and gentle. We hate the odious Jason, a bigot with a cold heart and migraines. And we recognize the class divide and implications of such with Dilsey, the family’s servant. I can’t say this book is for everyone, but it’s certainly for me.

I am not sure of the history concerning the construction**spoiler alert** This novel was published serially (seriously), and it almost reads like it. I am not sure of the history concerning the construction of the book, but it almost seems as if Wilde was gauging the public's opinion of his work while constructing the succeeding chapters. I cite, as example of this, how his characters, particularly the titular protagonist, develop such outstanding (not used as a complementary adjective) changes of personhood as to be rendered unbelievable. Gray goes from being a charming and handsome youth to a murderous and odious madman, whose decisions, one after another, make the reader dislike him more and more. Regardless of Wilde's unbelievable character changes, the novel does find a refined word-craftman's-ship, namely in the quips and often misogynistic epithets (""What are women?""; ""Sphinxes without riddles."") of Lord Henry, who I daresay has the cheeky sort of tongue play that Wilde himself had. Oh Oscar, could you not resist spitting your own words into your character's mouth? I jest, what author could?At length, in this rather obvious morality tale, there are a number of social criticisms to be offered, including, but not extensively: social class and the ridicule of the higher ranks of society who believe other classes to be subhuman; male/female relationships, which Wilde categorizes as fickle and capricious (I wonder why); and the mistake of envying youth, which, at one point or another, we all make.The latter, the central conflict of the story, is the most poignant. Wilde suggests that we are ignorant to be nostalgic about youth. After all, we often look upon our younger selves with disdain, wondering how we could fall for our past follies, while ignoring our present missteps. I think, rather, the message is that what we miss isn't our youth, but our lost energy, the way youth seem to have so much less responsibility than the old, but seem to squander it in ignorance. Of course, we fail to see that while we are musing over our gone youth, our older selves gaze back from the future and beg us to muse no longer, but to live.But what the Hell do I know?

Rest assuredI have to give credit to Dick for insight and set precedent for myself for the lack-of-fondness I maintain for the science fiction genre. Rest assured, my low scoring is a reflection of the latter.What I really like about the book is that there is a specific moral quandary with the story. Are androids alive? Is it wrong to kill them and see them as inhuman?Dick poses these questions really well by comparing android prejudice to that of the colonial American slavery of Africans. Moreover, Dick's protagonist wrestles with the conundrum of killing beings he develops feelings for. The major disparity between humans and robots is the former's ability to feel empathy, measured in a ersatz religion dubbed Mercerism. Robots are not empathetic creatures, and it is thereby assumed that they do not maintain valuable life. This is brilliantly contrasted by Dick's show of human characters who are not very empathetic at all: ""specials"" or ""chickenheads"" who have low IQs and aren't seen as members of society; a protagonist who cheats on his wife with a Robo-babe (whose small breasts are referenced far too much; I get it Dick, you like em tiny), and values animals so much that he pretends to own one.Why I don't particularly like the book lies in the story-telling. Like many Sci-fi writers, the focus is on the ingenuity of the inventions and philosophies innate in the potential future, rather than basic plot movement and beautiful wordplay. For instance, in one scene, two characters face each other in mortal combat. One character flees into a back room. The other shoots him (?) and he dies. I'm no creative writing teacher (ha) but you can't shoot someone in another room. Dick violates a lot of the spatial constructs of narrative, and this is emphasized in the very quick, very unexciting, and very anti-climactic actions scenes.

Despite the fact that most general readers (who I like to call, beach readers) like their stories wrapped up in a kind and comforting bow, Atwood traditionally institutes ambiguity, which forces her readers to interpret literature for themselves. This is lost in a lot of modern/contemporary literature. Unfortunately, there is not ambiguity in this novel. And, dare I say, she almost ruins the ambiguity of Oryx and Crake.She attempts to tell the same story as the ""prequel"" novel through the perspective of the cultish vegan group the God's Gardeners as they prepare for Crake's Armageddon. While reading, however, I never cared for the characters nearly as much as I did say Jimmy, or the Snowman. The book is long and long winded and is bisected by BAD lyrical poems that really could have been skipped. When the characters of the first book are reintroduced, the reader gets a wholly new perspective on them, and not a perspective we want. Rather, the information provided is too much and hurts the mystique that the previous novel developed. Moreover, you get the sense that the “clever” relating of the two books is wholly forced.Her criticisms in the book are great: FEMA's reaction to NOLA makes a snide appearance, genetics, veganism, cultish religions, gender roles, etc. In all, however, the story is one you really just can't wait to finish, and not because you want to find out how it turns out.The worst part, is that there will probably be a third. But if history serves us, she's usually hit or miss; so perhaps after a miss, she'll hit.I suppose my signed copy will sit on my shelf for awhile....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"May 04, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6080337-the-year-of-the-flood

Still, despite me aprobation, I read the entire thing in a few days, which says something. Barker is a master of narrative, bringing his reader along for the ride. I'm no prude, but I can go without the grotesque sex of the story and for God's sake, dialogue needs to be unique. Why does every character sound the same?

Having noted already that as the palate of age matures, the enjoyment of things past lessens, I wanted the familiar nostalgia of a book from my shelf that had my old, perhaps slightly smaller, fingerprints.The first of an incomplete trilogy, The Great and Secret Show is a novel of fantasy, horror, and sex. I must say that part of me was pleasantly surprised when rereading this book, to the extent that Barker does have a great command of language, imagination, and descriptive prowess. Following in the vein of much of his work, Barker creates new worlds, new creatures, and a mythology that is as confusing as it is intriguing. Unlike a lot of modern day mystery genres (LOST immediately comes to mind) where writers and producers have a certain grasp of the overall story, it seems here that Barker allows his imagination to run in a sort of stream of consciousness way, not really knowing where the stream's flowing. I know I know, Barker fans don't jump down my throat; I know he meticulously outlines his novels and has infinite folders of notes for such, but this book really doesn't seem to know the answers to it's own questions. I don't find this to be a particularly deal-breaking problem, but I hastily suggest to anyone who doesn't want to be frustrated with covert plots, be warned.What works is the interesting plot, the beginning, and the end.What doesn't work is about 400 pages in the middle. Barker is a great example of what modern day editors invest in red pens for. There are so many unnecessary characters and scenes in the book that would work well to be omitted. Moreover, the characters all seem redundant, each speaking with the same dialogue inflections and are generally indistinct.Still, I'm nothing if not nostalgic, so Barker's world, adopted the second time, was just as thrilling as the first....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Feb 06, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32628.The_Great_and_Secret_Show

What makes this novel so remarkable, besides its wit and beauty, and its social commentary, is that Chopin stood up for something far before it was the status quo to do so. This novel, after many publishers refused to endorse it, ended up stirring serious criticism from intellectuals and the literati at the turn of the century. Her villainess status lasted until her death, and so she never knew that her novel would be the spur that led women to social independence.My only complaint as a contemporary feminist is that the action that awakens our protagonist is her falling in love with a man other than her husband; I would argue that to align with modern feminism, a woman would not need a man at all to ""wake up"" to her own concept of independence. Although, I swiftly mention that choosing who one loves is a statement of independence in itself.

Although at times the plot takes very melodramatic turns that spiral into tense horizons, Moore's focus on tangential narratives and brilliant similes work wonders for the reader. She is a natural at wordplay. A sated satirist, I think she would say herself. Dry, humorous, witty, and bucolic. She does a tremendous job mixing sadness and comedy, which has been a benchmark for her literature for years. The titular metaphor of the Gate at the Stairs shows up endlessly through the narrative, often showing the separation of things: races, adults from children, lovers from lovers, life from non-life (not death), etc. Ultimately, Moore crafts a very poetic and pretty novel about some very not-pretty things, and guides the reader through complication to get to a point of crystal clarity....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Dec 13, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6076387-a-gate-at-the-stairs

(Wisest is the mind that can be changed).It is my stance, even after reading these genius books, that I do not like magic, fantasy, or children's literature. I do not care for books written for children, nor do I like simplistic infantile reading. Perhaps I'm too closly removed from the groggy-morning college classrooms that taught me to pretentiously value complex works of suffering and coy comedy, or perhaps I'm at the age where I need to seriously attempt the seriousness of adulthood so much so that I pillow-suffocate the small boy on his primary color dinosaur bedspread that I once was. Regardless of the reason, while half the world was reveling in Harry Potter mania, I turned an elevated nose.But I was wrong.At least I can admit that, right?The Harry Potter series is perhaps one of the most significant additions to literature since its cohort in the fantasy epic, Lord of the Rings. What Rowling has done with this series is create a world that is so vivid and approachable, with characters that are so simple to connect with, in an active plot that is so narcotically gripping, that readers desire it like a car-crash morphine IV drip. The writing is intense, precise, and intoxicating so much so that finishing the story is like sending a child off to college, where you know they are still yours but they will never be the same (groggily learning the pillow suffocating techniques of suffering and coy comedic literature). At first using a basic mystery novel approach to cyclic story-telling, wherein all problems are resolved by the end and turns dictate the surprise and shocking endings, the series quickly becomes very dark, often utilizing death and evil to force the protagonists into tribulations worthy of the adult world. Never scant on philosophizing, Rowling uses characters to initiate discourse on key contests in life: the concept of death, friendship, fear, and love. Although geared toward a youthful audience, the Potter series becomes very relavant to older readers as the characters encounter problems not foreign to our muggle adults.This series is intelligent, well-written, and I believe a functioning part of the literary canon.

What differs about this book in comparison to the others of the Duluoz Legend is its approach to Eastern Philosphy, specifically Buddhism. Keraouc uses Buddhist thought to convey both his enjoyment and lamentation of the world, polar properties of his emphatic appreciation for life and his ceaseless love of ""the red port,"" which accelerated his tailspin and early death. There is also a lot of talk of hiking in the book and Kerouac gives a fair description of taking to the wilderness, not simply giving the animalistic transcendental joy of connecting with nature, but also providing the realistic pain endured (or sometimes not) in partaking in such a physical challenge.

I'm a big fan of Emersonian and Whitman(ian?) transcendentalism, and I figured Thoreau would be of the same ilk, having attempted to put Emerson's Self-Reliance rhetoric into practice.

For example, Thoreau was a vegetarian who admited to eating meat and fish but claimed that anyone who would do so is poisoning themselves and not wise. Moreover, he claimed things like senses dull our human experience, claiming that all food should be bland and that those who drink coffee and wine are foolish. I understand people making personal life choices, but that does not mean someone else's choices make them foolish or weak. Thoreau is harsh in his treatment of others, concluding in a very inflamatory comment, claiming ""how you and I, can live thsi slimy beastly life, eating and drinking."" Wow.Moreover, Thoreau goes into vivid detail about the nobility of his outdoor lifestyle, loves it so much, yet lives there a total of 2 whole years. Then he goes back to the city and society.

Hemingway writes in a way that makes other writers envious in that his story is so simple and strong yet human, complex, and fragile. Centered around a very small mission in a war most Americans (myself included) know/knew nothing about, FWTBT is really about the intracacy of relationships as they morph over stressful situation and regular life happenstance. What really sets Hemingway apart is that his writing is provokatively honest and insightful. At times, his reader has that persistent pit in their stomach in regard to the graphic nature of the material, and at other times, feels the red-wine-warmth of a truism that only he can articulate.

The fact remains, Twain was perhaps one of America's premiere writers.In The Mysterious Stranger, traditional readers of Twain will get a nuanced view of the Mississippian-river-style writer. Where we may be more familier with Twain's depiction and dialect of the south and the adventuous nature of young boys, TMS is a metaphysical exploration of the purpose of humanity.It was almost a shock to witness Twain's extensive and eclectic vocabulary, being that his normal colloquial vocabulary of the south is so ""dumbed"" down. Here, in TMS, he is uniquely eloquent and picturesque. The story itself, really just a 100-page mini novella, attempts to comprehend the nature of mankind, something it seems Twain may have been struggling with. He goes to some length describing how outright horrible mankind has been in its historic decisions.Toward the end, I was getting a little leery as to whether or not this was Twain's final point because I did not consider him to be so cynical. And from a humanist perspective, absolute cynicism about the nature of mankind is shortsighted, and undeveloped. Thankfully, Twain pulls back from this, and at the very end, gives a highly philosophical and (dare I say) Eastern (Hindu) concept of the ""purpose"" of mankind. And although Twain presents this a little melancholically, I took great relief in his assessments.Good and worthwhile read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Oct 13, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/102564.The_Mysterious_Stranger

He writes in a style that would make most classic literature afficianados (sp?) cringe. And his one liners are almost always philsophically poignant.
