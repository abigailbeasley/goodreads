So when I landed at my layover in Vegas I bought this book to get me through the rest of the flight to Florida.Never heard of Foley or this book. I don't typically read whodunnits. However, compared to the book that I had to stop reading because the writing was so bad - this was okay.It was a super quick and easy read. The premise was interesting. However, the end got a little silly with twists that just seemed unrealistic. And I noticed a discrepancy in something the main character, ""Jess"" was doing that didn't make sense in the ending scene. So the story lost some credibility for me based on that, and other ""reveals"" at the end - that I can't reveal here! All a bit convoluted and ridiculous at the end.I suppose if this is your genre - or if you're a fan of Ms. Foley, you'd enjoy it.

First, I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know much about Sylvia Plath. I guess I shouldn't be embarrassed because this WAS her ONLY novel. Apparently she's better known for her poems and I'm eager to read them now. For some reason I had Plath lumped with that Gertrude Stein group! And I thought she was English! I knew she had killed herself, but I thought she was older. Didn't realize she was 29 while writing the novel, and was dead by 30. So I did a bit of research before I started.Then once I started reading Bell Jar, it was obvious that Plath was from that group of writers - born in the 1930s, coming of age in the conformist, conservative 1950s. J.D. Salinger was older, but Plath's tone fits in with Catcher in the Rye for sure. Ken Kesey's Cuckoo's Nest comes to mind as well.I'm struggling to  this - so I'm going to fall back on the old pro/con list method. PROs: The writing was strong. Excellent metaphors and similes. One liners that could blow your socks off. You could tell Plath was a poet at heart. Also, it was short and easy to read. Very quick read. Another thing I liked is that it oozed that whole late 50's, early 60's feeling. Plath's language was contemporary and cool and modern for the time. CONs: The book was published in January of 1963 in England. Plath killed herself in February of 1963 in her apartment with her two young kids (she taped their bedroom door and put towels up to block the gas from the oven, but still!) So I couldn't help thinking of her writing this while she must have been in a depressed or bipolar state. Also, it's labeled a work of fiction. It's not. And her husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother were so aware of that that they wouldn't publish it in the states until 1971. Why does this matter? Because as a work of fiction, it falls flat. Little character development, no real climax, problem/solution, settings were a little weak, etc. However, as a memoir it was an excellent depiction of how people who suffer from depression really feel. On top of that, given the time period where even wearing a ""different"" color or not having the right landscaping could brand you as a lunatic, Plath captured that constrictive nature of the time. So perhaps I need to put that in the PRO section! There were times that I felt like I was reading something too personal and it made me uncomfortable. Is that a PRO or CON? I hope this book is not in high schools. The suicidal ideation is just too much. Page after page. Well, at least when she returns from New York. In fact, that abrupt shift sort of threw me, too. I rather liked the first part and just labelled it: Normal 1950s Teenage Angst. But then it took a pretty dark turn. So...DON'T read it if you suffer from depression. DO read it if you know someone who suffers from depression and you want more insight. ...more",Notes are private!,4,4,2,"Aug 20, 2023not set","Aug 27, 2023not set","Aug 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/395040.The_Bell_Jar

I guess since then, Ms. Weir has become quite the expert on English monarchies. What I liked about the book was obviously, learning more about Elizabeth I. I visited England in the 1980's and learned a lot about Elizabeth's father - even visited Hampton Court. This book cleared up several historical questions I had had through the years. Especially with regard to Mary Queen of Scots.What I did not like is that I felt very repetitive - particularly in the first 150 pages. It just kept going over and over again about Elizabeth not being married, needing to marry, and different permutations of that idea. I felt it got old, and it made me wonder if Weir became too single-focused on that rather than other government issues that were taking place at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. OR was it not Weir's fault? Perhaps she couldn't find as much information about the early years? However, this finally started to get better and other topics were addressed. So that's probably why I ended up with the higher rating. I also felt like in certain parts Weir sort of assumed that her readers were English - or let's say already had a strong background in English history. I guess that's okay. I'm sure American authors do that with our own historical books. But I had to do a lot of research on my own to get up to speed.This is one of those ""not for everyone"" reads.

I've just been reading some s - good and bad. I don't want to be all over the place like Friedan was in this self-indulgent, 500 page manifesto - so I'll lay it out positives/negatives.PROS: So great that this book brought attention to the issues of women! I'm also glad it led Friedan to create N.O.W. Some of the negative s said it was too dated. Yes, it's a nonfiction piece from 1963, it's going to be dated, people. That's not my gripe at all. I liked reading it in ""real-time"" for her writing it and realizing how discriminatory it still was for women at that time on almost every level. I'm watching the fiction series ""Mrs. Maisel"" on Amazon right now and it's the same period and the producers are doing a great job portraying what a ""man's world"" it really was. In fact, the first 200 pages held my interest. Friedan created chapters that were more like mini-essays and I particularly liked the one chapter where she stopped talking about her own opinions, and shared some history of the women's movement with pioneers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, etc.CONS: Oh my, my. Where do I start? I guess first on how we define ""science"". I have scientists in my family: a geologist, dentist, and ecologist. Then there's the ""social sciences"". Can we all admit those are a little loosey-goosey? To top it off, then we have Ms. Friedan. Got her Bachelor's in psychology. That's it. Wrote articles for women's magazines. Said she wanted her PhD, but a ""boyfriend made me quit"". Um, okay. One would be hard-pressed to find one shred of real evidence or facts to back up all of her theories. However, I'm not even necessarily coming down on her for this - except she presented everything as if she had made some huge, factual, scientific discovery. From what I could tell, Friedan's book was based on anecdotes. And worse? Based on her OWN frustrating life. Now I'm getting to the point: this should have been sold/billed/published as a MEMOIR. All of us can pontificate and spout off any time we want - free country. But there was such an arrogance here that just seeped through the pages and became unbearable by the end. And in a nutshell her total theory is: no woman is a real, fulfilled woman unless she has a career. Kids should be few, and raised by the government (yes, she said her mother and mothers of her generation ""smothered"" their children by being there for them). If a woman enjoys cooking or sewing or makeup (I like 2 out of those 3!) she has been lied to and is now lying about liking it! Friedan is rude to homosexuals, said they made her uncomfortable and didn't include them in her ""depressed housewife"" analysis. To say nothing of black/brown women, or white women who didn't go to school. Friedan was Jewish, so I couldn't even believe when she started comparing housewives to people who suffered in concentration camps. She contradicts herself in several chapters - seemingly annoyed with the heavy emphasis on Freudian thought in the 40's and 50's, but then supporting his other theories later on the in book? Maybe Friedan was just a product of her time and place, as we all are. She was born in 1921, my grandmother's generation. She basically said she was completely unhappy being married and having kids. And I can see that in that generation, that would have been frustrating because a woman was expected to do just that. I just wish she could have been more objective and more inclusive and less judgmental and narrow-focused. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 19, 2023","Apr 30, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38723.The_Feminine_Mystique

But it is short, and oh so important and poignant!First reason to read: it falls into the war-is-hell category. If we don't know our history, we're destined to repeat it - as someone once said, right? Wiesel did an incredible job here of saying - know your history, count your blessings, and don't ever take peace for granted. Message received, Mr. Wiesel.Second reason to read: This part was a huge takeaway for me. Wiesel started the story with himself as a young teen in Sighet in Romania in 1944. Obviously, his parents were following news updates about the war, the Germans, etc. But Wiesel was masterful at showing how easily his whole town was sort of smoothly scooped up into this drama, leaving their homes forever. When just nights before they thought they were not going to be part of this drama! Oh how quickly everything got BAD. Fast! This made me think of myself and my own home. I'm embarrassed at how apathetic I've become to current events, world news, and involvement in the process. Most recently (January!), remember the crazy Chinese spy balloon that flew over our whole country? I sort of just dismissed it when I saw that our OWN president Biden and government didn't seem too alarmed. Why was I so willing to ignore it? I guess I'd say I'm too busy at my own job as a teacher, I'm distracted, I'm disgusted with Biden and Trump - two useless presidents in a row. But Wiesel's story has given me pause. These little incidents can add up quickly. That's how it happened to Wiesel's family. I think for me, personally, I always have this attitude of ""let's not ruffle feathers, let's not upset other countries, let's not make more of it than it needs to be."" But at the end of the book, Wiesel's Nobel speech was included and he spoke about that very thing - almost getting too comfortable and not questioning and then not taking action to prevent governments from atrocities. I think I need to get my head in the game a little more so that I don't have any ""surprise"" visitors (fill in the country of your choice here) telling ME to leave.

Which made it cumbersome and frustrating to read.Well, this one was cumbersome and frustrating, too. First, Proulx does the weird name thing again. OMG! I can't stand it. Main character: Bob Dollar. There's a Rope Butt, Hugh Dough. You may think - why is this woman so annoyed? But the names felt contrived and silly and weirdly made up so that would bring me out of the story. And just like Shipping News, there were SO MANY characters and with the odd names, I couldn't remember who was who. Second, and worse still - so much focus on the landscape - again, like Shipping News. This time instead of the ocean it was the Texas panhandle, and fields and cows in just too much detail. And not enough forward-moving plot to get me through that landscape.Third, and the worst part of all - Proulx did that thing where the main action is happening with the main character, Bob Dollar. Then Bob will be talking to LaVon and LaVon will say, ""oh yea, I remember old cranky Ace Crouch"" and from there, the LaVon character is telling a LONGGGGG backstory on whoever this Ace Crouch is. Literally for pages and pages. Some of you may say, oh, that's fun to hear the backgrounds! But it's background of characters who have no part in the active storyline and don't even re-enter later in the story. It's kind of like how nobody really wants to hear about what someone dreamed about last night! It's meaningless chatter that I started to skim through. If the writing is incredible, then at least you might enjoy the long tale. But Proulx's writing feels like a forced folksy-tone and over-the-top shenanigans that are supposed to be humorous but are more schmaltzy and corny than anything else.All that being said, her descriptions of that area seem spot on. I've been in locales like that and she is accurate in her portrayal of the landscape, the barns, the houses, the sounds. Proulx describes characters as they're talking - and she's very detailed with their farting, spitting, snorting - which I'm saying is a positive and trying to throw her a bone here. Because frankly, I'm done with Proulx now.

I loved how she called a spade a spade and didn't give a shit who heard. I loved how she somehow balanced her liberal views with her conservative roots in Texas. Ivins battled an alcohol addiction her whole life, but I also love that she still worked her ass off every day. I loved George Bush for the opposite reasons. He was not funny or sarcastic. He was kind and caring. He also battled addiction in his early days, but was able to find the power to overcome. Bush DID give a shit who heard him, and it was difficult for him to put his thoughts into words. But he was a quiet, sentimental, and unassuming man. He often reminded me of my father with his quick-to-cry manner. And as Ivins said, truly was a friend to all and knew almost every man and women in the Texas statehouse - and their families. And cared.These two were long-time love/hate sparring partners. So keep that in mind as Ivins outlines his life in politics BEFORE being president. Ivins does a fine job of offering up different topics per chapter and the book is a quick, easy read. Obviously, she's quite critical, as she should be. But as I tell my students, it's also hard to get the whole story from ""data"". Especially if it's POLITICAL. There were many subjects she mentioned that I could see how both sides would view the evidence differently. Another thing to consider: as with all politicians, time and history are important. Ivins wrote this book 23 years ago, and before Bush's presidency, 9/11, and his ""post-presidency life"". I was lucky to meet Bush when he visited here in Boise during his second campaign. Briefly spoke to him and my takeaway was respectful and genuine. I'm proud of Molly Ivins, too, as even though she disagreed with most of Bush's policies, she frequently mentioned some of his best qualities.

The whole thing reminded me of an old 1930s black and white ""science fiction"" picture on the TCM channel. Not to mention lots of typical 1930s racist attitudes and calling folks negros and octoroons. Awkward. Oh, and super awkward - at the beginning Huxley kept talking about hundreds of young naked boys and girls engaged in erotic play. Um, ew. I understand all the sex that Huxley had the adults engaged in. Since ""free sex"" wasn't around in 1932 and Huxley was trying to show this future way of thinking that adults could have sex whenever and wherever they like. And that was fine. But the sexuality of kids, I don't know, made me wonder about Huxley...just sayin'. On the other hand, I was impressed with Huxley's writing and his resume. I had no idea how prolific he was - plays, essays, poems, fiction, non-fiction. The end of the story offered wisdom and philosophies (during Mond's discussion with Hemholtz, Savage, and Bernard) and words to live by. I would read another Huxley story for sure.

Because of China's one-child policy (and/or variations of it) as of 1980, all of these poor women who had to give away (the author doesn't like the word abandon, and I agree) their daughters is unreal! In a country where the author says abortion is easy, prevalent and encouraged - it says so much that some women chose to actually go through the birth process, and maybe even tried to keep/hide her daughter and then a husband, boyfriend, or parent told the woman to leave her daughter somewhere and ""hopefully"" the daughter would be discovered - how unbelievably sad. The scant studies that had been done before this book showed that it was overwhelmingly a family member - not the mother - that said they would have to leave the daughter somewhere else and hope someone caring and able would find her. I guess I had never thought about the birth mother and the absolute pain she went through. I sort of labeled her as ""the bad guy"" in this story. I'm so sorry I thought that way.

I just spent a few minutes reading the interesting variety of GR s on this. Originally, I thought I'd be rating it a 4 - mainly because I know the amount of extensive research Dedman had to do on this thing. But truly, it's a solid 3 stars. Here's why:PROS: GR ers were pretty split - they either liked the first part and hated the second, or vice versa! I actually liked the first half better. This part focused on the father, W.A. Clark 1839-1925. I found it interesting that he ranks up there with the Gilded Age Robber Barons like Carnegie and Rockefeller and I'd never heard of him. Clark amassed a FORTUNE from mining copper in Montana and then moved to Manhattan. But the story is about his DAUGHTER, Huguette. She never earned anything or even became anything. And was a strange recluse with no husband, no kids, and not much of a life.CONS: Dedman is a good writer. Easy to read. Yet I had this nagging feeling that he was holding back on criticizing or judging how Huguette lived. I read other ers say this was to Dedman's credit - but there was a dishonesty about it. I think it's because his co-author was Huguette's cousin, and Dedman didn't want to offend the cousin? I'm not sure. Then every once in a while, Dedman made it sound like Huguette was strange, but didn't explore it. Also, I didn't read any s that mentioned this point, but I thought Dedman was going to delve into this woman's condition. Obviously, she had some kind of autism or phobia. Maybe he just couldn't find evidence on that? It was like he refused to paint Huguette in a bad light. In the end, I guess I'm not sure why the author wrote it or what he wants me to feel here. Is the theme supposed to be ""it's okay to be quirky""? Is it ""one can do what one wants with one's own money""? There was a bit of People-magazine-feeling to it because Huguette was definitely weirdly ""fascinating"". But I felt like Dedman was manipulating me to think, well, what a sweet, old, rich lady. Instead, I'm actually kind of sickened by her life. All of that money going to waste in mansions she never lived in, Monets and Renoirs she barely looked at, doll collections she didn't touch, jewels she never wore, etc. It's bad enough her father was from that generation that didn't care that they DECIMATED the land and poisoned the rivers, but then Huguette did nothing really to rectify this. She did give money away, but to a few friends and to people who served her - nurses, accountants, doctors, managers. Oh and art museums. After her death it was mainly to taxes and lawyers. She could have done so much good. Dedman kept saying how tender and sweet and kind she was, but only to about six people in her whole life. I guess Dedman is leaving it up to the reader. I say her 104 years of being incredibly wealthy were squandered and I don't know that that's enough for a book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 10, 2023","Jan 23, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17704903-empty-mansions

Written in 1937, a slim novella ringing in at 107 pages and classic Steinbeck. The only author I know who can capture the entire human condition in one paragraph (sometimes one sentence). It sounds so cliché, but Steinbeck had that rare ability to set an entire mood and scene with very few words. I want to touch on something, though, that I read in some other GR s. The one female character: ""Curley's wife"" - no name. Yes, as a woman, it's hard to see how the character is portrayed. She's awful. But I think we're doing Steinbeck and the story a disservice if we decide there's a ""flaw"" because of how she is portrayed. I think we see this reluctance to create a minority character who's wicked more and more nowadays - whether it's a woman, a person of color, a member of the LGBTQ community - aren't there evil folks in EACH of those categories, too? Of course there are! If a character is offensive, do they not belong in the story? And any woman who is reading this, can't you agree that Steinbeck ""portrayed"" a woman we have all known at least once in our lives? Now, I guess you could say, okay, yes, there are woman like that, but I don't want to read about them. Ok, that's fine. But please don't say that they SHOULDN'T be portrayed that way. Steinbeck NAILED that character. On top of that, if you read closely, you'll see that Steinbeck is not completely one-sided with her, either. In the scene where she's talking to Crooks, Candy, and Lennie, you can hear the utter sadness and disappointment. Steinbeck rounds out her evil with longing, fear, vulnerability, and confusion. So I think it's hard to say that Steinbeck is ""portraying"" her badly or falsely. Especially considering it's 1937. Talk about trapped! No wonder she's such a bitch! I was going to end this by saying everyone should read this book and everyone should read Steinbeck. I'll stand by that, but - ""reader beware"" - Steinbeck is REAL.

I'm sorry it has been on my ""to-read"" list for so long. It takes a lot for me to give 5 stars. I'll try to stay brief - but here's why!First, I give Zacks a lot of credit. I've read a ton about Twain. There's been a ton written about Twain. What can anyone say that is new or fresh? Well, I loved that Zacks zeroed in on a very specific time period - toward the end of Twain's life - 1894-early 1900s. Twain died in 1910. I enjoyed the focus and details about Twain's world speaking tour with his wife and middle daughter. Secondly, Zacks wrote it in a comfortable, conversational tone that made 400 pages just whiz by. I didn't want it to end. Zacks included lots of excerpts from Twain's letters. Some of the best letters were to his good friend, billionaire H.H. Rogers in New York. And I thought it was balanced between Twain's actual words, biographical info from Zacks, and then the words of those close to Twain.If I had to think of why someone would not like it, I suppose it might be the numbers and dollar amounts that Twain was making at each ""comedy"" show, and what he owed his creditors.

I read ers say it felt unfinished, but I thought it stayed true to the story and was good to not have it tied up in a neat little bow. Felt real.CONS: I will mirror what I read many ers say - the biggest problem - REPETITIVE. First, it was repetitive in physical descriptions. Everyone was either dark brown, light brown. But what was worse was the repetition in the INTERNAL DIALOGUE (I think that's what it's called). Without giving anything away, one of the beginning scenes Phillip is asking himself the SAME questions OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I love reflection, but reflection that might be moving the story forward, or if not that, allowing me to learn about the character. On top of that, there was too much internal dialogue. Who is that man? I know that man. Who is that man? Why do I know that man? Why isn't this relationship working? Was it working? Is this relationship working? Why isn't this working? Oh. My. God. I was begging the author to get out of this mental vortex and get to the next scene. The characters were flat. The only character who felt developed was Chippo - and he only entered the last few pages of the story! I never knew who was who. And females were nonexistent except his wife, and she was barely there. I thought at first, well, it's the 70's. Nah. That's not gonna work. In the 1930's Steinbeck created Kate Trask; in the 1940s James Cain gave us Mildred Pierce, etc. etc. Some important females may have helped this story. Frankly, I felt a bit duped. I thought that there was going to be a big reveal toward the end as to what some terrible incident was.

But I can't believe that I actually enjoyed it!The writing is nothing special at all. Felt like an average magazine article. Also, if you're not a true, die hard fan of Seinfeld, don't even bother. But I loved all the old references and reading about how Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld created it, how they changed the way sitcoms were done, and all the inside stories about the various writers throughout the years. It made me feel good and brought back lots of memories. I actually remember the airing of the pilot in 1989! I wasn't even married yet, and I was at my boyfriend's house. When the episode ended, we just kind of looked at each other like - meh. And yet.... and yet... later that evening we both said - there's something different here. The show was like no other comedy that we had seen. And the rest was history. I watched every episode for the next 9 years. During the show's run I moved from Florida to Idaho, got married, switched jobs 3 times, but my constant was always Thursday night on NBC! Those half hours were sacred. And now, of course, I've seen the series over and over in syndication. In fact, my husband and I were just on a road trip watching TV in the motel room and we caught it on three different channels!One of the points the authors makes is that very few people have ever been as committed to a show since Seinfeld. That's me. I've enjoyed other sitcoms - probably ""The Office"" comes close, but nothing like Seinfeld. Ms. Armstrong also wrote at first that the executives kept saying ""too Jewish"", ""too New York"", but that never affected its popularity. I agree. But I did notice when I moved to the west that not as many people that I'd talk to watched the show or thought it was as hilarious as I did. I grew up in south Florida where I was friends with many people who were Jewish and from New York. I KNEW these characters! Lastly, I had to laugh when the author mentioned that fans have a tendency to be able to draw a parallel from their own lives to any or every scene from the show - but they have to be careful because it becomes annoying quickly.

However, not knowing much about India and specifically, Jaipur, I have no idea how authentic the history was.Cons: plot was over-the-top dramatic. Very soap opera. Very predictable - I knew what was coming quite early on. Non-believable events at every turn. A very poor village outcast child is familiar with English authors like the Bronte sisters? The main character's henna cures everything from skin rashes to sex drive? And many more silly occurrences so the author could make it all come together with an unrealistic, happy Hollywood - or Baliwood - ending! Ha! Even with the ""cons"", I always wanted to pick it up and see what was happening to these Indian ladies, kids, and men!
