Like many ers, my primary complaint is that I grew weary of waiting for the “big reveal.” There is such a thing as too much anticipation. This story was engaging, but after awhile, I began to feel strung along and manipulated. There is a certain artistry in knowing just when to divulge the big “what,” and then constructing the remaining narrative so it sheds well-timed light on the various “whys” and “hows.” Suspense for its own sake can be tiresome. Which is why, when I got about 40% through the book with “the day of the barbecue” as obfuscated as ever, I did a Google search in desperation to find spoilers! Then, naturally, once I learned the big secret I questioned whether there was any point in continuing with the book. But continue I did, and I am glad. Despite the “off timing,” I found myself fully engaged by this story and the assortment of characters, so much so that I couldn’t give up on it even after knowing the punch line. The more I read, the more I enjoyed it. This poignant story is funny and delicious; the characters quirky and delightful. Truly, Madly, Guilty would be a near-perfect Moriarty masterpiece had the author not led the reader on for quite so long. But be that as it may, Liane Moriarty has a real talent for harmonizing words and human emotions. Her books are like a merry-go-round—all cheerful music on the surface, but with ever-present ups and downs, the clanging merriment is mere overlay to an entertaining but sometimes stomach-churning ride....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27831371-truly-madly-guilty

Besides being a really compelling, moving and engaging story, it could teach our country a lot about the immigration ""issue"" and engender some compassion for what many migrants face in their origin countries and what they go through to come to the U.S. This is not a journey for the faint of heart or one that is undertaken on a whim. I don't see how anyone could read this book and not reevaluate any ""anti-immigrant"" sentiment they might harbor. I believe living free of fear and violence are basic human rights. I'd like to think this is a value held by the my fellow Americans as a whole. Maybe allowing increasing numbers of immigrants into the U.S. isn't the answer; but until a longer-term foreign policy solution is found to address cartel violence, extreme poverty, etc., we should not be separating children from their mothers, incarcerating undocumented people in refrigerated prisons, or separating U.S. families so we can deport the undocumented parent of a U.S. citizen child. These policies have diminished us as a nation and struck a blow to our national image as a compassionate country that gives a crap about human rights.

It delves into the effect a long-ago secret adoption had on the teen mother who left her child behind in order to attend college and make something of herself. It then delves into issues around race and social justice (the protagonist is Black), family secrets, and the ramifications of leaving vs. staying in one's small and suffering home town. I didn't quite ""buy"" Ruth's complete and sudden (if temporary) estrangement from her husband when she goes back home over Christmas to learn the truth about her son's adoption. I also thought it was an interesting choice to have the narratives switch between Ruth and ""Midnight"", a little disfigured white boy who happens to be both the grandson of Ruth's grandmother's old friend(view spoiler)[, but more importantly, best friends with Ruth's adopted son (hide spoiler)]. I would have thought that Ernestine (the grandma) or Xavier (Ruth's husband) would have made for a better ""counterpoint"". But Midnight's story (including his deepening attachment to Ruth) was touching and provided the white point of view necessary to illustrate the difference between the Black and white experience out in the world, even when the Black child is better off financially and has a more secure home.

The story alternates between present-day protagonist, Bethany, in 1996 during her father's decline and following his death, and Grace, Bethany's long-deceased mom, during the late 1950s. Both women suffer(ed) from post-partum depression, so that is a primary theme. It reminded me what it was like to care for an infant while your body feels like it's been hit by a bus and no one especially cares. Everyone expects a new mom to be blissful, but the responsibility of keeping a tiny new person alive can be emotionally and psychologically overwhelming. Kelly Rimmer captures this fraught period of motherhood beautifully and accurately. Besides this overarching theme, the story has a number of good twists and turns as the mystery of what happened to Grace unfolds. In telling that tale, the author introduces the touchy (and timely) subject of a woman's right to abortion, and showcases what things were like for women back in Grace's time, when one's fertility foreclosed virtually all other life choices. There are also minor themes about memory/speech loss, hoarding, and the competing pull of one's own aspirations and obligations to others. Truths I Never Told You is, in the end, a beautiful presentment of family loyalty and love. All in all, I could not put this book down and found it to be a delightfully unexpected treat....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Oct 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45701218-truths-i-never-told-you

With the possible exception of the final scenario, I can't say that any of Shriver's twelve possible outcomes for Kay and Cyril's suicide pact is encouraging as far as their (or our) ultimate fate–individually or collectively as humans. Whatever her fictional vision for her protagonists' future (view spoiler)[(a ""live forever"" drug? Cryogenics?) (hide spoiler)] there are the pesky unintended consequences. Shriver sure does give the reader plenty to think about, brilliantly weaving the moral, social and existential issues facing us as we age on planet Earth.

I was expecting a light memoir about a woman leaving her husband for a woman. It is that, in a way; but it is so much more. Untamed is a heartfelt roadmap to living one’s life with honor and integrity no matter the cost—a modern day bible for forging an authentic life—sans dogma or “preachiness”. There are so many themes in this book it practically covers the gamut of our human condition: Doyle addresses addiction, divorce, mental illness, parenting, greed, suffering—all with poignancy, humor and love. And while the book’s simple message (sit still, wait, listen for the Knowing, then follow that Knowing like your personal North Star) is nothing new, Glennon Doyle delivers it to the reader with a humble flair for the divine.

I loved the title character, with all of her quirks and up-tightness. I didn't see the surprise ending coming (though perhaps I should have).I was also struck by how differently workers are treated in Scotland, where the story is based. Foster kid with no family? No problem, you get ""council housing"" where you can afford to live alone in a decent, affordable apartment on one salary. Mental health problems? No problem. You get as much PTO as you need to sort yourself out while you undergo state-supplied therapy. And when you're ready to return to work? Your job is secure and waiting for you. I realize this is a fictional story, but I assume these features of Scottish life are fact-based. Why is our own country so cruel and heartless toward its citizens? That's a different issue, I suppose, than the quality of the book, but it bears mentioning as it made a sad personal story hopeful and positive. I don't know that the same story, if based in the U.S., would have had the same happy ending.I listened to the audio book, and the Scottish brogues only added to the charm of this heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting story.

But the ending veered off a cliff of cringe-worthiness, ""convenience"" and suspension of disbelief. The story was great up to that point; I enjoyed following Joe on his seemingly misguided mission to clear the name of a convicted child molester/murderer in order to fulfill the requirements of a college biography class, while at the same time ""wooing"" his indifferent neighbor, Lila, and dealing with recurring crises involving his mother and autistic brother.

That said, I also consider myself a critical thinker, which is why I had First, let me say I am a vehement Trump detractor and have been since Day 1. That said, I also consider myself a critical thinker, which is why I had some issues with this book and cannot give it four or five stars as I had hoped.Too Much and Never Enough was certainly eye-opening and engaging for all the obvious reasons. For anyone desiring insights into why the pr*sident is such a hollow shell/poor excuse for a human being, this book may provide some insights. However, many of the incidents Mary Trump describes happened before she was born. I am left to conclude that this family lore came from her deceased father (who had a serious drinking problem) and/or from other members of this cruel and fractious family. I therefore have to question the accuracy of any events that did not take place during the author's adult life.Secondly, a major theme of the book is how Donald's ""faction"" of the family attempted to deny the author and her brother their ""rightful share"" of the Trump fortune, as if this is their birthright. (The disinheritance was based on the fact that Fred, Jr. died the ""black sheep"" of the family due to his career choices, alcoholism and general temperament.) True, there are allegations of duress against Fred, Sr. when he was of less than sound mind. If these allegations are true, they are very serious. But this isn't the author's ""beef"" so much as the mere fact that her father was written out of Fred, Sr.'s will, leaving her and her brother to fend for themselves like just about every other ""regular"" person on the face of the earth. Wah! I'm sorry, but however big a d*ck Fred, Sr. may have been, it was his right to do with his estate whatever vindictive thing he wanted, and the author was not automatically entitled to a share simply by virtue of her last name. Thirdly, while I absolutely recognize—firsthand—the effect Fred, Sr.'s breed of cruelty and abuse can have on a person in adulthood (having witnessed it in both my older brothers), I also fault Fred, Jr. for continually and repeatedly ""going back for more."" He managed to get himself the career he always wanted as a pilot, he moved his family away, and then, after four months, undid all of that and returned to the family fold for more abuse. Why? I can only conclude it was, at least in part, because he lacked the backbone and belief in himself necessary to walk away from the family fortune. To the extent that choice cost him his sobriety and mental health, well, who is to blame for that? Truly, I do not mean to be insensitive, but as the ""breakaway child"" in my own family, I know firsthand it is possible to find one's own way—financially and emotionally—if that's what someone truly wants.Apart from the issues noted, I found Mary Trump's account to be informative (if nauseating) and an easy read. I also appreciated her ""take"" on Donald as a mental health professional, which rang true and might be educational to any voters still on the fence about this man. I doubt this book will change many minds, though, given how divided the country is. But I respect Mary Trump for coming forward and sharing her unique perspectives ahead of this most crucial election. She seems like a sane and ethical person, which is no small feat when your name is ""Trump""....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54081499-too-much-and-never-enough

And it is most poignant in its spotlight on human dignity and exercising choice in determining one's end-of-life destiny.

I downloaded the audio book (as I often do) for a long drive, and the fact that I continued listening over the next several days after my return is a testament to its ""sticking power"". Summer of '69 tells the story of a summer spent by the Nichols-Levin family on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard during this turbulent year in U.S. history. It takes place against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and shifting racial, sexual and societal mores. It is, like the other books I have read by this author, a bit ""fluffy"", but has a historical fiction component that lends a seriousness absent from the ""Paradise"" books. As I was a child myself during this historical inflection point, I also found it to be a gratifying nostalgia piece.I honestly didn't care for the ending (view spoiler)[, as it glorifies war and the military (hide spoiler)], but I found the characters to be generally well-developed and their issues, setbacks and triumphs kept me rooting for them. I look forward to reading Summer of '79 when it is released in 2021.

It tells a moving, shocking, inspiring story of survival and self-realization against all odds. Tara Westover is an Overall, I really liked Educated. It tells a moving, shocking, inspiring story of survival and self-realization against all odds. Tara Westover is an uplifting protagonist and narrator. My heart went out to her for all that she endured, while at the same time, her grit and resiliency were awe-inspiring. Tara Westover is a true bad-ass.This book was coasting to an easy five stars for me, but the last quarter cost it a star as the narrative devolves into a sort of foggy, disjointed pea soup whose unifying thread is the abused author's overriding self-doubt over whether she deserved the academic accolades she'd earned (not to mention the personal affections of friends and suitors), and whether she'd actually been abused by her older brother Shawn (spoiler alert: she had). While I certainly understand how the abuse inflicted on her caused enough psychological damage to justify so much self-doubt, I was nevertheless baffled (and more than a little annoyed) by the author's gluttony for punishment. Her willingness to sacrifice her intelligence to the altar of family loyalty, and substitute the family's reality for her own—once she'd already won scholarships, personal independence, and recognition for her talents and accomplishments—made this reader want to scream. If Ms. Westover had been my friend or classmate, I would have slapped her silly (figuratively, of course) before letting her take one more flight home to Buck's Peak. (And the sheer number of trips was mystifying, given the cost and distance, and the fact that Ms. Westover's academic standing at times dangled by a thread.) Each pilgrimmage was more disheartening than the last. Predictably, each renewed search for redemption only led to more belittling, physical abuse, and gaslighting at the hands of her father, brother, and mother, respectively. How many times does an intelligent, freshly-educated woman have to do the same thing before realizing that the problem is her family, and not her? I do understand, having been raised by a larger-than-life abusive and narcissistic father. But perhaps because of this, my frustration mounted with each doomed attempt at reconciliation. This erratic family clearly had no room in their hearts or minds for Tara's shining light; their only mission seemed to be stamping it out. As an aside, I found one event at the end of the book to be confusing. Maybe I misread, but I could swear that the grandmother who died was ""Grandma-in-town"", i.e., the author's maternal grandmother; but later in the story, the deceased grandma is described as the paternal grandma, who lived in Arizona. I think the last quarter needs ""tightening"" and re-editing. One or two factual instances of pointless head-butting and hand-wringing could easily be sacrificed to tell a more concise, succinct story. All in all, this is a must-read memoir. It is generally well-written and captivating. Tara Westover's hardiness and determination are an inspiring reminder of all a body and soul can endure....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 21, 2020",not set,"Apr 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133922-educated

The premise is a fascinating one--how guilt over not stopping to help an acquaintance (who is then murdered) derailed the protagonist's life. The early-onset dementia angle adds even more intrigue.The story goes downhill in the the use of texts to unravel the mystery of both the murder and the mysterious phone calls unhinging Cass. I listened to the audio book, so the repetitive recitation of dates and times, ""smiley faces,"" ""LOLs"" and similar text-talk was tedious and distracting. Maybe it isn't quite so bad on the printed page, but listening to these particulars over and over was close to torture. I don't think it is necessary to state the date and time of each and every text, at least not in the audio book, and especially when so many of the texts are mundane and inane and don't add anything as far as moving the story forward.

It is compelling, well-argued, well-written and singularly engrossing. And despite the fact that (asI was going to give A Warning five glowing stars. It is compelling, well-argued, well-written and singularly engrossing. And despite the fact that (as noted by other ers) there is “nothing new” here, if anything should breathe renewed life into our comatose, war-weary national debate, the “same-old” alarm bells blaring on these pages should, as they are being submitted for our consideration by the proverbial “fly on the wall”. Any voter of rational sensibility who cares a whit about Democracy ought to be staggered and disgusted anew.My one-star “ding” is due to the following derelictions:First, the author suggests that some anti-Trumpers suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome” because we reject everything and anything the pr*sident says. Granted, even a broken clock is right twice a day, as the saying goes. But when right-thinking Americans are subjected to so much idiocy, inanity and malice from the pr*sident on a daily basis, we cannot be expected to give a fair and impartial assessment to each bit of drivel emitted from Donald Trump’s foul mouth. Frankly, the author speaks out of both sides of their own mouth when, on the one hand, they (I refer to Anonymous as “they” since we do not know their gender) invest 272 pages trying to scare the citizenry straight by confirming that, indeed, the so-called commander-in-chief is an unstable, unfit, dishonest and corrupt thug; but on the other hand, those who consistently react negatively to Trump are deranged and suffer from a “syndrome”. Puh-lease. Unless you are part of Trump’s “cult”, you, your friends and loved ones and all that you hold dear are being attacked from the bully pulpit on a daily basis. From where I stand, a strong, repulsed knee-jerk reaction to those attacks is 100% appropriate. Trump forfeited the right to any “benefit of the doubt” the day of his inauguration (which Anonymous recognizes as the acrimonious tragedy it was)—if not before.Second, the author argues that, despite Trump’s innumerable naked disqualifications, impeachment is too divisive, and the next election should determine whether this so-called pr*sidency terminates or continues for four more years. I might be swayed by that argument if the pr*sident were not attempting to tamper with said upcoming election. It has been well established—as the author concedes—that Russia tipped the scales in 2016. Those of us who voted for the qualified candidate in 2016 are still reeling from the fact that our election was attacked, and nothing is being done about it. Not only are we being asked to accept the “legitimate” electoral distorters (e.g., gerrymandering, voter suppression, the Electoral College), we are now supposed to ignore Donald Trump’s flagrant solicitation of a foreign power (Ukraine) to investigate a political opponent—not to mention his not-so-subtle nods to Russia and China for a repeat performance of 2016. Having lost all faith in the legitimacy of the upcoming election, I for one feel strongly that impeachment—successful or not—is imperative as a symbol of resistance, if nothing else.Third, I question the author’s final “warning” that Democrats must nominate a centrist as their candidate in 2020, in order to win over “swing voters” and “moderates”. That point might have some validity had Mitch McConnell not blocked Barack Obama’s centrist nominee to the Supreme Court (Merrick Garland) in 2016. Democrats consistently try to appease phantom “moderates” and “swing voters”, and lose whenever they do (think Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, John Kerry). The last best example of the Democrats’ star power was Barack Obama, the first Black president and a two-term winner. The sad reality is that Republicans don’t play by the rules (and haven’t for decades); until they clean up their act and “play fair”, Anonymous has zero right (or credibility) to offer advice to Democrats. The fact is, an overwhelming majority of Americans support progressive Democratic policies—a woman’s right to choose, affordable housing and health care, preservation of the environment, and a living wage. Anonymous, an admitted Republican enabler of Trump’s tyrannical minority rule—has no right to opine on who the next Democratic nominee should be.Despite the above failings—and they are significant—I commend the author for making a chilling and earnest case for ousting the thug-in-chief pronto. I hope Trump supporters—whether voters or elected officials—take heed (though I seriously doubt they will). The author also makes an excellent point that Congress reflects the electorate at large; until we (as in the respective “bases”) stop being so uncompromising and polarized, there is little chance that Congress will rise above our own gridlock, as they merely reflect back at us the behavior we demand of them. (However, we will gain no ground in our national healing until Russia is made to stay out of the mix by whatever means necessary. I see no signs of Republicans supporting that effort. So again, don’t ask those of us on the right side of history to embrace our fellow countrymen and women until they unequivocally get behind this most uncontroversial mandate.) I will offer my own parting shot to voters: If by some miracle Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren manages to win the Democratic nomination, we’d better make damned sure to also take back the Senate and hold the House. Anything less, and it won’t really matter who the president is. We will spend four (or eight) more years helplessly watching America crumble....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Nov 30, 2019Dec 08, 2019","Dec 07, 2019not set","Nov 30, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48557815-a-warning

The book tears down the ""Three Great Untruths"" that have overtaken our public discourse: (1) “What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker,” (2) “Always trust your feelings,” and (3) “Life is a battle between good people and evil people.” The authors explain how these ""untruths"" are the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom needed to fairly evaluate opposing points of view with logic, critical thinking, empathy and open-mindedness, and are in fact based on various cognitive distortions.  The Coddling of the American Mind also discusses how tribalism is driving a wedge between various identity groups in this country. The authors do not downplay the realities of hate speech and verbal intimidation, but hail the virtues of the ""sticks and stones"" philosophy, where true strength and resiliency come not from ""safe spaces"" where people can shield themselves from speech they find distasteful, but by feeling ""safe"" in their own skin despite whatever someone else might be saying. Particular emphasis is given to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which the authors maintain can ""correct"" the cognitive distortions that cause ""emotional triggers."" There is even a short guide at the end of the book that explains how to practice this therapeutic technique. Particular emphasis is given to the chilling of free speech on college campuses—the result of college students' emotional fragility and its resultant ""otherizing"" opposing points of view and the people who hold them. The authors make a strong case that the various developmental disadvantages suffered by the current generation of college kids (""iGen"") was caused by excessive early childhood ""screen time,"" overprotective parenting and the elimination of free, unsupervised play (with all of its attendant risks). As the parent of a college sophomore, this book spoke to me; I may have, indeed, been guilty of overprotective parenting.In spite of the polarization we are experiencing in this country—along with the threats of climate change and social injustice—this book ends on a positive note offering an optimistic perspective for the future. I would recommend  The Coddling of the American Mind to iGen kids and their parents, as well as anyone else concerned about the devolution of discourse plaguing our nation during these troubled times. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 29, 2019","Nov 16, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36556202-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind

The story While I Was Gone tackles the issue of how a single traumatic event at the dawn of one's adulthood can ripple throughout that person's life. The story is a bit too lethargic for my liking, but the plot—when it finally does ""get there""—is powerful (assuming you can hang in there that long). When our protagonist (Jo) receives an unwelcome confession regarding a horrific long-ago crime against her closest friend, she faces an explosive ethical dilemma about what to do with that information. This unwelcome disclosure—obtained as it was during a compromising near-affair—threatens to shatter her marriage (to a minister), her relationship with her youngest daughter, and her otherwise tidy little life as the town veterinarian. Also of note: Jo is the mother of three adult daughters (all of whose relationships are already fraught), and Jo's relationship with her own aging mother reveals how one's family of origin ""stamps"" a person with peculiar personality traits that inform their lifelong actions, choices and perspectives. This domestic moral spectacle is presented against a beautiful backdrop of New England's changing seasons and vistas. While I Was Gone places a particular emphasis on setting and environment, opening with a vivid scene on a lake and containing an abundance of descriptive language making for a ""pretty"" read throughout. I am not sure whether this stylistic choice bogs the story or brings it to life, but it was noticeable.

The book focuses on male-to-female abuse in heterosexual relationships but acknowledges that gay partners of both genders can and do sometimes abuse their spouses and partners. It provides a number of resources for members of the LGBTQ community who might be facing these issues. While I did not “buy” 100% of the author’s core edict that “men are always at fault; women are always without blame”, Mr. (Dr.?) Bancroft opened my eyes on several key points:1.	Men who abuse their partners don’t do it because they have “anger” issues, substance abuse issues or unresolved childhood issues. They do it because they feel entitled to and can get away with it. Controlling, abusing and keeping “their” women in line benefits them. They get to be “king of the castle”, the center of attention at all times. They are the sun, and their wives and kids the planets and moons orbiting around them. (My father fit the descriptions in this book to a T.) 2. Society (as in the abuser’s family, friends, coworkers and larger community, including, by and large, police and the court system) supports this underlying notion of entitlement that enables abusers to get away with their behavior. 3.	Perfectly “normal”, strong women can and do find themselves in the clutches of an abusive man. Part of the abuse is the gradual process of psychological (and sometimes physical) warfare he wages on his partner to break her down and make her afraid of the repercussions of standing up for herself. The victim’s genuine love of her abuser and desire to “keep the peace” also often play a role in her willingness to accept increasing levels of abuse over time. (This book helped me make sense of my parents' turbulent dynamic and my mother's seeming passivity.)4.	The children are the “collateral damage” of this pattern, and they often come to identify and side with the abuser. (This was certainly true for me as a child of an abusive father.)5.	Abuse isn’t always physical—and it doesn’t have to be in order to inflict severe psychological and emotional damage. It is the fear—the palpable threat of violence—that keeps women “in line”. (My father was rarely physically violent, but his mood on any given day set the tone in the household; more often than not, the tension was oppressive.) 6.	No matter how incompetent, annoying, “naggy”, etc., any particular woman might be, her “shortcomings” do not justify male violence being directed toward her. That is a function of the man’s entitlement, not her unworthiness. Some of the things women accept as “fair game” in arguments with men (e.g., name calling, trivializing, belittling) is a form of misogynistic abuse. I read over half of Why Does He Do That? before realizing the author is male, so unwavering and unconditional is his support of abused women and his unapologetic, unblinking assessment of abusive men. While this is an informative and mostly spot-on appraisal of abusive male behavior, I nevertheless believe there are particular men and women who push one another's buttons, bring out the worst in each other, and are mutually violent in a sort of pathological “dance” that fulfills some twisted drama they are both playing out....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 02, 2019","Sep 13, 2019","Aug 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/224552.Why_Does_He_Do_That_Inside_the_Minds_of_Angry_and_Controlling_Men

Like most people, I had never heard of the Wilhelm Gustloff, whose sinking was the worst maritime disaster in history. Now I'm at a loss as to why the Titanic got so much more ""fame""—perhaps because it transported the ""rich and famous"" of the day, whereas the Wilhelm Gustloff carried mostly refugees. Regardless, Salt to the Sea brings to life an important piece of WWII history through four fictionalized characters, following their arduous trek to the doomed cruise ship (which was supposed to transport them to freedom) and the horrors that ensued after they managed to embark against all odds.

Nickel and Dimed is an eye-opening exposé into the plight of the working poor—and things have only gotten worse in the 18 or so years since it was written. Barbara Ehrenreich's little experiment illustrates how stagnant wages have not kept pace with the exorbitant cost of [healthy] food, rent or health care, and how a nationwide housing shortage has made it impossible for anyone working minimum wage to subsist on their own without public or family assistance. Wal-Mart truly has the biggest scam going: Pay workers sub-subsistence wages and have them rely on WIC and food pantries. Americans can buy their artificially cheap goods while the Walton family grows ever-richer. When will we wake up and realize that (1) full-time working adults deserve a living wage; (2) three-quarters (or more) of the merchandise sold at Wal-Mart is low-quality, environmentally harmful junk that we do not need; and (3) while we do need to pay somewhat higher taxes, the taxes we do pay are horribly misused on a bloated defense system and prison-industrial complex that gives nothing back to the average American taxpayer? Although I worked minimum wage as a supermarket cashier while in high school (late 1970s), and survived on $83 per week while in college (living off-campus in a Queens, NY apartment I shared with my boyfriend in the early 80s), that relatively prosperous post-recession time in America is long gone. In addition, most of my jobs—even the crappiest ones—were relatively ""cushy"" office gigs where my 100 word-per-minute typing ability (thanks, Mom!) qualified me for above-minimum wage office work. Nickel and Dimed has given me a new appreciation for all the Target and Wal-Mart workers out there, and has reaffirmed my decision to not consume fast food or have another human being (other than my husband!) clean my toilet. Although I can see why the ""invisible class"" (as Barbara Ehrenreich describes them) might take issue with an imposter sharing their plight from her privileged perch, and while it's now a bit dated, Nickel and Dimed is required reading for the rest of us. The ""social contract""—if we still have one—has been shamefully breached, and American capitalism truly needs an overhaul from the bottom up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 28, 2019",Jun 2019,"May 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1869.Nickel_and_Dimed

It purports to deal with serious subjects like homelessness and traumatic brain injury, with a ""whiff"" of crime drama (view spoiler)[which turns out to be a red-herring (hide spoiler)]. Then there's the issue of loyalty, both to one's past and present, and the quandary of having to choose between two very different men whom the protagonist loves for very different reasons. These enduring themes—which never get old if done right—are glossed over with the lightest touch. Even the characters' names (""Kailey"" and ""Cade"") scream ""soap opera"". Always was a perfect light read for a plane ride; it's entertaining and the story moves along well enough. But if you're looking for something thought-provoking, this ain't it, which is a shame because it could have been so much better with a little more research and editing effort. As it is, Always is spoon-fed pabulum, which is fine as long as you're not expecting something noteworthy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 11, 2019","May 18, 2019","Dec 25, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40605984-always

All in all4.5 stars, but I'll round up because of how much I enjoyed this book, and how compelled I felt to snatch a chapter or two whenever I could. All in all, this is great psychological fiction, even if the characters are a bit ""trope-y"" and the story premise is commonplace and overdone. The Wife Between Us is your typical Cinderella tale of a high-powered, professional ""Prince Charming"" plucking a young, delightful-to-look-at, mentally malleable blonde out of her ho-hum, financially challenging existence. In this case, ""Nellie"" is a preschool teacher by day and a waitress by night, sharing a New York apartment with her best friend to save on rent. Picture-perfect Richard graces her with a marriage proposal and promise of a new and carefree life. In the first part of the book, we are told the story ostensibly from the alternating points of view of Richard's older, mentally-unstable ex-wife (Vanessa), in the first person, as she seemingly stalks and obsesses over her younger replacement (nicknamed ""Nellie""), whose side of the saga is cleverly told in the third person. But in Part Two, we learn that the authors had played a trick on us—how sneaky! The story structure is clever and innovative—all the more so given that two authors contrived it (how did they do it?). The characters' points of view are believable and shrewdly presented; and despite the complex interweaving and unexpected supplantation of characters, all pesky little loose ends are adeptly wrapped up. And all the while, the slow unfurling of psychosis (you'll be kept guessing exactly who is the psychotic one) is delicious. I listened to Parts One and Two (through Hoopla). I found it consistently gripping and loved the twists and turns. I also liked the narrator's voice. However, I read most of Part Three (in the large-print book, since that's all that was available through my library) and thought the writing lost steam as the story neared its end. Maybe the experience of reading the large print was simply less absorbing than listening to that smooth female voice, but I also found the surprise epilogue a bit preposterous, not to mention gratuitous (as in, ""now we're just trying too hard to be clever""). I'd shave off a half star for the last-minute letdown. Nevertheless, this is a fun and captivating read and a wonderful example of ingenious craftsmanship....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 03, 2018","Dec 06, 2018","Dec 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34189556-the-wife-between-us

Seven Days of Us is a lively, quirky and fast-moving story. My [minor] annoyances are (1) the way the narrator (who has a British accent) attempts an American accent for the Jessie character (it is horrible, nasal, and wholly unbelievable; either get an American narrator for those parts, or do not attempt ""voice-shifting""); (2) the way each email address is recited start-to-finish, character-by-character, over and over again each time a character sends an email (you can skim over this type of thing when reading the book, so why not skip the character-by-character email address when reading aloud?); and (3) how, when Jessie shouted, ""Call 911!"", no one corrected him--it's 999 in Britain. I know this last bit is petty, but little things like that catch my notice and detract from the story.Although a bit predictable, I nevertheless really enjoyed Seven Days of Us and found it engaging and laugh-out-loud funny in parts.

I loved the matriarch, Eleanor—how classy, inscrutable, and cool-as-a-cucumber she is. However, while Eleanor and Rupert are strong characters, the others—especially the sons—all seem to glom into a single entity. Eleanor's father is supposed to be singularly endearing, but I got no strong sense of who he was as a person. The same goes for the sons. The book ""tells"" us what their personalities are supposed to be, but nothing about their conduct or statements gives the reader an experience of who they are. A strong novel makes the reader feel as though he or she is spending time with the characters, for good or bad. The Heirs does not do this.Like most ers, I found this book to be something of a ""bait and switch"", which is why I can't give it a higher rating. Rupert's so-called ""other family"" is given short shrift, an ancillary subplot, rather than carrying any emotional weight as a major plot point. (view spoiler)[They are not ""another family"" so much as the possible product of an obsessive sexual exchange, transactional in nature, between Rupert and Vera. (hide spoiler)] Finally, I think The Heirs is meant to have an omnipresent point of view, but it just has random, ""all over the map"" perspectives that I found downright perplexing—despite the chapter headings purporting to channel a certain character. Many times the narrative uses ambiguous pronouns so that it wasn't clear to me who was narrating/speaking, or who was being referred/spoken to. The strange paragraph placements didn't help, frequently leaving me to ask, ""Who said that?"" (In fairness, I read this on my device, so maybe it is a formatting glitch in the Kindle version.)I did enjoy it, though, much in the way I enjoyed Desperate Housewives—colorful, quirky, and entertaining; but in the end, transitory and inconsequential. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 18, 2018",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/31867044-the-heirs

While overall it's a five-star read, it contains a half-dozen or so annoying typos (""your"" for ""you're""; ""effect"" for ""affect""; and others I noticed but didn't initially mark because I wasn't expecting so many). I see White Like Me was published by a small press in Berkeley, California, so I can somewhat forgive this. But for as important as the subject matter is (especially with a ""racist-in-chief"" occupying the Oval Office), the otherwise excellent job Mr. Wise does shedding sunshine on darkness could stand a fine-toothed editing so that its presentation is equally excellent. Also, Mr. Wise, like many storytellers allowed to expound on important political/social issues through uncensored personal vignettes, sometimes veers afield or draws questionable conclusions from his personal experiences. But this is nothing that said ""edit"" couldn't fix. For example, while I generally agree with the author's argument that ""political power,"" when held by people of color, does not necessarily translate to ""economic power,"" his example of the Prime Minister of Bermuda does not hold up to intellectual scrutiny. Alex Scott (the Black Bermudian PM) was made to apologize to a white political opponent for an anti-white comment he made via email. I daresay that (before January 2017 at least) had a white U.S. politician made a similar comment about being ""sick-and-tired"" of receiving criticism from people who ""look like"" thus-and-such Black person, he (or she) would have been chastised and forced to apologize. Mitt Romney's (""those people"" don't even pay taxes"") remark probably cost him the 2012 election. So while I do not disagree that Black elected officials too often have to kowtow to the sensibilities of white opponents and constituents (one need look no further than Barack Obama to see this phenomenon in play), I think the above Bahamian example falls flat. Other than these minor weaknesses, White Like Me is a powerful read, made all the more compelling because it is written by a privileged white male—one who recognizes that being Jewish (like being gay) does not automatically obliterate one's white advantage, and who has truly put his money where his mouth by dedicating his life to exposing and combating racism. His oft-repeated example about how his grandparents' home (in a racially-redlined district) helped finance his college education, while tiring in its repetitiveness, hit home for me. My father, lacking even a high-school diploma, was able to buy a ten-room home in a solid, all-white neighborhood with good schools and virtually no crime. It abutted a tonier town across the city line. All throughout my life, I, a veritable ""nobody"" with no connections, saw doors magically open as I got my education and sought higher-paying jobs and better opportunities. First, by virtue of my (actual) Jewish last name, I was (nod, nod; wink, wink) invited with open arms into probably a dozen predominantly Jewish law firms in various roles over the course of my career. Second, when I told interviewers, in all types of jobs, where I had grown up, the knowing nods affirmed me as being ""one of them"" despite my sketchy-upbringing, despite being half-Jewish and half-Italian, despite being female, and despite being solidly lower middle-class/borderline ""white trash."" That childhood address branded me a well-raised, solidly middle-class white girl who had come up on the ""right side of the tracks."" I moved seamlessly from cashier in high school, to secretary and paralegal in college and law school, and ultimately to attorney at large and ""exclusive"" law firms on both coasts. Had I been a Black woman from the Bronx sitting for those same job interviews, I seriously doubt those doors would have flung open so easily.I think it is extremely important for every white person, regardless of background or economic station, to take stock of how their skin color has advantaged them—to whatever degree. That task honestly and humbly completed, we have an obligation to speak out whenever and however we can to acknowledge the disparities in treatment that have so benefited us compared to our brothers and sisters of color. We must recognize ""white backlash"" and so-called ""reverse discrimination"" for precisely what they are: white angst and resentment not about unfair treatment, but simply about being asked to cede a tiny bit of our privilege so that others might have a shot at the things all of us want: a decent, safe place to live; a job with a living wage; a good education for our children. Even that small bit of recognition and ""sharing"" is apparently too much for white people to abide and get behind. How shameful.White apathy to racial injustice is pervasive, because that injustice benefits white people and is largely invisible to us. It is so embedded into our legal system and social fabric that we view racial injustice—if we acknowledge it at all—as something happening ""out there"" someplace else to someone else—to ""those people"" about whom we might not especially care because we're essentially doing okay. And even if we do care, what are we supposed to do about it anyway? Shouldn't ""they"" just ""get over it"" and ""move on""? And how can anything we say or do possibly help move the needle?I loved Wise's allegory of a new CEO who had just taken over a multi-billion dollar corporation. He blithely tells his CFO that he plans to ignore the liabilities column of the balance sheet because ""he wasn't there"" when those liabilities were incurred. Too many white people argue that ""my family never owned slaves"" (if that happens to be true—many white families can trace their roots—and their privilege—back to slave-owning families) or ""I never personally oppressed Black people,"" ignoring the fact that each and every one of us has been born into a system with unpaid liabilities on its balance sheet, those being the genocide of Native Americans and the enslavement and continued separation of Black and brown people. To quote Mr. Wise: ""The notion of utilizing assets but not paying debts is irresponsible, to say nothing of unethical. Those who reap the benefits of past actions and the privileges that have come from whiteness are certainly among those [who] have an obligation to take responsibility for our use of those benefits."" How true, typo notwithstanding. As for what difference anything I do can make, Mr. Wise argues compellingly that ultimately ""winning"" the battle is beside the point. There is a long and largely ignored history of white resistance to racism and injustice in this country, and it behooves decent white people to identify with that version of our white heritage and to join in. Resisting racism, standing on the right side of these issues, and taking the moral high-ground (rather than standing idly on the sidelines while this ugly battle rages)—that is the point. It boils down to what sort of person you want to be, and what sort of life you want to live. For every one of us white folk—and especially those who call themselves Christian or ""people of faith""—there is no more important question to answer in this lifetime.I was also persuaded by the author's arguments as to why racism and unequal treatment harm not only people of color, but white people, too. Systematic unfair advantage presumes that white people aren't good enough to ""make it"" without the head start and ""leg-up"" we implicitly and undeservedly expect as our birthright. This allows too many mediocre white people to excel while only the most spectacular people of color are allowed similar gains. It lumps all white people into the same selfish, ignorant, clueless ""basket of deplorables"" in the eyes of our darker-skinned brothers and sisters, when many (most?) of us can, should, and in fact want to ""do better"" by them. Just as our current pr*sident has given license to white supremacists to ""come out of the woodwork"" with their tiki torches and vile rhetoric, Mr. Wise gives moral imperative to decent, right-thinking white people to ""show up"" and SPEAK UP. For that message alone, for that permission, Mr. Wise's book deserves five stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 12, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88362.White_Like_Me

Rather, she is first and foremost a wife and wannabe mom who is singularly focused on finding a baby while avoiding telling her husband the truth about her own family of origin—in particular, the fact that (1) Molly herself was adopted and raised under a form of ""open adoption"" with her birth mom living in close proximity on the family's property, and (2—no spoiler here) according to Molly, her adoptive mom murdered her father.

The narrator, Aaron, who lost his wife when a tree fell into their house, is surrounded by several other quirky characters, like his sister and coworkers. I couldn't help but wonder how, in this age of print-on-demand online publishing, Wolcott Publishing (the fictitious ""vanity publisher"" which Aaron and his sister inherited and ran) was profitable enough to pay a living wage to them and three other employees, but I suppose if we can ""roll"" with Aaron's deceased wife reappearing from the dead into thin air, we can suspend disbelief about the viability of this enterprise.I really liked Dinner at the Homesick Cafe by the same author (though I gave up on A Spool of Blue Thread midway), so I thought I'd give Anne Tyler another shot....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12482658-the-beginner-s-goodbye

In the Country We Love had I was on the way to giving five stars to Diane Guerrero's memoir about losing her parents to deportation at the age of 14. In the Country We Love had me in tears. The ""voice"" in the early chapters was moving and heartbreaking, and drove home to me the barbarity and senselessness of ripping apart loving, law-abiding (apart from immigration documentation issues) families for seemingly no reason. Ms. Guerrero intimately reflects on her insidious emotional ""dive to the bottom"" even as she struggled—alone in the shadow of her abandonment issues—to make a successful life for herself as a first-generation U.S. citizen. It is a compelling story that needs to be heard. However, the writing got a bit ""cutesy"" in the middle, what with the ""OMGs,"" ""WTFs,"" and smiley faces. I felt like I was reading a series of Facebook posts rather than a serious memoir. And then, we move into the final chapters, when the book takes yet another turn into a more impersonal ""voice"" that does not sound like the same author, especially in the last chapter's call to action. I felt like I was ""dumped"" at a party by a warm and engaging host and turned over to an eloquent but more distant party guest. Hence the drop to four stars.Don't get me wrong: Ms. Guerrero's arguments about immigration and human rights are spot-on. It is not a crime to want a better life for oneself and one's family if, by chance of birth, one is unfortunate enough to be born in a violent and hopeless country. It is not a crime to want to survive and make a living—in fact, those who uproot themselves and leave behind everything and everyone familiar to them to toil in the U.S. at the lowest rungs for sh*t wages and, in the process, endure all sorts of indignities and abuses are the most perseverant, indefatigable people on earth. It is a good thing—not a bad one—that people the world over want to come to the United States. It is a good thing—not a bad one—that our southern neighbors are willing to pick our produce, scrub our toilets, trim our hedges and wipe our babies' butts with grace and good humor. Our ""legal"" immigration system is a travesty and a joke, and immigration reform—not building a midieval wall to fend off the brown-skinned ""bogeyman""—is the true ""emergency"" at the border. And when you factor in our own ugly history, and how much we continue to deplete resources the world over to satisfy our lust and insatiable desire for excessive comfort and unnecessary ""stuff,"" basic human fairness demands that we give something back to the folks whose homelands we so callously exploit to keep our high-powered economic engine chugging along.I agree 100% with Ms. Guerrero's urge that any person with a conscience not sit idly by while our country's best ideals are crushed by cruelty founded in racism and falsehood. Good for Ms. Guerrero for turning her personal tragedy into a rallying cry. My only issue with all this is that the ""voice"" in the last chapter sounds completely different than the narrative that preceded it. I see there is a ""co-writer"" and wonder whether this persuasive, almost legalistic parting-shot was written by her and not Diane Guerrero. I think In the Country We Love could easily be a five-star home-run with a tad more editing to smooth over these choppy edges. As it is, I still highly recommend it, as it is a story with widespread relevance that everyone should read, regardless of where you stand on the immigration debate. It is authentic, powerful, engrossing, and topical....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 14, 2019","Jan 25, 2019","May 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25666051-in-the-country-we-love

It has so much heart, for most of the novel, it feels like being ""up close and personal"" in an African American family's living room. But what tipped this book from 4 to 5 stars for me is all the wisdom and moral ambiguity so artfully woven within its pages. This story pulls back the curtain on the landmine of being a Black man in America. The main character, Roy Hamilton, tries to ""make it"" by doing all the right things. Despite his humble Louisiana upbringing (by a young mom who was abandoned by his biological father and a loving adoptive dad), Roy manages to move to Atlanta, find the ""right"" job, the ""right"" clothes, and (so it would seem) the ""right"" well-bred woman to be his life partner and mother of his future children. But even with all these ""right"" moves, Roy literally gets yanked from his bed one night and is wrongfully convicted of rape and sent to prison. His accuser is an older Black lady whom he helped to her hotel room earlier that evening, but to her, and to the jury, Roy is just another ""animal"" who is not entitled to the benefit of any doubt.An American Marriage examines the human cost of this tragedy, and the many ethical dilemmas foisted on Roy's wife, best friend, and family members in its aftermath. It shows how prison brutalizes and dehumanizes its inhabitants, especially (and ironically) those who are imprisoned wrongly. It raises universal moral questions about loyalty, friendship, marriage, abortion, what it means to be a father, and even what constitutes ""consensual"" sex. The scenes run the gamut from touching, laugh-out-loud funny, to stomach-knotting, but if I had to characterize this work in one word, it would be deep.I give it a ""qualified"" five-stars for two reasons: First, in some small, indefinable way, the ""rubber just didn't meet the road"" as far as Roy and Celestial's marriage and their feelings for each other. Perhaps deliberately, their relationship seemed opaque and wobbly. I think the author was going for something here by making their connection not-so-solid as it needed to be for Celestial to remain faithful throughout Roy's incarceration. But I think an even stronger case could have been made—and the story might have been even more powerful—if despite a rock-solid marriage, it still couldn't withstand the wrecking ball of Roy's incarceration. I think that would have made the scenes in the second half of the book that much more captivating.Secondly, somewhere along the way, the three main characters (Roy, Celestial, and Andre) became ""wooden""—ironically, during some of the most emotionally-charged scenes. The dialogue grew vague and stilted, leaving me feeling unnerved in the same way I feel when shouting at the TV because a movie's characters are dancing around the bush and not stating the obvious. All the supposedly tense silences, the [symbolic] shrugged shoulders after what these people had been through? It just did not ring true to me. Nevertheless, by that point, I was so invested in this story and so taken by this author, that I was ready to forgive any flaws that I perceived. Apropos of nothing, but as an aside, I started reading An American Marriage as I struggled to finish All the Light We Cannot See, and the difference was stark. It was like a slice of warm, homemade apple pie being set before me, its spicy fragrance reassuring my nose that there really was such a thing as ""delicious"" as I struggled to clean my plate of some highly recommended but bland and overly-heavy food that I was supposed to like because Michelin or some-such told me it was good, but it really wasn't.On balance, for whatever its blemishes, An American Marriage is a really satisfying and worthwhile read that didn't leave me feeling like I'd wasted my precious time. I wholeheartedly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 18, 2018","Nov 20, 2018","Apr 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage

I was not wrong.Although a bit dry in parts, Russian Roulette is, overall, a fascinating must-read for anyone who is the least bit concerned or curious about what really happened before, during, and after the 2016 sh*tstorm that passed for an election. Unlike What Happened by Hillary Clinton (which I have not read) or Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff (ditto), Russian Roulette is neither self-serving nor gossipy. Rather, it is a well-researched, even-handed expose by two well-respected journalists that lays out the truly alarming Russian campaign to not only hijack the 2016 U.S. election, but to dismantle Western democracy overall.

The Book of Unknown Americans is a hidden gem that I happened to pick up (as an audio book) before a long drive. It is a moving and touching story about the budding romance between Maribel Rivera, who suffered brain damage in Mexico following an accident, and Mayor Toro, a shy teenage boy who is able to see through Maribel's limitations, and even her physical allure, to the beautiful soul within. The story is told against the backdrop of a group of immigrants living in an apartment building in Delaware. The central characters are the Riveras—Arturo, Alma and Maribel—who have recently immigrated from Mexico, and the more ""established"" Toros—Mayor and his parents, Cecilia and Rafael—who immigrated from Panama years earlier to escape that country's violence. The Book of Unknown Americans has a valuable place in our current national debate over immigration. At its core, it shows that immigrants—legal and illegal both—are simply human beings with human stories and problems and challenges; people who crave—and deserve—a chance at a better life and should not be condemned for pursuing better circumstances; and, for all that they might gain, immigrants pay a high price for uprooting their lives and attempting to set down roots in the U.S. The Riveras' story is gripping and heartbreaking. Alma is the voice of this family, and she tells her tale with uncensored emotion. I was pleasantly startled by the appearance, for the first time, of Arturo in the very last chapter, when for whatever reason, we do not hear from him directly before that. Through his wife's eyes, we learn he is a good man and is an endearing character (whereas Cecilia's husband, Rafael, is not) despite the strains in their marriage and his human frailties. Nevertheless, introducing Arturo's voice at that late stage, given what had happened to him previously, was a bold if confusing creative move.I would give this book five stars but for the extraneous characters (e.g., the building owner; the busybody neighbor ""Quisqueya"", who is supposed to be Puerto Rican but whose name refers to the island of Hispaniola and the Dominican Republic in particular). For me, they detracted from the plot's momentum and also injected a flippant quality to an otherwise somber tale. Perhaps that was the author's intent.Despite some quibbles, I think The Book of Unknown Americans is a notable work that merits a thoughtful read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 19, 2018","Mar 24, 2018","Mar 19, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18465852-the-book-of-unknown-americans

It was a short and gripping read, both the early chapters focused on Mattie and the later ones centered around Lisbeth. Many have criticized its portrayal of slavery as not being brutal enough, but I disagree, seeing as how the story depicts quite accurately how slaves essentially had no dominion over their own bodies. Mattie is wrested from her own infant to provide milk to the mistress's newborn; she is later whipped when her husband escapes from a neighboring plantation. Mattie's son, Samuel, has no say when he is sold away from his mother (Mattie) at the young age of ten. And, most poignantly, a young, nameless slave girl has no say when Lisbeth's betrothed decides to ""relieve his needs"" by raping her under a willow tree. I don't need more graphic blood and gore to get the picture.Mattie is a beautiful character whose fortitude, faith and graciousness are not obscured by her inhumane lot in life. Lisbeth is an unexpectedly sympathetic character grappling with the inextricable role her own station in life plays in the systemic injustices perpetuated upon her nurse and the fallacy of her mother's and fiance's flimsy justifications for slavery's unseemly way of life.I especially love that the book is written by a local (Berkeley) author and possibly self-published (through Amazon). And I found the original cover haunting. This is clearly a real photograph, possibly of an actual slave and her charge. The young Black woman's mouth is blocked by the baby's head, which is apt if unintended symbolism. And her eyes, though not terribly clear, express unmistakable pain and sadness.

Sure, it was a bit of ""pabulum"" for the masses, and certain parts were hoaky as heck. But to the extent it demystifies human creative output, it delivers a crucial message. Creativity isn't something only the phenomenally talented, rich, or tormented few get to partake in. It's something we are all  inherently entitled to express—no matter our talent level, financial circumstances, or emotional state.

For those who don’t know, ALS causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles, gradually but predictably robbing its victims of the use of hands, limbs, and eventually the ability to swallow and even breathe. While perhaps not as brilliant as Still Alice, Every Note Played comes pretty darned close.Ex-spouses Richard and Karina are flawed yet likeable characters. Divorced and completely estranged when Richard is diagnosed, by a fortuitous combination of default and happenstance, Karina nevertheless becomes the only logical caretaker for Richard after a humiliating episode reveals he is no longer able to live alone in his fourth-floor walkup. It was both heartrending and terrifying to witness Richard's decline; the reader can really feel his losses and yet relate to his hope—against all odds—that the latest impairment would be his last and that this disease would be arrested. Because of his “optimistic denial,” Richard does not plan as well as he should have for what ALS next has in store for him. To do so feels too much like defeat and surrender. Meanwhile, Karina's defenses and self-delusions about Richard and their marriage gradually peel away like the layers of an onion as she experiences (and resents) his increasing helplessness and dependency on her. Against this sobering backdrop, the curtain is drawn and the truth behind their marital grievances is laid bare. As Richard's ALS progresses and he loses his remaining bodily functions one-by-one, their shared humanity comes into sharper focus. Rounding out this poignant tableau is their only daughter, Grace, who is away at college but returns at intervals to take in the ravages of her father’s disease and ""make her peace"" with Richard. A big part of the drama involves Richard's and Karina's shared torment over how and when to tell Grace about Richard’s condition without interrupting the trajectory of her education or social life. It is Grace’s freshman year, and no time is the right time. Tell her sooner, and she might become so distracted she fails her finals. Wait to tell her, and Richard’s inevitable degeneration will come as an even greater shock. When Grace does enter the picture, it is truly heartbreaking to witness their mutual ambivalence and emotional ineptitude.One quibble I have with Grace's story line is the fact that, at the beginning of the book, she introduces her boyfriend to Karina on a parents' weekend at school. It appears to be a serious relationship. But then we hear nary another mention of said boyfriend, other than once when Karina's tells Richard about him, and again in Karina's internal monologue. Do they split up? Given that Grace’s role in her parents’ marriage is a fairly major plot point, this omission is a thread left dangling. I would have liked at least a line or two about how Grace handled this relationship after learning about her father’s condition.The story is narrated in the third person, and alternates every few chapters between Richard’s and Karina’s perspectives. I listened to the audio book, which is read by male (for Richard) and female (for Karina) narrators. I found “Karina's” voice (combined with the deliberate Polish accent) a bit whiny and languid, but I suppose that’s in keeping with her unhappiness and many harbored resentments. Genova weaves in many musical references—to classical composers (in the case of Richard) and jazz masters (in the case of Karina). The musical dimension adds texture and context to the story: Richard, a concert pianist before ALS, lost not only his livelihood but his life's greatest joy once the disease took hold. Richard’s repeated ""bare"" references to Brahms, Mozart, Liszt, Chopin, etc. grew a bit tiresome after awhile, but nevertheless made me want to hear the pieces Richard was pining for. Some classical background music would have made for nice ""audible scenery"" while the narrator read his chapters, but I suppose we can't have everything.All in all, I loved this book. I loved how such a horrific disease could bring out the best in those it affected—for example, Richard cracking jokes, with slurred words and a barely audible voice, when he smashed his nose after a fall (""There. . . goes. . . my . . . modeling . . . career."") I loved Bill, Richard’s tireless and selfless home health attendant (though I could have used fewer “God bless Bill” references—or whatever the line was). I loved Richard’s two brothers, even though they played a very minor role in this story. All of the professionals in Richard’s orbit were caring, pragmatic and professional. And while Richard is always in the “limelight,” Karina has a compelling story of her own. In the end, despite having lost every major bodily function—including the ability to breathe without intervention—Richard is given control over his own ultimate destiny. But despite their divorce and prior estrangement, Richard’s no-win choices are excruciatingly complicated and consequential to Karina in her own right. In the final Author’s Note, Lisa Genova (in her own voice, in the audio version), explains why this story is so meaningful to her and makes a pitch for ALS ONE. The author's website (https://www.lisagenova.com/) is like a public service announcement for awful diseases (Alzheimer's and Huntington's, in addition to ALS). I really admire how she uses her literary talent and scientific expertise to help people, educate her readers, and promote these worthy causes. I also enjoyed hearing her speak; she sounded down-to-earth and approachable—a trusted friend in addition to an acclaimed author and neuroscientist.Not every one of Lisa Genova's books is a ""home run,"" but in this reader's humble opinion, Every Note Played earns that distinction....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 22, 2018","Dec 25, 2018","Jan 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36082326-every-note-played

For as short as it is, this book dragged and (for me at least) fell flat. Not that a book about a brain surgeon dying from lung cancer should be a fun ride. My heart went out to the author and his family, and I do admire Dr. Kalanithi for using his remaining time on earth to chronicle his illness and share his experiences for posterity. Like several other ers, however, I was appalled that he would perform brain surgery while impaired (by pain, dizziness, nausea, etc.). I would hope that any surgeon about to saw into my skull would do me the favor of recusing him- or herself under the same circumstances. But I digress. I guess the big ""hook"" here is that the author, being a surgeon, understood (unlike most ""regular"" patients) what his odds were with this diagnosis and made pragmatic choices regarding his treatment. I daresay, however, that many ordinary folks exhibit the same pragmatism when given a terminal diagnosis. My mother-in-law is a perfect example of someone who chose to die at home with grace and dignity, rather than submit herself to relentless medical torture. Diagnosed with lung cancer in August 2001, she underwent one chemo treatment before deciding that chemo-induced sickness was not worth whatever time it might add to her already doomed life. Before that one treatment, rather than fear the loss of her hair, she had my husband (her son) shave her head. During the final days of her illness, she expressed joy at my daughter's baby sounds and seemed to enjoy seeing her adult children and their spouses/partners gathered in her apartment. My mother-in-law died exactly a month after her diagnosis, on September 13th—not exactly a cancer ""success story."" But given what was going on in our world at the time, I'd say she chose as good a time as any to ""check out.""My point being, having lived through my own ""close to home"" cancer experience (among several other family members' deaths from other causes), I was not all that impressed by Dr. Kalanithi's level-headedness—I would expect no less from a doctor. And I already understand that it's better to accept death on its own terms when the alternative is an agonizing course of treatment that might bankrupt the patient (financially and spiritually) with a long, drawn-out experience of worse suffering than from the underlying illness—particularly when the medical benefits are uncertain and negligible. I do not mean to disparage anyone who opts for chemotherapy or other treatments, as I have seen people beat cancer and have great admiration for their fortitude and will to live. As for Dr. Kalanithi, an ""insider"" of the medical profession, he generously shared a few dirty secrets about how the ""medical machine"" operates, and for that I give him credit. If this book helps other cancer patients make more informed choices, Dr. K. has done humanity a service. But if you're looking for something profound or enlightening about death or end-of-life choices, you should probably look elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 29, 2018","Aug 11, 2018","Jan 12, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air

I simply refused to ingest his form of hatred and bigotry, especially since I often listened to the story while preparing meals, with my Black husband and mixed-race daughter within earshot. I made two exceptions: The courtroom scene, where Turk Bauer is on the witness stand, and the final scene(view spoiler)[, where Turk and Ruth Jefferson meet at a clinic she then owns. I felt that the courtroom scene was going to be extremely important to the arc of the story (which it was), and the ending was redemptive, if a bit unbelievable (hide spoiler)]. I should probably ""ding"" Picoult more for writing a story a third of which I found so unpalatable as to be unable to read it. But I decided to forgive her because she did such an otherwise exemplary job of telling a bold, compelling tale with an extremely important social justice message. I disagree with the naysayers who feel a white woman should not tell this type of story, especially not from the viewpoint (in part) of a Black woman. As Kennedy (Ruth's public defender) so passionately states in her closing argument, it is precisely white people who have to speak up if we are ever going to see an end to institutionalized racism and the insidious, nearly invisible barriers it places in the paths of people of color. I applaud Jodi Picoult for being one of those privileged people who nevertheless values fairness and chooses to use her platform to speak out against racial injustice. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 25, 2017","Jan 05, 2018","Dec 25, 2017",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/28588017-small-great-things

Compact in terms of pages but larger than life as far as substance, this book is thought-provoking and riddleBetween the World and Me is a must-read. Compact in terms of pages but larger than life as far as substance, this book is thought-provoking and riddled with quotable, eye-opening passages on virtually every page. That it is presented as a letter to the author's son gives the writing a poignant, personal touch. I have thought a lot about race in my life, having been raised by a tyrannical racist father and later marrying a Black man and having a ""bi-racial"" child. I like to think I haven't been quite as blind to racial inequity as many white people because of this, but the one obvious thing I had not considered is the central tenet of this book, i.e., that from the time of earliest childhood, Black Americans do not feel secure in their bodies. Rather, they live in a constant state of fear whose premise is that, on any given day, their bodies can be obliterated. Dark skin creates a highly visible and ever-present barrier separating ""Black"" people from the world beyond—the so-called ""Dream"" described by Coates. And because of this “high visibility,” African Americans live in the world with an undercurrent fear of corporeal loss, whether to a stray bullet in one of America's ghettos, to violent arrest and incarceration, or to sanctioned police brutality and murder. It is a sobering perspective but one that cannot be dismissed. All parents feel the vulnerability that—God forbid—something unthinkable could happen to their offspring. But Black families feel this risk as a palpable daily proposition. The remnants of slavery are all around us, and any ""white"" person who refuses to acknowledge this is not being honest with him- or herself. Despite the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of equal treatment under the law, people of color are still treated as second-class citizens, distrusted and feared as a first impulse by ""white"" people and law enforcement alike, guilty in all matters until proven innocent. Our spun history would have us believe that slavery is nothing more than a minor blemish on an otherwise exemplary moral national heritage—a trivial ""my bad"" akin to dropping a jam jar in the supermarket aisle, where a flustered shopper can rightly expect the aggrieved store owner to appear out of nowhere with a mop and a smile to clean up the clumsy shopper's mess and make him or her feel better in the name of good customer relations. More accurately, ours is a history of land theft and genocide on a massive scale, a history that included the deliberate, systemic physical subjugation and psychic annihilation of dark-skinned bodies for pure financial gain and, later, socioeconomic advantage. Until this nation can wake up and candidly come to terms with the fact that slavery represents a crime against humanity—a system of state-sanctioned kidnapping, human trafficking, rape, torture, and terrorism—this country has nowhere to go in improving its ""race relations.""Let us not forget, as Ta-Nahisi Coates rightly points out, that Black Americans as a ""race"" have been ""free"" for a far shorter span of history than they were enslaved. Technically, people of African descent were enslaved for approximately 465 years all told, and ""free"" for only 150, give or take. White people cannot and should not expect that magnitude of psychic trauma to be erased so quickly in order to appease our discomfort and spare us this conversation—especially given that so many vestiges of this immoral system of race-based inequality remain embedded in our institutions and the unequal implementation of our supposedly color-blind laws. If a white woman were kidnapped and held in captivity for ten years during which she were raped, beaten and terrorized, if she had given birth during that time to children who were stolen from her, we would not expect her to ""get over it"" in a matter of days, months, or even years. In terms of content and the importance of its message, this book deserves five stars. I took off a star because I found parts of the first third (primarily the recitation of all of Mr. Coates’s reading materials and heroes) a bit “dry” and ""off point""—perhaps because, as a white person, I couldn't relate. But that aside, as a writer Mr. Coates is extremely talented, with a style that can be described as starkly poetic. I have several other of Ta-Nahisi Coates’s books on my “To-Read” list. I look forward to reading more. Note that it is my personal convention to capitalize “Black” and not “white.” Many style conventions agree with this approach—see http://www.diversityinc.com/ask-the-w... http://dcentric.wamu.org/2011/10/when... https://www.cjr.org/analysis/language.......more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 15, 2017","Dec 17, 2017","Dec 15, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25360188-between-the-world-and-me

It would have sufficed to show that Marin was abandoned by her birth mother and adopted, which is why she feels conflicted over this wrongful birth lawsuit and its plaintiff.

My criticisms are these:•	 I became hooked starting with Book Two. Before that, I found the writing at times stilted and flimsy. David is not a character one can connect with—perhaps that is deliberate, given the stalwart manner in which he conducts himself. Still, when faced with a deep longing to hang on to a boy he loves, and debating whether to cross lines and bend legal rules to keep nine-year-old Anton in his custody rather than return him to a drug-addicted mother, readers ought to be able to connect with his dilemma on a deep emotional level, not just an intellectual one.•	David's wife, Dolores, Connor (his best friend) and Brad (Connor’s son and Anton’s best friend) are likewise not well-developed as characters, nor is Anton’s girlfriend, Katherine (until perhaps the very end). Anton's college girlfriend, Carine, is certainly the most colorful of the secondary characters; but even she is something of a stereotype in her role as the “outspoken radical.” •	The book could have benefited from deeper editing, as with the claim that “pop” is a term for soda in the North (it isn’t—that’s a Midwestern thing—see https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/1...) and the “slip” on Page 107 where David grabs his “coat keys”. •	Finally, whereas the book was written in third person past tense, two pages before the end, it shifts to present tense. I think that was done deliberately, to indicate Anton’s “coming into the moment” for perhaps the first time in his life. But the fact that it's noticeable means it doesn't quite work. For me, the sudden shift was jarring and puzzling and only drew attention to the ending's ambiguity.Despite these imperfections, like someone we come to love after hanging in there long enough to truly know them, there is much to love about Everybody’s Son, flaws and all. It has something elemental to say about race and privilege in this country, while teasing at important peripheral issues like prison inequality and police brutality. It attempts to answer the fundamental question, “What does it take to be a complete, genuine human being?”—Are money, pedigree and even love enough? Or do we also need to locate two remaining awkward pieces of the “meaning-of-life” puzzle, namely acceptance of our own true natures and making peace with our biological origins?Thrity Umrigar is a warmhearted and sensitive writer. That same authenticity Anton is searching for in the story comes through in real time as Umrigar’s own wisdom on these pages. It’s as if the reader is listening to her speak over a cup of coffee or at a lecture. You can tell she pens stories she cares about, and weaves in topics that are important to her. Not every author can pull this off without it detracting from her work. For me, this ""personal touch"" tipped Everybody’s Son from 3.5 to 4 stars.If Everybody’s Son isn’t the masterpiece of, say, The Space Between Us or The Weight of Heaven, it nevertheless has depth and heart and offers readers lots to think about....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 25, 2017","Oct 28, 2017","Oct 25, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/32051571-everybody-s-son

Commencement is an enjoyable if understated story with substance. The first third (i.e., the college years) plodded along a bit and therefore didn’t “hook” me right away. But I’m glad I hung in to see how the friendship among these four classmates (Celia, Bree, April and Sally) would play out following graduation. Each woman’s tale has something to say about the implications of that woman's life choices (however passively pursued), and the ending, though farfetched and reminiscent of a Lifetime movie, is gratifying nonetheless.Despite some harsh criticism in many of the s here, I liked its “girl power” theme and the author’s handling of important/delicate subjects like date rape, “coming out”, child exploitation, and “extreme activism”—without allowing any of those serious topics to overwhelm the plot of enduring female friendship.

It's one of those must-reads about the inherent inequality in our society lurking before our very eyes, but which middle-class white America mostly does not see. It posits the theory that, like an occupied colony, poor communities of color are subject to a different standard of law enforcement--the maintenance of order at all cost, whereas in the rest of proper society--the nation--the law is viewed and applied in an entirely different way. I think the author, MSNBC talk show host Chris Hayes, makes a compelling case.I listened to the book on CD, read unaffectedly (for the most part) by the author--but with a bit of subtle accentuation peppered throughout for good measure.

This book is informative, and a worthwhile read for Although I liked Everyone Brave is Forgiven, I did not find it as gripping as Little Bee or Gold. This book is informative, and a worthwhile read for that reason alone. I, for one, had no idea that English children were separated from their parents during World War II and evacuated to the countryside. And I had no idea the degree to which the city was bombed before the U.S. finally intervened in this war. I was motivated to Google pictures of London during WWII to get a better mental picture of some of the scenes Chris Cleve describes.That being said, I don’t especially like reading about war (I find it boring). While there aren’t really any combat scenes per se, there are numerous passages where you’re plodding along one minute, and the next Cleave drops a bomb out of the blue (pardon the pun) with no warning and then without any subsequent shift of mood or tone to mark the gravity of the situation his words denote. It might be an intentional and somewhat effective literary device designed to underscore the ""one-minute-to-the-next"" survivalist nature of war, and the ""not-particularly-noteworthy"" nature of air raids during World War II. But this matter-of-fact telling was jarring and, for me, fell flat emotionally.The near death scenes are powerful, but stand in stark contrast to the deaths of more minor characters, which are instantaneous and without fanfare. The jelly jar metaphor ultimately proved meaningless (unless I am missing something). And is it me, or are there “hints” of undeveloped homosexuality between Tom and Alistair, and Alistair and Duggan and Simonson? Or are the intimate and playful moments these men share intended to emphasize the heightened emotional state of men during wartime? This wasn't made clear and left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied.I liked the female characters (Mary and Hilda), but didn't think the so-called ""triangle"" (from the book flap) was adequately developed or, for that matter, the supposed lightning-bolt ""love-at-first-sight"" between Mary and Alistair. Again, maybe I don't quite grasp the urgency felt by people living in a city under siege, although in other respects, I was awakened to the horrors, uncertainties, and sufferings of living in a war-torn city.In summary, this is a “so-so” book by Cleave standards, a decent read all-in-all, but not one I’d label a “must-read”....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 20, 2017","Aug 27, 2017","Mar 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814512-everyone-brave-is-forgiven

It is enjoyable overall, but somehow misses the mark of a great read. On the plus side, I think Ethel Rohan did an excellent job portraying how a family can resist change--however positive--of one of its members (in this case, Billy) because of the threats they perceive (in this case, unwanted publicity) to their own emotional security. The deteriorating relationship between Big Billy and Tricia, his wife, in the wake of their firstborn's suicide was heartbreaking, as was Billy's often bumbling attempts to connect with his remaining children while trying to make sense of his deceased son's motivations. I believe this is the book's greatest strength, as it speaks not only to the constraints of family dynamics and our need for familial approbation, but also to cultural expectations surrounding grief and suicide.Where The Weight of Him misfired for me is that it really does not elucidate on the very important issues of suicide or morbid obesity in any meaningful way. Despite the story being told exclusively from Billy's point of view, I never fully related to him. There is a lot of talk about his food cravings, his grumbling stomach, his sexual and emotional longings and frustrations, and the negative impact his weight had on his marriage and his life. And while he had moments of emotional growth and clarity as he lost weight, there was never a single ""aha"" moment, either in regards to Billy's food addiction, Michael's suicide, or suicide generally--which is disappointing when you consider that these are the driving themes behind this story. Maybe there are no pat answers to such thorny issues, and in this instance we are simply being invited along for the ride.Also in the negative column: I found the fantasy world Billy created in his garage (with the toy ""seconds"" from work) to be a hackneyed distraction from the story. If it was intended to give us a glimpse into Michael's character or his relationship with his father, it fell flat in this regard. I also found the author's consistent use of synonymous phrases like ""anyone and everyone"" and ""anything and everything"" rather irritating (like any other ""tic""), as I don't need to read a second, redundant word over and over again. I am surprised the editors let this one through. All in all, I would recommend The Weight of Him as a poignant and pleasant enough read about a family coping with the aftermath of trauma, but readers should not expect anything truly revealing about its key topics....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 31, 2017","Jan 03, 2018","Feb 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29939242-the-weight-of-him

Like many ers, my primary complaint is that I grew weary of waiting for the “big reveal.” There is such a thing as too much anticipation. This story was engaging, but after awhile, I began to feel strung along and manipulated. There is a certain artistry in knowing just when to divulge the big “what,” and then constructing the remaining narrative so it sheds well-timed light on the various “whys” and “hows.” Suspense for its own sake can be tiresome. Which is why, when I got about 40% through the book with “the day of the barbecue” as obfuscated as ever, I did a Google search in desperation to find spoilers! Then, naturally, once I learned the big secret I questioned whether there was any point in continuing with the book. But continue I did, and I am glad. Despite the “off timing,” I found myself fully engaged by this story and the assortment of characters, so much so that I couldn’t give up on it even after knowing the punch line. The more I read, the more I enjoyed it. This poignant story is funny and delicious; the characters quirky and delightful. Truly, Madly, Guilty would be a near-perfect Moriarty masterpiece had the author not led the reader on for quite so long. But be that as it may, Liane Moriarty has a real talent for harmonizing words and human emotions. Her books are like a merry-go-round—all cheerful music on the surface, but with ever-present ups and downs, the clanging merriment is mere overlay to an entertaining but sometimes stomach-churning ride....more",Notes are private!,0,0,0,not set,not set,"Feb 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26247008-truly-madly-guilty

I prefer reading to listening to stories, so I was surprised I loved the book as much as I did. I had less than six hours of round-trip drive time, but I got so drawn into the story, once I arrived home I lay in bed for several more hours to hear how it turned out. The idea of checking the book out of the library to finish it seemed wrong somehow. I am familiar with Joyce Maynard as she is a local Bay Area author whom I had met and seen give talks at the Lafayette library. Although this is maybe the second or third audio book I have listened to, I must say her rendition was impeccable and enhanced my experience. Not only did she give a flawless read--which I expect is the norm with modern editing, but her voice and intonations gave the story an up-close-and-personal feel which was all the more special. As for the book itself, this is a sweet, first-rate story featuring a flawed but endearing character (Helen McCabe) whose careless drinking one night cost her custody of her son, Oliver. It is also a cautionary tale of how Helen falls ""under the influence"" not only of alcohol, but of intoxicating people who purport to befriend her, but who are not what they appear to be. The story contains valuable lessons about how this can happen when a vulnerable person is in dire straits or (as is typical) enthralled by ""lifestyles of the rich and famous""--in this case, the fictional Havillands. Little by little, Helen all-too-willingly relinquishes control over her time, her personal life, even her son, in a willing exchange for the many ""goodies"" and ""favors"" the Havillands have to offer. In the meantime, she naively dismisses and discounts other genuine friendships (most notably, BFF, Alice and would-be suitor, Elliot) whose qualities and offerings aren't as ""dazzling"" as those of the Havillands.It is a sensitive, sad, and compelling tale with a lot of attention to detail. While some might say this slowed the pace too much, I found it captivating; it kept me rapt as it gave the story the richness of real life and gave me the ability to picture the scenes as if watching a movie.

Like a crime scene photo in a criminal trial, it is ugly to look at but impossible (and immoral) to turn away from. This book contains few, if any, “fluffy” vignettes that so typify today’s nonfiction. Rather than being “dumbed-down” to maximize sales to undereducated/oversaturated readers, Mr. Cotchett lays out all the cold, hard facts in an intelligent and unapologetic manner. Joseph W. Cotchett, a California “Super Lawyer” (see http://www.cpmlegal.com/attorneys-Jos...), pulls no punches exposing the systemic greed, corruption and theft that affect our daily lives, from our “bought” electorate to our tainted food supply. Other chapters cover health care fraud, Wall Street thuggery, the theft and misappropriation of our tax dollars, climate change/denial, Big Pharma, Big Oil, defense (mis)spending, the erosion of our privacy, and the lawyers who make all of the above possible. It is all rather dispiriting and overwhelming. And yet, if you care at all about the current state—and more importantly the future—of our nation and world, you must read this, cover to cover. Just as attorneys have to suffer through mandatory continuing education each year to keep our law licenses, readers should think of this book as mandatory continuing education for U.S. citizenship and global residency. In fact, The People vs. Greed should be required reading in every high school civics class (if there is such a thing) and citizenship application. It should be mailed to every registered voter in those awful voter information packets and handed out at every City Hall, DMV and other government office throughout the country. According to the author’s acknowledgments, all royalties from The People vs. Greed are donated to various nonprofit groups. So you can and should purchase this book with a noble conscience.If I could add my own subjective observations/suggestions for improvement for a second edition (and yes, go off on a bit of a tangent), they would be these:•	Include the vaccine debate in the chapter on Big Pharma greed. This merits a book unto itself, but many respectable studies have questioned the efficacy of vaccines and documented the increased potential for serious side effects from our rigorous early-childhood vaccination schedule. The United States has the highest number of mandated vaccines for children under five in the world (36, double the Western world average of 18), the highest autism rate in the world (1 in 150 children, 10 times or more the rate of some other Western countries), but only places 34th in the world for childhood mortality in children under five. (See http://www.rescuepost.com/files/gr-au....) Big Pharma’s influence on the CDC is now indisputable, as revealed by the documentary Vaxxed. Whether you believe that there is a connection between the childhood MMR vaccine and autism, whether you happily accept the CDC’s “fast tracking” of the Gardasil “vaccine” for Merck’s benefit, the fact remains that vaccinations are huge business and are given quite the “free pass” in this country, unlike in the rest of the developed world (see, e.g., http://healthimpactnews.com/2011/stud...). A National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (“Vaccine Court”) was set up in 1986 to grant immunity—no pun intended—to vaccine manufacturers in favor of a government reimbursement program for families whose children had serious side effects from vaccines. It has since awarded nearly $2 billion on 2,398 claims. Although this seems like an astounding figure, I am sure it is far less than jury verdicts would have been if class-action litigators like Mr. Cotchett had been allowed to pursue vaccine manufacturers directly on behalf of injured children. The CDC—a supposedly independent watchdog agency—accepts millions of dollars in gifts and funding from the pharmaceutical industry, and the former CDC director (Julie Gerberding) is now the head of Merck’s vaccine unit, among other high-profile, revolving-door conflicts of interest between Big Pharma and the public agencies tasked with regulating them (see http://articles.mercola.com/sites/art...). •	Address the for-profit prison-industrial complex and the attendant racism that makes America the #1 jailer in the world per capita. According to Wikipedia, in October 2013, “the incarceration rate of the United States of America was the highest in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population. While the United States represents about 4.4 percent of the world's population, it houses around 22 percent of the world's prisoners.” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_....) It is no coincidence that most of our human “prison inventory” consists of black and brown bodies. Read The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander. This is U.S. greed and racism at its ugliest. •	Now that we have all this awful information, offer suggestions as to what your average citizen can do. Vote? I vote in all major elections and many minor ones; I take the time to read the confounding and often thick voter booklets, Google the major issues, etc. But what good does any of that do if the people we vote for are greedy, dishonest, and in the pockets of our real leaders, corporate America? No wonder so many of us feel powerless and disgruntled. Even those politicians who start out somewhat well-intentioned are quickly spoiled like fruit left to rot in a bowl. Are term limits the answer? Perhaps. More regulation of big business? Perhaps. Frankly, I’d like to see our elected “leaders” doing the jobs we pay them to do and enforcing the laws we already have. Beyond that, we need a major overhaul of our political system to remove money from politics (let’s not hold our collective breath) and implement legal and financial restraints on big business to protect citizens from runaway Capitalism. I, like many of my fellow citizens, am at an utter loss as to what power we individually wield to avert the total and inevitable collapse of our nation—if not our planet—when we are up against these untouchable, unstoppable, and largely invisible forces. Although by all rational inference we seem doomed as a nation and a species, we are fortunate to have a few renegades like Joseph Cotchett to afford a glimmer of hope. Although Mr. Cotchett paints a bleak picture of the good old U.S. of A., he (and many other trial lawyers, I am sure) have dedicated their lives and careers to righting wrongs and plugging for the underdog. Yes, there is still faint hope that David can ultimately triumph against the Goliath of our American oligarchy. It has happened before and can happen again if “We the People” unite and make our voices heard. Politicians too often rouse our fear and hatred, in order to divide and manipulate us. The People vs. Greed exposes the bigger picture at play—the rampant greed and corruption throughout our government and major industries. We have essentially exonerated our leaders from all accountability, like neglectful parents unleashing their teenagers on their communities with a fat trust fund, unlimited cocaine, a hot rod with a full tank, and no curfew. There is much in this book we can agree on. Let’s put our collective differences aside, gain control over our electorate, and band together for the greater good of our country. Thank you, Mr. Cotchett, for this informative, important, and timely work....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 25, 2016","Aug 02, 2016","Jun 25, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30750442-the-people-vs-greed

Lubna Jahangiri does not shy away from the sThough its topic is disheartening, The Little Stepmother is an engrossing and ultimately uplifting story. Lubna Jahangiri does not shy away from the sad fact that young Middle Eastern girls are often married to much older men before they are old enough to give meaningful consent, or that women are silenced and threatened with the loss of their children and financial security—or worse—if they dare file for divorce.Jameela is one such woman. Married against her will at the age of twelve, she assumes second-class status as a second wife to middle-aged Abdul. She is forced to fend off his strident and jealous first wife and their children. Theirs is a chaotic and stifling household that slowly but steadily chips away at Jameela’s sense of self. The one bright spot in her life it that, unlike her mother before her (who was likewise married off at a too-young age), a condition of Jameela’s marriage was that Abdul pay for her education. This opened her mind and heart to the possibilities of life beyond the four walls that literally imprisoned her. Although her schooling provided a temporary respite from an otherwise insufferable life, Jameela “hits bottom” enough times to leave the reader wondering whether she will pick herself up or eventually go off the deep end.The Little Stepmother is not without its flaws, but they did not detract significantly from the overall story. This is a solid, very readable first novel that tackles an important subject matter with sensitivity and artistry. Too few Middle Eastern women are willing to advocate for women’s education and independence, and Lubna Jahangiri is to be commended for exposing the shameful practice of forced marriage. I understand the novel is loosely based on a true story, which makes it a must-read.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26489565-the-little-stepmother

Perhaps The Dinner Party isn't a ""life-altering"" read, but it's a quick and fun ride with lots of spirit to keep readers entertained and just enough substance to nourish the soul. The pacing starts out a bit slow as Sylvia prepares every last detail of the Golds' annual Passover Seder; I was afraid this was going to be another My Dinner with Andre. But thankfully there is much more to the story than that. This dysfunctional Jewish family proffers wonderful, subtle messages about why we do or don't like ""certain"" people and deem them more or less worthy of ourselves (and our children) than their social/ethnic underlings. Then they just as cleverly break down those barricades while barely budging their underlying prejudices. It wasn't exactly subtle, but neither was it clichéd. I'd say exactly the right balance was struck.I found every single character to be delightful in his or her own quirky way–even Sylvia. I laughed out loud so many times I lost count. The ending is delish–pure chocolate babka to those faux latkes presented in Seder #1. I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway.

If you’re familiar with the Australian TV series House Husbands, Joshua Braff’s ""take"" on the subject could easily become the U.S. adaptation.What I liked: The tender scenes between diarist Jay and his depressed son, Alex. The fact that the economic role reversal between Jay and wife Jackie is not a source of friction—Jay is secure enough in his manhood to appreciate his wife for who she is and what she brings to their family. He supports her work (which entails a good amount of travel) by functioning as the dedicated stay-at-home dad. I also found it a nice—as well as realistic—touch that Jay, as primary parent, is not so keen on the idea of making a third child, despite his wife’s claim that “someone is missing from their dinner table.” Finally, DD posits an arguable social angle about parents’ vs. children’s rights when it’s not in the best interests of a minor child to live with her parents or follow their misguided mandates.Not so Much: I found the character development to be somewhat flimsy. I would have liked to see the author focus more on the multiple causes of Alex’s depression (teenage “angst”/family history/the move to Florida, etc.) and less on the St. Petersburg “parental party scene.” Alex’s mental health and the parent/teen relationship are the grounding notes of this story, and are far more compelling than the numerous instances (and there are too many of them) where Jay “falls victim” to impromptu partying and drinking. In my world, responsible parents don’t run off to bars at the slightest twist of an arm—especially when, for all intents and purposes, they are functioning as single parent. Childhood friends and siblings don’t just “pop up” unannounced from several states’ distance and demand that you go out drinking with them. Rich divorcees don’t spontaneously open their homes to scores of parents and kids for flirtatious poolside antics. Maybe that’s the way they do things down in Florida, but personally, Jay’s vulnerability to such distractions lowered my respect for him.That said, The Daddy Diaries is a book you have to finish to fully appreciate. The funniest scenes are in the first third, and the most emotionally-charged ones appear toward the end. My daughter gave me this book for Christmas figuring I would like it, and she was right. All in all, it's a sensitive and worthwhile family drama by a fellow independent Bay Area author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 03, 2016","Jan 08, 2016","Dec 25, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25052190-the-daddy-diaries

My own mother and aunt and their two husbands lived in a similar setup in BrooklThe Two-Family House is an engaging, quick read I could not put down. My own mother and aunt and their two husbands lived in a similar setup in Brooklyn in the 1950s. After my parents moved to Queens, Long Island in 1958 to raise their growing family, we visited the two-family Brooklyn house each Christmas when I was a young child. There I witnessed an easy, open flow of activity and communication between my aunt’s and cousin’s respective families living upstairs and downstairs. Such was the nature of things between sisters-in-law and best friends Ruth and Helen—married to brothers Mort and Abe—until that fateful night when they gave birth simultaneously during “The Great Blizzard of 1947” (an historical storm that dumped over 25 inches of snow on New York City in less than 24 hours). Okay, I realize it’s a hoaky and unrealistic premise, but it is a necessary “suspension of disbelief” if we are to accept what transpires next: Mort and Ruth have only daughters, and Mort is gruff and resentful because he longs for a son. Conveniently, Abe and Helen have only sons. One of the women gives birth to another girl; the other, a boy—you see where this is going. The “Christmas-esque” birth-in-a-blizzard provides the obvious yet totally far-fetched foundation of this story. We, as readers, ""go along"" in order to experience how each of the characters implodes under the weight of the women's secret.Speaking of characters, even knowing the unspoken “spoiler” from go (it’s not difficult to figure out), Ruth is so perplexing, odious, and incomprehensible, she is perhaps the most fascinating of the lot. Mort can be flat and one-dimensional, whereas Helen and Abe are angelic to a fault. The four of them comprise a kitschy Motley crew. As for their collective brood of nine, other than Judith, Teddy and Natalie (who are the focal point at the child level), I couldn’t keep the offspring straight. When the author introduces in-laws Sol and Arlene and their son, Johnny (on Helen’s side) and Aunt Faye (on Ruth’s), I thought my head would explode—and that was before the kids grow up and start to marry, resulting in even more spouses and in-laws to keep track of. But the many well-paced ups and downs, spats and snubs, and one huge tragedy along the way glue the whole thing together and kept me hooked from beginning to end.My only other observation is the running monologue. Though the story ostensibly shifts point-of-view with each new chapter (as indicated by the chapter titles), this is a rather “tell-y” affair whose “voices” seem to blur into a single narrative by an all-knowing storyteller. It can become confusing at times—like the chapter where Abe tells what his wife, Helen, is smelling in the back seat of the car. I don’t know whether this was meant as a form of literary stylization or if the story needs further editing. Either way, despite this shortcoming, The Two-Family House “works” in a delightfully campy way that never falls flat or loses momentum.

I’m not sure whether it merits four or five stars, but only because it isn’t a great work of literature. The writing is fairly simple. But after abandoning Donna Tartt’s The Little Friend after 222 pages (of 658!), “great literature” wasn’t what I was looking for. The Good Father proves that not every tale must be told with brilliant prose in order to be great.And make no mistake, The Good Father is one heck of a story! Actually, it deftly interweaves three different but related and equally compelling subplots. Each of the three characters (Travis, Robin and Erin) has absorbed his or her own share of tragedy, and consequently is about as touching as any fictional character can be. In a plainspoken, almost simplistic way, The Good Father shows us what anyone might be capable of under desperate circumstances—in other words, what it means to be human. We all like to think, “Oh, I would never do that.” But you never know until you are faced with the situation—whether it be lack of money, a life-or-death health condition, or the devastating loss of a child. The Good Father does a beautiful job of showing how these three ordinarily people flounder and nearly fall when life seemingly turns against them.There were moments when I feared Ms. Chamberlain might veer into tired and trite territory, but thankfully she never does. Rather, The Good Father offers tried-and-true reminders about class and status, grief and healing, and the essence of enduring love. It’s a sweet yet gripping book that I couldn’t put down and highly recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 20, 2015","Oct 23, 2015","Sep 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13035050-the-good-father

I loved Middlesex but was somewhat disappointed by The Marriage Plot, his two subsequent works. Five sisters killing themselves is a rather macabre subject to tackle in a first novel. But given that teen suicide is all-too-prevalent, I figured, Why the hell not?Eugenides' writing is lyrical. But I had several problems with this book. Number one: The multiple first-person narration. Huh? I could maybe accept it as a bold artistic choice, except that it didn’t really work. Who were these boys, and why were they so enthralled with the Lisbon sisters? What qualifies these male classmates as a single amorphous group entitled to keep a running commentary on these girls’ lives? Why should we be interested in what they think? It was creepy and voyeuristic (perhaps this is precisely what Eugenides intended!). Secondly, if we are to accept that the Lisbon girls and their suicides so fascinated and obsessed these faceless boys for their entire lives, then we need to be given a reason to believe that premise. What elevated the five weirdo sisters to such superstar status? As they weren’t especially captivating, these oddballs would more likely be bullied or shunned. Was it Cecilia’s wedding gown? Lux’s rooftop escapades? Yes, their foibles were weird for sure, but not in a good or endearing way. All the while, the Lisbon’s decaying house provides an apt-if-trite metaphor of their collective suffering and decay. Finally, while the writing can be labeled superb in one sense, the dismal narrative was over-the-top from the more practical perspective of delivering a readable novel. The repeated attempts at poetry quickly grew tiresome. By the time I made it to the boys’ climactic tree house convocation on page 202, I was spent—with four of five suicides yet to go! I pictured the lot of them—lanky, overgrown teen boys piling into a soggy, sagging tree house to better spy on the troubled girls at eye level, a creepy culmination of their misguided obsession.There is no issue as to Jeffrey Eugenides’ talent as a writer, but in my opinion, this novel falls short in the simple storytelling department as there is no real story. The Virgin Suicides offers no insight into the motivation for the girls’ actions, choosing instead to focus on the boys’ juvenile collective masturbatory fantasy. (Even the title is telling: At least one of the daughters was clearly not a virgin.) Perhaps it is simply a matter of taste, but I found the story to be pointless and not especially engaging. Four stars because objectively, I give Jeffrey Eugenides well-deserved props for artful writing. And I learned more than I ever wanted to know about fish flies....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 14, 2015","Sep 26, 2015","Sep 14, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10956.The_Virgin_Suicides

The Rest of Her Life shows us how, from one minute to the next, one error in judgment—a teeny, tiny moment of inattention—can profoundly alter so many lives forever. I found both the plot and characters to be intelligent, moving and utterly convincing.Distracted by a stray dog, eighteen-year-old Kara Churchill accidentally hits and kills a pedestrian in a crosswalk while driving her parents’ Suburban SUV. The victim, Bethany Cleese, is a fellow neighborhood teen being raised by a single mom. One beloved young life is irretrievably lost, but many, many others are deeply affected. Although Kara’s punishment will likely be light (a reckless driving charge), Kara is hell-bent on punishing herself to the max. She withdraws, stops eating, and sinks into a deep depression while her father tries to do “damage control.” Gary Churchill orders the family not to talk to anyone—not even their closest friends, mother-daughter duo Eva (the town gossip) and Kara’s best friend, Willow. Gary’s all about lawyers, insurance, and making sure Kara avoids jail and starts college in the fall on schedule as if nothing happened. Kara’s mom, Leigh (from whose point of view this story is told) processes the tragedy quite differently. She becomes obsessed with Bethany’s mother, Diane, and grows increasingly desperate to finagle Diane’s forgiveness even as the dents in her own relationship with Kara become all-the-more evident under the weight of her family’s sudden misfortune. To Leigh, Kara’s carelessness offers proof to the entire small town of Danby, Kansas that she has failed as a mother. She is reminded of something Jackie Kennedy once said: “If you bungle raising your children, I don’t think whatever else you do matters very much.” Damning herself, Leigh concludes that “despite her best intentions, apparently, she’d somehow bungled raising her daughter. Now that Kara had bungled too, it was true—nothing else seemed to matter.”Although on the surface, The Rest of Her Life is about a fatal accident, Leigh’s realization about her maternal inadequacy is what gives this story its beating heart. As the narrative progresses, we slowly learn why Leigh has had such a difficult time with motherhood: She was abandoned by her own mother as a 16-year-old, left to live in a trailer with her hapless if kind-hearted older sister (herself a young single mom), and basically had to grope her way through life in order to become a teacher and form a stable family as an adult. The Rest of Her Life reveals just how difficult it is to parent a child when one has had defective (or no) parenting herself. Understanding intellectually that her mom did the best she could given how she was raised did little to heal Leigh’s festering emotional wounds. Even though Leigh could dance circles around her own self-absorbed, clueless mother, she has difficulty connecting with others—including her own family, and slowly comes to realize that, despite her best efforts to be a different sort of parent than her mom, her own daughter simply doesn’t like her. At this crucial time when she most wants to comfort and connect with Kara, she is blocked at every turn. Stomach-clenching scenes are abundant throughout this novel, but the clumsy mother-daughter standoffs are perhaps the most heartbreaking in their authenticity; they certainly struck a nerve with me. A well-rounded cast of nuanced secondary characters—including younger son Justin; sister Pam; Eva and her daughter, Willow; Cynthia Tork (the book-censoring mom of one of Leigh’s students); and especially Bethany’s mom, Diane—pepper this already compelling tale with thorny complexity as Leigh grapples with her day-to-day connections and commitments. After all, no matter the pain we might be suffering inside, life marches on all around us. Though I am perhaps in the minority in finding Laura Moriarty's novel to be the rare gem that left me emotionally spellbound, in this reader's humble opinion, The Rest of Her Life is a truly extraordinary book deserving of five stars. I would give it six if I could. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 30, 2015","Sep 02, 2015","Aug 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/566850.The_Rest_of_Her_Life

An exclusive birthday party for one Katsumi Hosokawa is hosted by the vice president of a fictional Latin American country. In attendance are a potpourri of international diplomats and business dignitaries. The feature entertainment is the great opera diva Roxane Coss, who has everyone under her spell—until the vice president’s mansion is taken over by a pack of guerrilla terrorists whose aim is to take the president hostage. But the joke is on them, because the president elected to forego this shindig in favor of staying home to watch his favorite telenovela, Maria. A hilarious premise to kick off this delightful adventure.Ann Patchett weaves a gripping tale of broken barriers and unlikely attachments. Few of the characters share the same language (they communicate through the birthday boy’s translator and right-hand man, Gen). And yet, they all understand Roxane Coss’s irrepressible language of music. You can practically hear the operatic notes rising from the pages. Over time, both the hostages and their captors come to understand a deeper, quieter language than words—the immediacy of the here and now; of interdependence and play; of seizing each and every moment. And then, connections, affections, and unspoken understandings that took months to cultivate are torn asunder in about two minutes in a climactic and bittersweet finale. (I could have perhaps lived without the unlikely epilogue, but hey, nothing in life is without its flaws.)I probably would have never picked up this book had a friend not recommended it and passed her copy along, but I am so glad I did.

I feel “lucky”—or I should say honored—to have read it. I thought I had a fair understanding of how rape affects victims, but after reading this book, I feel humbled by how little I really knew. Ms. Sebold opens with a graphic, blow-by-blow depiction of the rape itself. From there, she describes with painful honesty how being raped affected her, how beyond the PTSD, it “tainted” her, like a communicable disease.The treatment Ms. Seibold received in the aftermath of this crime will make you flinch, from police officers (one of whom, speaking of his niece who had likewise been a rape victim, cried, “She’s ruined! Ruined!"") to her own psychiatrist (who had the audacity to say, “Well, I guess that will make you less inhibited about sex now, huh?”).I don’t know whether a memoir can contain “spoilers”. (view spoiler)[If so, then I suppose the subsequent rape of Ms. Sebold’s college housemate, perhaps as revenge for her having criminally prosecuted her attacker, could be labeled as such. With that second heinous crime, Ms. Sebold was silently and indirectly blamed; she lost her closest friend and supporter. After having the guts and determination to prevail against her rapist in court to have him locked up, the losses just kept piling on. (hide spoiler)]More than anything, this book shows just how much is lost—what is really taken from a woman when she is raped. The notion that some men would use their penises and strength to rob a woman of her very personhood, her right to feel secure in her skin, is infuriating to me, as it should be to anyone. Ms. Seibold found an outlet for this fury in her poetry, which triggered a cascade of reactions among her college classmates. Ms. Sebold’s bravery in pursuing her attacker is a story in itself. The fact that she wasn’t dressed “provocatively” and was a virgin at the time of the rape played well in her favor, which is its own travesty as neither of these things should matter. But even with those so-called “advantages”, she was subjected to a grueling and humiliating cross-examination designed to weaken her resolve and chip away at her confidence. Those courtroom scenes were painful to read; I wanted to kill the defense attorney. I would place this book in the category of “must-read” due to the importance of its subject matter for both men and women; its raw honesty; and the underlying hope and radiance of spirit it conveys. In the end, it was an uplifting, if bittersweet story and I thank Ms. Sebold for her courage in sharing it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 28, 2015","Oct 31, 2015","Aug 22, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/82970.Lucky

Three stars for an engrossing story in its own right, and a bonus one for shedding light on the thorny topic of campus date rape, to boot.It’s tricky pulling off a work of fiction that tackles a difficult social issue. Again and Again deftly moves between the present day, more-troubled-than-it-appears relationship between protagonist Deborah Borenstein and her D.C. campaign consultant husband, Aaron; and her early relationship with her college roommate, Liddie Golmboch, at Danforth University. One evening in 1978, before we had a name for such things, Deborah walks in on her roommate being date-raped by a handsome, well-to-do frat boy. Without giving away too many spoilers, suffice it to say that neither a credible eye-witness nor the many Polaroids Deborah took of Liddie’s injuries would be sufficient to prove that this wasn’t a “classic case” of morning-after hook-up regret. After all, other frat brothers had seen Liddie drinking with Will Quincy and making out with him at a party earlier that evening. She’d even invited him back to her room—for a book, according to her (“Yeah, right”).Now a top figure in “Breaking the Silence”—an organization dedicated to fighting sexual violence against women, Deborah finds herself at odds with hubby Aaron, who is campaign manager for the candidate running against—who else?—Will Quincy, campus rapist cum pro-choice supporter of women’s issues who is vying for the open Delaware senate seat. Although the college rape and lack of vindication had all but derailed Liddie (who as an adult is happily ensconced in Wisconsin with her veterinarian husband, leading a quiet life making quilts), Liddie’s refusal to “go public,” and Deborah’s support of that decision, is driving a wedge between the seemingly egalitarian D.C. couple.While as a feminist and the mother of a teen daughter, I don’t doubt the legitimacy of Liddie being affected by PTSD after having been a victim of this insidious crime, as a reader of fiction, I couldn’t help wanting to root for an underdog-turned-pit bull out for vengeance, or—failing that—at least get inside the victim’s head. I found myself growing frustrated with Liddie’s diffidence throughout nearly the entire story, as well as the sometimes syrupy relationship between her and Deborah while Liddie remained consistently in the background. Though engaging, I think this book might have packed a bolder “punch” if told—at least in part—from Liddie’s point of view. Deborah as the lone (if plucky) heroine just slightly missed the mark for me; her marital, career and family issues and her husband’s conflicting career aspirations weakened and at times eclipsed the focal point of this story—i.e., stopping a known rapist from becoming a U.S. senator. That said, this is a satisfying read by an author who obviously knows what she is talking about. Ellen Bravo is described as a “lifelong activist” who is currently the executive director for Family Values @ Work, a network of state coalitions working for family-friendly policies.

At least that’s my take on it.Though I enjoyed the familiar California setting, as some ers aptly pointed out, nothing of particular note happens in this story. The goings-on are all pretty “lightweight.” The story shifts between the kids’ childhood and the present day, and I found the childhood chapters to be rather dry. That, combined with the flitting points of view (following no rhyme or reason that I could discern) made it impossible for me to connect to any of these characters. I liked the dad best, even though he was somewhat detached, because he obviously cared deeply for his kids. The mom, Penny, is portrayed as rather unlikeable, but she is the more interesting character study in that she poses questions about the oddball psychology of an “artist.” I found myself wondering, what makes someone a true “artist” (as opposed to a slacking, self-centered F-up)? And is being an “artist” utterly incompatible with parenthood (or, in this case, motherhood)? It almost seems to me that if this family were more genuinely supportive of Penny’s creative aspirations, and less tied to expectations about how family life should be, there might have been a different outcome. Although, as far as families go, the actual outcome didn’t seem all that terrible or noteworthy to me. Which makes me ask, what exactly is the point of this story?  I suppose the expectations placed on Penny as a mother of four children, and her falling short of those expectations (because she’d rather be out in her shed pasting cellophane noodle wrappers to backer-board—or whatever she did out there) made her a terrible mother, especially to James. Bill (the father) was a pediatrician who supported the family financially and hence could not pick up the domestic slack. James (the “problem child”) was an interesting character, but it seemed to me that he acted the way many “normal”-if-rambunctious boys do (though by today’s standards, he’d be labeled “ADHD” and put on some type of medication). James grows up to be the “black sheep,” the odd man out—a drifter who cannot find his footing and is always somewhat “lost” in life. But even James wasn’t so outlandish a character as to be particularly engaging. So what if he didn’t have a career? So what if he moved from place to place? Must we all be cookie-cutter followers down the path of college-marriage-family? Or, like Penny, was James’s problem simply a matter of him deliberately failing to live up to his family’s expectations? I usually like stories about dysfunctional families. The Children’s Crusade was mildly entertaining but a puzzling read. Maybe it just went over my head.
