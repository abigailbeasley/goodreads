It is the story of Virginia Hall, who really had an amazing life as a spy and part of the French Resistance in WW2. An American woman who was undervalued by the US State Department, and who eventually gets a position with the British Intelligence agency and is sent over to France to try and start a Resistance unit. She does an amazing job, recruits some wonderful people (both nuns and prostitutes) to be a part of the unit. Has an innate feel for her job, and did I mention that she had her one leg amputated due to a hunting accident! Wonderful story, but for me the writing and editing was mediocre. Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street, not 64 Baker as stated in the book. Also there are lots of filler that has no supporting research because Virginia did not keep a diary of her life due to the sensitive nature of her work. I also felt the book plodded along, especially when there were such dynamic events happening with Virginia.

Chikodi AnunobWhat a unique and fascinating novel set in Nigeria, which to me has definite words of wisdom for those of us here in the United States. Chikodi Anunobi has written a wonderful book that takes an inside look at corruption that has plagued the country of Nigeria for decades. He takes pain to tell us that not all Nigerians are corrupt or dishonest, and he's correct but unfortunately the power elite rely on this corruption, greed and power to rule this country, and to keep it from becoming a truly unified nation. This is the story as told by Bonaventure Angila who was from the Kwenzu tribe of Nigeria, and about his rise to power until his eventual downfall years later. Bona tells us how he initially fell into the easy way of getting ahead: by bribing a school official so he could become a student mentor. Things snowballed from that initial realization that it was easier to get ahead by bribery than by hard work. Not that he does not work hard, Bona is a fine student, and eventually gets his degree and becomes an integral part of helping the political powers that be remain in power as well as collecting untold wealth. These people have their fingers in every Nigerian business, and in particular the Off-OPEC oil that they personally sold in order to reap billions of dollars for their personal gain. It's a cautionary tale of someone who gets caught up in each and every revolution in the country and always lands on his feet, because of his knowledge and what he can do with the money and the hidden assets. But eventually Bona is arrested as those people who were supposedly his friends and protectors turned upon him, because they were afraid that Bona would turn on them. In prison has ag enuine change of heart and mind, and eventually writes a story about his life. By the end this turns out to be not just a story of Bona, but a discourse on culture, cultural diversity and cultural assimilation. Is a thought-provoking book because even though the United States is not tribal in nature we are a country of multiple cultures and how these cultures must blend in order to become one cohesive unit. This is a wonderful novel, that is a short simple read, and grabs your attention from page 1. It is a book that most of us should read, and not just as cautionary tale of what has happened in Nigeria, but what could happen right here in the United States.

Well, it's not Agatha Christie to put it mildly, but Benjamin Stevenson has come up with an ingenious way of having a murder occur on a train, which is hosting an Australian book fair in which five mystery writers are featured. Who did the murder, how did it occur? There are plenty of brains that could be looking into this, which is a variation of a locked room mystery. It is given in the first person narrator form of ""Author"" Ernest Cunningham, who, apparently published a prior book about murders in his family, but has since then developed writers block and it's on this train expedition to flash out a new book. But instead of something from the inner workings of his mind the new book, which is this book, now is what happened on that train ride through the heart of Australia. The first half of the book was extremely slow and tedious reading for me, as the author introduced all his characters and gave us sufficient background that we should be able to solve the mystery. But when he tells us early on that he has mentioned the name of the killer, 106 times by the time the killer is revealed, it's just sort of an overkill. You see Cunningham is actually writing this book from a hospital bed after the event has ended. It's sort of ingenious, but the same time I could not get for about the first 60% of the book, after that thing started to move, because one murder always leads to a murder. There are suspects, some of whom are authors, maybe a publisher, how about a literary agent or fans who are on the train? As I say, it is certainly a unique take on the typical locked room mystery by having it on a train, but there's just something missing in this book, and because of that no more than a three star from me....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Mar 04, 2024","Mar 18, 2024","Mar 04, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/166998871-everyone-on-this-train-is-a-suspect

Despite being book 6 of the series it is pretty easy to pick up the characters and the plot is interesting. As with the other books in this series, the setting is the small town of Stony Beach, Oregon, and specifically the Victorian estate of Windy Corner and which is owned by the narrator Emily Cavanaugh. Emily and her husband Luke have just returned from their honeymoon in England when her half brother Oscar asked if she can host his wedding. This certainly seems to set Emily into a tither, but she is willing to do anything for Oscar, even if this entails having a house full of guests and booking a local church as well as paying for some of the repairs that need to be done on the church due to a recent storm.. Add to that crew, the artisan who is repairing the stained glass window at the church, along with his wife and son, who have no place to stay other than with Emily. And then we have moses, Valerie and his foster daughter Charlotte who are on the run from a out of control social worker named Janine Vertue. Yes, it is a crazy household combo made all of the crazier by the fact that Oscar and his fiancé show up and just a few days later the fiancé's parents arrive to stay with them. It is a full house and eventually there is a murder as social worker Janine Vertue is found dead in her hotel room. Shockingly, many of the individuals who are staying with Emily have a to Janine, and nobody has anything but bad thoughts about her. In addition two sinister characters come in from Portland, and try to take Charlotte from Emily's house. All of this just gives us a host of possible murderers to choose from. Emily's husband, Luke, is a member of the police force, but even he can't crack the case without some help from Emily herself. Yes, it is a cozy mystery that will keep you guessing. As for the title, Janine is found hanging in her hotel bathroom, and one of Emily's friends is reading a book by Victor Hugo.

Unfortunately, so many of these books deal with five or six teams, You know who they are: Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Giants, and Red Sox. They predominate the bookstores and media s. So when this book crossed my desk, I was intrigued. A story about baseball, and World War I, a story about members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, who served in Europe, and not just in Europe, or part of the chemical warfare service. This is a something you don't usually read about. It's a good story. And it details the history of seven baseball players or executives who served in the AEF. Granted there many other people who served in the war in that branch of the army, but Jim Leek is a baseball historian. A member of the beloved baseball research group known as SABR he specializes in digging deep into many aspects of the game and its players that have gone either unnoticed or forgotten. And he hit upon a winning formula here as we learn about these players, but also about chemical warfare and history. If you're looking for scintillating prose, you're not going to get it in this book, but instead, you're going to get very good information about people such as Eppa Rixey, who was a chemistry major in college before he began his professional career, and who eventually became part of the chemical warfare service. You read about the attempts to get Christy Mathewson to represent the YMCA in France to lift the spirits of the troops, Instead, he eventually goes over to France and is a member of this chemical warfare service, as a matter fact, is one of the people who trained our troops to how to survive chemical warfare. Also, there is Thai Cobb, who is happy to be drafted and wanted to go to Europe to fight. Baseball executive Branch Rickey is also part of the contingent, as is former baseball manager and broadcaster Gabby Street. It's an interesting book filled with facts about the war, information on the chemical warfare service that I had no idea about until I read this book, and some fascinating insights as to these ballplayers and others, The book may not be about those well publicized, baseball teams that saturate the market, but instead, you read about real human beings, who lived in a different time, and when the time came to serve their country, they were there on the front lines in Europe, in one of the most dangerous jobs you could undertake....more",Notes are private!,2,29,1,"Feb 23, 2024","Mar 18, 2024","Feb 23, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/86546574-the-gas-and-flame-men

Finkel is a fine writer but even he really cannot get a whole lot more out of Stephane other than the fact that Stephane swipes Finkel's laptop with a swift ease that Finkel had no idea it was happening. It just shows how adept Stephane was and how he was able to quickly steal over 300 priceless objects from museums throughout Europe. But he was unable to get any new info from Stephane's girlfriend and mother, both of whom blatantly lied during the two trials arising from these thefts. He places little blame, does not really give us more insights into the 80+ pieces still not found, and seems to be more at awe of Stephane than the ridiculous judicial proceedings that gave slaps on the wrist instead of severe penalties. A system that believed Stephane would not go back to his criminal ways upon release (he did numerous times and the penalties were not that severe), and a system that employs people to solve art crimes but until 2023 had no really meaningful punishment.

Wasserman casts her considerable talents on this St. Patrick's Day fire at the Windsor Hotel in New York City in 1899; The research in compiling this book is impeccable and the book is filled with Historical figures who either stayed at the Windsor, were associated with the Windsor or helped into the investigation into the cause of the fire which remains unsolved 125 later. This massive blaze that happened as the St. Patrick's Day parade neared the building, killed over 85 people, of which 41 were never identified. It was a massive conflagration that seemed to come from out of nowhere, and Wasserman through her characters provides us possible reasons for the fire (all of which were considered by the authorities at one time). Was it a ring of thieves aided by the hotel maids, was it started by a cigar ash that caused a dining room curtain to burst into flames. Anarchists who were trying to kidnap President McKinley's brother? Maybe it started in the basement while the workers were out watching the parade or an electric iron that was never properly turned off, or that it was it just an old flammable building that complied with the 1873 building code that was outdated?

How newspaper reports were contradictory, how eyewitnesses and even survivors of the fire were not really sure what happened as memories blurred and peoples actions were questioned.

There's not a lot of action, but rather a lot of contemplation and discussion about the political and military classes in Venice and Italy. The book centers around the death of a 17-year-old boy in a Military Academy in Venice. Everyone is sure it was a suicide, but there was no suicide note, and, the boy had given no external indication of being unhappy or dismayed leading up to his death. Inspector Brunetti is on the case and something just does not seem right to him, so he keeps looking into possible external reasons for the boys death. Brunetti ponders the fate of Venice, Italian politics, the military, and these military academies, that aremtraining of young people, to think and act the same way as their forefathers. All the students in this Academy are children of either rich politicians or military leaders so they continue to create a class of individuals who feel they are above and beyond regular citizens as well as the law. as the book goes on, we find out that the young man's parents are separated, that his mother had been shot in the leg two years previously, that his sister is nowhere to be found, and that things just don't quite add up. His father had been a crusading politician and nobody wants that in Italy because no one wants to stop the corruption or the graft that keeps the country running. As I said one of my favorite books, and like most all of Donna Lyons works nothing ever is tied up with a neat ribbon at the end of the book. Was it suicide, was it murder, is there justice, and is there just more of the same that is beginning to drag, and wear upon Brunetti?

This book follows the dual timeline of World War I and the first class of females at the US Naval Academy in 1976. in 1918 Emmaline Balakin is working at the Dead Letter Office of the US Postal System, and stumbles upon a letter from a former friend of hers, who is now serving in France during the war. She eventually becomes a librarian, and it shipped overseas where she is part of the effort to bring books to the soldiers. While there she finds that her friend is one of the wounded soldiers at the hospital where she is working. She is shocked by the horrors of the war, by the segregation among the wounded and hospitalized, and tries to bring joy and happiness to these individuals, through books, despite all the perils of being near the front line. She makes friends with another young lady named Nellie who is a Red Cross volunteer who helps Emmaline navigate the system while she's over there, as well as teaching her how to drive. In 1976 Kathleen Carrie is part of the first group of female midshipman at the US Naval Academy, and is the granddaughter of Nellie. We follow Kathleen as she is subjected to all types of hazing and harassment at the Academy. Many of the male midshipman do not wish to have females in the Academy, and do anything possible to intimidate them, including trying to have them dismissed from the Academy for treasonous behavior. But there is a secret from World War I, that will impact Kathleen in her attempt to be part of the first class of female midshipmentat the US Naval Academy.

Marko Zorn is a Washington DC homicide detective who many times does work outside of the police department, and not always following the rules of the police department. The book begins with a horrific car fire in which an individual has been locked inside a car that was deliberately set on fire and his horrible death was a shock to everyone’s system. From there, we discover that the deceased may have been connected with an illegal drug called Speedball, which is an offshoot of a prescription drug and which has extremely dangerous and deadly effect to anyone who takes it. The pharmaceutical company is owned and controlled by a pair of sinister, twin brothers, who have built an evil empire that basically keeps them out of range of any regulatory agency, governmental officials or law enforcement agencies. They own a security company who's not afraid to kill, even if it's one of their own people. As I said, this is a fast reading book, and it takes us to many different locales as we have the daughter of the new police chief of Washington DC being kidnapped when Marko gets too close to investigating to the deaths related to the company and Speedball. While this is the third book in the series, you don’t need to read the first two to follow the action, and there is action galore. If you are a fan of action, adventure, and thrillers then this is a book that is right up your alley. Zorn does whatever he can to bring down the empire the twins only to have a potential shocking twist at the very end, and which just leaves us to believe that the author is not yet finished with this pharmaceutical saga....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 16, 2024","Jan 19, 2024","Jan 16, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/125636440-firetrap

Most of us are aware of the Monuments Men because of the book by Robert Edsel, as well as the movie, but those basically concentrated on northern Europe and what was going on in Germany. Less attention has been paid to the Herculean efforts by the men and women behind the scenes trying to save the great masterpieces of Italy. As with most of Morelli’s books she gives us a dual perspective as half the book is narrated by Eva Brunner, a German photographer who has been sent to Florence to document the efforts by the Nazi too “save and preserve” the masterpieces of Florence and Italy. And then we also get to follow Josephine Evans, an American WAC who has become so proficient at her stenography that she is selected to accompany two different art historians and experts in their attempt to retrieve and preserve these same works of art. The book is filled with historical characters, and this fills the book with the realism that one needs to understand what was happening in Italy near the end of the war. Eva begins documenting all the artwork that she encounters in Florence and then accompanies the German Art Institute personnel to photograph these works of art as they're being moved to various locations in Italy. She eventually comes to the realization that the Germans are not preserving these for the Italians, but rather to take back to Germany where her father is actually in charge of one of the leading salt mines where masterpieces are being stored. Josie, who knows nothing about art to begin with, eventually becomes attached to works and comes to understand their importance to the citizens of Florence, Tuscany, and mankind. She becomes part of the rescue efforts to locate these paintings at the very northern border of Italy and Austria, and to make sure that they do not disappear forever. If you don't know much about the Italian version of the Monuments Men then this is the book you want to read to fill you in on the history, but it's also a book that explores the human side of art and how fluid and dangerous the situation had become in Italy after the Italians no longer fell under the control and domination of the Nazis and we're now working either overtly or covertly with the Allies. Morelli's book is fast-paced, action-packed, and filled with relatable characters.

He is so caught up in this challenge that he does not really pay attention to his wife and children who have a longing to return to DC. A few months after their move to Seattle, Aaron's friend Otis comes to the house a Divination Tray as a housewarming present. They joke that is is sort of like an African Ouija Board, but nobody really wants to ""play"" with the Divination Board but eventually agree to ask a few questions of the Board. Unfortunately, nobody knew that this board can activate a portal to the land of the light, the dead, and that gray area in between known as the Shadowlands. Days later strange sounds are heard in the house, and both children are frightened by ghosts. Again, Aaron pays not attention, and eventually both children disappear. Where did they go, are they alive or dead, and only later does Aaron come to realize they were taken by forces into the Shadowlands, and now it is up to Aaron with the help of Voodoo Princess, Urbi, to find the children and try to retrieve them to the world of the living..

This is a book that combines art and history and keeps us on the seat of our pants the entire time as we try to find out the mysteries behind a painting that may in fact have been the last and lost Van Gogh painting created by that master. This is the second book that features Luke Perrone and Alexis Verde, both of whom are children of art thieves, but they have not followed in there parents footsteps, but rather they are on the trail to find and discover mysteries regarding the world of art. As a lover of art and art history this book is a gem, as it is filled with meticulous detail about artworks, their location, the history behind these pieces, as well as the death of Vincent Van Gogh. While not a history book, the book delves into his death and the alternate theory that Van Gogh did not commit suicide, as well as the theory that one of his last paintings was placed near his coffin and mysteriously disappeared after his burial. It's that painting, and that history that the author uses to perfection to weave a tail regarding the location of the painting, and how it eventually turned up in an antique gallery in upstate New York. Not only do we follow Luke and Alexis, but we also follow the trail of the painting, a painting that was disguised to be smuggled out of France. And once the painting was discovered by Luke and Alexis, they immediately lose it and now the story takes us from New York to Amsterdam on the trail of the painting and nothing is as it seems in this mystery or in the world of art. It is a marvelous work, one that keeps you guessing, as there are allies, predators and enemies galore with everyone wanting to get their hands on the lost Van Gogh.

People, for years, have turned to alternate medicines or alternate attempts to treat these problems and it is their plight that is highlighted in this new book by Jacqueline Alnes. Jacqueline, herself, was a college athlete when she was struck down by a mysterious medical condition that none of the doctors could cure. They ran her through batteries of tests with no positive results. She could no longer run, she could barely walk, she couldn't eat she couldn't speak at times, and yet at other times things mysteriously got slightly better before another setback. This is all detailed in “The Fruit Cure” a book which tells the tale of a normal college girl who no longer can function in society, as well as all those others who have had issues or ailments or beliefs that lead them away from normal patterns of living, lifestyle, and eating. Many have become either proponents or followers of those who have preached the gospel of vegetarianism, fruitarianism and the drastic change to their lives, all in an attempt to solve the mysteries that modern science cannot unravel. Jacqueline takes us to Banana Island along with some rather unique individuals who go by the name Freelee and Durianrider and who used the Internet and YouTube to expound their beliefs that eating 30 Bananas a Day will cure you of your medical problems. They preached that eating nothing but bananas and raw food will cure you. That meat and fats are poison and that anything other than what they believe in will cause you harm. The author traces the history of vegetarianism, fruitarianism and takes us on a journey that is most fascinating and educational as we get to read some of the actual transcripts of the YouTube messages and see how body shaming also plays a big part in causing people going to the extreme in order to lose weight. While the author never completely adapted to the 30 Banana a Day diet, she admittedly began to change her eating patterns and behavior, none of which cured her medical condition. Eventually the author was able to lead a normal life, is now a college professor, and therefore has approached this subject in a clinical manner. I appreciated this approach to these issues because I think that is the best way to explore all that was 30 Bananas a Day, fruitarianism and “The Fruit Cure”. 3.5 ***...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Dec 12, 2023","Jan 04, 2024","Dec 12, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/125092686-the-fruit-cure

It was the year that Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella consolidated their conquest of Spain by overrunning Granada which led to the expulsion of the Moors. But few of us know that it was also in 1492 that those same rulers, Ferdinand and Isabella, expelled the Jews from Spain, a location where they had lived for over 1500 years. It's that expulsion, as well as the ensuing difficulties, that first time author eric Weintraub features in historical fiction novel, South of Sepharad. Weintraub captures the shock, horror and dismay of the Jewish community as seen through the eyes of physician Vidal ha-Rofeh, and his family. It is through their eyes that we see the results of the expulsion, as the Jewish population was given three months a free passage to leave the country, and that failure to leave or convert to Catholicism would result in death. Vidal realizes that his future is tied to that of his faith and refuses to convert to Catholicism, even though his oldest daughter has already converted to Catholicism years previously when she married a Catholic gentleman. The family is split, should they stay in Granada or should they leave with the rabbi who is taking them to the coast of Spain to eventually make their way to fez which is in Morocco. Vidal will beg his daughter, Catalina, to come with them but she refuses and stays with her husband especially since she is now pregnant with their child. This is a journey that the members of the Jewish community must take from Granada to Malaga Spain where they will hopefully find transport to North Africa. Eventually a caravan of about 200 people set out across the dry and parched area and the caravan is beset by all sorts of mishaps the least of which is they've run out of water. Forced to sell all their possessions while in Granada, for pennies on the dollar, the caravan struggles to make it to the coast and when it does the struggles continue. Meanwhile Catalina gives birth to a baby boy but also has the legitimacy of her conversion questioned by the priests in the inquisition. It was a bad time for anyone who used to be a Jew living in Spain and we get to see all the difficulties that Vidal and his family suffered through as they attempt to make it to the sea and hopefully define freedom to live, work and worship in fez. This is a very fine first time novel which has well drafted characters, a plot that comes directly from history and expands our knowledge as to the horrors that anyone who was not a Catholic would face if they lived in Spain once Ferdinand and Isabella consolidated their power. This book is not so much about religion as it is about suffering and attempting to overcome adversity. I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, historical fiction, and history and makes me eagerly await the next novel from this gifted writer....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 08, 2023",Jan 2024,"Dec 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/190108419-south-of-sepharad

A group of 4 men, all who now live in exile are the alleged President and representatives of the Confederate States of America. They come to our intrepid enquiry agents to secure a meeting with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain. Barker is able to do this and they produce alleged treaties and documents to prove their claim. Barker and Llewelyn are caught in the middle as many top British officials do not trust them, nor does the Confederate delegation. Much of the book deals with trying to find out the legitimacy of the delegation, what their real purpose is to come and request the ship, and the efforts of the British & American governments to keep this ship out of the hands of the purported Confederate leaders. Filled with fascinating facts (the Trent Affair) as well as Llewelyn's certainty that alleged President of the Confederacy is none other than Jesse James, and another delegate is John Wilkes Booth, this book that is set in 1894 brings light to the conspiracy theories surrounding the deaths of those two scoundrels. While many of our favorite characters are either missing in this book or confined to cameo appearances, the book captivates and makes us wonder as to the legitimacy of the documents and the real identity of the delegation members. As with all his books, Will Thomas takes us on a whirlwind tour of Victorian London, and proves once again why he himself is the legitimate successor to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as the fact that Barker & Llewelyn are equal to, if not even superior to Holmes & Watson.

He is a math savant and can see patterns and numbers others cannot. People win huge amounts of money based on his ability to move the odds at the right time.

Airships (blimps) had their heydays in the early 19th century and here author S.C Gywnne gives us a really good overview of the history of the airship industry, which really gets started with Count Von Zeppelin in Germany whose failed airship adventure became a source of German pride, so much so that his next airship was funded by private donations! Yes, there was Zeppelin-mania over in Germany. From there we see those airships used to bomb London and England in WW1 and how they were allegedly banned by the Treaty of Versailles - fascinating look at how the Germans got around that! But now the British are interested in Airships and were far behind the Germans in both experience and technology and developed many airships in the 1920 that ended in tragic failures. But one of the offshoots of the Treaty of Versailles is that the British Empire was greatly expanded, and even though a decision had been made to discontinue their manufacture and use, Lord Thomson, one of the leaders of the Socialist Party, wanted to use these airships to float among the regions of the British Empire. Yes he wanted to connect London with the Middle East, India, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and convinced Parliament to restart airship production. R-101 was still an experimental ship, and we get to see all the issues and problems that beset this airship, problems that are too numerous to list in detail. Suffice it that this disaster in 1930 was because of one man's ego, as well as his desire to become Viceroy of India. Instead this airship, that had never been fully tested sets out in stormy weather which never gets better, and within a day it has crashed killing everyone onboard except the lucky six who survived. This is a riveting account of the history of airships, their use, assumed potential and all that went wrong with not just the R-101 but so many other airships that were used during this era. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Nov 05, 2023","Nov 18, 2023","Nov 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62919779-his-majesty-s-airship

Once again, Osman proves he is at the top of his game as he treats us to his usual assortment of seniors who assist the police in solving crimes. Elizabeth is the leader, Joyce her friend and diarist, Ron the former union leader and Ibrahim who is a psychogist. Here we have one of their friends, an antique dealer, who is murdered after he is given an old box filled with heroin. The dealer is dead, and the box with the heroin is missing. They care less about the heroin, but need to discover who killed their friend. We also are treated to a side issue of Romance Fraud on the internet as a new resident at their apartments has fallen for an internet romance and shipped a large amount of funds to Lithuania to help his ""true love"" pay her bills. Add to this, Elizabeth's husband Stephen is suffering from dementia and we have many segments of the book dealing with the condition, aging, death, etc. Finally we also have University professors, Afghan drug smugglers, a cocaine dealer who Ibrahim counsels at her prison cell, and a rival antique dealer and her male Canadian partner. I am telling you, the plot is interesting, we get to also meet Bob the Computer Guy who also has just moved into the complex, and we are treated to Joyce with her diary entries which also help tie things together, and who has surprisingly taken the lead when Elizabeth is indisposed. As for the short goodbye, Osman relates that the group will be back for many more cases, but that his next book will deal with new characters, which might just turn into a new series.

After the first day of presentations, marred by local protesters opposed to such a resort, Nigel, et al head to the ski slopes for a night of skiing prior to more presentations the next day.

Fraught with both peril and hope, Richter follows this families fortune as they try and carve out a home in this new and wild land. Richter also uses the language of the time period in his books and while it might not be what we are used to, it adds a true realism in the book. Not a long read, but very interesting, as he keeps the plot moving at a perfect pace and we can use our imaginations as to the hardships that the family must overcome.

But was attracted to this book because I enjoy a good mystery and thought I might learn a few things. And, I did!!! C.L. Miller has written a delightful debut novel in which the search for stolen antiques and antiquities collide with murders, and along the way we are treated to a host of characters from Freya, who is the lead protagonist of the story, to her Aunt Carole, her semi-grandfather Arthur who got her started in the antique profession over 20 years ago and who eventually caused her to leave the profession until she is suddenly pulled back in. Something is fishy about Arthurs's demise and Freya and Carole are on the hunt to figure out what all the clues lead to and what Arthur is trying to tell her from beyond the grave. The mystery takes us to an English Manor, and we learn about antique ""banks"" as we are joined by a shady group of characters who are all trying to find the valuables that appear to be hidden in the house. Nobody is as they appear, and everyone has their own agenda as the group meets for a weekend gathering where all things are hopefully going to be resolved. A very well plotted books with believable characters, this is a fast paced book that is easy to read and hard to put down. The author does a very good job of keeping us guessing as to the murderer, and I must admit that I was fooled!!! What I also like is that we know from the last chapter of the book that this appears to be the first of a series of books, and that there could be a group of repeat characters that we will follow as we delve into the world of antiques and murder.

But the book actually begins in 2003 and all the basic characters of the book are introduced to us with their own chapters and details needed to follow both time lines. A very strong beginning to this book! Jeanne has a son who is a failed real estate developer, a daughter-in-law who is a minor opera singer looking for a break and actually moves out of the family home at age 35 to follow her dream in New York, and takes the couples daughter Alice along with her. John is now a retired newspaper journalist who Jeanne first met and fell in love with during that 1947 journey (he was 21 at the time and a WW2 Vet), and who is now retired and living in Italy where he bought and is refurbishing a Villa that he hopes will be a destination location for Americans and Brits. But he also has been approached about writing a book about what really happened back in 1947 and needs Jeanne to be a co-writer. Complicating matters are two failed relationships between Jeanne and John, which have left Jeanne pretty well scarred as to John. Nonetheless she accepts his request to come to Italy, and brings along her son Michael, and her daughter-in-law and granddaughter also will be there because Kelly (the daughter-in-law) has secured a lead role in an Opera being performed at the Spoleto Festival in Todi, Italy. Whew!! Lots to cover here as we find out what behind the scenes info Jack withheld from his dispatches in 1947. Conspiracies, assassins, etc. what a going on, and we are moving a breakneck speed as we go along with John, Jeanne, the UN vote and a whole lot more. A well-written book with believable plots and characters, and one that takes me back to the time I spent in Italy and living at a spectacular Villa in Umbria.

It all germinated from a mention of an Indian boy in Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"", as well as a ships log that denotes that a boy named Tony was onboard a boat from England to Jamestown in 1635 and was the first known Indian to arrive in America.The book begins with the hanging of a ""witch"" on the passage to Jamestown and it haunts Tony. When he arrives he is in a nowhere land. Not white, not black, he is constantly referred to a mud color, and is really not accepted into either world. Tony is an indentured servant (different from a slave) with a 7-year term of servitude before he will be freed. But his indenture gets transferred to differing individual - the sadistic Ganter is one character we will ever forget - and along the way he is won as a gambling debt with his new master being an outdoorsman. Together they strike out West to try and find the Pacific Ocean and for Tony as way back home to India. We get Tony's backstory which is fascinating, as well as a look at his life in America where he toils for year and finally ends up an apprentice to a doctor. Tony finds love, and sometimes finds a lot of trouble as he ends up being on trial at a coroners inquest for the death of Ganter, a few years after he left Ganter's service. Charry also paints a vivid picture of how even the indentured servants are mistreated as well as their attempt at insurrection in order to get sufficient food. Two Angolan's also join Tony's group of friends and since none of these individuals are slaves they are allowed in public areas and that was one of the interesting parts of the book - the differences inj treatment between servants and slaves. We also are treated to a lot of information as to the plants and herbs that were used to make ""physics"" by the doctor and Tony - I mean the research was out of this world. And yet by the end Tony is able to wed and the couple makes it to Maryland where they are treated much better, but Tony warns us that in America there is a difference in how you live and are treated as determined by the color of your skin.A well-written, easy to read novel that shows us the trials and tribulations of most everyone who lives in America in 1635, but how difficult it is for one person who belongs to neither white nor black community. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Sep 14, 2023","Sep 29, 2023","Sep 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/74865875-the-east-indian

Numerous failed marriages, including some that even put her daughter Cheryl at risk when one of her husbands apparently turned out to be a pedophile. She would jump from man-to-man, and then she met Johnny Stompanato and things went downhill. This is a book that got glamour, Hollywood, the mob, and some really sleazy characters. A perfect weekend read! I loved this book, and the research that the author did was top-notch. We go through all of Lana's life to the fateful murder inquest regarding the possibility that her daughter Cheryl had killed Johnny Stompanato. Johnny and Mickey Cohen had basically set up Lena to be what is known as a ""honey trap"" and they would try to use photographs of Lana in compromising sexual positions to then blackmail her. This was a common theme back in the days. they never expected Johnny to fall in love with Lana, and to be so physically demanding to the point where he would beat her up. There was a lot of abuse that went on in that relationship and all of this is well documented. While the author never comes out and proves that Lana was actually the killer of Johnny Stompanato, everything certainly seems to point to that. The bottom line is, if there's ever a person deserved to get what he got, it was Johnny.

Very quickly, Anne is an orphan and by mistake is being given to Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert who are upper middle age, have never married and live on the farm Green Gables. They had wanted a boy but due to a mixup they ended up with a 12 year old, red-headed, freckle faced, dreamer. It is a lovely story about blending of personalities, friendships, and the experiences of growing up on Prince Edward Island. This is the first book in the series and ends when Anne is now 16 1/2. There were 8 books in this series published while the author lived and one submitted the day she died that only was published decades later. It takes us to a kinder and simpler time. A time when you had to make your own fun, use your imagination and creativity and went to school in a one-room schoolhouse.

Author Deborah Jenkins stories are about a disparate group of individuals who live in and around England. The stories are about people in all walks of life and are charming looks at their lives as they approach the winter holidays. It all begins with the story of a key to a home, an argument that escalates into an angry parent being involved in an accident, and the discovery of the key which brings healing. We are also treated to people who meet on a train, as well as another story about an Indian restaurant where the owners son doesn't understand his father. The stories go on and on, and the message in each are uplifting and affirming. By the last stories Jenkins brings everything full circle at a New Years Day party at the home of Lady Trenton. It is hard to say which story I enjoyed the most, and that is a good thing! So many times books of short stories consist of a few quality stories and just as many clunkers. But here the fact that Deborah Jenkins is able to seamlessly tie-in each and every person and story creates a book that has one of the most delightful, charming and uplifting books I have read in well over a year.

But in this novel we discover more about the real Doc Holiday who suffered from TB from an early age, who had ambition to become a top dentist (attended Dental School in Philadelphia), but was truly a genteel Southerner from Georgia, whose life has rarely been explored and so author Mary Doria Russel takes us along on a tour of his early years, his upbringing, his first love (his cousin), his love of classical music and classical literature, as well as how his TB forced him to continually move onto ""better"" climates and which took him to Texas and eventually Dodge City, Kansas where a majority of this book takes place. How much is fact, how much is fiction? Well, while Russell does not give us a page by page breakdown, we do find out that she had access to Holiday's relatives, as well as their non-fiction book on Doc. Many of the scenes in this book are factually correct, and she uses this go give us a look at Wyatt Earp (while in Kansas) who Doc admired, Bat Masterson, Morgan Earp (his true friend), Kate Harony (the prostitute better known as Big Nose Kate), and a host of supporting characters who crossed his path while in Dodge City. While not a history, it does help us flesh out Doc, and provide some insight into his life, friendships, loyalties, his illness, his gambling (how else can one support themself if TB kept him from continuing his practice of medicine), and his fascinating attraction to and life with Kate. This is a very fine book with one drawback. At the end of the book the author wraps up Doc's life, along with Kate's and others, and you get the feeling that this will be a one book effort on his life. But no, there is a Book 2 titled Epitaph and which covers the Tombstone years, so I am a bit perplexed as to why she appears to wrap things up at the end of this book. Nevertheless, this is a great book for fans of History, the Old West and those who just want to read a truly fine book!! I shied away from this book for years for fear it would not do justice to Doc.

Mitch is a partner in the worlds largest law firm (over 2100 lawyers in 31 worldwide locations), while Abby is a cookbook editor.

And now Mitch is dashing around the world to try and secure the funds to pay the terrorist kidnappers. No law involved in this, and shallow characters that you really cannot connect with.

The ships captain enlists Jim, who has become a detective in America after his life in the British/Indian army, to lead the investigation into finding the murderer among the ships passengers and before they reach England. The book is set in the 1890's and even then there were cruise liners that plied the seas in luxury as it the case today, and while the ships were smaller back then there were still over 500 passengers or crew who could be the murderer.

There are only 6 days in which to solve this murder, and along the way we meet many of the wealthy first class passengers, their aides, nurses and assistants, as well as many of the crew. Making this more intriguing is that the murder took place in a locked meeting room onboard this moving ship so there is nowhere for the assailant to hide.

This is a story that needs to be told, about survival and courage and by using the actual events and people in the NEI we see a part of WW2 that is never seen or covered here in the US. We follow the Vischer family and the horrid plight of the women and children in a prison camp. It is tough to read, but not gory. But it is what these people had to put up with for 3 years of Japanese occupation. We also follow George for portion of the book as he is ordered by the navy to try and make a desperate attempt to get to Australia and help form a counter attack. That fails and we see the privation that he is also subjected to. Each chapter begins with a quote from an actual survivor of one of the NEI camps which leads into the focus of each chapter. Men, women, children are all subjected to brutal conditions, and we also see the crazed command of Captain Sonei, who is pure evil and subjects the women and children to roll calls two to three times per day, some lasting as long as 6-hours. This is a book you need to read.. As the prisoners are reduced to one meal per day of porridge, and even must go so far as eating or using grass for sustenance. On minor infraction can lead to multiple days of no food,. The conditions were inhumane and I wonder how they compared to life in the Nazi camps, or even the US Civil War camp at Andersonville, GA? Even after the Japanese surrender the problems persist as native Indonesians attack and kill anyone they can find who is Dutch. Yes it is war and, yes war his Hell, but mans inhumanity to man is here in this book and we need to confront this issue.

Unlike so many other books that use the word books, or book club, etc in the title, this book is not really about the books that are mentioned, but rather the Reading Club is the background for a look at 4 freshmen girls at Radcliffe College in the mid-1950's. Four so very unique and mismatched girls are dorm neighbors at Radcliffe and this book takes a look at the formative friendships and then the ups and downs that they all experience during their first year at Radcliffe. We first meet Tess as she wanders into a book store and eventually the owner discusses a reading club with Tess. Eventually all 4 of the girls join this group which meets once a month and the books read deal with various examples of women and how they deal with growth, their future, the place of women in society, etc. It is an extremely well written and thoughtful book. I read one chapter each day to my wife and after that we probably talked about the book, the characters and the plotting for at least 30 minutes every day. Julia Bryan Thomas is a wonderful writer, and this newest book is a true gem. We get immersed in all the girls, their lives, their sorrows and their experiences.

Not revisionism, but rather a thoughtful bookColin Mustful has done a very good job in writing what he calls an ""alternate"" historical fiction novel. Not revisionism, but rather a thoughtful book that turns history upside down.. At its heart, this is a story of two young men. Waabi is seen as a young Ojibwa Indian who goes to a missionary school and whose family tries to live in accordance with the peace treaties. Samuel, is the son of a Vermont family who moves to Minnesota after the promise of free land and great prospects for prosperity. We follow these two through alternating chapters of the book and the author gives us a very good and sympathetic backstory for each young man and their respective families. Samuel's family relies on government claims about life in Minnesota, while Waabi's family does the same with regard to the numerous peace treaties which move the Ojibwa tribes out of their traditional lands and onto smaller and smaller areas, as well as the hardships they encountered due to decreased allotments of money and food from the government. Something has to give and this leads us to the Dakota Wars of 1862 in which Waabi now becomes part of a Native American Army and Samuel is in the US military - something neither of these two really wanted but are put their by circumstances beyond their control.I will be the first to admit that while I knew a lot about numerous battles and wars in the midwest and southwest, the Dakota Wars is something that I know very little about, but despite that it is a book about humanity and lack there of by both sides. Both young men and their families are innocent victims in this War. The author has given us an authentic and well thought out book. Yes, it is alternative history, but the focus is on the individuals and not so much the reversal of history. Also we see natural resources come into play as both the Ojibwa people and Samuel's family had a tragic episode over who has the right to cranberries grown in that territory, the epilogue fast forwards to today where a lawsuit once again tries to figure out who has the right to the cranberries grown in that region. A very good, and very easy read that is hard to put down until we come to the very end!...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jun 30, 2023","Jul 11, 2023","Jun 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/125781015-reclaiming-mni-sota

Wimmer gives us a great overview of all that happened that year, from the Centennial to Custer's Last stand, with personalities and details galore. The book never slows down, and one of the easiest to read non-fiction books I have had the pleasure of reading in years. In addition to the above, we also have a bit about the formation of the National League of Baseball Clubs, Western lawmen and celebrities such as Bat Masterson, Wild Bill Hickok, locations such as Dodge City and Deadwood; there are famous Native American chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, and even Buffalo Bill Cody gets into the act!What makes this book so special is that Wimmer shows all the coincidences that occurred that year, and even how miscommunication resulted in both tragedy and inept failure. If you want to learn about Custer's Last stand Wimmer covers that in detail from all angles, and to me the best part of the book is the Northfield (MN) bank robbery involving the Jesse and Frank James, along with all the Younger Brothers (Cole, Bob & Jim). Wimmer gives us the stories behind so many of the names and legends. The authors passion for story-telling and the Old West shine through in this fast-paced book that is sure to be a hit for young and old.

Our protagonist, Bill Hefflin, has left his job at the CIA after having inherited a substantial sum of money from his former KGB friend/asset, Boris. But one day during a walk he sees a sign that there is a drop for him, and the message indicates that it is from Boris, but Boris is dead and nobody knows that but Bill, so who is behind this. Thus begins a top flight espionage thriller that certainly has elevated William Maz to a premier espionage writers. There is a mole in the CIA and many consider Bill to be that person, but despite that he is sent back to Romania to both find Boris and prove he is not the mole. What he finds is a new Romania that has been taken over by the Oligarchs, be they former members of the dread Securitate, former Communist politicians, gangs of gypsies, or others propped up by either the USA or Russia. An intricately detailed and plotted book that is refreshing in that it is not the usual US/UK/Russia thriller but instead Maz deals with Romania and the forces that are trying to control the country. Businesses and land has been privatized, and all the wealth has been transferred from the Communist government to this small handful of individuals. It is place of continues corruption ahd lost hopes and dreams, a place where weapon sales and smuggling rampant and Hefflin is confronted by innumerable obstacles. Filled with real individuals, along with true descriptions of the people and conditions in Romania, it is a bleak world that existed there in 1993 and it appears that there will happily be at least one more book in this series.On a personal note, my wife is Romanian (escaping in 1984), and I have personally been back there numerous on numerous occasions and can vouch for the realistic conditions set forth by the author. It will take generations for Romania to overcome its past, and so William Maz has a fertile location for many more great espionage books!

Julia applies for and gets the job at the Addison Center and quickly finds out that it is more glamorous and scandalous than she expected. Lots of loving, gossip, cattiness and backstabbing going on throughout this book, as we find out someone took a huge donation check from her desk, how someone appears to be setting her up for a fall, and finding out that clothes are so essential in this job! We also have a lot of speculation as to love lives, and affairs (including Julie's husband??), but the book ends with a satisfactory ending for one and all, most especially Julie who has had to navigate this minefield. All in all it is not a bad effort by debut novelist Diane Bergner, however the plot gets bogged down with a huge over emphasis on describing the clothing everyone wears, almost every other chapter.

But this proved scandalous to certain people (the FBI and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper). And so no matter what Chaplin did he was hounded. They tried him for violation of the Mann Act when a Hollywood girlfriend came to NY (crossed state lines), and when that failed they found a rather unstable woman to bring paternity charges against him (the heck that the blood tests proved he wasn't the father). Then they attacked him as a Communist without any proof, attacked his making of The Great Dictator, Modern Times and any other movie he made. Eventually Chaplin gets a re-entry permit for him to travel to Europe to promote his move Limelight, and 2 days after he boards to ship to England he is informed that his permit is effectively revoked and he will be arrested if he returns to the US.. From hero to pariah in a few short years. This book is focused on these times and we get a Who's Who of Hollywood celebrities in the book, along with legendary columnists and politicians who are all out to get Chaplin, and a few who remain friendly to him.

The Marlow Murder Club is a group of 3 women led by Judith, a 78-year old retiree who loves both creating and solving crossword puzzles, Suzie who is a dog walker and now a host on Marlow FM, and finally Becks who is the 40-ish wife of the local vicar. The three blended well together to solve the first murder, but it seems they went their own way until they are reunited to solve the murder of Sir Peter Bailey.

Enter the ladies who were all at the party and begin collecting clues and trying to find the murderer. Finally the police arrive but the ladies continue to meddle. And this goes on for over 300 pages. The police officially refuse to believe it is a murder which is a convenient plot device to allow these three ladies to continue meddling in lives and collecting clues. But, by about page 30 I knew who was the murderer, and apparently I am smarter than those ladies of the Marlow Murder Club, so much so that they, especially Judith, becomes aggravating and irritating.

A wonderful stand alone mystery novel by Craig Russell in which he delves into legends and mysteries from the Golden Era, the Silent Movie era of Hollywood. This is a wonderfully crafted work that takes us back and forth in time from 1967 to 1927, and then even further back to 1897 and 1907 to introduce us to character and a plot that is intricate and spellbinding. It all begins with the death of Hollywood star Norma Carlton and is mostly seen through the eyes of Carbine Studio fixer, Mary Rourke who is tasked by the studio owner to figure out who killed Norma. Norma was part of the alleged cursed production of the epic silent movie The Devil's Playground of which there is alleged to be only a single copy remaining. In 1967 Dr. Paul Conway is on a mission to find that elusive copy which takes him to Sudden Lake, California to a former hotel which may very well hold the secret to the lost film. We also are introduced to an alleged voodoo queen in the Louisiana swamp back in 1907 and even further back the author takes us to introduce many aspects of the plot, all of which add to the mystery of Norma's death, the cursed movie production, and missing young girls who flocked to Hollywood in the early days of film to become the next big star. Just a well done plot and a well written book. Meticulous research on many aspects of Hollywood including the now defunct Hollywood Studio Club, the goat-gland guru John Romulus Brinkley, and much, much more. Yes, this is a novel, but it transports you back in time and with such realism that you feel that these events actually happened. Mystery, suspense, horror, thriller??

This is a tale of family, mystery, secrets and follow the interconnecting stories of an abandoned town, a woman's 100th birthday party, and a secret that has laid hidden since two young girls were found wandering in a chestnut grove after having gone missing for three days. Hugh Fisher is an American Historian who has returned to Valetto to spend time living in a cottage his mother resided in prior to her death. It is there we meet his soon to be 100-year old grandmother, and his three aunts reside (4 of the 10 who remain in the city). Unfortunately he is greeted by Milanese chef Elisa Tomassi who claims to have a letter written by Hugh's long dead grandfather and in which he wants to give this cottage to Elisa's mother for all she did for him during WW2. The Serafino sisters oppose this and doubt the story behind the letter, as well as the document itself. Aldo Serafino was a partisan during WW2 and had to hastily leave Valetto and worked in the Italian Alps helping his compatriots fight the Nazi's plus the Italian Fascist allies. Two years later Aldo has died and the Serafino family has heard nothing from or about him for over 70 years until Elisa arrives with the letter. The letter prompts a family investigation and eventually they discover the truth about the mysterious disappearance. The truth resides in the memory of the two ladies, one dead and the other Elisa's mother, as well as an aged pensioner now living in Rome. And it is at Ida Serafino's 100th Birthday party that secrets are revealed to all who gather for what was to be a glorious gala. World War 2 is over but even today old passions and history comes to the forefront in this dazzling work by Smith. Smith's knowledge of Italy and Italians hits and mark, and it is rare that any books are written about how everyday Italians both coped with and suffered during that war. Smith tackles with remarkable sensitivity and crafts a novel that is a worthy addition to his body of works. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"May 02, 2023",Jun 2023,"May 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60656502-return-to-valetto

Claudia Gray is primarily a YA author who has made a partial transition into historical mystery with the help of most all of the characters of Jane Austen's novels. This book uses most all the characters from Sense and Sensibility as we delve into a murder of a newly married woman at a welcoming dinner party. Horrors, aghast and social norms be damned. The poor woman both vomits and loses control of her bowels at the home of Lord Middleton. Despite having two constables available to investigate this murder we are lucky to have Mr. Jonathan Darcy and Miss Juliet Tinley in attendance. These two young people, both apparently under the age of 20, had worked together just a few months ago to help solve another murder, and now they are thrown into this case. Darcy is in town at the invitation of his boarding school nemesis John Willoughby, whose wife was murdered, and he was joined by two other boarding school acquaintances, Ralph Bamber and Laurence Follett, neither of who either liked John Willoughby. So there are suspects galore, action taking place in numerous locales and all in all you get a highly satisfactory read. This is the 2nd in the series and I hope more are on the way. Even though I know nothing about Jane Austen, her books or characters, this is an extremely readable book, one that Austen fans should enjoy, and folks like me will find interesting and filled with plenty of societal rules that make this one fun read.

This is the David vs. Goliath story of not just the 1938 PGA Championship but rather much of Runyan's career. It is a golf book, but it also is a lot more, as we follow the career of Runyan from rural Arkansas to the heights of professional golf. At 5'6"" and weighing only 130 pounds he was able to figure out how to adapt the game to his frame. From hitting anywhere from 600-1000 golf balls a day, every day, he mastered the iron game and was able to defeat others due to his success from sand bunkers, deep rough, as well as the approach shot and unbelievable putting. A golf club pro, he also competed and won many events, but as time went on the general public knew more about his contemporaries such as Snead, Hogan, Sarazen, etc. But this is an inspirational book as we find much of his success due to a dedicated fitness schedule, control of his eating and drinking, getting proper sleep, the use of mathematics to conquer golf courses, and the use of a cool bath to outlast his opponents. John Dechant did a masterful job in detailing Runyan's career with the highlight being his overwhelming defeat of Sam Snead as a 10-1 underdog.

This is the 2nd Max Geller mystery, and while it is not a standalone book, you can easily follow what happened in the first book, and get caught up with the issues in this book. Max had worked for the CIA and had been in Russia where he received compromising photos of the US President, and along the way stole $10 Million from a Russian bank.. He is now a fired CIA agent living the good life with his girlfriend in Australia where he is approached on the beach and is basically blackmailed into going back to Russia to bring out a Soviet defector who has major information about the Russian plan to invade its former satellite countries. But Max has a price on his head in Russia and must devise his own method to ensure that this is not a trap, as well as escaping Russia with the alleged defector.. The action is both explosive and fast paced, as Max tries to evade the Russian security forces, and stay alive. The action takes us from Australia to DC, then onto Russia, into those Russian satellite countries, Cyprus, Germany and, whew, that is a lot of action and travel.

The beginning was good, the ending was good and in between it just felt like Jane Smiley lost her way.Why do I say this? Well it is because it just appears that the author could not decide what this book is about. Is it a detective story, a ghost story, a gal-pal story, a recital of prostitutes clients, historical fiction, etc. She throws in slavery at the very end, since the story is set in 1852, and when you throw all of this together it is lackluster read. It also did not help that I could figure out the killer early in the book, but there was a twist into the how and why.

I loved this first book of the Sol Nemo series that was written by British author John Constable. Constable keeps the action going from page 1, yet by action I do not mean the typical guns blazing unbelievable action in many books. Instead here the action deals with the kidnapping of a former club singer (chanteuse) who was married to Sol Nemo's father figure. Why would she be kidnapped? It all revolves around a demand for $50 million and what goes wrong at the drop off. Really well written with believable action. Nem0, a former member of the South African police and who is now a PI, is both the hunter and the hunted in this book. The plot takes us to many locales in South Africa and includes many small personal details that are missing in other books (lots of good references to Sol's eating at different locations). Fast paced, page turner with a good plot and characters are well developed over the span of the book, for instance Sol is mixed race but not what you might think, with a Dutch father and Indian mother.

To me this is a step down from his last book featuring Malone, The Omega Factor.

This sequel to the first book in the series, Relic, turned out to be almost beyond belief and sort of boring. We begin 18 month after Relic ended and we discover that there are murders being committed in which the victims heads are cut off. Enter most of the same characters from Book 1, with the addition of a new Transit Authority cop and eventually this group discovers the culprits live beneath the city in the bowels of the subway system. They are homeless or people who just want to escape society, but even they are stalked by others living deeper underground and who appear to have genetically evolved like the monster in Book 1. For me there is too much unbelievable action, firepower and a hokey solution to the problem. The police are inept except Lt.

As expected the action takes place in Los Angeles and we follow Joe as he graduates for an Anti-Obsession classes for his lifelong passion of sitting on flagpoles, and the next day decides he realizes he is not cured of this and begins the process of going back up again to break the record of Shipwreck Blake. He has a specially made platform built and up he climbs. Very well written, as most chapters are narrated by Joe, but there are also some narrated by his wife Clover and son Nate. Joe introduces us to a host of characters, from a transvestite movie theater owner, to the Anti-Obsession guru who eventually tries to outdo Joe, we have news reporters, as well as school officials, and even more flagpole sitters and even Shipwreck Blake shows up at various times to both torment and encourage Joe. But while Joe is sitting 70 feet in the air a lot is going on with his family, much of which is not good. Joe runs the entire gamut of emotions and fears as he attempts to break the record, and even though he is not with his family, his deliberate action of flagpole sitting has negative effects upon both Clover and Nate.

Borman is a top-flight historian and makes us realize that all battles are not necessarily on a battlefield between warriors, but rather can be fought by women in the background who see and feel things differently than the men. Frances is one of the attendants of Princess Elizabeth and is well placed for palace intrigue.

Brands is, in my opinion, our best Historian/Author and his books are filled with accurate research, and this book is just an example of this. Here he turns his eye on the Indian Wars, and he is no revisionist, which he accurately notes were going on for hundreds of generations before Europeans came to the US. He even says when the tribes from Europe (meaning England, French, Spanish, etc.) came to the new world they merely joined into the war that was already waging! See what I mean, accurate history and writing. Anyway Brands looks at the expansion of the US and the many Indian Wars fought by our military. William Tecumseh Sherman, after the Civil War, was made the head of the US troops and did what had to be done. You see notes from his diary, along with speeches he made, the conflict between how he felt and the job he had to do. Also, many chapters deal with Native American tribes and the battles. It really was a war of attrition that ended in the Northern Plains with the surrender of Chief Joseph, and finally the capture and surrender of the Apaches and Geronimo. As is pointed out, there were good and there were bad among the soldiers, the settlers and the Indians. And I really came away with a well-rounded view of these wars. Brands goes out of his way to be fair-handed, something you rarely see lately, and is not afraid to point out the good and the bad in all sides of this campaign. Read this with an open mind and you will be surprised at the history of the Indian Wars. A fast-paced, action packed journey to the frontier and all the names we are familiar with (and some unknown until now) and this is must another reason why H.W.

The book is meticulously researched and follows Cream from his childhood in Canada and then to Illinois where he is convicted for murder. He is released early and heads to England where he again begins his treacherous ways. He is a weird guy to put it mildly. Smart, he graduated from Medical School in Canada and then got an advanced degree in England. He used his medical status to give poison to prostitutes, as well as ladies who need abortions. He writes to coroners and also tries to blackmail people for his own evil deeds. A very easy read, not gory for a true crime non-fiction book, and shows all the issues that Scotland Yard had in the 1880's trying to find this serial killer.

It is a fascinating book that is steeped in great research and actual history, and yet it involves a plot that could easily have happened. Most of us have heard of Operation Barbarossa, but this book takes it a bit further and delves into a fictional agreement between the US, Britain and Germany to forge an alliance against Russia. Sure this did not happen, but ""what if?"" Great stuff that even takes us into British Royal intrigue and the very real ""Operation Willie"" that was created to get the Duke of Windsor to support Germany and quite possibly retake the throne of England.

It is a fast paced and exciting book, that raises many fascinating facts and possibilities.

This shines an unfortunate spotlight on the Holland America cruise ship Zaandam on its voyage of March 6, 2020, a voyage that was so terrible it was dubbed the ""Pariah Ship."" The authors are able to interview crew, staff, passengers and others, and also got access to certain documentation to give us an almost day by day look at what happened on the Zaandam as it was overwhelmed with Coronavirus infections. I am a cruiser but after reading this book I may never cruise again. The ship was a breeding ground for Covid, and this voyage should have never left port in Buenos Aires (Final destination Port Everglades, FL). By the time this boat left the world had begun to be overrun with Covid, and numerous ships had well publicized Covid outbreaks. Nonetheless, the boat took off and shortly thereafter Covid struck, but the ship was ill prepared for this outbreak and it ravaged so many people on the cruise. So what we have in this book is a classic example of what not to do in crisis situation. Holland America corporate refused to participate in this book and I can understand why! Terrible. This book grabs you and will not let you go. I read it in under two days. The stories are shocking, heartbreaking, and heroic. Bureaucracy runs amok, all countries close their ports to this ship with dead and dying passengers until the are finally allowed through the Panama Canal. Then they are denied entrance to other ports in the Caribbean and even the US. This is a non-fiction book that all of us should read, and read about our fears, our inhumanity to suffering people, heroism by staff and crew members and the suffering that was imposed upon every passenger on the boat as it drifts aimlessly trying to get fuel, food, medical supplies and a friendly port.

As with all the books of this series, Donna Leon, weaves her plot and characters around a social/society issue in Venice and this time we are dealing with fishing. Yes, fishing, over fishing, destruction of the clam beds off one of the islands of Venice, and the pollution of the waters in and around Venice. Two of the characters in the book even refuse to eat clams for differing reasons.But Brunetti finds himself being called to the island of Pellestrina to investigate the deaths of two fisherman (father and son). The islanders refuse to give up their secrets and eventually the lovely Signorina Elletra volunteers to go to the island and ""visit"" her relative and try to discover some information. Another policeman is assigned to look over her while Brunetti is stuck in his office. This book, as all of Leon's books do, come to a conclusion that is less than satisfying for Brunetti. Some justice is done, some is not. Brunetti discovers that he is enamored with Elettra and worries about her constantly. Then another death is reported and eventually there is the usual tangled web of intrigue that was lurking beneath the surface and which eventually finds everyone in the midst of a monstrous storm (bigger than their famous storm of 1927). Who lives, who survives and what happens to every character in this book as the storms fury reaches epic proportions. As I said, there is so much going on and we are left with our usual feelings of ambiguity about Venice, the law, corruption, and most of all the fate of the now massively polluted waters in and about Venice.

It follows the usual Ambler plot of an ""every man"" who is thrust into the path of danger, which usually produces a fascinating story, but here things go off the rail for me. First of all, our ""every man"" is a 50-ish year old petty criminal living in Athens who tries to con a person to use his services as a driver and guide, and then tries to rob him by entering his hotel suite to steal travelers checks. He is nabbed in the act and all of a sudden Alfred Simpson (of Egyptian/British lineage) is forced to assist a group of thieves who are heading to Istanbul. What they want is for him to drive a car to Turkey. Things get complicated and for a petty criminal Alfred is clueless. What he interprets as a possible heroin or blackmail scam turns out to be a theft from a royal museum.And here is the second thing, neither Simpson nor we the reader have any idea that a heist is being planned until about 85% into the book. We meet a lot of unsavory characters, and follow the bumbling Simpson until the very end when nothing went as planned. This book is the basis for the Alfred Hitchcock movie, Topkapi, and maybe had I not seen the movie years ago and remembered the plot I would have had more pleasure reading the book. It is not a bad book, and all the action is rather fast paced, but it just fell flat for me. This book came in at 3.5*** and I am rounding it down to 3***.

As with all is books, Berry blends 80% real history with 20% fictionalized plot and gives us fast paced, books that actually teach us a lot about bits of unknown history as part of his novels. Here he has a brand new character, Nick Lee, who comes to Belgium at the request of his ex-girlfriend (who is now a nun!), who is involved with the restoration of the missing panel of the Ghent Altarpiece. Upon arrival there is a fire that destroys the painting and Nick is after a laptop that holds the only remaining images of that restored panel. So what do we have here? Well we spend much time in Brussels and France, we learn a lot about the history of the Ghent Altarpiece, we have a mysterious order of nuns, Joan of Arc, the Catholic history of Mary the mother of Jesus, the Marion Legend, the Inquisition and the Cathars. Whew! I am sure I missed something, but you get the gist. This is a wonderful read, with a new character (Nick Lee), who works for UNESCO and may just appear in future books. Berry has a wonderful mind for history and for this blend of history and fiction that makes even non-historians love his works. It is an easy flowing novel and one that will be another best seller.For a more detailed  please visit www.viewsonbooks.com...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Apr 20, 2022","Apr 29, 2022","Apr 20, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59071204-the-omega-factor

I was unaware of this until I saw the Netflix TV series and I wanted to read the book to delve deeper into these Saxon Stories of Medieval England. So glad that I did. Yes, not everything is like the book, but the book gives us a really quality look at that time period and sets things up perfectly for the rest of the series.Lots of old English spelling of towns, and names, but this edition comes with a guide so it is easy to figure out the modern day equivalent locations. Basically we have the story of the creation of the nation of England, and its beginnings with Alfred the Great. Wonderfully described, as are all the characters, we see the early differences between Alfred and those of Wessex and the Danes. And the main character/hero/protagonist for this series is Uhtred of Baebbenburg. A Saxon who is captured by the Danes at a young age and adopted into the Danish family and learns their ways before he is drawn back into Saxon lands. He goes back and forth straddling allegiances with both cultures as he has one quest, to get back his ancestral lands that were taken from him by his uncle.

Judy has written over 15 novels aI am a big fan of historical fiction and recently was just introduced to the prodigious Australian author Judy Nunn. Judy has written over 15 novels and kids books, and this 2015 novel tells about the building of The Ghan. The Ghan Is a train line that crosses the continent of Australia, and the book is inspired by a trip that Nunn took on that train. She deals with the central part of this railway which was not built until the 21st century, despite having been laid out years previously. The name of the railway line and the book is a tribute to the camel herders who brought their camels from Afghan to Australia in the 1800’s, and which animals were used to transport goods and materials used in the construction of the Telegraph services across the country. The railway line was then devised to basically follow the route of the Telegraph lines, sort of like here in the United States where in the western part of the country the Interstate highways follows the railroad track.This is a book about culture, history, and the aboriginal belief that ancestors can you speak to you in your dreams, or can even invade your thoughts while you are awake. There are many interesting characters in this book, but the two main characters seem to be Jess, a young woman of aboriginal and Irish descent, as well as Matthew a surveyor who was there to work out the final route of the railway lines. Jess had been hired by the government to be an intermediary to the indigenous people because the government wanted to be very surely they were not disturbing any sacred sites during the building of this railway. And it is through this job that Jess meets Matthew. Trust me it's not a love story.Instead Nunn has given us a fantastic look at certain events that occurred in the 1880s and which resonate even today in the indigenous regions of Australia. Some of the characters which we meet in the early chapters will all be entwined later in the book as we get white settlers, aboriginal natives, Afghan camel herders, and others who will eventually help us discover the secret that the spirits of the past hold in this one small area and which will play havoc with the original path of the railroad. We get to see the prejudice, culture, and history of Australia all woven into this novel, and is a story that is entirely captivating. I found that the plot was believable, the characters are extremely well developed and interesting, and the fact that Nunn was able to keep any sort of romance between Jessica and Matthew out of this book was a big plus for me. Two mates trying to do what's best. We get caught up in the lives of the characters as well as their interactions, and all the while we were also introduced to the history regarding the development of the rail line. In the end you have a much greater understanding as to how this railway was built and the spirits that helped guide the path of the railway. Just an excellent book, well written, fantastically researched and a book that I heartily recommend that you try and find. This book was not available in any of my Free Library services and so I had to buy it, and I'm very happy I did.

I was very excited to receive this book anThis is the second installment of the Ellie McDonnell espionage series set in England during World War Two. I was very excited to receive this book and moved it to the top of my reading list. Unfortunately my excitement did not last that long for this book. It is rather simple and lacks some of the qualities that I so enjoyed in the first book. There's a lot of championing of England and patriotism, which is all well and good, but sometimes it gets to be a bit much.Now, this has an interesting plot in that out of the blue Ellie is approached by Major Ramsey to help him remove a bracelet from the wrist of a young lady who was found dead in the Thames River. It was a rather simple bracelet to remove, and yet attached to the bracelet is a locket which also needs to be opened. Again this is not a hard task and it makes you wonder why major Ramsey really needed Ellie to be with him to open this. Nonetheless it turns out that within the locket was a small camera which contained film that had photos of sensitive areas in and around London. It becomes obvious that the dead woman was a spy. Now we have to find out who was the woman, who is in the spy network and to do this we bring in her uncle Mick, as well as her friend and possible love interest Felix Lacey.A lot of this book is easy to figure out, and I just found the writing not up to the quality of the first book of the series, and the plot was rather obvious. Now, there have been many books written about World War Two, and many of the espionage novels have already covered much of the same ground. This series is different because Ellie and her family were professional thieves, which was a very unique twist that was introduced into this series. But by the 2nd book everyone becomes legitimate and some of the fun is gone. Ellie is torn between her growing relationship with Felix, and yet everybody seems to want Ellie to end up with Major Ramsey. We also get more information as to Ellie’s mother who had been convicted of killing her father and a lot of the back story into that situation. To be honest I don't need that. Major Ramsey makes a very good observation about that very subject and I think he hits the nail on the head.But we have spies, spy rings, the beginning of the bombing of London, breaking into a bank vault and a lot of other action which helps move the story along. Unfortunately for me it just didn't do enough, I had a feeling that the author was rushing this book to press after the success of her first book. It's a good read, but it's not a great read and that to me was a disappointment. I still think the series has a lot of potential but the author must whittle down her cast of characters to make things a little more believable.

Her lead character, Margery Benson, is not exactly a person that I would be friends with. She had a strange upbringing, lost all of her brothers as well as her mother, and I'm still not sure whether her father killed himself or just left the family. But she was raised by Aunts, and they did nothing to teach her the ways of the world or how to even fit into the world. Instead she developed a love of beetles, because her father had told her about the golden beetle. Thanks to this she eventually hung out at the Natural History Museum and learned all she could about the wonderful and fascinating world of beetles. Many years later, in 1950, she decided that she would strike out on her own to try to discover this elusive insect, after a calamitous incident at the school she worked at. She eventually has a traveling companion, Enid Pretty, who is rather bizarre and who has her own secret as to why she wants to leave England and travel to New Caledonia. The two women don't exactly mesh, yet at the same time they are able to survive together. There are scenes on board the boat trip from England to new Caledonia, as well as many scenes in New Caledonia and how they thrashed their way through the jungles of that island. Marjorie is on a quest, and Edith is there to escape. And along the way there's a male character by the name of Mundic who is totally unnecessary. This character does nothing to advance the storyline of the book, and is really nothing more than a stalker. He is instrumental only to advance the ending of the book, and I think that the author could have created a better character to obtain the same result, or could have written the dramatic climax in a much more believable way.Now some people will say that this book is good because it shows how women used to be treated in the world and in academia, and how eventually Margery overcomes that. That much is true. But is that the only reason we liked the book? The book begins with a very good premise and idea, but after the first 100 pages it runs into a brick wall and I could not finish this fast enough. In addition the entire conclusion of this book was obvious, and once Enid decided to give her baby Margery’s last name you knew exactly what had to happen, and it did.Again, I am very disappointed in this book which I know is a minority point of view and for me it is a disappointment since I had such high hopes that I would enjoy this book due to the author and the s I had read. I now begin to wonder whether the people in my book club actually read this book before they assigned it, because it's certainly one that I would not assign because there's really not much to talk about. Some people don't like mystery books because there's not much to talk about, and I don't see any difference in this book. but this seems to be the authors MO. She starts with a good premise and then the further we get into a book we get more into either magical realism or fantasy or whatever but it just loses its way. I really did not care for the characters and as I said the one male character was completely unsympathetic and unnecessary and I really don't understand why he was included.I know I am in the minority, but I'm not about to give a book a good rating just because others do, especially when I did not enjoy a book, and the longer I read this book the less I enjoyed it....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Feb 17, 2022","Feb 21, 2022","Feb 17, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53675513-miss-benson-s-beetle

I listened to a podcast in which the author was interviewed and was so impressWhat a marvelous book about a little known chapter in American history. I listened to a podcast in which the author was interviewed and was so impressed that I moved the book to the top of my reading list, and once I began the book it was hard for me to put it down!This is the story of the attempt by Henry Ford to change the destiny of the Muscle Shoals, Alabama region and to create a utopian society based on 19th century values and ethics. It was a plan where Ford would purchase government owned facilities, facilities that have been deserted after World War One, and he would finish the damming of the Tennessee river, would finish nitrate fertilizer plants that had also been halted, and would create a massive amount of electric energy that he would use to create a 75 mile development plan for this upper Alabama region. It was an ambitious endeavor, but one which the citizens were wildly in favor of because of how backward, desolate and impoverished this area was.The book is an extremely fast read, as a matter of fact the first section I read in under a day. It slows down a bit once the focus gets off of Henry Ford, and instead focuses on the main opponent to this project, Nebraska Senator George Norris who way back in the 1920s believed that natural resources in America should be controlled by a public entity and not private corporations. He believed that Ford was lowballing the purchase price, was not willing to commit to certain enhancements and for almost three years this US Senator was able to block any and all attempts by Ford to purchase the property and make these improvements.Henry Ford was an icon, and in addition he brought in his friend Thomas Edison to help promote the project's use of hydroelectric power by damming the Tennessee river. What I never realized was that Henry Ford wanted clean and green energy. He hated coal and the smoke and dirt that it produced. As a matter of fact I got the distinct impression that Ford would have preferred his automobiles to be electrified but there was not a way to feasibly do that when he developed the Model T. By this time in his life Ford was most likely the wealthiest man in the world and he had dreams of expanding his automobile dynasty as well as dreams of creating an America that was based upon his work ethics. He planned for villages that would be developed that had a 40 acre village green, a church, housing, some small businesses, all of which would be populated by people who would work at Ford’s automobile factory, or supply chain in the area. He may have been the first person who dreamt of something we now know as the suburbs, And his ideas on small family farming we're truly revolutionary. But no matter what he did he was opposed by George Norris. Norris eventually drafted a bill which would lead to the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Norris believed that the Tennessee River should be damned for the benefit of all people in the area not just to benefit Ford.This is a truly eye opening book about something I had never heard of and I was fascinated to read all that was involved in this project. A project that actually had its beginnings in the 1890s, expedited during the early years of World War One, and before the whole project could be finalized the war ended. It was at that time that Henry Ford decided he would come in and help revitalize that area by taking over the government projects and structures and use them for his utopian dream.For me this was a well written book, a fabulous read come which bogs down a bit when we get into the middle portion of the book because the focus no longer is on Ford or Edison, but rather on Norris, government hearings and what impediments could be put in the way of Henry Ford so that he did not get this land. I heartily recommend this to anyone who is interested in history, the TVA, and the question of government versus public ownership of utilities. It's not a dry read, but rather it is one that kept me from putting this book down until I finished it. A top notch effort to put it mildly!...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Feb 17, 2022","Feb 24, 2022","Feb 17, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57880690-electric-city

I have felt this way many times when I begin the first book of a large series and I was so excited to finally start the Walk Longmire series by Craig Johnson. Unfortunately, my excitement exceeded the reality of this book. It's not a bad book, but it was a ponderous book for me. It's filled with many descriptions and information that just seeing to stand in the way of making this a free flowing read.As a fan of the Walt Longmire TV series I guess I still have have images of all the characters burned into my mind, and the characters that you discover in this first book of the series are not what you got on the TV screen. I also find it fascinating that a veteran lawman such as Walt Longmire would be so confused as he was in this book. For those who have not watch the TV show or read the books, Longmire is a County Sheriff in Wyoming and he has a cast of characters surrounding him in the Sheriff's Office that are all different and unique. some of that uniqueness comes across in the book but it's not at all how they are portrayed on the TV screen. Obviously the author had an image of what he wanted from his characters, and I don't think the TV series depicts the characters in the same manner.Nonetheless, this is a book that took me longer than I expected to read and got bogged down at many places. Lots of discussion about guns, Indian traditions, past crimes all of which will hopefully set the stage for future books. But for our first book I felt the author got in too much detail and that detail actually got in the way of the story. I know there are a lot of people who like this series, and I'm not going to give up on this, but I must admit the first book does not make me want to read the second book of the series in the near future.

His younger brother Billy has been living with a neighbor and his daughter Sally. Unbeknownst to all, two other juvenile offenders have escaped in the trunk of the car carrying Emmett to his home. Emmett and Bill want to head West to San Francisco but are shocked when Wooly and Dutchess appear, both of whom still have time to serve at the facility. And with this all things go haywire, as the 4 boys make side trips, and then Dutchess steals Emmett’s car to go to New York to claim Wooly’s inheritance. This forces Emmett and Billy to ride the rails to try and find the other two in NYC. And so it goes. I found the first half of this book tedious and put it aside for 6 months. It was easy to get back into the story, as each chapter has multiple narrators. It picks up steam and comes to a shocking ending in Upstate New York.

I also listened to I am a big fan of the author Robert Harris, and yet for some reason I had not read this book until I saw it was made into a movie. I also listened to the author on a podcast and that also compelled me to read the book and gave me a bit of background as to what he was trying to do with this book. Now obviously everyone is aware of the Munich Agreement and Neville Chamberlain's “Peace is at hand” statement. What this book tries to do is give us some perspective on that, and what Chamberlain may have been thinking about during his negotiations with Hitler and attempting to peacefully resolve the Sudetenland crisis in Czechoslovakia.This is a fast reading and interesting book, and yet it also is troubling to me in that Harris is trying to rewrite history. He stated his purpose was to sort of veer away from the Churchillian view of history, and instead make Chamberlain a much more sympathetic and understandable character, as well as why peace was what he wanted and yet which he could not truly obtain. We also have the story of two former Oxford friends, one who works for the German foreign ministry (Von Hartmann) and the other who is a deputy press secretary for the Prime Minister of England (Legat). These two don't really meet until 2/3 of the way into the book but we see what they're trying to do and some of the problems that they are encountering. I found much of this to be contrived and how both of these individuals got to be included in the delegations that came to Munich is rather hokey in my opinion. We also have some rather unnecessary views into Legat’s, marital situation which does absolutely nothing to further the plot. We also see Von Hartman having a dalliance with a secretary which again does not do much to move the plot along.Basically Von Hartman, is part of the opposition to Hitler, and is trying to do anything possible to keep this peace agreement from being signed because he has seen documented evidence that all Hitler was trying to do was get this foothold into Czechoslovakia and use it as a launching ground into an invasion into Western Europe. Obviously this document never existed and is merely a literary device to move the plot along. It is a fascinating attempt to see what was behind Hitler's move into Czechoslovakia which was really twofold in nature. The first being Germans being allowed to live in a unified Germany, and the second being how do you feed and sustain these people. in the long run the Munich agreement is signed, we all know the results which was merely a postponement of the invasion of Czechoslovakia and eventually World War Two. Chamberlain’s place in history, which might very well have been sympathetic, was not practical and did allow Hitler to fortify his military during the intervening period prior to his invasion of Poland.Of all the books that I have read by Harris this has been my least enjoyable, but I wanted to read it before I saw the movie, because I want to see how all of this is treated and how it is differs from the book. I hope it differs substantially, but I doubt that. All in all it is a good effort, but I don't think it is the quality effort that I've come to expect from most of Harris’ work. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jan 29, 2022","Feb 05, 2022","Jan 29, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36114376-munich

This is the first novel of the set, and he deals with the beginnings of the Judean war, lays out many of the characters who I think will appear in later volumes of this series, and gives us a tremendous historical lesson in this fictionalized book. Some people get five star ratings due to th beauty of their writing, others because of the genre they write in, and this historical fiction novel gets my highest rating because of the detailed research that went into the book, the history that's behind the book, and how Blixt is able to incorporate all of that into a highly readable novel.We meet many characters in this book, but I think the three main characters are the twin brothers Judah and Asher, along with the newly appointed general Yosef, who general Vespasian gave the Romanized name of Josephus, a name many people are familiar with due to his histories of the Jewish faith and Jewish wars. While the twin brothers are no doubt the center of the novel, and heroes of the novel, Josephus comes off as both a dreamer who thinks he may be the Messiah, as well as an opportunist, and a rather unlikable character who is more concerned about his future glory than about the siege and the overall course of the war.We also get many supporting characters who Blixt is able to flesh out for us, one of the most impressive is Eleazar whom everybody called Atlas. He is a giant of a man, a person who does incredibly heroic work and is a favorite of his fellow Judean warriors as well as myself. Yes, there is a lot of history in this but it is a fascinating read, it is a read that moves along quickly and to be honest I could not put the book down. I have read other works of Blixt which are very good, but which tend to be extremely lengthy and are a bit difficult for me to read in there paperback version. Here I decided to go with a Kindle version of the book and I found it much easier to follow and read.If you like historical fiction, that is fiction based on true history in which most all the characters are realistic historical figures, then this is a book you should read. It does a very good job of outlining the beginning of this war, the siege that is the center of the book as well as preparing us for what's to come in the future novels.

So it finally came time for me to read the first of the Benny Griessel series. I found the book slow to begin with but then it picked up speed as all the different plots and characters became more cohesive. This is a book about both Benny and his individual demons, as well as his hunting down of a serial killer who has been executing individuals who have committed horrible crimes against children. We also have interwoven with this the story of a prostitute and her Colombian boyfriend which eventually leads to the resolution of the case.The first section of the book was rather slow moving because I could not grasp all the different parts of this plot. We have the prostitute talking to a minister, we've got Benny who is an alcoholic and we've got the individual who became a serial killer and the story as to what happened that led him to become this executioner. By the time we got to the second section which was just about Benny, basically, things started to become clearer and I can understand why the author uses him in his own series of books. Benny is a fascinating character who has sunk almost as far as you can due to the effects of alcoholism, and so we follow him as he tries to clean up his act and also catch the killer.I can't say this is my favorite of the books that I have read by Deon Meyer, but I can see where this character is going to grab my attention and I'm thinking the future books are going to be even better. This is well written, as always, once I could make my way through all the different subplots, I thought everything worked well together and, again, as I got about halfway into the book I couldn't put it down. If you have not read any books by Meyer I think he does a wonderful job of explaining the political and police situation over in South Africa, and I find his works extremely realistic. I'm looking forward to the remaining books in this series!...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jan 03, 2022","Jan 16, 2022","Jan 03, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11521752-devil-s-peak

It is a book all about the history of clocks, or as it is known in the business “Horology.” TheThis is one of the most unique books I have ever read. It is a book all about the history of clocks, or as it is known in the business “Horology.” The author is a clock historian, has worked at the Greenwich Observatory and has been the president of the worldwide horological society. I can think of nobody else better qualified to write such a book. Now this is not a book that everyone is going to want to read, and even if you read it it's not exactly the book you're going to read at breakneck speed. There is a lot of great history in there, as he examines 12 different clocks and how those clocks represent different ways in which the clock and time have been used to organize society. I never realized how many wonderful clock stories there are, nor did I realize how many different types of clocks were out there and what were the reasons behind the uses of these clocks.He begins by the downing of Korean Air flight 007 and explains how that attack would have been preventable had there been GPS navigational systems in place. From there he takes us all the way back to Roman times with the Sundial which was used to create order in society. A lot of people weren't happy with the sundial because they didn't want to be told what time to eat or to do something. The clock was telling society it was time to do certain activities at certain times. Later chapters take a look at how clocks, and all different types of clocks, were used to instill faith, virtue as well as order in the marketplace. We see clocks used for manufacturing purposes, or misused in some cases, as well as for morality and resistance. It truly is a fascinating and wonderful book, for me. This might not appeal to everyone out there but if you like nonfiction reading this is a real winner.Now you may wonder if I extol the virtues of this book so much why I only gave it a four star rating. The reason being that this is a book of 12 chapters and I found the last 1 1/2 chapters to be more philosophical about clocks and society as viewed by the author. There's nothing wrong with that, but to me if you only have 12 chapters and a little more than one chapter is not that great then you don't get a five star rating. But other than that this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. I have regaled my family with clock stories during the time I have read this book. I had never heard of this book until I was listening to a podcast called Constant Wonder where the author was being interviewed and it was a fascinating interview that made me want to go out and buy the book. I am very happy I did and I'm very happy to recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the history of clocks, and the history of our global civilization....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Dec 28, 2021","Jan 29, 2022","Dec 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55298389-about-time

I have read many o Eight years, yes, eight years ago I purchased this book and it has been sitting looking at me from my library shelf all that time. I have read many other books and yet this book kept waiting for me to pick it up. Finally I did and I cannot figure out what took me so long. This is a marvelous work by Colum McCann and one that is divided into 3 sections. The first section takes a look at three different trips from America to Ireland. The first by aviators in 1919, the two gentlemen that were first fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. The next was a look at the 1846 trip by Frederick Douglass and what he encountered while in Ireland. The final trip is that of George Mitchell, the former U S Senator became the lead peace negotiator for what is now known as the Good Friday agreements. These are well written fictional accounts of actual events and I thought it gave a deep look into the minds of these gentlemen during their trips and while they were in Ireland.	The second portion of the book is about 3 generations of women and how their lives intersected the lives of these gentlemen in the first portion. We see the overlap in their stories, and we also learn much more about these women’s lives. The first was a servant in Ireland who eventually made it to America and faced sadness and difficulties as well as finding a new level of respect in this country. The second was her daughter who, due to no fault of her own, was unable to secure a job in America as a journalist, and instead moved to Canada where she raised her small daughter, and was present when those aviators flew over to Ireland in 1919, and who goes back to Europe in her old age to interview the one survivor of that flight. While there her daughter meets the man who will become her husband and she is the third story we follow. She loved tennis, it was from that love of tennis that she has a very brief encounter with George Mitchell but her life was so much more than that an encapsulates the hopes and dreams of Ireland.	The third section is about the final generation of women from the family, and the anguish that she felt when her son was taken from her when he was 19.You can feel the pain and loss and heartache that this woman has suffered from as she is now the last of this family of women, there are no other heirs. But it is a resilient group of ladies who I think make up the best portion of this book.	This is a well written book, containing some beautiful language and some absolutely wonderful descriptive portions. On the whole I felt that the book was a very smooth read with the only real slow part being a portion of the Frederick Douglass trip. But despite those slow pages, this is a solid 5***** effort. ...more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,"Dec 28, 2021","Jan 08, 2022","Dec 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16085517-transatlantic

It is the first book of a new series that features Paris Police Detective Henri Lefort. Had no idea what to expect and I must admit that I was blown away by this first book. So well done, such a fascinating plot and well-defined characters. It was a joy to read this book, and the way it was written tells us so much about the characters backgrounds. Just Superb!!!!	Lefort is a Robbery Detective in Paris during the beginning of the German occupation of WW2. The events take place about 6 weeks into their overthrow of France and we can feel the anger and resentment in most all the Parisians. Lefort is called to investigate a burglary at the home of Princess Bonaparte, yes the distant relative of Napoleon. Lefort makes a big discovery and impresses everyone, so much so that the next day he promoted to be a Murder Detective and is given the unenviable task of having to solve the murder of a German Officer. The officer had been assigned to The Louvre, and was deciding what works of art should be “repatriated” to Germany when he was killed. Lefort is given, by other German officers, a list of suspects, as well as being directed that he is not allowed to enter the Louvre in order to solve the murder. Not only that, he has been given a one week time limit to resolve the case! 	He enlists the help of the leading secretary in the police office, and together they try and find a killer. Along the way the Princess has her home coonfiscated by the Nazi’s and has to move into an apartment, from which she contacts Henri and advises him that she studied and worked with Sigmund Freud and that she herself is a psychoanalyst. Henri was in WW1 and still has much emotional baggage and so she helps him begin to get over those matters. This is a marvelous way that Pryor gives us the backstory of Henri Lefort and we learn much about his life, his service in WW1 and is great way to tell two separate stories in one book and set up so much more for future books. You can hopefully see Henri, his secretary Nicola, and Princess Mimi Bonaparte in future books. 	Suspects are killed, the mystery deepens, and the motivating factor for Lefort is that if he cannot solve this case in a week, then Lefort himself will be tortured and killed. 	This is a great read, a fast read and one that will most likely explore much of the French/German relations of WW2 in future books in this series. If you like history and detective novels this is a great book for you. I was so impressed that I have already gone out and purchased the initial book of his first series. This is a quality writer and a book that most everyone will thoroughly enjoy and not want to put down until the very end. Oh, so good, and oh so many fascinating characters and plotlines.

There is no doubt that there are some fun episodes and escapades that are recounted in this book, but on the whole the book is a ponderous read for someone who is not into steampunk and science fiction writing. At over 1100 pages it is definitely too long and my copy of the book was in a tiny font size which made it very difficult to read.This is a book about the adventures of a group of hot air balloonists that takes place over the course of many years and takes them to many different locations, some of my favorite being Chicago and Iceland. The tales are fanciful and imaginative but it's too much. As I said this reminds me so much of Jules Verne’s works, specifically his first book “Five Weeks in a Balloon”, as well as his other novels. The beauty about Verne is he rarely left his home in France and all these travels were in his imagination. This is exactly what we have with this book. I know there are some who believe this is a wonderful book, I'm glad that I took the time to read it, but I think that I will prefer some of Pynchon’s other books, specifically Mason and Dixon which has a more historical fiction feel to it.I give this a low rating because I just did not click with this book, and if you don't have that feeling about a book it's hard to give it a good rating.

It is an outrage and one lady has had enough, and it is Brunnetti's wife!!!!! Yes, Brunnetti is sound asleep when he gets a call from the police station that his wife is there.

Even though she is not his personal secretary, he taps her for her vast computer skills and she is eventually able to find a connection between the manner of death, and a few other cases with similar M.O.'s in Italy. This is a wonderful book that really shows the personal strife the Brunnetti family undergoes thanks to Paula's vandalism at the travel agency, and how it affects their marriage and relationship (no fear, the Brunnetti's love each other), how it spills over into his work and their social life and that it is not until the murder is solved that it becomes apparent that the killing was not caused or related to Paula Brunnetti's actions. Well plotted, fast paced, and just a solid read for Donna Leon fans. I do believe you need to begin this series with Book 1 to see how the characters grow and evolve.

This book is loaded with a lot of interesting facts about Vesalius, a person I had never had heard of until this book.Good historical fiction that begins by setting out the basics of the narrator Jan Van den Bossche, who is presented as both a childhood friend and ""astral twin"" of Andreas (they were born on the same day of the same year and only a few blocks apart. Jan is a fictional character who carries this tale of Vesalius from their first friendship at school, and for a first time author I was very impressed with how Blumenfeld then carried this tale throughout the book, as he skips from college years to Jan receiving notice that Velanius died returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and was buried on the Greek island of Zante. This prompts Van den Bossche to embark on his own pilgrimage to Zante to say goodbye to his old friend. Along the way Van den Bossche stops at numerous towns along the way, and at each town he meets people who had been a part of Vesalius's life and we learn more details through these sources, be they a Cardinal who was an old friend, a printer, professor, etc. We learn about Vesalius's love of anatomy from an early age, and his pursuit of perfection so that he had at the time of his death the most advanced anatomy book in the world. While preferring Academia, he is ""reduced"" to being the court physician of Charles V and Phillip II of Spain, a position that his forefathers had held but one that he was not suited for. But due to troubles at Court, Andreas went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but died on Zante on his return trip. This is what prompts Jan to make his trip because he wants to pay a final tribute to his friend. But when he arrives at Zante things are not as all as he expected and this segment of the book is really strong and well done. We meet so many characters, all of whom are well developed, and we meet Anne, the love of Jan's life who eventually married Andreas, and now as Andreas' widow Jan is hopeful that upon his return to Brussels she will marry him. This is a fast read, and well plotted book, a book that you cannot put down, and is filled with revelations from the first chapter to the last page of the book.

Daniel James Brown, who previously wrote ""The Boys in the Boat"" has a foAn absolutely spectacular book to which I give an enthusiastic 5***** rating. Daniel James Brown, who previously wrote ""The Boys in the Boat"" has a follow up book that in my opinion dwarfs any of his other works. He has done a magnificent job in telling the stories of Americans of Japanese Ancestry (AJA) who suffered and sacrificed during WW2. He has used extensive sourcing for this story, including personal interviews when possible as well as oral history archives. Life was never easy for many people who arrived in both the US or Hawaii (at the time of WW2 Hawaii was not a state). These were hard working people, people who came to the US and could not attain US Citizenship, but their US born children were full American citizens. They rose from menial jobs to having their own small businesses, owning homes, being productive farmers, etc. And then came the attack on Pearl Harbor.Americans don't want to talk about War Relocation Camps, Exclusion Zones, prejudice, racism and loss of American liberties, but fortunately for all of us the author does a fantastic job of detailing this and so much more. He makes the reader feel the pain and humiliation that those AJA experienced and felt directly, as the US succumbed to fear and the feeling that anyone who had Japanese ancestry had to be a spy for or loyal to Japan. People were unceremoniously rounded up and sent to holding areas before being shipped off to their horrific Relocation Centers. And to assist in telling the story the author follows about 15-20 different people as we see how this shameful part of our History affected these people or their families.Eventually the young men in the camp were given the option of enlisting in the US Army, as we were going to form an All-Japanese division to fight in Europe. We follow them through Basic Training, and get a glimpse at the harsh reception they got in Hattiesburg, MS, even when they went into town in their US Military uniforms. They all became part of the 442 Infantry Regiment that made its way over to Italy where they were given assignments and missions that none of the other units were able to complete. They served heroically, bravely and did what nobody else could do. They broke the back of the German army in Italy and their reward was a trip to France and Germany where they once again were given the tasks that no other unit could accomplish, all of which culminated in their rescue of the Lost Battalion. The Lost Battalion was a group of Texans that got themselves surrounded by the German Army and were in fear of being totally annihilated. The 442 was sent in to rescue that group. The weather was horrid, the terrain unforgiving, the Germans pouring massive firepower at them, but eventually these young men (men who were denied their liberties here in the US) broke through. The 442 lost 800 men in order to rescue 200. These were warriors, these were heroes, these were ordinary kids most of whom had their parents still living in the War Relocation Centers. But the story continues after the war, as they and their parents many times felt continuing prejudice and lived in fear for their lives and property. And as a bonus we also get to follow a conscientious objector who challenged the system, who was respected by all he met be they prosecutors, FBI agents, cellmates, etc. He even was allowed to make his own way to the prison in Arizona when there were no funds or agents to take him there, and so he hitchhiked to his own prison term and when he arrived he was treated as a hero by the inmates. There are stories galore in this book and page after page we meet wonderful characters, shake our heads in both despair and amazement, and by the end I must give a huge THANK YOU to Daniel James Brown for writing this book, as well as for all those AJA who suffered and who served in WW2. The book is both inspirational and cautionary, it makes us think of service, valor, sacrifice, humiliation, shame and it teaches us many lessons - never take our lives and liberties for granted because if we do some politician or foreign power is always waiting in the wings to try and deny us those very things we hold near and dear.A final note, it is refreshing to read a book that focuses on Japanese Americans. Most history books and movies ignore these individuals, as they concentrate on the War in Europe and the Pacific theater us ignored. We still have voluminous books on the treatment of the Jews in WW2, but nobody wants to remember what we did to our own citizens. Thanks Daniel James Brown what a wonderful book, what an amazing topic, and what a history lesson you teach in a book I could never put down!...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Oct 13, 2021","Oct 20, 2021","Oct 13, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56377238-facing-the-mountain

I enjoy the series, and intend to read all of the books, but this book just did little for me. Yes we got some detailed writing about Nazi torture in 1933, yes we seemed to get some inside info on many of the movements leading figures, but other than this the book was flat. First 1/3 of the book was nothing more than recapping prior 2 books and updating characters a bit. I still cannot understand why Lanny married Irma since they are so mismatched and most of the book just continued to show this. And they have a child they never see, who is left with nannies/matrons until Irma needs to see her baby again. Lanny shows no paternal instincts. Lanny goes from an intriguing character to an irritating individual who care more about his Pink (Socialist) friends than he does his wife and family. Lanny is a total zero in terms of what he does, as he has made himself into an art dealer but has no idea as to the real world despite being part of that world. I want to continue this series to see if Lanny will grow up or will he continue to be our Socialist voice fo Upton Sinclair. I will say this for Sinclair, he has made Lanny into Forrest Gump before Gump was ever created. By that I mean, he greets, meets and his life intersects every major figure and event from the time he is 19. At Versailles, meets Mussolini, meets Hitler and Goring and Goebbels, and any other leading figure in the world. Yes, Sinclair uses this device to teach us world history since all of the events depicted in his books really happened, and Budd is just there to tell us about them and have his adventures as part of this. Not only that, I now understand the wealthy elite progressives in the world. Wealthy and well placed enough to believe a lot of this ideology, and to be able to promote it. To each their own, but I get it now as to how Millionaires and Billionaires can become socialists. The other big drawback for me is that the last 1/3 of the book is a slow slog as Lanny tries to get a friend out of prison and what he must go through to do so. Realistic? Not sure. Dramatic? Yes. 100 pages too much? Yes. Again, I am enjoying this series less and less with each slow moving book and hope that things will pick up in future volumes. A Pulitzer Prize winner?

What differentiates this book from all the others is that it begins with his Abdication and then takes an intimate, very intimate look at his personal life in the newly created title as the Duke of Windsor. Of course Wallis Simpson is also covered in detail and what we seem to get here is a man who was infatuated with a woman (Wallis), gave up his crown “for love” and yet from day 1 of the abdication Wallis Simpson dreads this relationship and never really wanted to marry him. But they did marry and their marriage has created a myth of love and devotion that just was not there. Don’t fall for the story as told by The Crown, once the Duke left England he rarely returned and the Royal Family wanted nothing to do with all his schemes for postings and official British positions, and certainly wanted nothing to do with Wallis Simpson.Drawing on books, articles, diaries, letters, official British documents and German documents we get a completely different view of this man, a man who considered himself more German than British, who sided with Hitler, wanted peace treaties that would make England a servant to Germany and if this happened Hitler agreed that the Duke should become Monarch once again England would become like Vichy France. This is a truthful expose that peels back the myth and lets us see so many different sides of the Duke that we almost do not recognize him. This is a man who told the Germans they needed to bomb England in order to get them to the peace table, a man who was a huge security leak, a woman who had intimate ties to the Nazi’s, and a lifelong desire to be given the title of Her Royal Highness (HRH). Why wouldn’t the Duke return to England after his abdication? He did not want to pay income taxes!!! The couples entire life was made up of parties, ripping off merchants for goods the never paid for and a rather bizarre sex life. Let me just say Gay and Bisexual! Yep.

It is different in that it is the story of Zet Van Heerden, a former South African police office who quits the force due to emotional issues and works as a down and out private detective. The action begins on Page 1, as he is jail after a drunken night ended in a brutal beating he took from 4 men in a bar. Nonetheless, an attorney gets him released and takes him to the office of a female attorney who has a problematic case that must be solved in 7 days. The book is divided into sections relating to each day prior to what is called D-Day as well as the events on that day.The case is fascinating, although Zet wallows in self-pity for about half of the time. A man was found tied to a chair. He was tortured by a blowtorch and then killed with a US automatic weapon. Not only that, his walk-in vault was opened and everything in there was removed, including a Will that left the property to his live-in girlfriend of 14 years who knows little or nothing about the case. Interspersed with the action of this case are alternating chapters revealing the backstory of Zet Van Heerden. From childhood, to his parents, to why he became a policeman, to his rise and fall in the force. It is quite a ride that Meyer takes us on and, as always, he fills the book with wonderful characters and details. By the end of the book we understand Zet, the motives behind the crime, as we follow a trail of blood, guts, murder, as well as a 25-year old secret.

It is a touching story of an Irish gentleman who is married and has 5 daughters, and owns his own coal/timber business. He has no idea who his father was, since the birth certificate was marked Unknown, and after his mother died he was raised by a neighbor.. He reflects on his life, he reflects on not having a father, on never getting the one thing he wanted from Santa Claus - a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle about a farm.

This book features Captain Mat Joubert who is still reeling more than 2 years after his wife (also a police officer) was killed on assignment. He has left himself go, gained weight, drinks and smokes too much, has gotten sloppy in his work when into his life come two cases, plus a new demanding boss. The boss demands all of his officers get in shape and he gives them deadlines to lose weight, as well as informing Joubert he must see a psychologist. This is on top of a serial murder spree that seems to have no connecting links to each murder, along with a series of bank robberies at Premier Bank branches in which a gun, similar to that used in the murders is used to intimidate the bank tellers, and in which each incident the robber uses a different disguise. And who does Joubert eventually assign to this case? Future lead character Benny Griessel! Griessel catches your attention from his very entry in the book and it is easy to understand why he became the focus of future books.

One of the main issues I had with this book is the title. I had expected a much more detailed look at those people living in America at the time and the contrast between the Revolutionaries and the Loyalists. It never really meets the standard laid out in the title. We do have lots of information on Washington, Franklin, John Adams, as well as the politicians in London and Paris, but as to the average loyalist in America there are very few glimpses of their lives. Yes one or two do shine through but this book is basically about the elites and how things maneuvered during this period. Fascinating book in that regard, with a heavy emphasis on personal correspondence and diaries of these individuals (sometime a tad bit too much verbatim quotations). And we see the highs and lows among the rulers in England, the Congress in Philly, our military leaders and the difficulties that all parties had during his momentous period of World History.

First time author, Lindsey Fitzharris, is a biography of Joseph Lister who was a pioneer in surgery in Victorian era Scotland and England. She has given us one of the most easy read biographies that I have ever had the pleasure to come across. While Joseph Lister is the star and focus of the book, there is so much to learn about medical practices of the time, and how he struggled to overcome older surgeons belief that ""hospital stink"" was the reason so many patients died. Oh, it was a primitive time in the 19th century, and the levels of care and cleanliness that we are accustomed to are nowhere to be seen, as surgeons were lower tier doctors and speed was essential since for about half of the 19th century surgery and amputations were gruesome procedures: no gloves, bloody surgical instruments used again and again, as well as lack of clean and sterile dressings and wards. The rich had surgery performed at their homes, usually on dining room tables, while the poor went to the hospitals, where many died due to infections after surgery.I was completely unaware of this world, and Fitzharris has done such a great job of making it a readable book, one that does not dwell on the gruesome but rather on Lister's life and attempts to save patients lives and bring much needed changes to the field of surgery. Fitzharris, as a novice author, does a super job of telling an engaging story and did not need 800 pages (as most biographies tend to just go on and on) to relate a most compelling story. A fantastic biography, well written and well researched, and I cannot wait for her next biography which is in the works.

What a remarkable book that takes a true ""inside"" look at Churchill and his War Cabinet during the most crucial days of WW2. This is part of a group of books the author has written which examine WW2 and Churchill and despite its short length it provides so much insight as to how Churchill was able to turn the political tides in the UK and his War Cabinet at the time of the disastrous defeat and retreat from Dunkirk of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Taken from official British documents that had only been released prior to writing this book, as well as secret public opinion polls that were conducted daily, and a multitude of public and private diaries, Lukacs is able to give us a glimpse of both the politics and the general publics impressions on the course of the war. After he replaced Neville Chamberlain, Churchill kept him in the War Cabinet and he became an ally of Winston, he also appreciated Churchill allowing him to remain living at 10 Downing Street even though he was no longer the Prime Minister. Also you discover how Lord Halifax and Churchill butted heads over policy and how Halifax was ready to accept peace offers from Hitler while the fighting still raged in France. Eventually Churchill prevailed and the naval retreat from Dunkirk was a success. During this entire time the British public was kept in the dark about the BEF, how poorly the French were fighting on their home soil and the state of the evacuation/retreat. Truly a remarkable work of research and a great addition to any library on WW2. The author ends the book with some very good observations on the state of democracy and a prediction of a new dark age that would be coming to darken the lives of our children and grandchildren.

This time Leon takes a direct aim at the Catholic Church, and even gets the secretive organization Opus Dei into the plot.The book begins with Brunetti actually in charge of the police station as his boss, Vice-Questore Patta is on vacation. Not much is happening, crime seems to have also taken a break until one day a young lady barges her way into Brunetti's office. She looks familiar, and yet he cannot place her. She knows him and her name is Maria Testa. Who is she, we finally find out she used to be Sister Immaculato who cared for Brunetti's mother in the nursing home. But Maria Testa has left the order and now tells Brunetti a story of how patients at the home have been dying suspiciously (in her mind), due to heart attacks when they had no heart issues, and has heard whispers that these people are being coerced into changing their wills and giving all their money either to the church home, or some other church organization. She has nothing to back up this claim. She merely ran away and began a new life in the world she left over a decade ago. Brunetti has no idea what to do to try and act on her suspicions other than some cursory inquiries which come up empty. But he is bothered by this, and this leads to a large portion of first half of the book in which Leon examines Brunetti and his wife Paola's religious beliefs, along with their daughters bad grade in religious instruction at school. Things really go nowhere until Maria is injured in a hit and run incident and relatives of the deceased also turn up dead. There are evil Mother Superiors, corrupt church officials and priests and also some seeming involvement in all of this by Opus Dei. Brunetti and his fellow officers have to try and untangle these secrets.

Yet, if Emile Zola is up to the task, I figured it was about time for me to start reading!And this is Book 1 of the series and introduces us to the founding families upon which this story is told. What is interesting about this book is its focus on the rather lower class of life in the fictitious town of Plassan in the south of France.

There is strong dislike by oldest on Pierre Rougon and he plots to have his mother (Aunt Didi) sell her house and give him the proceeds. Meanwhile he has successfully schemed to get his half-sister married and his half-brother Antoine Macquart enlist in the army with promises of future assistance. Didi sells the house, Pierre gets the money and now the story gets very interesting. Pierre marries the daughter of an oil-trader and never hits as big as both of them so desire and it is their quest for fortune and prestige that moves the story along. After years Antoine is back in the picture and is making a nuisance of himself and eventually sides with the Republicans and oppose all that Pierre and his wife are plotting as they are supporters of what will become the Second Empire. There is scheming, plots, family foibles and some interesting characters in this book, as even Pierre's children have divided loyalties.

The author has a great pairing of former Scotland Yard Detective, Daniel Wilson, along with his now fiancee Abigail Fenton, a world renown Archeologist. Together these two have been solving mysteries surrounding murders at some of Englands most well-known museum. Here they are called into the case by the owner of the wax museum, much to the dismay of the higher ups at Scotland Yard, who are angry and yet jealous of the publicity and credit that the ""Museum Detectives"" receive instead of Scotland Yard. Here we have the beheading death of a night watchman at Madam Tussauds, and the official investigation leads in one direction, while Wilson and Fenton do not buy the official investigation. Oh, we have multiple murders of folks with connections to the ""Wax Business"" along with a string of high profile banks being broken into and robbed of most in their safe deposit boxes. Are the cases connected and, if so, how are they related since nothing seems to make sense.A rollicking good tale filled with a lot of background on Madam Tussaud, the wax museum business, Florence Nightingale and a host of characters that keep you guessing until the very end. If you like historical mysteries, and page-turning books that keep you up at night, then this is the author for you, and Murder at Madame Tussauds is a perfect book for you....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jun 19, 2021","Jun 23, 2021","Jun 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56819727-murder-at-madame-tussauds

No we have Senator Paul Morelli, who is being groomed to run for President, and DeMarco is sent to investigate the death of a rather hum drum journalist who refuses to believe the autopsy results and in sure something criminal happened to the young man. But when DeMarco investigates there is no evidence of wrong doing, but he does find a small slip of paper that contains a few names and dates, and also some indications that the journalist was investigating the Senator. But when tracking down these names he finds two women who refuse to talk about the Senator, any anyone else whose name is on the list has died. All of those individuals had somehow been political opponents of Morelli. But someone is killing them, and it appears that there is a powerful figure lurking in the background who somehow can assist Morelli. Lots of murders in this book, lots of twists and turns, and DeMarco involves the Mafia, the Texas Senator who will be Morelli's opponent in the next Presidential elections, as well as his good friend Emma (a retired espionage agent who knows everyone and everything).

This book concentrates on the world of faked museum pieces, specifically ceramics from the digs in Xian, China.It is different from her other books in that there seems to be a lot more attention paid to details on how ceramics is made, how it can be fake, how one can tell a fake, and more underworld fingers in this very fascinating and lucrative business.We begin with two characters from one of her earlier book, opera singer Flavia Petrelli and her female lover Brett Lynch who is an expert on all things ceramic and is involved in the Terra Cotta Warrior work over in China. Brett goes to open the door and is viciously attacked, so much so it requires hospitalization. Commissario Brunetti is assigned the case, and attempts to figure out why she was attacked, since the attackers told her to not keep a meeting with a museum official. A few days later that individual was killed in his office. And now Brunetti has to try and determine if the crimes were related and, if so, what is the motive. Of course we also have the typical Sicilian mafia figure who is part of the plot time. And, as it seems with many of Leon's books, there is not an absolute legal justice as part of the solution.This book had a good beginning and a slam bang ending but just lacked something. First of all, I thought it was too predictable and Brunetti came up with motive and villain way too easily. Second, we did not see much of the usual characters that inhabit these mysteries and which give the books their flavor. We did get an enlarged part for police secretary Signorina Elettra who is a great recent addition, but not much seen of his boss, Patta, or other police officers, nor many worthwhile scenes with his family (who again, are good supporting characters). Instead Brunetti solves the crime himself in a sort of lone wolf manner, all the while Venice is flooded with its usual February rains that makes the city basically a totally inhospitable place.A good book, not up to par with her earlier efforts but certainly enough to keep this loyal reader happy until I get to Book 6!...more",Notes are private!,0,38,2,"May 30, 2021May 27, 2021","May 30, 2021May 30, 2021","May 27, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18938973-acqua-alta

I am 68 years old and just finished this book by Cicero. It is a book that I recommend tI just do not have enough superlatives to describe this book. I am 68 years old and just finished this book by Cicero. It is a book that I recommend to one and all because it contains so much wonderful instruction and philosophy on the second half of our lives. Let me first say that this is a great translation by Phillip Freeman in which the Latin is on one side of the page in the English on the other side of the page. For those who are trained in Latin this must be a true joy, for me it took me back to my 7th and 8th grade Latin classes and I realized how little I learned. We go back almost 2000 years to the writings of Cicero in which he contemplated the end of life, and it's something that all of us should read and at a much earlier age than I did. There is wisdom for everyone from youth, to middle age, to retirement time. He goes through each stage of life and gives us wonderful insights, yes there are references to other Romans and Greeks who we might know nothing about but he uses them as examples. He is rarely derogatory and always complimentary. He looks for wisdom and how to live life and what to expect as you grow older and how some of the fervor and enthusiasm for life, now changes to a different type of living and a different type of enjoyment. Yes by the end Cicero was a farmer, and even shows how farming can parallel life and the enjoyment that we can get from the simple pleasures of watching a seed grow into maturity and harvesting. It is an analogy of life. This took me a little longer than I had expected to finish this book, It is not because the book is difficult to read or understand, but rather it's a book that makes you think, think about your life, and it is a book that allows you to put it down and pick it up a few weeks or a month later and not miss a beat. It is a book which I will probably read again next year, and maybe again after that because this short book contains much that can help us negotiate this second half of our lives. I particularly like when he points out that some of the traits of old age really are not due to old age, but rather are due to the character of that person's life. If you were sullen and grumpy during your first half of your life, you will continue that in the second half of your life. If you were happy, forward thinking and pleasant to one and all, then those traits will be amplified in senior citizens. He talks of life, death, pleasure, and the soul. I enjoyed this so much that I have gone out and purchased two other books on philosophy, and maybe it's too late for me to learn much about youth, but quite possibly I can continue learning so that I can instruct my children and younger people who may have questions and issues about life and what to expect. In a way I think this  has gotten rather philosophical, but that's what happens when you read Cicero or any other of the classic philosophers and thinkers of that ancient era. Too often, today, we get caught up in the current day-to-day issues in our life and don't think about how we can live the best possible life. How there are bigger and more important issues that surround us, and too much at the time we are mired in minutia instead of thinking about what will truly make our life better and how we can help others lead a better life.

A few chapters are quite detailed but they move along at a jice clip, and then we get into the journey across Africa. Along the way we get a history lesson on the previous explorers, a science lesson on the aerodynamics of flight, as well as cultural, geographic and history information on Africa, its flora and fauna and the people who inhabit it along the flight path. To be honest, for 1863 this is quite a well-written and detailed book and one that holds up after my many internet searches. We have the initial excitement and all those first two weeks of discover, then the doldrums of the Sahara desert, warring tribes, exotic animals, danger and travails along the way and just a darn good adventure book!

I must admit to be in the former category and have come way now wanting to go back and read her prior works.	This is a book that is based, in part, on the Cambridge Spy Ring that notoriously passed along secret information to the Soviet Union before many of those same people defected to the USSR. And why espionage and spy novels have become sort of old hat, I find that Beatriz Williams has put a new and fresh take on this fascinating time period in her newest historical fiction book.	To begin with, the story is told in alternating chapters by two sisters: Ruth Macalister and Iris Macalister Digby, with a few chapters written from the point of view of a KGB agent in Moscow. Not only do the chapters alternate between the sisters points of view, the book also rocks back and forth between 1940, 1948 & 1952.	Ruth Macalister is a former model turned modeling agency executive, while sister Iris is married to Sasha Digby, a former US diplomat who is an avowed Communist and whom from the very beginning you figure is not all he appears to be. All three of these characters meet while the brother of the Macalister’s is posted in Rome prior to the outbreak of WW2. Dinner parties and social gatherings abound and eventually after the outbreak of the war Ruth returns to New York, while Iris remains and marries Sasha and follows him on his diplomatic postings throughout the world. After the war Sasha defects to Russia and Iris follows her husband.	These are all the basic facts one needs to know other than that one day both Ruth and her aunt receive postcards from Iris asking that Ruth come to Moscow to help Iris with her 4th pregnancy. Iris has had 3 full term children, all with difficulties, and 2 miscarriages and eventually, despite the rift that occurred when Iris defected, Ruth is talked into going to aid her sister thanks to Sumner Fox, an FBI agent who goes along and poses as Ruth’s husband. 	The book traces the sisters relationship, the events that led to Iris following Sasha to Russia, Sasha’s spying for the Russians, and the efforts of Ruth and Sumner to extract Iris from Russia. It is a well written book, that brims with details the author has gleaned from extensive research into the Cambridge spy ring, and some of the individuals who were part of that and whose names and experiences we no longer remember.	Character development is really well done in this book, especially with using the alternating chapter viewpoints, and using a period of 12 years so that we feel we know these characters so very well, but there are twists and turns and it makes the book a fast and enjoyable read.

Bly was an intrepid journalist for the NY World and had an idea for a round the world journey to try and outdo the fictional record of 80, as written by Jules Verne. Her idea in 1888 was pushed aside, but by 1889 the World's circulation started to decline and out of the blue the newspaper decided it would be a great idea and so on 2 days notice Bly was sent on the journey in November. She traveled on an East to West course, with her first leg being on a steamer from New York to England. Not to be outdone, the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine had feature writer Elizabeth Bisland hustled to their offices and told her she had to now race around the world against Bly and beat her back to New York, but Bisland was going to go West to East and her trek began with a train trip across America - but she only had 8.5 hours to prepare and catch the train! This book is a story of the two ladies, their differing upbringing, differing writing styles, and their competition to get around the world faster than the other.

The Gunfight at OK Corral, another name everyone iTombstone, a town every western history buff has heard of, and one which I visited a few years ago. The Gunfight at OK Corral, another name everyone is pretty familiar with even if you are not a history buff. What happened, who is to blame, and can anyone really tell the real story about the town and the shootout? Many books have been written on this topi, many either side with the Earp's or with tyhe Clanton's. It is hard to find that middle ground of reality. This book tries, and does a good job with the history of Tombstone up until the Earp's enter the picture. It seems to me that when reading the first 200+ pages of the book this author makes every assumption or opinion agains the Earp family. It is funny, Wyatt comes to Tombstone with his common law wife and must hide due to that fact. Johnny Behan, who will become sheriff, comes with his common law wife and has no such worries according to the author. So many assumptions all fall against the Earp family and you begin to wonder about objectivity. And then we get into the gunfight.Is there anyone to blame? From my reading of this book and so many others, that blame falls squarely on the shoulders of Ike Clanton, a loud-mouth windbag who continually wants to shoot and kill the Earp's and who goads everyone into action. The second is John Behan who is almost a clownish example of a sheriff. His posses never find outlaws, he associates with the Cowboys, he lies to one and all, and he has numerous prisoners escape from his jail.Justice is a word used infrequently in the west and this book gives numerous examples of justice denied. Wyatt's vendetta ride is basically due to that lack of justice and how witnesses would lie to protect their friends, or family.This is a good book, I feel there are better, but it just continues to pile onto the already massive amounts of books on the topic. There is no right or wrong, there is no middle ground or ""real"" story. All that is lost in history, and even many of the new sources still are unable to give us the answer and reasons for the gunfight. However, even if you read this book you cannot come to any other conclusion that there was an inept, buffoon-like sheriff who wanted to be reelected, and wanted fame and fortune; and then there is the guy who just cannot shut up, who just cannot stop drinking and making threats about a fight but when the fight comes he usually runs away. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Apr 04, 2021","Jun 07, 2021","Apr 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9587101-the-last-gunfight

Fans of Ashley Weavers “ArmorThanks to NetGalley & St. Martin’s Press for providing me with a free copy of this book in return for my honest opinion.	Fans of Ashley Weavers “Armory Ames” series of mysteries are rejoicing at her newest heroine, Electra McDonnell, and for new readers this series should be a real treat. Having never read any of the Armory Ames book, I was unaware of the authors abilities with regard to plot, character development and plausible mystery resolution. Fear not! Ashley Weaver has done a great job in all aspects of this book.	We are introduced to Electra (who goes by the name Ellie) and the action begins on page 1, as she and her Uncle Mick are breaking into a house in order to open a safe and steal the items that were left there while the family was away. Yes, Ellie is a safecracker and thief, and as she and Uncle Mick are leaving the residence, during the London blackout, they are apprehended and taken to a non-police location. Who apprehends them? Why were they stopped? Are their lives in danger? All these thoughts go through Ellie and our minds. It is there that we meet Major Ramsey who gives Ellie and offer. Help open and safe and steal the contents, or be turned over to the police and go to jail. Ellie quickly decides to help the Major and the plot heats up.	Things don’t go as planned, and now Ellie is working for British Military Intelligence as she and Major try and discover what happened to the contents of the safe and how can they get them back and keep them from being placed in the hands of German spies. This in turn allows Weaver to introduce some additional characters, as well as mild romantic undertones and some truly comic scenes.	Before we know it Ellie is escorting Major Ramsey to a private function to view Chinese Porcelain and to scope out the 5 or 6 potential suspects who could have the secret items in their possession and are ready to betray their country since they feel there is little hope in stopping Hitler. But Ellie’s family and contacts now provide the Major with a most unlikely army of thieves and the story never falters. Totally believable, with fun and interesting characters and a definite inkling that there will be more espionage in store for Ramsey, Ellie and the most unlikely, and loveable, group of thieves that are all needed to do their part to help the British war effort.

This time Eric Ambler takes us to the very beginning of WorldOnce again, the father of the espionage thriller comes thru with another stellar effort. This time Eric Ambler takes us to the very beginning of World War 2, as we follow the exploits of British munitions engineer who is known only by his last name of Graham. We meet up with Graham while he is concluding his companies arms agreement with Turkey and before he leaves for London, the companies representative in Turkey takes him for a night of fun at a Cabaret in Istanbul. While there he is introduced to a sultry lounge dancer before he makes his way back to his hotel to finish packing for his trip home in a few hours.	Upon reaching his room, Graham opens the door and gunfire erupts. The shooter only grazes Graham before escaping out the window, and so begins Grahams “Journey into Fear.”He is quickly taken to the offices of Turkish security commander, Colonel Haki, who lays out the facts that this was not a random burglary gone bad but rather an attempt by the Germans to kill him so as to delay the delivery of the weaponry to Turkey.	Instead of heading out on a train, Graham soon finds himself about a cargo ship bound for Genoa from where he can quickly get across the border into France and then make it back to London. The timeline of the book is fascinating since while Poland has been invaded, France is not considered to be in danger of falling, and Italy is technically neutral, all of which help with the plotline and action.	Onboard the boat Graham has very few fellow passengers since there are only 10 cabins, but one of those cabins belongs to sultry dancer Josette and her husband/partner Jose. Jose is unpleasant and it is obvious to all but Graham that Josette is latching onto him for a good time in Paris before Graham returns home to his wife. We also have a feuding French couple, a German archeologist and his constantly ill wife, a French couple and an Italian mother and son who serve no purpose other than to play bridge at key times so as to allow Graham some free time.	At their first port, which is Athens, the boat takes on a new passenger who turns out to be the person who tried to kill Graham in Istanbul and who is a paid Romanian assassin. But there also is a Turkish tobacco salesman on board who always seems to be hovering around Graham at important times.		Graham now discovers his life is in danger on the boat, from not one but two different people. Who can he trust, how can he escape the boat, how can he get out of Genoa alive and how can he finally get back to London? All these problems are part of a well-devised plot and Ambler again puts an untrained regular person right in the middle of WW2 intrigue. A fish of our water, can Graham somehow manage to extricate himself and who, if anyone will be able to assist him?

Here we are with the 5th book in his Barsetshire Chronicles and he takes us into the world of how the upper classes of society work in England when it comes to love, courtship, etc. I must admit, Trollope has given us a host of unlikeable characters led by a few selfish sisters who just exude a high and mighty attitude and totally unbelievable actions and reactions. This book revolved primarily around the people who live in the small house at Allington and are the sister-in-law and nieces of the squire who owns the land. Everyone we come in contact with loves these young ladies (ages 19 & 21) and many want to marry them. One cousin (male), wants to marry his other cousin (Bell - female) and she turns him down. A friend of the male cousin proposes to the younger sister (Jill) and then she accepts, but after that he now has reservations as to how this will crimp his style in London because he is not rich. He quickly leaves and visits some aristocratic family in another area and within days he proposes to Lady Alexandrina and she accepts - yep, Mr. Crosbie is now engaged to two women. So we have this situation going on, all the while family friend Johnny Eames (he who is called Hobbledehooded throughout) loves Jill and keeps asking for her hand in marriage and she keeps refusing even after her 2-week engagement ended. Lots to write about for all these characters and Trollope is never one to skimp on words! It is both a fascinating, as well as frustrating book for me in that everyone really is unhappy until the very end when 2 of the characters seem to have found happiness.

For a few years he seemed to have lost his edge, but this 3rd installment of his 2nd LA Quartet is a wonderful read, a book that is hard to put down and for fans of his style of writing it makes us look forward to his next effort.	Once again Ellroy features infamous LA cop Freddy Otash to give us the scoop as to the happenings in the early 1950’s in this fictionalized look at varied topics. We have politicians, movie stars, wannabe actors, Communists, pornography, murders, muscle, drugs, and so much more. But much of this book is built around the Caryl Chessman kidnapping/rape/murder trials that rocked Los Angeles for a few years.	Otash tells his story as a confession as to his part in much of this, since the book begins over 20 years since Freddy has died and he is in Purgatory and has been told he can move on from there if he tells the truth about what really happened in these affairs. In real life Otash was a fixer, and with that background it allows Ellroy to spin story that is part fiction, part Otash memoir and is able to give us a lot of “dirt” on what really went on in LA. We meet a young James Dean, aspiring actress Lois Nettleton, Marlon Brando, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Senator Jack Kennedy. All come in Freddy’s orbit and each has as part to play in this saga, one in which Otash makes things happen and is there when things fall apart.	Being close to Ellroy’s age, I know the names, the movie scandals, the tattler sheets that Freddy helps along the way. Younger readers might not know the names, but his style of writing will keep one and all burning the midnight oil to keep up with the action as only Otash can tell it in a slang/hipster voice. A voice of one who was not at all adverse to doing bad deeds himself, and then using his ill gotten money to try and make things right if that is possible. 	Freddy Otash is a complicated person, a person who knows evil when he sees it and acts on it (sometimes for tabloid magazines and other times for personal reasons). It is the heyday of the hard-boiled LAPD. Movie studios demand results (can’t let public know Rock Hudson is gay), tabloids pander to readers who love the lurid tales that only Hollywood seemingly can provide, and Freddy Otash was there, was a part of it, made a lot of it happen and gives us a first-hand, birds eye look at one the most corrupt yes fascinating periods in the history of Los Angeles.

Landers, along with friends who had previously been a part of the British Intelligence Service began a political intelligence unit in London, and traveled the world gaining an insight into the “spy game.” For the third book in this series, Landers focuses on Poland and the events of the early 1980’s, which include the rise of Solidarity at the Gdansk Shipyard, and the eventual military takeover of the country by General Jaruzelski. And all of this begins with the assassination of a Turkish General in Russia. Thomas and Julia Dylan are there on a cultural city tour when the General is killed and nobody but Julia got a look at the assassin. Quickly the Dylan’s are brought back to England, debriefed, and soon are part of the UK assistance to a CIA devised Operation Coronation, all of which has to do with the return of the Crown of a medieval Polish king to a priest in Poland and which will allegedly cause the Polish people to rise and overthrow the government.As with the traditional espionage novels, Landers introduces us to characters from Russia, Poland, England and the US, along with his wife who always seems to be one step ahead of everyone in terms of understanding what is going on! We are taken into everyone’s points of views and ideas as to what has gone wrong with this plan, and see that uneasy cooperation between the CIA and British agencies involved in this.In addition to the death of the Turkish General, we also have an escaped Polish naval soldier who washed up on British soil by accident and whose story is too bizarre for anyone to make out. Landers also has the excellent ability to end a chapter with a hook that makes us want to continue reading since Dylan thinks one thing is happening and then in the last sentence of the chapter he relates that things aren’t as we expect. Lots of Polish history in the book and that history is the driving force behind the plots, counter plots and counter-counter plots! It is a fast paced and highly believable book, and even though it is the 3rd book in the series it can easily be read as a stand-alone book. Nobody does espionage like British authors, and Landers has mastered this genre and his setting in Poland in the early 1980’s is one that is both fresh and fascinating.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Mar 13, 2021","Mar 26, 2021","Mar 13, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57289654-coincidence-of-spies

Off we go to one of those other islands that comprise our lovely 50th state, but in this mystery by Eric Redman the beauty of Hawaii is hidden beneath the murder and mystery of Hilo, Waimea and other locations on “The Big Island”. What can look appealing at first blush, can many times hold deep secrets, angry indigenous people, fortune hunters and a whole lot more. And that is exactly what we get in this fast-paced book that grabs our attention from the very beginning when real estate developer, Ralph Fortunato, is found dead on a signature golf course and resort.	We follow Detective Kawika Wong, who is half-Hawaiian, as he attempts to get to the bottom of this murder, a particularly gruesome one in that Fortunato is found with an ancient Hawaiian spear having impaled him. And despite Wong’s past issues when he was a detective in Seattle, his boss has no qualms in having him try and unravel this crime.	Soon one murder becomes two, and then three, and bodies are piling up and despite quickly realizing that Fortunato is a shady developer now a whole lot of progress is made. But that is where angry indigenous people come in, as local native Hawaiian organizations are incensed that Wong seems to be focusing on one of their members as a prime suspect and we get to see the power of the press as, when Wong is made to appear responsible for these deaths. While nothing can be further from the truth, some strategically worded press releases turn Wong into a target. 	Sadly we see many throughout the book use “civic” organizations to pad their own agenda and how many of these groups are filled with bogus individuals. There are many native Hawaiians who have a dislike for what happened to their kingdom, but on the other hand many are also used by “haoles” to get their way when it comes to island developments.	Wong will eventually travel back to Washington state, where he gets advice from his mother and step-father, and continues to look into the murky past of Fortunato who had a similar bogus resort in the Methow Valley region of Washington also blow up in his face. And quickly discovers that wherever Fortunato goes, so goes mysterious deaths, and that everyone is happy to find out that he is finally dead.	A very interesting book, filled with lots of Hawaiian details and intrigue. “The Big Island” is a beautiful place, but also a very dangerous and deadly location, and one that we can only hope Redman will return to in future books.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Feb 28, 2021","Mar 20, 2021","Feb 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55262935-bones-of-hilo

After a baffling preface, we encounter a murder of a homeless man, which quickly spirals into all the behind the scenes evil that is happening in the most isolated portion of the County. And not only are there bad intentions, one of the main adversaries is the swelteringly hot weather that the area is experiencing during this time period. Galligan’s book is divided into sections and he uses as unique way of dividing the action. His sections are not made up the time of day, or the days of the week, but rather the temperature ranges during the period of the books plot. Every day the temperature is between 94 and 100+ and it drives lots of the action in the book.	Not spending a lot of time on typical character development, he is able to use the actions to help us understand the characters and their points of view in the book. There are multiple parts of the plot, none of which seem to be related until we get to the dramatic last chapters of the book.	Not only do we deal with multiple murders, Sheriff Kick also has many issues with her own family that helps drive the action, and makes us realize how hard it is for law enforcement to be concentrating on their work when their family has as many issues as Kick’s does. Throw in a bitter election campaign, sex slaves, crazed environmentalists/back to the earth people who live in caves, and a host of other unique characters and you will be reading at breakneck speed to reach the conclusion.	This may not be a book that some will like to read, but nonetheless it is a book that also makes us confront many of the issues of our day, and how such evil exists within our society.

This is one of the most eye-oThanks to NetGalley and Blackstone Publishing providing me with a free copy of this book in return for an honest .	This is one of the most eye-opening books I have personally read in years. It’s probably best described as a political thriller, with the main topics of the book being poaching and endangered species. Before the book even begins, the author gives us numerous pages of research that he did on the topic and he hooks you from that very Preface.	There is not a lot of major character development here, as many of the characters include Rhinoceros, Elephants, Sumatran Tigers and Pangolins. It is a book that takes us from South Africa to Tanzania, to China, Macao, and the jungles of Southeast Asia. While Staples writes a book that’s topic is not sexy, he writes a thriller that is both fascinating and educational as to the plight of these animals.	The book has numerous storylines that easily converge, as we follow a former soldier who was a park ranger at Kruger National Park in South Africa, a Chinese narcotics agent, and an insurance adjuster who is both clamoring for wealth as well as trying to protect these endangered animals.	The CIA are also drawn into this as there appears to be a link between poaching, endangered species, Traditional Chinese Medicine and the funding of terror organizations. And throughout the book we get an inside look at the Chinese triads that control this trade, along with being taken to remote jungle areas where tigers are bred for nothing more than being able to harvest their bones, bile, paws and even are used to make Tiger Wine. We also get an inside look at South African poachers who are decimating the rhinoceros and elephant populations all for horns and tusks that are turned into jewelry, and aphrodisiac powders. It is a world most of us know little to nothing about and which exists because it is next to impossible to stop.	This book may not be for the squeamish as the reader is exposed to the dark side of the this international trafficking, and distribution system and we also see how these animals are abused by these groups. 	This is a thriller like few others that I have read, and the author is going to give all his royalties from the book to anti-poaching organizations, and NGO’s that fight the daily battles on behalf of endangered species throughout the world. It is a book that shows the worst of humanity, as well as giving us hope that there are those out there who are doing all they can on behalf of the animal kingdom.

One day I am listening to one of my favorite British podcasts and they are interviewing Kate Moss, the author of this book series and I was captivated by her discussion. So, I did some research and found that this book is the first of a series she is writing. The 2nd book, City of Tears, has just been released, but I wanted to start with this book and it certainly did not disappoint. The book deals with the beginning of the French Wars of Religion between the Catholics and Huguenots, and we learn a great deal of history (much of which I was unaware of) and follow the lives of the Joubert family, along with Piet (Huguenot) and Vidal (Catholic priest) along with Vidal’s mistress Blanche. What a great way to both have a wonderful read and learn of all the complexities of this time period (1561-72), and all the hostilities and difficulties that people had to live with. Cities divided but holy wars. People who were neighbors now become enemies - and many of these people are drawn into the conflict as unwitting victims. Of course there is a really good mystery that also plays a large part in this book and which is something that propels some of the plot even though through most of the book the mystery remains hidden from us.

Fatal Fried Rice is the 7th book in the Noodle Shop Mystery series by Vivien Chien, who is one of the bright young authors in the cozy mystery genre. Each of her book titles take the name of a Chinese dish, and that it itself makes it a yummy entre into the world of mystery and murder that seems to always find its way into the life our narrator, Lana Lee.	Lana’s family owns a Chinese restaurant, the Ho-Lee Noodle House, and Lana’s world if filled with mysteries that she somehow always manages to stumble upon, and this book is no exception. Lana is no cook, and gets kidded by her sister about her lack of culinary skills, so she decides to take a Chinese cooking class at a local Community College. As luck would have it, tragedy strikes after the very first class, and as usual Lana is right in the middle of things.		Having left the class Lana realizes she forgot to get the shopping list handout and so she heads back into the classroom and there discovers the dead body of the class instructor, and to the lead detective Lana is the prime suspect, along with the school’s janitor who has a questionable past.	Knowing that she is in the crosshairs of the police, Lana is determined to both clear her name and discover the identity of the killer. She certainly has a knack for his since so many tragic events always seem to cross her path. Helping her is the usual cast of characters from her roommate Megan, to best friend Kelly, and the always helpful (as well as nosy) Mahjong Matrons who congregate each day for breakfast and mahjong at the Ho-Lee Noodle House. In addition, Lana rejects advice from her boyfriend, and that helps get her deeper in trouble but also closer to the killer.	As with all her books, Vivien Chien has created wonderful characters, a good plot and an enjoyable and sensible/realistic setting. Rather than create a cutesy and made up world, all of these books are set in Chien’s hometown of Cleveland, which adds to the flavor of her books. Chien is a prolific author and her 8th book will be out later this year, but for all her loyal fans and even newcomers, Fatal Fried Rice is a delicious order from the Noodle Shop Mystery Series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 30, 2021","Feb 17, 2021","Jan 30, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53138056-fatal-fried-rice

For her first novel, author YZ ChiThanks to NetGalley and Ecco for providing me with a free advance copy of this book in return for an honest .	For her first novel, author YZ Chin has written a unique book about immigrants in America, one woman’s search for her husband as well as trying to find herself. The book is written from the perspective of Edwina, the wife of Marlin, both of whom are immigrants from Malaysia who are here on work permits and trying to navigate the complexities of life in the US.	The uniqueness of the book starts from the beginning as this story is told as if we are Edwina’s therapist and she reveals much about the couples lives, work and the issues they encounter. We also find out that even though they are from Malaysia they have certain differences. Edwina is light-skinned, a vegetarian, heavy, has a rather difficult relationship with her mother and lacks much self-esteem. Marlin is dark-skinned, lean, a vegan, a computer coder and worships his recently deceased father. They work at different tech companies and both need to be sponsored in order to get their green card.	Despite coming from the same country the differences are quite obvious and drive much of this novel. Edwina feels that all is going well with her marriage until one day she comes home and Marlin has left. Their suitcase is gone, as well as the couples cat/dog (a toy they made for themselves, not a real animal, but nonetheless something that had become a family pet). What had happened? Was he kidnapped, had he wandered off, and where had he gone?	And so it is Edwina’s attempt to find Marlin, and all the while using us as her therapist to  her life, their life together and her experiences in New York. She tells us that something has changed in Marlin since they returned to the US after his father’s death, and tries to explore the full nature of these changes, whether she has done something to cause the changes and at the same time try to overcome the negative relationship she has with her mother. To put it mildly, Edwina has had to overcome a lot with her mother, who believes and tells Edwina stories as to why she is heavy, a vegetarian, has a mole on her face and much more. Even Marlin starts accusing her of having lovers, as it appears that he, too, has lost touch with reality prior to his disappearance.	While searching for Marlin, Edwina begins to eat meat, change her own lifestyle and begins to come to grips with her own life, as well as why Marlin has left. She finds him, but that is only part of the story. Edge Case is not a typical lost person novel, but rather is a story that makes us all reflect upon the deeper things that drive our lives, our loves and our own self-worth.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com  ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 17, 2021","Feb 09, 2021","Jan 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55782263-edge-case

Attorney turned author, Phillip Margolin, reThanks to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press/Minotaur Books for this free copy in return for an honest .	Attorney turned author, Phillip Margolin, returns with his 4th book in the Robin Lockwood series and this time she is faced with a murder trial that carries the distinct possibility of a death sentence. 	A real page turner that gives us down and out Joe Lattimore who has been reduced to living in a Tent City in Portland, OR, with his wife and infant daughter. Things appear desperate for Joe who was a former boxer and whose temper kept him from holding a job as a cook after his boxing days were over. He has no job, no prospects and no way to provide for his family until one night he went out for a jog and was stopped by a man who recognized him from his boxing days and offered him the chance to make $300 in an illegal no-holds barred fight.	Once Joe agrees to this, the action picks up and he is soon whisked away to a secret location where he is matched against an obviously impaired opponent. He is told the crowd wants blood and shortly Joe is pummeling this opponent to the point where he stops hitting him because he believes the other man is seriously hurt. He is told the man is dead and is quickly hustled away from the site.	Things go downhill from there after he is summoned, once again, to burgle a home and steal the jewelry from a safe. When he gets inside he sees a dead body and runs away, but his fingerprints are in the house. To make things worse the decedent is the wife of a rather unlikeable judge.	Robin Lockwood, a private practitioner, agrees to handle the case and she is soon plunged into an underworld of violence and crime as she tries to find out what really happened and who is the true killer.	As a former attorney I am always drawn to books written by other attorneys, and Margolin has been able to develop a technique of time compression. The books is almost devoid of any prose, his character development basically consists of giving us physical descriptions of people, and he is able to cut through all the typical trial preparation, motions, investigations and some shoddy police work in order to quickly get us to what he considers the most important parts of the story.	This is a fast-paced and action packed book that, while sparse on legal details, has enough legal and investigative insights to make a plausible and successful mystery. I read this in less than 24 hours, and the pages seem to fly by as we follow Lattimore, Lockwood, prostitutes, judges, bikers and gangsters to a breathless conclusion.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com   ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 15, 2021","Jan 27, 2021","Jan 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138031-a-matter-of-life-and-death

This is book 3 in the Jess Bridges Mysteries, and here it is Christmas time in Jolly Old England. Set in Oxford, Jess is a temp worker who is right smack in the middle of the BBC Christmas TV special and, despite the “drama” involved with this production, it is quickly overshadowed by the fact that a body has been discovered in a wealthy neighborhood garden. This brings DI Leo George into the scene as he is in charge of the investigation and quickly discovers that the body appears to have been buried for at least 13 months or longer.	Living in the neighborhood is Jess Bridges, who in addition to holding down the temp job at Oxford, also is a missing persons investigator, and in addition to house sitting at what is referred to as the “Red House” due to the brick color. Jess and Leo apparently almost had a date in a prior book but romance never materialized, but in this book that is about to change. 	The body was found at the house owned by Russian Oligarch, Anatoly Chernov, and Jess is house sitting in an even larger house owned by a Uzbek diamond Oligarch who she has not heard from for months.	Neither oligarch has lived in their respective houses for months, nor has any of their extended families and so Jess and Leo team up to try and figure out who is in the garden, and solve the crime. Along the way we are introduced to the nosey and combative neighborhood association who are trying to keep the Oxford area from degenerating into rather non-traditional uses – someone wanted to install a pool, another wanted to turn the mansion into student housing units. While it sounds a bit confusing, it goes to show how protective so many people are of their neighborhoods and what lengths people will go to protect them.	While this is a Jess Bridges mystery, she really does not have a lot to do with solving this crime. The plot is good, the characters are interesting, but I was able to easily figure out the murderer as one by one every possible suspect just did not fit for the murder.

For her fourth book on the legendary British Mitford Sisters, author Jessica Fellowes follows them on a cruise, a cruise that turns out to be worse than ever imagined, and one that puts the family right smack in the middle of the action and intrigue.	Fellowes is the niece of Julian Fellowes, the writer of Downton Abby, and so she seems to have followed his lead in these books about the Mitford’s who are wealthy aristocrats, as well as their now former maid Louisa. This book really shows the differences in the class structure in England, as Louise has already left the families employ when she married policeman Guy Sullivan, but despite that fact the family feels they need a maid to accompany them on their 3-week cruise and so Louisa reluctantly accepts.	Lots of fascinating people are on this cruise including German businessmen and his assistant, a bankrupt architect and is always drunken wife, amorous crew members, many fellow wealthy Brits and nobles, and halfway through the book Louisa’s husband Guy Sullivan joins the group, seemingly out of the blue. And it is shortly after Guy arrives on the boat in Livorno, Italy that a heinous crime occurs.	One of the Mitford sisters is called to the scene and she alerts Louisa and Guy to the crime. Because of the boats location in international waters and since it is a British cruise liner, Guy is quickly put in charge of the investigation because he is the only British police officer on the boat.	Before we know it two people are claiming to be the assailant and nobody knows for sure what really happened, how it happened and why it occurred? Eventually Louisa discovers the weapon and soon a search of the entire ship occurs. Incidents occur that force Louisa into a prime investigative role and by the time the boat arrives in Rome the assault has turned into a murder and two people are under arrest.

A glacier, an avalanchThanks to NetGalley, along with Amazon Publishing UK/Thomas & Mercer for this free advance copy in return for an honest .	A glacier, an avalanche and an artist’s search for truth, all come together in this wonderfully conceived book by Kevin Wignall, an author I never read before and who has done a great job of exploring one mans journey to find the truth about his father and how he died.	After 32 years the body of Charlie Treherne is uncovered as the result of an avalanche on a Swiss glacier. Luckily, the body had been very well preserved over that time since Charlie’s disappearance, and his passport and diary had been wrapped in plastic so the coroner was able to at least identify the body.	Famous modern artist, Foster Treherne receives an unexpected visit from a State Department official informing him of the discovery of his father, Charlie. And this sets up the dramatic plot of one man’s attempt to learn the truth about his father’s death and existence. Charlie’s death had occurred before Foster was born, and to complicate matters his mother committed suicide when he was only one year old. 	Basically raised by a nanny, and shipped off to boarding schools, Foster had no photos of his father, and really knew nothing of the man or his life, which was fine with Foster. But despite achieving worldwide artistic fame Foster has always had a hole in his psyche due to tragic circumstances surrounding the death of his parents, as well as his grandparents rather hands off and uncaring interest in his upbringing.	But, as so often happens, one little bit of information leads to another, and eventually Foster is convinced that his father’s death was not a mere accidental hiking death, but rather a murder. The discovery of a group photo now propels Foster on a journey of discovery and enlightenment. Who really were his mother and father, how did his father really die, and if it was not an innocent hiking accident who is to blame?	That Wignall is able to cover all of this in a short 232 page novel tells us about his ability as a writer. It is an action mystery, that really has little physical action. It is a detective story without a detective, and it is one man’s surprising desire to learn about his father. Foster is able to discover the identity of the people in the photo, but their memories of the day his father died are either incomplete or give the indications of a conspiracy. But was there a killer or was it truly an accident, and his desire to learn the truth also uncovers some facts about his father he never had known and which he might have been happy not to know.	This is a short, fast read. Yet it is a book that moves action around at a reasonable pace and teaches us that our past is not always what we think it is, and that our parents are not always who we believe they were. Fascinating, and a very good read with no violence, sex or any graphic sequences.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Dec 26, 2020","Jan 05, 2021","Dec 26, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53937997-those-who-disappeared

And what if the prize was a marvelous private library collection? And what, if in addition to that, all the contestants were all going to be awarded a large sum of money just for playing? Tempting??Well, Edinburgh bookshop owner Delaney Nichols received an invitation to participate in this treasure hunt after it was delivered, out of the blue, by a mysterious delivery person. Delaney was one of four people to get such an invitation by the elderly, eccentric and wealthy Shelagh O’Connor. Once she arrived at the O’Connor estate she was overwhelmed by the size of the library, as well as the object of the treasure hunt – a rare edition of Robert Lewis Stephenson’s classic, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.O’Connor, a spinster, is obsessed with this book, so much so that in her youth she used to dress up and prowl the streets of Edinburgh as Mr. Hyde. It got her in hot water once, but will the present imitate the past? Once the hunt begins a “New Monster” seems to begin roaming the streets of Edinburgh and there are Monster sightings, a rash of burglaries, and even a death. Who is to blame, who is the monster and is Shelagh O’Connor a prime suspect due to her past eccentricities?Delaney is on the hunt for the clues to the treasure hunt, and each clue seems to lead to a different pub in the city. Along the way she begins to uncover clues about O’Connor’s past until one day O’Connor is kidnapped, and her cousin is left a bloody mess by the attacker. Now the police and Delaney shift into high gear in their search for clues and to unlock the mystery identity of the Monster. Despite the treasure and the cash prizes, the race is on to find Shelagh and hope that the Monster has not taken the life of another victim. The police are baffled, the clues seem to be impossible to follow, and all the while every person who knew or worked for O’Connor is a possible suspect. This is a well written novel, one that keeps the reader guessing until the very end of the book and makes us wonder if there is not a little of Mr. Hyde in all of us. The book features the pubs of Edinburgh, believable characters and a very interesting plot. While being the 6th in the series, this certainly can be read as a stand-alone mystery and is an enjoyable novel for all mystery fans.This  was previously published on www.mysteryandsuspense.com ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Dec 20, 2020","Jan 03, 2021","Dec 20, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54419024-deadly-editions

When dealing with China, we are talking about a country that has such a long history that Rutherfurd needed to find a memorable period upon which to focus. Here we begin with the run-up to the two Opium Wars and get as far as the Boxer Rebellion, while in between there is the Taiping Rebellion. It is an eventful period and Rutherfurd does a really good job of detailing this historical era. The history is spot on, and I learned so much about these conflicts which I had heard of but never truly understood. As with all of his books, China features multiple characters and follows them through these turbulent times. We have opium traders, British diplomats, Chinese pirates, dowagers, emperors and eunuchs! Quite a diverse group to follow and on the whole these characters do a wonderful job in both interacting together, as well as being part of these historic times. Well written and superbly researched, this book does check off many of the boxes that I had expected, yet in many ways it falls flat. Why would that be? Well, while I do not like to have books wrapped up in a nice neat package, I do like to finish characters storylines, and too many of these characters are just left hanging. We are only dealing with a 60 year timeline and there really is no reason not to finish off these stories. A few do get completed but there are many that are left dangling, and then halfway through the book he introduces a new major character whose story as a eunuch in the Emperors Court dominated the last half of the book and many of the original characters merely seem to disappear. Call me picky, but I just felt a little bit disappointed after such a long wait since his book Paris. Very good, not great, and certainly not like Michener who reigns supreme in my ranking of historical fiction authors....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Dec 05, 2020",Jan 2021,"Dec 05, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55087077-china

She is one of those Golden Age of Mystery/Detective writers who made the genre popular, and so I have decided to read a few of her works. I enjoyed this book a lot, but much of the plot reminded me of The Billiard Room Mystery by Brian Flynn that was written a few years prior to this book. Here we have a festive weekend gathering in which the guests will play the parlor game ""Murder"" in which one person is designated the killer (in secret), and in a period of time that person must tap someone on the back and tell that person they are dead. The first part of the game ends and the guests must have a trial to determine who is the killer. Sounds like fun, but before the designated killer can act, one of the guests turns up dead with a dagger in his back. Lots to enjoy in this book, but I had a hard time keeping up and remembering who was who since there is not a lot of character development in the book. Also there is a lot of 1930's corny language in the book which does not help the modern reader.

For her 11th novel, CanadThanks to Penguin Group/Dutton and Net Galley for providing me with a free copy of this book in return for an honest .	For her 11th novel, Canadian/Australian author Tara Moss, starts a new mystery series which focuses on Billie Walker. Billie is a female Investigation Agent in Sydney, Australia, and this book is set shortly after the end of World War 2. She is an anomaly because it appears she is the only female Investigation Agent in Sydney. Luckily for Billie, her dad had been a policeman and then quit to open this agency, and after his death Billie takes over the business.	There is a lot going on in this book, in addition to having us get acquainted with all the supporting characters, including her male secretary (a wounded war veteran), her mother and mother’s maid, and a reluctant but decent police detective. All of these characters play a big part in her case of trying to find a young man who has disappeared. It might seem to be a case that will be easy to resolve, but the deeper Billie gets into the investigation there are more layers to this case than first meet the eye.	As a side case, Billie is friends with an aboriginal girl named Shyla and we learn how the aboriginals were treated at that time – being torn apart from their families and placed in schools where they are taught how to be domestic servants for wealthy Australian families. Shyla’s friends, however, were placed at a location far from Sydney, kept incommunicado, and fearing for their safety Shyla asks Billie’s help in locating them.	The action takes place in a little over a week, as Billie pursues leads at a local Dance Club, a high class auction house and even travels over three hours away to the famed Blue Mountains of Australia. The action and adventure never stops, as Billie seems to go from the frying pan into the fire, literally, as she exposes the truth behind both the disappearance of the young man, as well as the missing aboriginal girls.	What also makes this book so different from others is its setting. So many books on World War 2 and its aftermath are set in Europe or America, and it is absolutely refreshing to see a novel, such as this, set in Australia which has been overlooked for decades as a site of fallout from that war. Billie, herself, was a journalist during the war and covered events in Germany and Austria, and while there she fell in love and married a photographer who he was taken captive. Billie has no idea if he is dead or alive, thus her mother declares Billie a “War Widow” like so many other women in Australia and throughout the world whose husbands either are MIA or killed and whose bodies are never identified. It is a difficult world for these ladies, and Billie Walker is a struggling survivor who seems destined to take us on many more adventures and mysteries.Bottom Line: For fans of Tara Moss, Billie Walker is a wonderful new character and takes us through both some history and mysteries in the overlooked setting of Australia.This  was previously published at www.mysteryandsuspense.com...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48806818-the-war-widow

Alexis Morgan returns to Snowberry Creek for her 4th installment of the Abby McCree mysteries, and she once again proves that she is not your average run-of-the-mill cozy mystery writer.	As with all her cozies, there is a good and believable plot involving the murder of a spectator at the final movies in the park night in Snowberry Creek. We also have the introduction of a few new characters who provide additional drama, in support of the books plot.	For this book, Abby now has her mother. Phoebe, visiting her from Seattle, and in the brief time Phoebe was there she was able to find a boyfriend. Both Abby and her mother are divorcees, and for some reason Abby takes an immediate dislike of her mother’s friend, Owen. We even are treated to Phoebe’s “canoodling” during the movie, which brings the first hint of Abby’s dislike for Owen, and it all goes downhill from there.		Abby and her mother go to finish the cleanup of the park area and discover the dead body, sitting in a chair away from where the crowds sat during the movie. The police are called in and, before you know it, Owen is the main suspect in the murder. 	Phoebe takes an immediate dislike to the local police chief and is harshly outspoken as to her feelings and, to be honest, for most of the book Phoebe acts like a petulant love-sick teenager. But this mother-daughter tension helps move the plot along, and also explains some of the issues between the two ladies.	While the police go about solving the crime, Abby and her mother continue sparring almost every time they are together and because of this Abby never really gets into solving the crime. This is one of the authors strong suits since, unlike so many cozies, her main character is not smarter nor more intuitive than the police, nor does she actively go about trying to insert herself into the investigation. And thus things happen off the page that move this story along.	Owen sits in jail and it is obvious to all that he is withholding certain facts about the night of the murder, and despite Phoebe being allowed to visit him and try to talk some sense into him he still refuses to assist the police. What confuses everyone is that the decedent was new in town since taking over an insurance business, and Owen is also new in town and owns a restaurant and food truck. Did these two know each other from the past, and what secrets are held in a photo that used to hang in the insurance office and has now been stolen.	There is a lot here too keep Morgan’s dedicated fans clamoring for more books in this series, as well as hoping that Abby, Phoebe and the men in their lives will eventually enter into long term relationships.

For his 16th CLet me give a big thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press and Minotaur Books for providing me with a free advance copy of this book.	For his 16th Cotton Malone novel, Steve Berry starts off in Belarus, goes to Poland and then spends much of the rest of the book traveling around Germany, Chile and South Africa. It is a whirlwind of action, and as always Berry does it as well as anyone in history/thriller genre. 	Cotton and his girlfriend Cassiopeia Vitt are retired yet are still on call for special requests from the former President of the United States. This time they get involved in the upcoming German election and Berry uses this event to really give us a great insight into the rise of the Nationalist Right in Europe, as well as lingering devotees of the Nazi’s. Due to the sudden death of a messenger, these two now are at the heart of the campaign by the current Centrist Prime Minister of Germany and her Right Wing challenger.	What I enjoyed about this book is how Berry splits up Malone and Vitt. One stays in Germany while the other heads to South America. They both are trying to investigate whether the challenging candidate has ties to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, and along the way we are treated to a history and mystery lesson as to those two and Martin Bormann. Did they really die in the bunker? Did any escape, and if so where did they go? Did they have children? And, what about the stolen Nazi golden bounty?? Oh, Berry knows how to intertwine a great fictional plot with loads of historical accuracy and once again weaves a tale that is believably true.	Getting lots of help from siblings, one in Chile who is in her 90’s and her brother in South Africa who is in his 80’s, Malone and Vitt are actually being led by the challenger to find evidence that will incriminate the Prime Minister and lead to his election which will usher in the New Right in Germany and hopefully lead to an overthrow of the makeup of the European Union. Time is of the essence in this chase to find the truth, as campaigning heats up and the election is only days away. The candidates are tied in the polls and whatever Malone can uncover will probably sway the election.	If you have not read many of Berry’s books there is no fear that you will feel out of sorts. He does not have to deal extensively with background material on Malone or Vitt, and that is also what makes his a wonderful author. Without even knowing it, you will pick up bits and pieces of their past adventures, and pieces are nice to know but they are not vital to this books plot, but lets you know these two have a good history together.	Filled with mystery, history and intrigue, twists and turns that keep your head spinning until the very end, Steve Berry has written a wonderfully informative, entertaining and fast-paced novel, a novel that is a worthy new chapter in the Cotton Malone series!

This book is set in 1841 and follows thFirst time author Hope Adams has a real winner in her debut historical fiction/mystery novel, Dangerous Women. This book is set in 1841 and follows the fates of 180 women who are being transported on the boat, Rajah, from jails in England to Van Diemen’s Land, which is present day Tasmania.	The trip takes 15 weeks and is told through the eyes of 3 or 4 main characters, as they recount the trip, as well as a stabbing assault that takes place upon the boat during this crossing. The book begins with the assault and then chapters go back and forth (titled conveniently as Then or Now), telling tales on how and why some of the ladies got to be part of the prisoner transport, as well as trying to solve the stabbing before arriving at Hobart.	What ties so much of this together is a sewing group that Matron Kezia Hayter establishes from Day One. The group is sewing a quilt that will be presented to the Governor of Van Diemen’s Land upon their arrival, and it is through this group of ladies that the stories unfold. None who are transported are supposed to have been convicted of murder, and yet one of these ladies has slipped through onto the Rajah. We can also sympathize with many of these convicts since their life situations placed them in a position that they had to commit criminal acts just to survive.	In addition to the ladies, the book also follows Matron Hayter, the ship’s captain Charles Ferguson, along with the ships physician and priest. These male characters come to the fore during the investigation as to the stabbing, while the victim lies in a coma. Was the attacker one of the ladies of the sewing group, one of the other convicts, or could it have been one of the sailors? 	Throughout the book we get to view Matron Hayter as the rock that all these ladies rely upon, and we see the changes brought about due to the sewing circle and Hayter’s belief in forgiveness and compassion. 		But first and foremost this is a compelling mystery, all wrapped around a group of lady convicts who are headed to an unknown future in a land they know nothing about. How could someone get ahold of a knife, what drove that person to the attack, and how can such an incident be solved when every woman on the boat is a convict which can lead to many suspects and also many lies and denials of acts on board.	History plays a main focus in this book, as the author has blended historical characters with a group of fictional ladies. There are dangerous women living in cramped quarters for 15 weeks. Nerves fray, alliances form, and love blooms in this fast paced, well written novel. This is a great page-turner that I finished in two days.

Alexis Morgan returns to Snowberry CreekThanks to NetGalley and Kensington Press for a free advance copy of this book in return for an honest .	Alexis Morgan returns to Snowberry Creek for her 4th installment of the Abby McCree mysteries, and she once again proves that she is not your average run-of-the-mill cozy mystery writer.	As with all her cozies, there is a good and believable plot involving the murder of a spectator at the final movies in the park night in Snowberry Creek. We also have the introduction of a few new characters who provide additional drama, in support of the books plot.	For this book, Abby now has her mother. Phoebe, visiting her from Seattle, and in the brief time Phoebe was there she was able to find a boyfriend. Both Abby and her mother are divorcees, and for some reason Abby takes an immediate dislike of her mother’s friend, Owen. We even are treated to Phoebe’s “canoodling” during the movie, which brings the first hint of Abby’s dislike for Owen, and it all goes downhill from there.		Abby and her mother go to finish the cleanup of the park area and discover the dead body, sitting in a chair away from where the crowds sat during the movie. The police are called in and, before you know it, Owen is the main suspect in the murder. 	Phoebe takes an immediate dislike to the local police chief and is harshly outspoken as to her feelings and, to be honest, for most of the book Phoebe acts like a petulant love-sick teenager. But this mother-daughter tension helps move the plot along, and also explains some of the issues between the two ladies.	While the police go about solving the crime, Abby and her mother continue sparring almost every time they are together and because of this Abby never really gets into solving the crime. This is one of the authors strong suits since, unlike so many cozies, her main character is not smarter nor more intuitive than the police, nor does she actively go about trying to insert herself into the investigation. And thus things happen off the page that move this story along.	Owen sits in jail and it is obvious to all that he is withholding certain facts about the night of the murder, and despite Phoebe being allowed to visit him and try to talk some sense into him he still refuses to assist the police. What confuses everyone is that the decedent was new in town since taking over an insurance business, and Owen is also new in town and owns a restaurant and food truck. Did these two know each other from the past, and what secrets are held in a photo that used to hang in the insurance office and has now been stolen.	There is a lot here too keep Morgan’s dedicated fans clamoring for more books in this series, as well as hoping that Abby, Phoebe and the men in their lives will eventually enter into long term relationships.

For his 16th CLet me give a big thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press and Minotaur Books for providing me with a free advance copy of this book.	For his 16th Cotton Malone novel, Steve Berry starts off in Belarus, goes to Poland and then spends much of the rest of the book traveling around Germany, Chile and South Africa. It is a whirlwind of action, and as always Berry does it as well as anyone in history/thriller genre. 	Cotton and his girlfriend Cassiopeia Vitt are retired yet are still on call for special requests from the former President of the United States. This time they get involved in the upcoming German election and Berry uses this event to really give us a great insight into the rise of the Nationalist Right in Europe, as well as lingering devotees of the Nazi’s. Due to the sudden death of a messenger, these two now are at the heart of the campaign by the current Centrist Prime Minister of Germany and her Right Wing challenger.	What I enjoyed about this book is how Berry splits up Malone and Vitt. One stays in Germany while the other heads to South America. They both are trying to investigate whether the challenging candidate has ties to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, and along the way we are treated to a history and mystery lesson as to those two and Martin Bormann. Did they really die in the bunker? Did any escape, and if so where did they go? Did they have children? And, what about the stolen Nazi golden bounty?? Oh, Berry knows how to intertwine a great fictional plot with loads of historical accuracy and once again weaves a tale that is believably true.	Getting lots of help from siblings, one in Chile who is in her 90’s and her brother in South Africa who is in his 80’s, Malone and Vitt are actually being led by the challenger to find evidence that will incriminate the Prime Minister and lead to his election which will usher in the New Right in Germany and hopefully lead to an overthrow of the makeup of the European Union. Time is of the essence in this chase to find the truth, as campaigning heats up and the election is only days away. The candidates are tied in the polls and whatever Malone can uncover will probably sway the election.	If you have not read many of Berry’s books there is no fear that you will feel out of sorts. He does not have to deal extensively with background material on Malone or Vitt, and that is also what makes his a wonderful author. Without even knowing it, you will pick up bits and pieces of their past adventures, and pieces are nice to know but they are not vital to this books plot, but lets you know these two have a good history together.	Filled with mystery, history and intrigue, twists and turns that keep your head spinning until the very end, Steve Berry has written a wonderfully informative, entertaining and fast-paced novel, a novel that is a worthy new chapter in the Cotton Malone series!

One must wonder if after 30 books Agatha Raisin will become a bit tired and stale. This 31st book co-authored by Beaton and Rod Greene proves that there still is a lot of spunk left in Agatha!	For her fans, Agatha has always combined humor, sarcasm, a frustrating love life, as well as some endearing friends. What makes this book fun for me is that as a devotee of Agatha Raisin, I have followed her antics and mysteries on the AcornTV series and I can truly see Ashley Jensen and the cast having an absolute blast in this book.	As with all of these books, they take place in and around the Cotswolds, and this time the events surround Agatha’s friend and, sometimes love interest, Sir Charles Fraith. Much to Agatha’s horror, Sir Charles has moved on and is ready to marry one Mary Brown-Field. Is it for love or is it money? Something Charles has little of these days. Mary and her family are part of the horse-crowd. Yes, show jumping, dressage and the entire toot-toot wealthy snob set. 	Mary and Agatha are not exactly friends, but nonetheless she crashes both the wedding, as well as a Versailles themed masquerade ball. And, in typical Agatha fashion she gets into a bit of a tussle with the now Lady Mary. Thrown out of both events, Agatha gets pulled in when a murder occurs shortly after this confrontation.	She now has to investigate the Charles Fraith Murder case and there are just a host of suspects, as well as many hilarious predicaments that only Agatha could get herself involved with, and which always show the pluck that Agatha uses to extricate herself, as well as to eventually in her unconventional way to solve the case.	Returning in this book are her loyal friends and employees that are as much a part of the series as Agatha herself. Along the way her Investigating firm gets involved with a mysterious pooper, a poltergeist, a cheating husband, and more. Some of these are just pure fun, and some actually are involved with the murder! 	Lady Mary has a host of enemies, many of whom are part of that show-jumping world, and many of her enemies have good reason to want her dead. As Agatha sorts out the clues she takes a side trip to Bordeaux, France for an equestrian event and there almost falls head over heels for a wealthy French aristocrat and winemaker. 	“Hot to Trot” is another fun entry in the Agatha Raisin series.

For his 8th Tracy CrossA big thank you to NetGalley, as well as Thomas & Mercer publishing for this free advance copy in return for an honest . For his 8th Tracy Crosswhite mystery, the author tackles missing children, Cold Cases, and some truly nasty people involved in kidnapping and abuse. For me this is the first time I have read this popular author and it certainly will not be the last.	The story begins 5 years prior to today when Seattle Police Officer, Bobby Chin takes his five year old daughter, Elle, to a local corn maze and when the lights go out he loses the child. This is every parents fear, that something over which they have no control will rob them of their child. 	Dugoni then shifts to present day when detective Tracy Crosswhite reports for duty after having taken time off for the birth of her daughter. Upon her return she discovers that her position among the detectives has been taken and she is forced to basically choose between retirement or working Cold Cases, a difficult decision but one that is made a bit easier after her interaction with the retiring detective working those cases.	Once those basics are worked out, we become immersed in the case of a missing lady jogger, as well as Crosswhite’s decision to try and solve the Elle Chin disappearance. We also get to experience how Crosswhite deals with her work-related separation from her daughter, as well as her psychological issues that came to the fore in a prior book.	Prior events from these past books play a big part in Crosswhite’s handling of matters, and so if you are just jumping into this series you are a bit lost as to all that had transpired in the prior books, but it is not a fatal flaw just one helps us understand the issues she faces while dealing with lost children, cold cases and the missing jogger.	The author moves seamlessly between cases, and does a wonderful job of helping the reader feel the tension that surrounds a missing persons case, the agony of dealing with Cold Cases, and the predators who are involved in the kidnapping and abuse. He even shows how 3 brothers have been affected by their abusive father and how that abuse leads to their current problems as well as one brother abusing his other two siblings.	There are lots of twists and turns in this book and it turns out that not everything is as easily solved as it first appears. Also, all of the abuse and torture appears outside of the book so that there are no really squeamish parts of this book. 	A fast and fascinating read, this book should really please all of Dugoni’s fans and, if you have just discovered Dugoni as I have, this book will certainly bring him a host of new readers who will scramble to read the first seven books in this series.

Despite over 200,000 books being written about Napoleo Thanks to NetGalley and Forge Books for this free Advance copy in return for my honest .	Despite over 200,000 books being written about Napoleon, Loren Estleman tackles a much overlooked subject in his latest Historical Fiction/Suspense novel, an attempted assassination of Napoleon. 	Little really has been written in recent years about the plot to kill Napoleon on Christmas Eve in 1800. Estleman uses this real world event to spin a tale about a fictional assassination attempt that is hatched after the Christmas Eve plot failed.	From the very beginning this book grips you as we follow the original plotters of the failed Christmas Eve bombing, and come to realize just how close those men came to altering the course of history. Napoleon rose to power while revolution was still in the air, and there were many both inside and outside of France who wanted to see him ousted as First Consul. Despite the many Civil Law reforms he created, the overall stability he brought to France, as well as the countries standing as a world power, many wanted him ousted since he turned the cannons on Parisians to quell rioting a few years prior to this.	Upon learning of the failed Christmas Eve attempt to kill Napoleon, the Pro-Royalist movement decided they would take matters into their own hands. These individuals had many supporters in England, a great many of whom were powerful and wealthy aristocrats who wanted a return of the Bourbon Monarchy to France so as to keep Republicanism from jumping the channel into England. The plotters are led by Georges Cadoudal, a former officer in the French army who has fled to England to live under the protection of the Earl of Rexborough, and while there we meet a mysterious stranger who will come to dominate this book. While refusing to give his real name or background this man who will eventually be known as the Viper, is a hired assassin and provides sufficient information and details that Cadodal agrees to hire him for the price of 5 Million francs. 	The book is filled with both historical characters such as Cadoudal, Napoleon and Josephine, French police minister Joseph Fouche and Nicolas Dubois the Prefect of Police, as well as fictional characters who play a major part in the book. The action moves back and forth from Paris to England, to rural France and Estleman paints a very realistic story about how life was at that time, since plotters were believed to be everywhere, spies and police informants blanketed the land, and people were afraid to speak out loud for fear of saying something that might land them in prison.	We never learn the identity of the Viper, nor what his connection was to the French military or his hatred of Napoleon, but along the way from England to Paris he weaves even more tales as to his identity and intimidates many. Despite what appears to Viper to be a foolproof journey and assassination, little troubles plague his once he gets to France, and he lets his guard down a few times which has major consequences for both Viper and those who cross him.	How will he get close to Napoleon? How will he attempt to kill him and escape are never known until the very end. And all the while as Viper makes his way to Paris we are also privy to the efforts being made by Fouche, Dubois and others to sift through stacks of reports on suspicious characters, as well as trying to stop Viper and arrest those who are behind this plot.	A well written book that is filled with historical accuracy, The Eagle and The Viper is a page-turner that kept this reader up to 4:00 AM to finish. When it ended you are just amazed at how wonderful a tale Estleman has written and hope he will again delve into the fascinating world of The Eagle, better known as Napoleon.

For his 8th Tracy CrossA big thank you to NetGalley, as well as Thomas & Mercer publishing for this free advance copy in return for an honest . For his 8th Tracy Crosswhite mystery, the author tackles missing children, Cold Cases, and some truly nasty people involved in kidnapping and abuse. For me this is the first time I have read this popular author and it certainly will not be the last.	The story begins 5 years prior to today when Seattle Police Officer, Bobby Chin takes his five year old daughter, Elle, to a local corn maze and when the lights go out he loses the child. This is every parents fear, that something over which they have no control will rob them of their child. 	Dugoni then shifts to present day when detective Tracy Crosswhite reports for duty after having taken time off for the birth of her daughter. Upon her return she discovers that her position among the detectives has been taken and she is forced to basically choose between retirement or working Cold Cases, a difficult decision but one that is made a bit easier after her interaction with the retiring detective working those cases.	Once those basics are worked out, we become immersed in the case of a missing lady jogger, as well as Crosswhite’s decision to try and solve the Elle Chin disappearance. We also get to experience how Crosswhite deals with her work-related separation from her daughter, as well as her psychological issues that came to the fore in a prior book.	Prior events from these past books play a big part in Crosswhite’s handling of matters, and so if you are just jumping into this series you are a bit lost as to all that had transpired in the prior books, but it is not a fatal flaw just one helps us understand the issues she faces while dealing with lost children, cold cases and the missing jogger.	The author moves seamlessly between cases, and does a wonderful job of helping the reader feel the tension that surrounds a missing persons case, the agony of dealing with Cold Cases, and the predators who are involved in the kidnapping and abuse. He even shows how 3 brothers have been affected by their abusive father and how that abuse leads to their current problems as well as one brother abusing his other two siblings.	There are lots of twists and turns in this book and it turns out that not everything is as easily solved as it first appears. Also, all of the abuse and torture appears outside of the book so that there are no really squeamish parts of this book. 	A fast and fascinating read, this book should really please all of Dugoni’s fans and, if you have just discovered Dugoni as I have, this book will certainly bring him a host of new readers who will scramble to read the first seven books in this series.

Here we are introduced to his lead character, the aristocrat Anthony Bathurst and we see him both working with and competing against the local detective to solve not just a murder committed on a billiard table but also the burgling of a certain pearl necklace. In my opinion the book suffers from two things. First, the language is tough. Too many phrases from that 1930's time period and very stiff language. ""I will pilot you there."" Instead of ""I will show you there."" The other issue is that many of the small details that led to the eventual outcome were withheld from the reader. There is a reason for that but it still is off-putting.Now I will read another of his books, they do not cost much to buy on Kindle, but this was just an OK book and I am not sure if I want to spend the $ or time on more.

We get to meet these young men, and the author does a great job of detailing the highlights and lowlights of their careers. The triumphs and tragedies and all the obstacles that stood in their way. We get to follow their rivalry with Cal, go with them to Poughkeepsie for 3 years as part of the collegiate rowing championships, and then in 1936 to Princeton for the Olympic trials and finally onto Berlin where they once again had to overcome many hurdles in that Olympic final event. Great writing, great stories and it teaches that the sum of the whole is greater than any one individual. A great and inspirational read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Oct 27, 2020","Jul 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158542-the-boys-in-the-boat

This book covers the years of 1919 until 1929 and culminates with the Wall Street crash. Very good book in terms of the historical events that our hero, Lanny Budd, gets to witness. My biggest problem with the book is that Lanny in my humble opinion is a rather unlikeable character. Oh, he does nothing wrong, but he seems to go through life living like Oscar Wilde - life is Beauty. Ugh! He is wishy-washy, flighty, and lives above most events. Lots of pages dedicated to him not being able to figure out what he believes. Ends up living with 2 married women (at different times) in the South of France. Has no idea what he wants out of life and when he finally finds someone to marry he refuses to court her because she is rich. By the end, he and his wife are heading back to France and book 3 will probably get us into the rise of Hitler and Franco, since we have already witnessed Mussolini. At 871 pages this one takes time and could easily have been cut down by about 200 pages. But, it is an interesting read, and I have 9 more to go in this series!

He has a way of telling a story that does not come off as overly professorial or long-windedly boring. This is another great example of his works. This book focuses on the development of the West, from the time of Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase to Teddy Roosevelts preservation of the American West. It is a glorious overview of American history, filled with names both familiar and scarcely known. Obviously, volumes can and have been written on the subject matter of each of these 54 chapters, and for someone who wishes to learn more than we are all welcome to do so, but here Brands gives us so many wonderful and tragic stories, characters and incidents that made the West. He breaks it down into 8 different sections beginning with the Louisiana Purchase, then we have Fur Traders, Texas and on and on it goes until we have reached the end of our Continental borders and begin to fill in the Midwest - great info on the Oklahoma Land Rush. All in all just a superb book by one of our leading historians. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"May 28, 2020","Jun 18, 2020","May 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43730451-dreams-of-el-dorado

I really enjoyed much of this book, but as it went on it appears that Mildred's views were not the same as others. Tyhe research of the book was great, and I love how the author gives a credit to Laura Hildebrand for his writing about a topic that is little known or remembered. The book really promotes the old Kayfabe myth of everything being a ""work"" without the fans being in on it. How else does one never lose a match in 17 years! It was all a work and the ladies perpetuate that with their stories of in ring action. What is sad about the book is how many of these ladies ended up broke and just went from one job after another once they left the ring. Penny Banner was a success, one of the few. Mildred Burke is remembered more fondly in Japan, where she energized ladies wrestling with her WWWA (red belt) organization. Good story, interesting facts about Billy Wolfe and the old NWA, and yet a real sadness by the end of the story.

I loved this book. Here we have 90-year old Buck being requested to give his side to a murder conviction. Why? Well, the person who was convicted has been on death row for 35 years and his time for execution is near. He reached out to an NPR reporter who has taken up his cause. We go back and forth between Buck in the present, he has early onset Alzheimers, Buck in his police detective career and the NPR reporter and that gentleman's show transcripts as well as interviews. It is a very interesting book on the death penalty, along with the question of death by lethal injection. Interestingly, the convicts appellate attorney no longer is filing appeals on the trial and conviction but rather whether death by injection is cruel and unusual punishment. A very fast read, well written book which got a bit preachy in the last few chapters that lowered it to only a 4****. I understand the author has a point of view but when the book gets to the final chapters I found it veered from what made this book readable.

Seven books in total having to deal, lightly and nicely, with art thefts. I love this series, and since Pears is an Art Historian, his books contain just the right amount of technical details to support his mysteries. This book deals with a rather mediocre painting that is stolen and winds up causing the death of two people in Rome. Though technically a murder investigation, the Art Squad is involved due to the fact that a painting seems to be a common denominator. Included within the books and series is Flavia di Stefano, who is the lead investigator who now appears to have unwittingly become Argyll's fiance due to the fact that he has moved in with her. While he is sort of loopy, she is intense and the banter between the two of them is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately there are only 7 books in this series and now I only have 3 left to read.

Daisy Dunn has done a spectacular job in bringing Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger to life. This year I have read books on Claudius, Cicero and now the Pliny’s. The other two were novels, and while this is a non-fiction book, it reads like a novel. The author has done a great job of researching her book and has brought out details and stories that I never heard of. She has a great mastery of her subject and you can tell it by her style. We learn of both Pliny’s. The Elder who wrote his encyclopedia on Natural History and who died while trying to save people from the volcano eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Pliny the Younger was a man of letters, a Senator and an attorney and we learn a lot about Roman life from his accounts. We read the story of Cleopatra drinking her 10 Million Sesterce pearl to win a bet with Marc Antony (and which was the subject of a fun antique/mystery episode of the series Lovejoy), we learn of the families dislike of Oysters and Ice. Never mix foods from the mountain and the depth of the ocean! We discover the brutal and evil Emperor Domitian, as well as Pliny’s happiness when Trajan became Emperor. So many stories as we follow the two men and get an intimate portrait of Rome, Tuscany, Naples and Como. Just a wonderful book by a young up and coming historian. I listened to a podcast with Daisy Dunn and immediately ordered this book. I had to wait for its release in the US and it was well worth the wait. As Pliny wrote, “To be Alive is to be Awake” and this book certainly make me feel alive and awake, and living back in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD in Rome.

OK, I love the illustrations and the story about the potential of sharing but the ending leaves me flat since I figure out what the author is trying to get at, but he ends it without a resolution. This can open up some discussion with kids. Again, this seems quite European in style but I wish we had about 4 more pages with a more conclusive resolution.

Here she is meeting Leah and her Dad in Holland, and so begins this young girls travelogue, adventures and misadventures. I gather Amanda must be somewhere between ages 11-13. Here Leah and Amanda get the run of the country as Leah's dad is in meetings all day, every day. I find it rather scary that these two young girls are allowed to roam all over Holland without any parental supervision, and they also see every sight possible. If they are not sightseeing they are eating, and if they are not eating Amanda constantly gets into trouble. I find this entire book a little hard to believe as adult reactions are not normal, and the book is just the girls racing to one tourist site to another, eating again and again, and getting into some pretty serious problems. Maybe pre-teen girls will like Amanda and consider her plucky, I consider her spoiled and lucky....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 18, 2020","Apr 19, 2020","Apr 18, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44025652-amanda-in-holland

As for the story, we have a duck who is trying to find just the right present for ""your"" birthday present. Oh, he has ideas. Small ideas like socks, or ice cream; big ideas like a car or dinosaur or even a rocket ship. Somehow nothing goes right and all those ideas fall through for one silly reason or another.

We have the 26-year old local vicar co-signing for someone’s debts and this is an overwhelming issue throughout the book. It teaches us - don’t co-sign for someone unless you are ready to pay the bill yourself. We also have on top of this 3, and slightly 4, love affairs that may or may not bloom into marriage.

I spent 3 years in Los Angeles in the mid-70's and fell in love with the area. And in the past year I have been fortunate to have read 3 different books about Los Angeles and its Urban Development, athletics and the Dodgers. This book specifically deals with those people who lived in what is now called Chavez Ravine, prior to the baseball stadium these were 3 different communities (Palo Verde, La Loma & Bishop) and most of the focus is upon Palo Verde and the Abrana Arechiga family. The family moved from Mexico to escape the revolution and ended in Arizona and from there made their way to Los Angeles to settle in these hills about 1 mile from downtown. So near, yet so far away, basically forgotten by Los Angeles until a dreamer, Frank Wilkinson, a wanderer and dreamer becomes involved in Urban planning, as well as the Communist Party. Was Frank a Communist? I guess by those old definitions he was, he certainly believed in affordable housing projects and once he got himself into a position of some importance he is the force behind the initial attempts to have Palo Verde, et al, be declared a slum and begin condemnation proceedings to have the land purchased and used for these Housing Projects. Oh gee, we want affordable housing, let's put it where the Mexicans live and displace them.We trace the history of Wilkinson, the Arechiga family and the Dodgers move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in this well researched book. The Dodgers wanted to move west and LA was finally able to offer them this land in Palo Verde because most families had left and accepted the condemnation awards. But the Affordable Housing fell through and eventually the Dodgers get this land to build Dodger Stadium which was state of the art in 1962 and remains so through today.We follow the hopes, dreams, tragedies and fiascos that all these interests are involved in and along the way we can try and figure out who are the good guys, the bad guys, and wonder if there are either. This is a story that most Angelinos know nothing about, and few outside of LA are aware of what happened and how it came to pass that the Dodgers moved to LA and were able to wrest this land from the city and from the families that had lived there for over 40 years. A very well written book that gives us a lot of the inside and unknown stories about Chavez Ravine. It is a fascinating book that will appeal to broad range of readers who will read this book from differing points of view....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Mar 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51205963-stealing-home

Earlier this year I read ""I, Claudius"" and loved it, and decided to read Book #1 on Harris's trilogy on the life of Cicero. I love this book. By the way, did you know that Cicero means chick peas! Lots of good stuff in here about the early career of Cicero up to his election of Counsel of Rome. The book is divided into 2 parts with the first part paying attention to his early trials and ending with his election as Aedile of Rome, with the second part detailing his rise to Consul. Now this is historical fiction at its finest, as the book is allegedly derived from the scrolls of Cicero's personal secretary Tiro who wrote a history of Cicero. While those scrolls no longer exist they are referenced by Plutarch and others and so this is as close as we will get to actual historical detail. Well written, Tiro paints the picture that Cicero was the master of politics and if what is in this book is correct, then Machiavelli had nothing on Cicero! Wonderfully written with well portrayed characters, this is a great novel that one should consider if you have any interest at all in the machinations of ancient Rome and the art of politics!!

Books that tell tales of uncovered or lost Biblical codes out r mysteries, and that is why I am a bit perplexed with my feelings about this book. On the face of it, the book sounds pretty good, and there certainly is a lot of rapid action and adventure (some of which is a bit too hastily introduced and finished). And yet I struggled at times with the book. The plot centers around some religious predictions made by a Lithuanian Jewish scholar back in the 1700's, which are then placed in a metal box that can only be opened by someone who carries the Blessing of Aaron. We then cut to present day and things are happening in the Middle East that deal with a peace treat with Israel, along with the natural animosity between the Turks, Arabs and Iran. Lots can be done with this plot but it all seems rushed and then by the end we have no resolution - stay tuned for books 2 & 3 - which is a little off-putting. More Christianity in here than I suspected, but nonetheless the books main points have been terrifically researched and the author gave me a look into some religious history and animosity that I was unaware of. Some characters need more fleshing out, and some leads that are discovered drop by the wayside, and will probably pop up again in books 2 or 3. So as a stand alone book it is OK, and will probably be better if you can read or get ahold of all 3 books.

I spent 3 years in Los Angeles in the mid-70's and fell in love with the area. And in the past year I have been fortunate to have read 3 different books about Los Angeles and its Urban Development, athletics and the Dodgers. This book specifically deals with those people who lived in what is now called Chavez Ravine, prior to the baseball stadium these were 3 different communities (Palo Verde, La Loma & Bishop) and most of the focus is upon Palo Verde and the Abrana Arechiga family. The family moved from Mexico to escape the revolution and ended in Arizona and from there made their way to Los Angeles to settle in these hills about 1 mile from downtown. So near, yet so far away, basically forgotten by Los Angeles until a dreamer, Frank Wilkinson, a wanderer and dreamer becomes involved in Urban planning, as well as the Communist Party. Was Frank a Communist? I guess by those old definitions he was, he certainly believed in affordable housing projects and once he got himself into a position of some importance he is the force behind the initial attempts to have Palo Verde, et al, be declared a slum and begin condemnation proceedings to have the land purchased and used for these Housing Projects. Oh gee, we want affordable housing, let's put it where the Mexicans live and displace them.We trace the history of Wilkinson, the Arechiga family and the Dodgers move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in this well researched book. The Dodgers wanted to move west and LA was finally able to offer them this land in Palo Verde because most families had left and accepted the condemnation awards. But the Affordable Housing fell through and eventually the Dodgers get this land to build Dodger Stadium which was state of the art in 1962 and remains so through today.We follow the hopes, dreams, tragedies and fiascos that all these interests are involved in and along the way we can try and figure out who are the good guys, the bad guys, and wonder if there are either. This is a story that most Angelinos know nothing about, and few outside of LA are aware of what happened and how it came to pass that the Dodgers moved to LA and were able to wrest this land from the city and from the families that had lived there for over 40 years. A very well written book that gives us a lot of the inside and unknown stories about Chavez Ravine.

While not a complete biography of real estate promotor/salesman, Billy Garland, it is obvious that Garland was one of the prime movers and shakers in the early years of the 20th century. He came to LA due to a lung condition and within years he became one o its biggest boosters. We see the good and the bad of Los Angeles, and while much of the focus is on the constant promotion of Los Angeles as the next great mecca, we also see some of the problems that had to be overcome. Eventually Billy decides that LA should host the 1924 Olympics and is rebuffed by head of the Olympic committee and the games go to Paris, 1928 games to Amsterdam, and finally Los Angeles got its chance and by that time the Depression had hit worldwide. Again, through Garlands sheer energy things finally come around for the 1932 games, which produces the first surplus for an Olympic game city, plus the innovating Olympic Village, the story of which is truly amazing. We meet the athletes, the newspaper owners and editors, celebrities and big wigs who all helped make this a successful Olympic games. A really fine book, and a fun non-fiction read.

Parents must be on guard against too much social media by children of a tender age, but then again there is no need for small children to have access to those devices and phones at that age. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Mar 2020,Mar 2020,"Mar 01, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/51532238-selfie

It is for ages 8-11, and is a really good story of the early years of Nikola Tesla filled with difficulties, challenges and successes. I enjoyed the illustrations and was particularly impressed with the story boxes of certain items, such as atoms, lightning, engineering and his early travels, the book also gives us a timeline of Tesla's life. It skips over a lot of his later life issues, but that is not really needed in this book, because the book is about his dreams. I give this a hearty THUMBS UP!!

Some early s made me question its prose, but I found the pacing really good as our narrator Juan Cameron is a photographer and the writing reminds me of how a photographer looks at things, picking up a lot of details we might miss. And that is basically the premise of this book. Juan and his father are sent to photographs architecture in Cuba right as the Spanish-American War began. Due to tragedy Juan ends up inheriting land in Cuba and Scotland where he returns. He helps police to solve a murder by the use of his camera which photographs shots of daily life at a regular interval and then can try and discern patterns that might help determine the identity of the killer.From here he is sent to Glasgow to help their police solve a group of serial killings. He sets up his camera in two locations, with autotimer device, and from there can get an idea of who might be the killer. I know some have stopped reading the book, but I just found it an interesting use of photography and the plot gets better and better the further into the book. Who might be involved? A minister, policeman, hotel owner, store owner, etc. the list of possibly suspects is long and the ending is very well done.

I really enjoyed Thanks to NetGalley, Perseus Books and Running Press for providing me with a free copy of this book in return for my honest opinion. I really enjoyed this book. Our narrator is 11-year old Nellie, who recently moved with her mom to Bear Creek, Maine. Nellie's parents had both worked on a big city newspaper and Nellie wants to recapture the fascination and love she had of the paper here in this small community. One day the community is shaken by vandalism at the community park and the entire park is shut down until the crime is solved. Nellie and a group of friends start their own paper to try and solve the vandalism as well as reporting on other stories from Bear Creek. The book is designed for middle school readers and does a superb job of teaching the basics of news reporting, the different positions on a newspaper, as well as preaching the Who? What? When? Why? and How? questions reporters should ask, but which in our current society are sadly lacking. By starting the paper, making friends, finding and reporting on the culprit of the vandalism, the book teaches us great lessons about the newspaper profession as well as helping Nellie come face to face with the truth as to why she and her mother moved to Bear Creek. The negative has to do with Nellie's rather over-aggressive attitude and her lecturing of her new found friends. But it certainly was a major deterrent to the overall enjoyment of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 22, 2020","Feb 26, 2020","Feb 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51199757-the-newspaper-club

I begin by saying I have not read the first book of the series, but that being said it is pretty easy to figure out that the Wolf had apparently been a mean wolf and eventually became part of a loving animal world. But by book two the Wolf was angry and keeps repeating ""They're Freezing."" The animals have no idea what he is talking about until the very end, but they try to guess what the problem is and they keep Owl busy knitting different garments for Wolf. In the end it is all about sharing the abundance of nature. Now the biggest issue is that nobody ever asks Wolf what he is talking about, but most children will skip over that issue. The graphics are super and eye-catching and while there may be a lot going on in some of them, kids tend to like that style.

A very well written book that picks up pace and interest as you move deeper into the book. Based on many true historical characters this is basically the story of two people, both of whom belong to groups that the Nazi government wants to eliminate. One a singer, one a piano player, one a Jew, one Polish, along with others who have Gypsy blood in their veins, along with a few characters who are homosexual. There is no real sexuality in this book, but rather it is a book about 2 people on the run to try and escape the horrors of WW2. One, the singer, is actually the daughter of a German General, who himself is under suspicion by the Gestapo for being part of the Oster plot to remove Hitler in the late 1930's. Lots of good and interesting historical information about the prison camp in Theresienstadt, as well as information I never knew of the Polish underground. As I said the book picks up speed about 40% of the way through and is quite the page-turner. My biggest criticism is that sometimes escapes occur and they are either not explained or not fully detailed. But let me say this, if you want a really good understanding of how regular people from within Germany, and who were not Nazi's, managed to survive or escape then this is certainly a great book to help you understand their plight. There already is a 2nd book that details even more of their lives after WW2.

A conductor is found dead between acts at the Venetian Opera House, La Fenice, during a performance of La Traviata. It is fairly obvious that it was death by poisoning, but who had access to get the poison into the conductors cup of coffee?? There are plenty of clues, plenty of potential murderers and a lot of backstory about the conductor who apparently was a Nazi in his early life. You get a pretty good flavor for Venice in this book, and it was interesting that it was Brunetti who solves the mystery with very few extra characters involved. Oh we see a doctor here and there, two incompetent police detectives who barely appear in any more than 10 pages, a typical Italian police commissioner, and some flavor for Guido Brunetti's home and family life. I felt the book moved effortlessly, that the characters were believable and that the solution to the crime was very interesting, even though I had sort of figured it out before Brunetti.

I began 2020 by saying that this was one book from my library I wanted to read, and I am so glad I started the year with it. Being Italian, loving History and having visited Rome many times helped me enjoy this book. Is allegedly an autobiography of Claudius, but is really a historical fiction book which does a super job of seeing Rome and the empire through the eyes of the physically challenged Claudius, a relative of Augustus Caesar who is so non-threatening that nobody tries to kill him and who will eventually rise to become Emperor of Rome. Great historical details taken from works of Suetonius and Tacitus and, again, is supposed to be Claudius writing his and his families history. Shows how his grandmother, Livia, is the power behind the crown, and does not really write highly about Augustus and especially Tiberius. Caligula gets the last 70 pages of the book and we easily see why he was assassinated! It is not the fastest book to read, partly due to very small font size, but I found the last 250 pages flew by. A great read, and now I must make the effort to read the 2nd book of the series, Claudius the God.

This is the 2nd installment of the William Constable spy thriller series and I have really enjoyed both books. They are filled with historical figures and much historical accuracy, as in this book we continue to follow Constable as there is intrigue about a possible sailing of merchant ships to the New World in the late 16th century. Constable is a physician and in both books he is both good, as well as fortunate. Fortunate here because his fiancé, Helen, is the daughter of one of the aristocrats who has ships involved in this venture, and also is a pretty smart lady in her own right! The plot is simple. Constable is nearly killed to begin the book and his savior is eventually charged with the murder of a man in the port of Plymouth where half the fleet is docked. Constable is obliged to defend this man, Charles Wicken, but from soon after the trial things do not seem quite right. Well from there we go off on more security issues about the fleet, about Queen Elizabeth, about Ireland, etc. and the book just becomes one you cannot put down by the end. And that is why I only give this a 4**** rating. It is very well written, and the last half of the book just flies by, but the first third of the book just drags a bit too much. How much, I actually started and finished 4 other books before returning to this book. That happened in the first book of the series and so this pattern needs to change in order for me to give it a higher rating, but it will not stop me from requesting and reading the continued saga of Dr. William Constable when it comes out in 2020!...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 29, 2019","Jan 05, 2020","Dec 29, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48578366-a-necessary-killing

Really enjoyed this mystery book by J. Michael Orenduff who, refreshingly, started writing this series after he had retired from a long and distinguished career in higher education. I say this because not all writers have the time, effort and energy to write while still pursuing their chosen career path and it is super to see a writer who has some life experience writing a series such as this. We deal with our main character, Hubert Schuze (pronounced Shoes), who is both a craftsman as well as a pottery dealer and within the first few pages is approached by an individual who wants to have him steal a piece of pottery from a local museum, as well as an FBI agent who believe he has really stolen the pottery and is keeping close lookout on him. Along the way we meet a lot of really good characters such as his friend Susannah who is both a waitress and student and who meets with him nightly for conversation, philosophy and Margarita’s! No romance between the two. We also have his nephew, Tristan, who is the electronics and gadget guy and who tries to bring Hubert into a closer appreciation of high tech. There are others but these two are there throughout the book, along with a neighbor lady who keeps bringing casseroles for Hubert. Pythagoras does figure into the plots solution and in addition to getting a cracklingly good read, you learn a lot in this book. We have stolen pots from a museum and Bandelier National Monuments, some unfriendly Native Americans, two murders and a host of other developments that keep you from wanting to put this book down. Really great first effort, so much so that I will overlook some little flaws in the book to give this a 5*****.

Based on extensive love and research into this topic, Storey has written an extremely interesting a very readable book. It is fun to go back and forth between the book and then researching the paintings and sculptures that form the basis of the book and competition. Having been fortunate to have seen many of this artwork in person I loved so much of the backstory that is told in the book, and if you have not seen these in person they are so simple to look up on your computer and gaze longer and even see more detail than you can when you are there in person.

Charlotte MacLeod has been compared to Agatha Christie and for good reasons. Well paced books, interesting and diverse characters and wonderful plots with solutions to the mysteries being held until the very end. Here we have the Murder of not one, but two security guards at a Boston museum, lost art and a huge scandal with regard to even more lost art from the past. Into the fray come Sarah and Max to help solve the crimes, along with Sarah's 4th cousin, twice removed, Brooks. He is a delightful character who works at the museum and is a dedicated bird lover and has this neat little belt buckle camera that helps solve the case. Art, art forgeries and art theft are center stage in this book, a book where Sarah is happy that none of the murders occur in her boardinghouse, a change that helps in the believability of the book.

I had never heard of this author until I got this book, a book that is completely different from her prior works, and for me a much more enjoyable genre and style of writing. We follow the exploits of Lady Amy Lovell (who is secretly a murder mystery writer) and Lord William Wethington, her friend. The writing is a good blend of both dialogue and prose, and characters are well developed both on the lead character and minor character level. Lady Amy is under suspicion of the murder of her fiance (ex-fiance) who she found in her library with a knife in his chest! She decides to try and find out the killer because the police are sort of convinced she us the murderess. All of this takes place in the town of Bath, England, which also gets very good descriptive development both in terms of the town and high society. We have a dead shipping magnate, opium addicts, a feminist Lady Amy, a charming relationship between Lady Amy and Lord William. Why not 5 stars? Well, sometimes the dialogue got a bit preachy about feminism and the plight of women (more so Lady Amy than women in general), and while it did not distract from the book I felt it continued much longer than necessary - the author made her point very well early in the book. The plot was great, and the murderer a real surprise.

I had never heard of this author until I got this book, a book that is completely different from her prior works, and for me a much more enjoyable genre and style of writing. We follow the exploits of Lady Amy Lovell (who is secretly a murder mystery writer) and Lord William Wethington, her friend. The writing is a good blend of both dialogue and prose, and characters are well developed both on the lead character and minor character level. Lady Amy is under suspicion of the murder of her fiance (ex-fiance) who she found in her library with a knife in his chest! She decides to try and find out the killer because the police are sort of convinced she us the murderess. All of this takes place in the town of Bath, England, which also gets very good descriptive development both in terms of the town and high society. We have a dead shipping magnate, opium addicts, a feminist Lady Amy, a charming relationship between Lady Amy and Lord William. Why not 5 stars? Well, sometimes the dialogue got a bit preachy about feminism and the plight of women (more so Lady Amy than women in general), and while it did not distract from the book I felt it continued much longer than necessary - the author made her point very well early in the book. The plot was great, and the murderer a real surprise.

Here he completes his trilogy of books about some of the biggest names in the West. First there was Dodge City dealing a lot with Bat Masterson, from there it was Wild Bill and the exploits of Wild Bill Hickock, and now we have the most well known of the group Tombstone and the epic clash between the Earps and the Cowboys. Most books that deal with this topic tend to come at the event as either pro-Earp or anti-Earp or pro-Cowboys. Here Clavin gives us a vivid look at the creation of the town of Tombstone, along with mini-biographies of so many of the characters and then the eventual Gunfight at OK Corral. We learn about Indian raids led by Geronimo and others prior to the gunfight, fires that almost burned down the town, rustling and Cowboy raids into Mexico and a very straight forward telling of the gunfight that is gleaned through a voluminous bibliography of books, newspaper, diaries etc. Unfortunately, many of todays youths have no idea of these individuals, but for those of us who are lovers of American History this book fills in certain gaps in knowledge, as well as giving us so many new facts I never was aware of, such as Cowboy Curly Bill Brosius actually being a tax collector appointed by Sheriff John Behan. There have been 3 major movies about this gunfight (My Darling Clementine, The Gunfight at OK Corral & Tombstone) but none of then really get the facts straight. However, it is true that Doc Holliday said to Johnny Ringo ""I'm your Huckleberry"" just not in the dramatic scene as portrayed in Tombstone.Just a super book, a fast read, and when it is all over you will have a much better understanding of the Gunfight at OK Corral as well as the town of Tombstone!...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 14, 2019","Oct 19, 2019","Oct 14, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51149079-tombstone

A bit dated and a few pieces of the plot were a tad bit implausible but on the whole it was a very fine first novel in a series. I say implausible in that after years our heroine Sarah Kelling grabs hold of a little insight and pieces together the crimes without a shred of evidence and once the evidence is discovered she has guessed correctly all of the time. But I like Sarah as the heroine of the series, even though she gets a bit brash at times. The series is set in Boston and we see the Brahmin community on display. All revolves around an old family vault that was used because one of the family members designated it for where they wanted to be buried. Once the vault is opened the chaos, murder and thievery is uncovered. The book is well-paced but really picks up steam during the last few chapters.

Thanks to NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in return for an honest . Prolific author Faith Martin is back with a new cozy mystery series featuring Monica Noble. Noble is one of the least offensive cozy characters I have read, as most of the book features local detectives trying to solve a murder. We are in the Cotswolds for this book and in the village of Heyford Bassett, the vicarage has been turned into a multiple apartment complex with the vicar and his wife. Monica, living on the first floor. One day at a get together another one of the apartment owners is murdered in the flat next to Monica. We have a stolen shotgun, a multitude of characters and a wonderfully moving plot and story. Unlike many other cozy's Monica is not there bugging the police or butting in all the time, instead our author allows the police to do their work and Monica has a few clues that she can use to assist now and then. A logically written book, with almost a few too many characters, it nonetheless provides lots of red herrings and possible suspects until the final dramatic ending.Really enjoyed this book!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 25, 2019","Sep 15, 2019","Aug 25, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52293371-the-vicarage-murder

An enjoyable mystery book featuring Lana Lee whose family owns a restaurant business and who apparently has a knack for solving crimes/mysteries involving the Asian community in Cleveland. Love that she sets the book in Cleveland and uses the Asian community in her works. A fast-paced and well-written book that begins with an explosion of a food truck and death of its owner and devolves into a lot more issues and hidden mysteries within the Asian community. I like the character and her roommate, not much depth on the police who are investigating things but other than an initial suspicion seem to be out of the loop in terms of solving the murder/explosion. My only issue is that I think the killer was too obvious from the start but the reasoning was very understandable in a twisted sort of way. While I rate this a 4**** book I actually round it to 4.5**** due to the authors use and acknowledgement of one of the greatest detective shows ever, one that should still be on TV, BURN NOTICE!Very enjoyable read with a lot more depth and insights than in cozy mysteries.

Probably the first reason I loved this book was that from 1975-78 I was in Law School in Los Angeles and these events were part of my experience in SoCal. Some might be put off by the social history in the book, but for me it was fascinating to read what people had written and thought about the California Dream. For me it was 3 absolutely great years, but it is interesting to see how many thought that the Dream has peaked anywhere from 1969 (Sharon Tate murders) to 1978 (Hillside Strangler). Whatever it was I loved California at that time period, and I hated the Dodgers! Much more a fan of the California Angels, maybe because they reminded me of my home state Philadelphia Phillies! Whatever, the reason I could never understand the mystique of the love of the Dodgers. I do admire the organization and it is fascinating to read how that group of players developed, as well as all the inside scoops about the players, manager, media, etc. The book reminded me why I hated Tommy Lasorda, who was the biggest self-promoter out there. He came off as bigger than the team and the organization. If you are interested in baseball as well as reading a good amount about California than this is the book for you.

We are treated to actual events and historical figures such as Henry VIII, Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, Martin Luther, the Council of Worms , the book burning in London and on and on it goes.

I never read any of Vivien Chien's book prior to this and I am now looking forward to reading all she has written. An enjoyable mystery book featuring Lana Lee whose family owns a restaurant business and who apparently has a knack for solving crimes/mysteries involving the Asian community in Cleveland. Love that she sets the book in Cleveland and uses the Asian community in her works. A fast-paced and well-written book that begins with an explosion of a food truck and death of its owner and devolves into a lot more issues and hidden mysteries within the Asian community. I like the character and her roommate, not much depth on the police who are investigating things but other than an initial suspicion seem to be out of the loop in terms of solving the murder/explosion. My only issue is that I think the killer was too obvious from the start but the reasoning was very understandable in a twisted sort of way. While I rate this a 4**** book I actually round it to 4.5**** due to the authors use and acknowledgement of one of the greatest detective shows ever, one that should still be on TV, BURN NOTICE!Very enjoyable read with a lot more depth and insights than in cozy mysteries.

I read this authors first book and now her most recent offering and the basic style of the book and the main character remain true to the initial offering about 12 books ago. That being said, this cozy mystery is a little to ""cutsie"" for me. Aimed at the Hallmark Channel crowd, the author writes well, but the main character just grates on my nerves. But I do admire an author who knows her stuff and writes to a dedicated group of fans. Here we have some antique and expensive Christmas ornaments that are taken from the room of a dying patient at a Nursing home. These things do happen, and the author does point out (not sure if that is her intent) this important issue in the lives of elder patients who either are in nursing homes or have caregivers. Since book 1, our heroine Sadie has become a private investigator and learned how to pick locks, but always manages to circumvent the rules to get to the eventual solution as is done here. And, as with the first book, we are treated to about 10 recipes throughout the book. These are good! I have copied at least 4 or 5 of them for our family to make together.

The book was a revelation to me because it certainly dispelled a lot of urban legends about the space program and gave me a great insight as to how NASA actually adapted prior breakthroughs and blended them into the space program - TANG is a major legend!

This basically focuses on US espionage from 1946-51 and deals with what was known as Inner Asia and Tibet. Blunder, blunder, blunder. We were hopeless and helpless. We had one competent man in the Kazak territory and he gets little or no help and eventually dies at the Tibetan border. We learn facts of how our newest weapons were literally handed over by the Nationalist Chinese troops to Mao's Red Army, how Chiang Kai-Shek most likely siphoned off close to $750 Million dollars from US aid back in that time period and may very well have used some of it to influence and support McCarthyism, how we again literally airdropped new weapons to Red Chinese after they invaded Tibet and we had no intelligence on the ground to tell us that the invasion took place. Many espionage and state department blunders, as well as folks who are part of this story and whom I am not sure I trust all of their version of events.

And very well done as the author switches from one characters mind to another - all helped along with different font and type styles which allows the reader to easily follow these conflicting individuals.As always, so very well written.

This book deals with the murder of Philip Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key) by US Congressman Daniel Sickles, due to Key’s adulterous relationship with Sickles wife Teresa. I had remembered Sickles due to his heroic efforts at the Battle of Gettysburg, but was unaware of this part of his life. Here the author delves into the past live of all three involved in the incident, and then gives us a really good overview of the events leading up to the shooting. Probably the most open secret in Washington was the affair between Key and Teresa, with the only person who was ignorant of the situation was Daniel Sickles, and once he found out there was no doubt as to his actions.One of the best parts of the book is Chapter 15 “Special by Magnetic Telegraph” which introduces us to the telegraph system and how that changed the way news was transmitted as well as the new “speed” getting out the story. So many similarities to today’s internet, texting and Social Media it is truly a great part of this story.We also have the first Dream Team of defense attorneys, and that harkens back to the OJ trial, as does the media coverage the case receives. Coverage was so extensive that it was next to impossible to even seat a jury of 12 disinterested men. The book is filled with trial testimony, opening and closing statements and arguments and the use of temporary insanity as a legal defense for the first time in a case such as this.

He is probably one of the more under-appreciated authors but he writes a tight police thriller. Here we have the Norwegian Ambassador to Thailand killed and body found in a hotel room.

The contract that appears in the titles deal with contracts that independent individuals have to help or assist CIA in overseas actions. Lots of shoot 'em up, but not nearly as much as book #1 which had a bit too much and which were a bit too unbelievable for me. This book is different. Set in 2002 the action is set in South Africa where we have a rogue nuclear bomb that is being sold by a former South African military man to terrorists who plan to use it against the US. The CIA spots a thermal signal and they contact Hayden Stone to go into action and find the bomb and secure it for the US. Not all that simple. I think the author does a good job of showing the CIA always a half step behind in its intelligence and how 2001 caught everyone off guard. Are we dealing with Libyans, or other terrorists. Where is the bomb headed and how do we get control of the bomb. All questions Stone has to face. Better plotting but there are still a bunch of unnecessary characters and actions, including a bird drone which is neat but really does little to advance things. A US Ambassador who is just window dressing, and some side characters that just go nowhere. But it all does come together.

That is how I feel about this first book in the Mickey Rawlings Mystery series. I really love Baseball and heard a podcast about this book so I thought I would give it a try. Probably won't try others. So what did I like? Well it is a first time mystery author and so that is a good thing. The time period of the book, 1912, and the the use of the early days of baseball as the basis of the book. And some of the research.That also is bad, because some of the research is outdated and there is nothing that I dislike more than when an author uses real people as part of the plot and then changes their bio to fit the plot. Here the author had two different people murdered, a baseball player and a former player, back in 1912. Unfortunately those two individual were neither murdered nor died in real life at that time, as a matter of fact the player who was killed off actually continued playing baseball after 1912. See, that in itself turns me off. Either create a character or fit the book to actually portray the individual you are going to use in the plot. I do not know why the author did this, other than he felt that was the best way to write the book. The other issue is the actual character Mickey Rawlings, who is prone to being both hopeless in his bumbling into problems, as well as his thought process as to who was the killer. The author wants us to believe that Ty Cobb was a suspect according to Rawlings, then it was AL League President Ban Johnson. It just gets dumber and dumber. And by the end the actual solution is rushed and how he solves the mystery makes little sense. I was rushing to finish this book, not because it was a page-turner, but rather because I just wanted to get this over with!

You may like Budweiser or Bud Light but it is questionable if you would like this family that drinks too much, has one who uses tons of illegal drugs, and is involved in multiple deaths although they never get charged with anything. The Kings of Beer got the Royal treatment in St. Louis or wherever they went. But by the time the leadership got to August IV the writing was on the wall.

Budd is the son of a Connecticut munitions manufacturing family, but lives his first 13 years of life with his mother in the Cote d'Azur of France. He sees his father sporadically when he comes to Europe on business but for the most part he is with his mother whose name is Beauty (I kid you not, but there is a long backstory to this). He eventually goes to Germany to learn the Eurythmic style of dancing and meets and makes friends with one boy from Germany and one from England (whom I assume will be fixtures in the future books). The time period in the book in 1913 thru 1919, and we eventually see Lanny going to CT to meet his American family and then returning to Europe where he stumbles into a position as part of the Paris Peace Conference which led to the Treaty of Versailles. I was captivated by the writing and the book. Sinclair was a Socialist and you can see that point of view coming through during the last half of the book when everything basically focused on the diplomats and the way they carved up the world. Personally I thought that Conference and Treaty was horrible and much of that was the fault of Woodrow Wilson and brought a religious conviction that to solve the worlds problems it was his way or the highway, and unfortunately Wilson was not really a world scholar and had no idea what he was talking about on many issues. Every country was a fault for this, and we see Lanny in the midst of all of this and even see his point of view change dramatically during the book.It is a fine effort, and written more than 20 years after the events of the book, Sinclair is able to add some perspective and prejudice to these events. It is very heavy on the history part in the the last half of the book, but it is fascinating to see all the machinations that went on in Paris and all the players who were involved. This series was lost for years and thankfully was rediscovered and put in eBook form. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 21, 2018","Jan 02, 2019","Dec 21, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36318913-world-s-end

He is not a debunker, but rather is a skeptic and by the end of the show has basically been able to prove how the seer was able to tell the audience members facts about their lives. And, shortly after the show the medium is found dead and Eli is considered a main suspect. In a way this reminds me of British TV Series ""Midsomer Murders"", because once someone is murdered there becomes a rash of murders and here we have a lot of deaths, as all types of mystics are killed.

This book has the feel of the final book of the series since it is only about Tayte's attempt to find his natural parents and is written in such a way that by the end we come to a very satisfying conclusion to that issue and more. Since then there have been two new books in the series and so I am wondering why the author used this book to wrap up that plot line and interested to see what he does with things in the next two books. Botton line is that Tayte was put onto a lead as to his parents in Book 4 and now he is tracing that information to Germany, where we are met with the very real issues of old Nazi's, neo-Nazi's, Nazi hunters, etc. as we follow Tayte around town. A few things bothered me in this book. First - all he wants to do is eat! Every time there is a crisis or situation Tayte keeps wanting to go out to dinner in the midst of things. Secondly, Tayte continues to make the same stupid blunders he has made in the past, only more so in this book. Always getting messages and getting caught in dangerous situations, it is as if he just does not learn from his past mistakes and here it almost costs him his life. And Third, he solved the mystery way to easily. Yes there was some research, but once he got down to brass tacks it was one day and done and things are revealed. Now the book did keep you going, as you keep wondering how he will get out of the dilemmas that he puts himself into, and some of these ways are a bit convoluted but nonetheless it is another good read from Steve Robinson.

Well done by Bohjalian, as this one is much more a psychological and emotional book. We see how people react to the murder, we get to know Alexandra and her life. And I must admit that the ending was somewhat predictable but who dies at the end sort of surprised me! I do enjoy the author and this one was, for me, as fast and interesting read about human nature and the depravity of what is going on in Eastern Europe and Russia with these young girls who no longer have parents. Bohjalian does as great job of making us see what happened in Alexandra's life and how she got to America....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 26, 2018","Oct 28, 2018","Oct 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25513627-the-guest-room

Here Sergeant Troy is tasked with finding the murderer when the only clue is a severed arm found amid the rubble of a bombed area of London. This quickly turns into the search since a 2nd murder victim is identified and then a potential 3rd victim who has disappeared without a trace. It is interesting in that in this book the bad guys are those in the CIA (OSS at the time) and we have an interesting interplay with a Communist leaning femme fatale along with a OSS Communist hunter, and then there is Sergeant Troy who has mixed loyalties. His family came from Eastern Europe, but he was a British citizen who is not overly patriotic, but rather is in search of Justice. A lot of interesting characters, but as in Lawton's other books we get information sort of just dumped on us. Troy figures things out that nobody else can and we never really get the A to B = C sort of evolution of facts and final plot. As in his other books the ending is a bit far fetched, but overall it is a good effort. Troy is not an overly sympathetic character because he rushes full speed into things, get shot a few times, beaten severely, hospitalized, etc. all because of his penchant for lone wolf justice and attempts at retribution.

He is a historian and most all of his books are non-fiction histories. He has written one other novel before this, and many have not read it but know about it. That title, ""Forrest Gump"". So years after Gump the author decides to write a new novel and chooses a very interesting historical time.

It is a very well researched book, as I would expect, but there are some far-fetched episodes throughout the book. I gave this a 4**** because of the historical research and use of so many historical figures like BlackJack Pershing, George Patton, Ambrose Bierce, John Reed, Villa himself and a host of other characters.

This is a wonderful book by a Historian whose previous works were all non-fiction and all dealt with the Tudor dynasty. She decided to turn her attention to fiction and write about James 1 the first of the Stuart kings. Here we meet all the anger, jealousy, and deception of court life under King James who comes from Scotland and desires to rid England of its Papist (Catholic) past, along with stamping out all whom he describes as witches (basically herbalists and other women who allegedly put curses upon his family and kingdom.) We see all of this through the eyes of Frances Gorges, whose parents are minor royalty, and who is chosen by her uncle to come to the court to enhance the families chaces of success and advancement and who ends up as the lady of the bedchamber for 8-year old Princess Elizabeth.This is really a wonderful historical story that deals with the advent of Protestantism in England, the operation of the court of James 1, as well as letting us know that James was pretty much a homosexual! (never knew that). And then we get to the gist of the story - this is about the Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament and kill James and his two sons in order to put Princess Elizabeth on the throne. These are not delights of fiction, instead the author weaves her tale while using historical characters and events.

We end up finding a ""hidden auditorium"" where Wagner has hidden his final masterwork opera for over 125 years and which will dispel many of the myths that associated his works with Nazism.

Baretshire is a 6-book series set in the imaginary county of Baretshire and in this book we deal with the Dr. Thorne's family along with those of local county squire Frank Gresham. Lots of family history here as well as a very good representation of the 1850's in England, a time when ""blood"" mattered more in matrimonial choices than love. That is unless there are economic difficulties which requires the changing of marrying only the best ""blood"" (social equivalent) to ""Marry for Money"" which becomes the overwhelming issue in this book, as local 21-year old squire Frank Gresham, Jr, falls in love with penniless and poorly born Mary Thorne (niece of title character Dr. Thorne) and this is the basic premise of the book. How the gentry led their lives and loves and what happens when the landed gentry is out of money and must resort to all sort of ways to marry off daughters and get their son to lose his love for Mary and ""marry for money."" The book is rather repetitious on some of these topics and could easily have been 100 pages shorter and still made its point. I love Trollope who wrote 47 novels and many short stories and plays in the days when all writing was written on paper, using a quill and ink. The sheer volume of work done by Trollope, Dickens, Zola and other writers who toiled in this manner is truly impressive and makes you wonder how none of them went blind with poor writing conditions! Trollope's Baretshire series is a lot of fun for me, I love his subtle humor and how he names characters to poke fun at them, for instance he the name of the one law firm is ""Sloe and Slideawhile"" as well as many other ways he pokes fun at English society in general. Trollope is eminently readable - more so than Dickens in the sense that he writes a bit plainer and with less grammatical accoutrements (no overuse of punctuation or sentences that go on for a paragraph!), and in this way I feel is an easier read to 21st century readers.

Yes all this and more in the 3rd installment of the Jonathan Argyll and the Italian National Art Theft Squad series by novelist Iain Pears. This book is decidedly different from the first two in that most all of the action takes place in California where Argyll is trying to deliver a valuable Titian painting and get paid $4 Million. But nothings works our right, as a lost Bernini bust shows up at the same art gallery and once that happens it opens a can of worms that lead to another interesting peak into the world of Art Theft and those trying to profit from this. We also see advancement in the subplot of Argyll and Art Detective Flavia de Stefano's personal relationship. A good and quick read. Lots of possible suspects and an Agatha Christie style ending that is a lot of fun. Being Italian, I love reading these books that deal with Italy and Art. They are fast reads and were the beginning of Pears career that has now stretched into lengthy novels, which are good, but I wish he would eventually return to these Art Mysteries - there are 7 of these and so I ration them out very slowly so that I do not run out of enjoyable reading too quickly.If you have never read any of these, you should take time to delve into the world of Art Historian Jonathan Argyll and the cases of the Italian National Art Theft Squad - you will have a wonderfully good read!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jul 27, 2018","Jul 29, 2018","Jul 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1111493.The_Bernini_Bust

Super popular, I was the 42 hold on our public library's 17 copies of this book and there still are over 120 holds for this book. I think I enjoyed the authors Woman in Cabin 10 a bit more, but here we have a story of unknown identity, a large inheritance, past crimes and new revelations, all of which seem to be tied together by Tarot card readings. Our heroine is a 21-year old girl who lost her mother 3 years ago, has no idea who her father is, is in debt to a loan shark and gets a letter saying she is named in the Will of her grandmother - even though the only grandmother she has known about died years ago. Who is this grandmother, what is her family relationship, what is her inheritance, are all questions she needs to discover. And so the author takes us on a journey of discovery. The young girl Hal (short for Harriet) is a Tarot Card reader at the pier in Brighton Beach, and throughout this book she keeps referring to these cards in her quest to find out the answers to the questions. Was a bit too much of that for my personal taste, but it was an interesting way to move the plot along (along with her hearing her mothers voice, in her mind, at these times to help her understand what is happening.I guess the biggest reason I did not give this a 5***** is because I figured out who was Hal's father and most of the plot very early in the book as, to me, it was the only obvious answer to these questions.

This time he tackles the early 20th century, a time that many referred to as the good times. Lord takes us chapter by chapter through events from 1900-1914. Throughout all these good times there were certainly a lot of bad times mixed in. He also has a fascinating way of analyzing a topic through preliminary events. For instance instead of the election of Woodrow Wilson, we spend the chapter dealing with the Democratic convention and all its political shenanigans. By the end Wilson secures the nomination in the 45th ballot and only after he had previously agreed to concede the nomination to Speaker of the House, Champ Clark, only to back out of that position a few hours later. We also get a wonderful chapter of the summer of 1914 when the main issue that was reported in the US papers was the end of the Mexican revolution, with little attention paid to the the assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand. We have a chapter on the race to the North Pole, the San Francisco earthquake, the women's suffragette movement, as well as those whom he calls the Cosmopolites who were the elegant socialites who flitted from here to there and most of whom ended up as passengers on the Titanic!

I had only peripherally heard of this disaster and really enjoyed Krist's writing style and his almost hour by hour detail of what was going on both in in the train and with the workers of the Great Northern Railway back in 1910 during this catastrophic avalanche. I personally felt that the supervisor got a raw deal in some of the post-avalanche inquest and trials. They portray a man who was working almost 24 hours for days on end, doing heroic efforts to try and free the passengers that were stuck in the Wellington Station, when there was really nobody else who could make decisions or who had a better read on the situation. Basically we have a horrid storm that puts a freakish amount of snow on the mountain, then you combine that with both rising temperatures and thunderstorms that make the snow almost like concrete. Relief rotary plow engines could not make it to the Wellington station prior to the Avalanche - why? Well the rotary plows were about 13' in height and the snow pack on some large portions of the track was over 30' high! Rough conditions. Not sure who is to blame, if anyone, but after reading the book I guess it would have to be the designers of the rail line who took a torturous path through the Cascade Mountains to please rail owner James Hill (another person who can be truly blamed for a lot of the problems.)A fascinating local history lesson for all of us about when the industrial revolution had yet to be brought up to proper safety standards.

Heck, I never even heard how much of this battle was actually a siege with daily tightening circles around the mission. The author tackled about 10 topics during his life, wrote the definitive book on the Titanic, and the research is just fantastic.

This time he points his research and book at Los Angeles, a place I have always loved (heck I even went to Law School out there!). By focusing on three individuals, Krist shows how they developed this city from almost out of nowhere. William Mulholland figured out how to get water to the city; D.W. Griffith made Hollywood famous for his early film masterpieces; and Aimee Semple McPherson tapped into the areas unique religious diversity to form the first megachurch that attracted thousands to its doors on an almost daily basis. There were, obviously, others who helped develop Los Angeles, but by limiting his focus the author condenses the story to a rather fast reading book. So if I loved the book so much, why only 4****. Most likely because it does not, for me, really bring anything new to the story of Los Angeles. Maybe due to living out there for 3 years in the 1970's, or maybe because of my love of books, movies and history I had already known most of these stories, or for whatever the reason I was aware of all the players in the book. If not for that to me it would definitely be a 5* effort. Krist has become a grand chronicler of this type of ""soft"" history, in that while he is not a trained historian, but he uses his research efforts to zoom in on a single topic (the development of LA, or in other books New Orleans and Chicago), and paints a very vivid picture of those times.

Not sure why all that is really necessary unless it is to make us appreciate the detectives need for more and more information, information that goes back to the time the two authors were in Middle School together.

Aaron is called back to Kiewarra by a note he got from Luke Hadler's father and thus begins a quest to determine if this really was a murder/suicide or were the Hadlers murdered by a 3rd party. Falk and his father were run out of town 20 years ago when one of Aaron's friends was found dead in the river.

I must unfortunately disagree with many of my friends on this book. This is truly a story about an alcoholic. Flight attendant Cassandra Bowen may be one of the least sympathetic characters I have encountered. She is a train wreck, and the repetitious writing about her need for alcohol and what she does when she passes our or blacks out are both monotonous and irritating. Anyway she blacks out one night in Dubai and awakens with her dead coital partner dead in the bed next to her with his next almost completely severed and she was so blitzed that she knows nothing about it. Did she kill this man or did someone else kill him. Cassandra makes every bad choice possible, from continuing to need drinks to sleeping with numerous men. She truly, to me, is unsympathetic and pathetic. The story line is OK and would have been better had the author not spent half the book on the alcohol and more on some plot development. Cassandra basically drinks when she is told not to, confronts people when she is told not to, disobeys her Union rep and her lawyer. Oh, in the end we also have some big surprises that come out of the blue and also have a chance encounter on an airplane this is supposed to make us look at Cassandra redemptively. Trying to figure out how she knows who the father of her child is since she loves to sleep around almost as much as she loves to drink. Just a total disappointment to me (and God knows I am no prude) as to the book, the plot development and the alcoholic escapades of Cassandra Bowen.

Then he also goes back in time with Wager to the 1909 World Series. How this happens who knows - of course nobody can time travel nor can we know how it could occur - but it is a great device in this book to teach young readers about some of the greatest baseball players and to show them the differences between todays game and that of yesteryear. The book also teaches some very good moral lessons, in this book the young man finds this card who belongs to the old lady next door, and has to decide whether to return it to her or keep the card and sell it to make a lot of money for his family.

He equates that with happiness and having the $$ to have peace of mind to enjoy happiness.

The author really concentrated on Adam Swann and never got to delve that much into the lives of family. Yes, we were given updates and carried the saga to some of the Swann children, but I got the feeling that like Adam Swann the author was getting tired. I think this was the last book of his third series of family sagas, and by the end you were almost wishing it could end 50-100 pages earlier. Despite 3 books there are still a lot of loose ends. Now I will swing to his other series that begins right after WW1, whereas the Swann's ended right at the day that war began.We do get to see the ebb and flo of the family and business but I really wanted more about George, Edward, Giles and all the Swann girls!

It is a combination of Time Travel and Baseball as our narrator takes a spill in present day and wakes up in 1869 Cincinnati where he becomes associated with the first professional baseball team - the Cincinnati Red Stockings. While many baseball folks seem to bow down in homage to Kinsella for his time travel works of ""Shoeless Joe"" and ""The Iowa Baseball Confederacy"" this is a far superior book. It is filled with rich historical people, places and things and for the life of me I cannot figure out why this novel has never beed adapted into a movie. Where Kinsella's books are fantasy, this book really shows us what it was truly like to live in 1869, and the adulation that America's first professional team received. We have gamblers and we see lots of pollution. We have Mark Twain, along with members of the Irish Fenian Society who want to invade Canada, which are dead on accurate portrayals of what was going on with the country and the Irish after the Civil War. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_...Was the time travel real, was it a result of a blow to the head, a vivid imagination of a man going through a difficult psychological time in his life? Who is to tell, and all time travel books are obviously science fiction in nature, but instead of going forward in time Darryl Brock takes us back in time. He is a History professor and you can see and appreciate the amount of research he has done to make this as real and detailed a book as one can read. On a few book lists I have seen this as a Top 5 time travel book of all time. Other lists do not even mention it - most probably because it was written in 1990 and a lot of readers are not as interested in this sort of time travel, especially one involving a professional baseball team.

Fascinating and present day story of a police detective you responds to a home break-in (there had been a series of these) and confronts the robber who refuses to turn around or respond to him. Both detective and robber are Hispanic and we finally get a few words from the robber but he refuses to turn around and makes a motion like he is going for a weapon. The detective has only 2 seconds to react and shoots and kills the robber. Then things get interesting. Lots of really good reality of present day immigration issues, social media usage and a publicity seeking person who makes a living by trying to paint every police shooting as excessive and beyond reasonable. We get into the mind of the detective who is our protagonist and all that he goes through, including the horror and remorse for killing a person.

Arthur because he directed that his correspondence be burned and so the author has had to rely on other source material to give us a well rounded look at a man who never wanted to be President but on whom the office was thrust due to the assassination of President Garfield. He began his public career as an attorney and gained an important civil rights victory, but as time went on he sank into being a cog in the Machine politics of New York and eventually was part of the corruption that was at the New York Custom house and was deeply involved in the spoils system of patronage. Eventually chosen to run with Garfield because Garfield needed to win NY state to win the election, we begin to see Arthur grow in stature and dignity after Garfield is shot and his eventual succession as President almost 3 months later. We also see correspondence from a Julia Sands who is a private citizen who for some reason has an unwavering faith in Arthur and some say she was his moral compass, which is derived from the 23 letters she wrote to him. Actually she gets a bit strange, and by the end I found her letters to be rather troubling, but she always believed in the good that Arthur could do. As President, Arthur turned his back on machine politics and began the first Civil Service Reform in the country - something that most people believe started with Teddy Roosevelt but it was Arthur who laid the groundwork and got the first reform bill passed. He also scrapped our tired and outdated Navy and moved us from a Navy of wooden boats to one of steel plated boats as he realized that without a modern Navy the US could quickly become marginalized by European countries who were trying to make inroads into the Southern Hemisphere, as well as in shipping and trade.I could write more but this short book tells the story much better than I can.

But it is Fandorin who keeps asking questions and 2+2 never equals 4, usually it is 3. Something is missing and so he is put on the trail of investigating his hunches, even though nobody thinks he is on the right track. Guess what!!! A wonderful book filled with intrigue, fascinating characters and so many twists of fate that you never know how Erast will escape his newest dilemma. Deep breathing helps in one tight spot and his Lord Byron Gentleman's Corset helps in another. I was able to figure out some key mysteries to the case before they are revealed, but that in no way diminished my enjoyment of this book.

A solid book but the author gets away from her home base and sets a lot of this book in Hungary in the mid-60's. That in and of itself is not why I rated this lower than her other works. The biggest problem for me is that we have a missing journalist and out of the blue (while on his first day of vacation) Martin Beck is called in specially by the Foreign Office to handle a missing persons case in a country he is completely unfamiliar with, and without any clues and is also directed to not really involve the Hungarian authorities unless absolutely necessary. So we have Martin stumbling around Budapest with no clues and no idea of what he is doing. He finds one or two pieces of information, but most of his other valuable info comes from his co-workers in Sweden. I don't know - it just struck me as a forced effort by the author. So many times this happens when authors try and expand their scope in a series and the efforts turn out to be sort of blah. That is how I felt about this book. Not a lot of action, a really bizarre ending to the case that has nothing to do with Hungary and so it was rather an unfulfilling read for me.Give it a 2.5** ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 25, 2017",Jan 2018,"Dec 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5393786-the-man-who-went-up-in-smoke

I understand why the author was so popular and the shame is that there are only about 10 books in this series. This is the 2nd of her books that I have read and I intend to read all of them. Her writing style is really good. What do I mean? First of all ther is a ton of dialogue, much of it in the form of interrogation. Plus as the action on the case bogs down her chapters become longer and much slower reads - it is as if she is putting the reader in the same emotional state as Martin and his fellow officers. This is something that is really great, especially since this crime takes well over 7 months to solve and requires some help from different continents and uses some great investigative work (remember this book was written back in 1967 with no such things as the internet or cell phones were available!). The plot is very simple, yet so difficult to solve. A woman is brutally murdered on a pleasure tour boat in Sweden and her body dumped overboard with no ID. He body is recovered and nobody knows how it got in the Lake, nor the identity of the decedent. It takes almost 3 months before the first break in the case and after that things still move at a slow speed. Now despite the slow speed there is a lot happening as they try to solve the crime. I previously read her book ""The Locked Room"" and this is similar in that she presents us with an almost unsolvable crime and we are on our way with Beck and his group of detectives as they attempt to catch the murderer.

Second, I thought the way Eve tracked down Rene` was very good and quite different from other novels. The overall espionage content of the book was very good. So what did not float my boat? The romance. Did little for me and once we find out what happens in Lille there is not need to keep going back to it, again and again. Also the relationship between Claire and Finn seems forced and I am not sure that was all that necessary to tell the story. Lately, for better or worse, I have become bored by books that get sidetracked on what I consider to be tangential details which are attempts to get ""into the characters"" minds, thoughts, etc. Some are good and necessary but too many times it does nothing to advance the actual story but makes readers feel more warm and fuzzy about events and characters. We read about how Eve also was working on espionage in WW2, but nowhere do we get any explanation of what she did. Also how did Eve really meet Finn and begin that relationship?

So sets up the plot as to how to what happened, to whom did it happen and who was the mysterious woman who was in the cabin next to her and loaned her mascara and then vanished into midair. Lots of thoughts as to who could be behind this death, if they can even figure out who was killed and who else was in that cabin next to Lo. I was able to figure out some of the plot but others were a surprise to me. I also thought that the character of Lo was totally unprepared for this cruise - I know she had some problems the day or two before the cruise but she seemed totally alien to cruising and never really did her homework on this cruise, a cruise she was covering as a travel writer and was expected to file reports and an article for her magazine.

This, in my opinion, is a horribly written book. The sentences are short, choppy and just plain poorly written. Take a look at Chapter Four. The plot was mediocre, she pulls the killer out of the hat and is someone we never even learn about until the last 4 or 5 pages of the book. There is absolutely no character development, the author uses names of people that we barely get introduced to and expects us to either remember who they are or figure out who they are. The narrator is kooky to put it mildly, and her interactions with both the police and the local plumber who she thinks is the killer is downright scary. We are told that the narrators sister Rachel, who is the murder victim, has confided in the narrator (Nora) that where she lives is a ""bad town"" OK, and what evidence do we have of that? Nothing that I find out throughout the book and there is no explanation for what is a ""bad town."" We are also caught up in a past assault of Rachel that happened 15 years ago and how Rachel is still looking for the perpetrator as is Nora. And we never do have any conclusion to that story line. I think we know who is might be but again this is so poorly written that I just cannot get ahold of what happens. The authors will jump back and forth in time from one paragraph to another and it is confusing and confounding. So why did I read this? I just joined a Mystery book club (not sure this is a mystery) and this is the book they are reading for the next meeting. But for me we have bad characters, bad character development, poor plots and storylines that go nowhere, poor writing and characters who are not sympathetic. And pulling the unknown, unseen, unmentioned killer out of the hat at the very end of the book is pretty bad in my opinion. That is why I rounded this down to a 1* and will not read the authors next book....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 27, 2017","Oct 30, 2017","Oct 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27246107-under-the-harrow

She has settled into a pattern and it appears we have our core characters for the series. We have Stephanie our bounty hunter, her parents and grandmother, her hamster Rex, policeman Morelli and a 2nd bounty hunter named Ranger, quite possibly along with former prostitute turned filing and assistant bounty hunter named Lulu.Evanovich has a gift for writing comedic dialogue and considering Stephanie lives in the Italian neighborhood and I am Italian there is a lot that makes me laugh out loud. Her dad is great as a long-suffering soul who doesn't do a lot but comment and stay out of the way. Her mom is a typical Hungarian/European character that strikes home since my wife is from Romania. To me the most forced character is her grandmother whose humor and actions seem totally forced and unrealistic.So why only 3***? The plot is easy to figure out and while Stephanie figured a lot out by page 143, most readers will figure it out about 100 pages earlier. It is about the resale of government weapons and ammunition, and it is pretty apparent who is behind all of this. Also, her encounters with the perpetrator are all by chance and in real life she would have been killed about 10 times in each book.Nevertheless it is a true light, cotton candy, read and I will probably go back for more since the characters are endearing enough to offset the holes in the plot and actions of the same characters.Once again, a big shout out to my daughter Sara for introducing me to this series....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 23, 2017","Oct 26, 2017","Oct 23, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/7074082-two-for-the-dough

Have obviously seen and read about the popular series but never tried it. After having just read The Bully Pulpit, Emile Zola and James Michener this book was like Cotton Candy. Finished it in one day. It is a light and easy read. The author does hold your attention which is good and this is just the first book of the series so there definitely can be a lot of room for growth in both the characters and the writing.The plot is a tad bit unbelievable. In that an unemployed girl would become a bounty hunter, and knowing nothing about what she is doing she goes after a huge payoff is she can collar and bring in her old HS friend who is now a cop and charged with murder. Not sure if this is supposed to be comical but Stephanie Plum is inept to put it right and stumbles into everything that happens. She is helped out by the very person she is supposed to be bringing in, she buys implements of the trade and has no idea how to use them.

When I cut the cord on the TV and went to internet TV and specifically Acorn TV, I watched the Agatha Raisin series, along with Hamish McBeth - both of which are adaptations of the authors books. I had been unaware of Beaton as a writer and was disappointed when the Agatha Raisin series ended after only 9 episodes. So, much to my delight, as I was looking for a new audiobook I came upon all of MC Beaton's Agatha Raisin series. I immediately downloaded it and what a pleasurable experience I had.First of all, this book (as well as most all of her other works) was read by my old favorite Penelope Keith. Have loved her in BBC shows for decades and she is just a superb narrator.Agatha is a high-powered advertising executive who sells her business and moves to the country.She tries to blend in by entering a Quiche baking contest, but rather than blending in she becomes the spotlight due to the fact that while she lost the competition, the judge died after eating her quiche - well, actually not her quiche but one she bough in London and tried to pass off as her own. And so begins the first of over 20 Agatha Raisin mysteries - they are fun, they have quirky characters and it is a riot to read/hear about the characters in the book and compare them to those in the TV series.

Here we are looking at a situation where the current spy agency is both questioning and trying to undermine Operation Windfall that involved George Smiley and all his fellow Cold War agents. Much of this book is seen as a series of flashback as set forth in Agency memos and notes. I really enjoyed the book and it made me a bit peeved at the new political correctness that pervades agencies who do not have a historical perspective to understand and appreciate what their predecessors had to go through during that time period. The book really makes it appear that the British Covert agencies are on trial for ""collateral damage"" deaths that occurred in the Cold War, while at the same time being blind to the actions and counteractions that were undertaken by the East Germans and Russians.Not sure if this will be le Carre's last book, but if so it wraps up a lot and allows us to take a look at todays spy agencies in not the most glowing light. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 16, 2017","Sep 23, 2017","Sep 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34496624-a-legacy-of-spies

Wonderful storytelling with Book 7 doing a great job of ending the Harry and Emma Clifton Chronicles, while leaving other generations in play in the event the author wants to bring the family story to the present as we end in 1992.Let me begin by saying that Archer has created some of the best evil antagonists I have ever read in this series - with maybe the best being Lady Virginia Fenwick who wound her way through most all of these books. One character in the book referred to her as a ""devious bitch"" and that hit the old nail on the head. But we also have wonderful characters like Harry and Emma, their son Sebastian, Giles Barrington and his sister Grace and the list goes on and on. Book 7 really should be an inspiration to all of us - to make and keep New Years Resolutions, to be happy in our family lives, to be productive, and if you are still aspiring as I am to write a book then the inspiration to get up and get moving - we all have stories inside of us, and unless we write them down they will pass on forever. Harry Clifton wrote novels, he had a schedule, he worked hard and he also wrote a final master novel - not all of us are able to be authors, to become published or famous, but all of us have that ability to sit down and write our stories (you see why I mean that this book was so personal to me, it almost spoke to me). Life is hard, and the series shows that and also shows perseverance and kindness and compassion are essential human qualities in living a successful life, a life we can all look back upon some day with pride. The Clifton Chronicles are fiction, are a story, the good guys and bad guys mix it up. Bad things happen to good people, but eventually goodness wins out. As I sat there reading the final 3 pages of the book, reading Giles elegy for Harry Clifton, I wept. I wept for a beautiful story, a beautiful elegy about a man and family that captured my life for about 6 weeks, and for a story that will hopefully inspire me to become a better person, a better husband and dad, and to write those books that are inside of me (some of which are already started) and tell the stories that maybe somebody will find worthwhile and which will tell of events and times that are important to me and which will hopefully be a joy to my family and friends.This was a 5***** series and a joy to read.

Nope, none other than Marcus Didius Falco the private investigator who is the creation of English author Lindsey Davis. And “The Silver Pigs” is the first of 20 books she has written about the adventures of Falco set in 70 A.D. during the the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor Vespacian.I always marvel at how well British authors can work with the Roman Empire as a setting, as there are quite a few books and series set in Ancient Rome, as I am also a huge fan of the Medicus series by Ruth Downie – I admit I have not read the works of Steven Saylor from the US but hope to begin shortly. Here Davis has begun a series about the first gumshoe, as Marcus Didius Falco has left the military and has gone into this line of work, as well as working as an informant when the need arises. The plot in this book takes us from Rome to Britain and the Silver mines located there. We have the attempted kidnapping of a 16-year old girl who becomes Falco’s client, along with murder and intrigue at the highest levels of Rome as well as a conspiracy to defraud the Roman government of quite a large amount of silver ingots (thus the title of the book the Silver Pigs as pigs is another word for ingot). It is quite a fun and fascinating book, one that moves along at a very fast pace and provides us with a good plot, a good mystery, a good hero (Falco) and a beguiling heroine. The dialogue is realistic and the history is spot in accurate. If the remaining 19 books are anything like this one, then it will be a wonderful series for one and all to read, especially for those who enjoy history and detective novels.Highly enjoyed this book and give it a big thumbs up recommendation. Solid effort for a first book in a series, even though I could figure out some of the conspiracy and the conspirators before Falco – but that is OK since he is the first private investigator and I have read many more of these books than he has worked on cases!

With the Cold War having ended he has had to shift his focus and at age 82 (when he wrote this) he has done a remarkable job in keeping up with the times, being current in his plots and delivering a scathing look at the new normal in counter-terrorism. The book begins with a covert operation on the Rock of Gibraltar, a mission that was deemed a success despite some apparent issues prior to a raid on a jihadist. We are then seamlessly transported 3 years hence and from out of nowhere one of the participants in the operation appears and we find out that things were not quite what that appeared at the time of the action. We come to realize that we now live in an age of mercenaries and independent contractors, people who owe their loyalty and allegiance not to a country or cause, but rather to their greed for cash and power.

The book garners these stars not so much for the quality of the writing, but rather for the people and acts of humanity that town provided to over 6,000 passengers and crew that were forced to land there when US airspace was closed. We follow a few main passengers, a lot of the townfolk and a whole lot of compassion that this area of Canada was able to give (at no cost) to these unfortunate people whose lives were put on hold that day and for almost 6 days thereafter.It is a quick read and I wish there was even a more recent update as to the people involved and the friendships that were made both among the passengers, as well as among those kind kind people of Newfoundland.This is was humanity is all about, this is what makes us have faith in society. It is not governments or corporations, but rather the acts of kindness and love that were displayed at a time of great distress and how so few people could touch the lives of so very many passengers.Great story and a definite read for all who want an uplifting book!...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Jul 10, 2017","Jul 13, 2017","Jul 10, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1756706.The_Day_the_World_Came_to_Town

The cover was attractive, and the writeup sounded good and so I decided to give this detective novel a try. I really loved it. I am unsure as to why I have become attracted to books either by British authors, or set in Britain or in India - it could be that our cousin is engaged to a wonderful Indian gentleman who I greatly respect and love chatting with -or maybe it is just the entire British colonial period that has peaked my interest.For whatever the reason I really enjoyed this book, a detective novel set back in colonial India in 1837. It is filled with wonderful historical characters, as well as Indian and Hindu culture and poses some very interesting thoughts and questions about the East India Company along the course of the novel. Avery and Blake are sent to find a missing author, a man whom himself is looking to solve some issues as related to the Thuggee (road bandit) problems. We also have a lot of action, a tiger hunt, an attempted overthrow of a Rao, and the list goes on and on. Our heroes are kidnapped, make a remarkable escape, only to have other dangers befall them. It is not always action, since the author does his best to give is the flavor of India in 1937 and by using true life characters and incidents he imbues the novel with great sense of realism.This is the first of three books and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series in the near future.

The author has created a series in which we are brought into the lives of those living with Jana at the Jolly Grant house in Hamara Nagar which is situated in the northern hill country of India.Some may say that little goes on in these books in terms of adventure, but with Jana Bibi just everyday life is the adventure, as we are swept back to 1962 India and meet the host of characters who live with Jana in the home, most of whom she has adopted into her life - from Mary her cook and housemaid, to Tilku the young errand boy who she brought into her household and whom she is now sending to private school, to other friends and compatriots that draw us to this quirky yet charming town.We also get to see how every day life can bring both pleasure and pain, and yet we have no pain when we head into Jana's world. We get to see the similarities between people and cultures and if we look closely enough we realize that not a lot has changed in our lives. Sure we have left 1962 India behind us here in modern days, but the feelings and emotions that these books deal with are as real today as they were then. We see love, jealously, disappointment, happiness and friendship everywhere in this book and this series and as I sat and talked about this book with my wife it was obvious that we have more in common with these characters than meets the eye.A very quick and easy read, yet it is one that continues to draw us back to Jana and the Jolly Grant house and keeps us anxiously awaiting the next book in the series which hopefully will come soon!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 19, 2017","Apr 23, 2017","Apr 19, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18465515-emeralds-included

We went to battlefields on family vacations, and I used to read a lot of civil war stories. And then I hit a wall. Maybe it was going to college in South Carolina where the Civil War was referred to as ""The War of Southern Succession"", maybe it was that old History professor who gave me a B in the course on the Civil War, despite my having a high A average, and discovered that the professor was still fighting the war between the states and being from PA I was on the ""wrong side"" of the war. But for whatever reason I stopped reading and learning about the Civil War. For some reason this book called to me and so I got it on my Kindle and found that I, once again, had a desire to read more about the Civil War. This book was a fine effort by Keneally, and the fact that he is from Australia makes it even more impressive. We follow Usaph Bumpass as he fights with the Shenandoah Volunteers under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson. Through Bumpass we meet many other volunteers, conscripts, spies, military leaders and visit hospitals which exist to both heal the wounded and get information that can be passed onto spies for the Union. To be honest the only Yankee we meet is Decatur Cate and he is a conscript who was put into the army while ""visiting"" Virginia. We get to feel the emotions of the soldiers, as well as the mutual understanding of those they meet across the field of battle. We also get to see what a waste of human life this war was, and the carnage that it wrought throughout the entire book, but which culminated in the Battle of Antietam. There are not a lot of happy endings, and one certainly gets the feeling that the Confederates would have fared better had they never crossed the Mason Dixon line, but there were reasons they did so which are explained in the book, but through 20-20 hindsight we see how those decisions caused the ultimate defeat of the south. Union generals are accurately depicted as fools and incompetent but in the end a thoroughly defeated Stonewall Jackson still tries to figure out how he can send more men against the Union lines to try and salvage some sort of victory - while we cannot get into Jackson's mind I no doubt think this was an accurate depiction of the General and made me wonder how little life meant to him and the others who casually observed and slaughter and destruction of the war.A very good read and one that I heartily recommend to one and all, especially fans of Civil War history and historical fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Apr 12, 2017","Apr 28, 2017","Apr 12, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28508648-confederates

We are not going into any sort of deep historical fiction here, but rather this series reminds me an awful lot of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency - books that are fun to read, with enjoyable and some offbeat characters, a book that teaches you a little about history as well as Indian culture (all of this is set back in 1961) and which takes us to a simpler time in a very remote part of the world. Not a lot happens in this book, but rather we see some ordinary life and times for the characters, along with some potential problems for Jana Bibi and her friends and her fortune telling ring necked parrot, Mr. GangulyOne of the fun parts of these books is that it features Mr. Ganguly, who has now become a celebrity, along with Jana Bibi whose fortune telling endeavors have helped save the town from destruction in the first book. We also have attempts by friends and her house staff to get Jana Marries (she is a 59-year old widow), as well as some other members of the community who also seem to have been bitten by the love bug - was it because of LPN10? Who can tell.Anyway, this is a book that is a super fast read, and a book that just gives us more and more information on the lives of this unique group of people living in the Himalaya's of India. I cannot say that I see any really deep plot in this book because the fortune telling and tarot card reading done by Jana Bibi is nowhere to be seen and she now concentrates on Dream Interpretations. It is all in good fun and is just a feel-good sort of book. It is also a series, like the Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency, that is best read through a loan from your local library.

I think it is important to realize that this was the last of Folletts WW2/Spy novels, and you can see that by the way that he telegraphed a lot of the action, but nonetheless it is was a good and very fast read. After this book he wrote Whiteout which is set in Scotland and has nothing to do with WW2 and then begins his Pillars of the Earth series and the Century Trilogy both of which series were major departures for him.Here we follow the exploits of a few members of the Danish Resistance, as well as Danish police and Nazi sympathizers who try to stop them. While there are some British involved in the action, most of this is about the Danish resistance and what they have to do to get information out of their country and over to England.If you enjoy Follett, enjoy WW2 espionage stories and a fast read then this book is for you!...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Mar 25, 2017","Mar 29, 2017","Mar 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1251038.Hornet_Flight

There are some gaps and if you purchase this book expecting a lot about art, forgeries to fool Nazi's etc. you will be greatly disappointed since art is about 1% of this book.That being said, this book made me feel lousy about my Italian heritage. I know, I know. I have been there numerous times, and Florence is one of my favorite cities, but this book really brings the action of the Fascists to the fore and shows what a bunch of brutes they were. The first two sections of the book were very hard to follow as each character is set forth in very short and quick chapters which is nice for moving the book along but which makes it hard to follow and form some impressions or get close to the characters. Making it worse, a bomber squad from England is followed and then we lose track of them by the 3rd portion of the book. I know that they are not the most vital to the story, but they are actually the most fully developed characters in the book and to lose them left a hole in the story.You are going to be thrown this way and that by this book. You will see the horrors of the Nazi's and the Italian Fascists, and you will see how life was disrupted and ruined for most everyone in Italy during the War. The last section which is 40 chapters long finally gets everyone and everything moving and by the end you truly feel pain for certain characters and you feel absolute hatred for a few others.Go to Italy today and you will see beautiful vistas, gorgeous scenery and artwork, taste amazing food and wine, but remember that if you dig a little deeper you will find some very ugly scenes and people who dominated, decimated and destroyed this lovely country and its people. It is a vissage that we do not want to see, but it is something that we all need to realize and recognize and make sure that it never happens again. Many thanks to the author for this great look at the horrors faced during WW2.And if you are a movie buff, take a gander at Roberto Rossellini's classic WW2 movies, many of which were filmed at the very end of the fighting there: Rome, Open City; Paisan; and Germany, Year Zero.

The first part of the book is pretty good as we see Manju growing up in the shadow of his big brother and eventually surpassing him as an athlete. There is a ton of Indian cultural references in the book that are interesting, along with the family dynamic and some other characters who are there to profit from Manju's cricket prowess and that is a fascinating look at the game and the country, but the book falls completely apart as Javed (also a fine Muslim cricket player) comes into Manju's life and plays head games with him.

Maybe it wasI remember reading about this book in early July while in Romania and kept looking and looking for it and finally got it a few weeks ago. Maybe it was the anticipated wait, or maybe it was the authors first book, but the initial hype was not justified in my mind. What went wrong?Well, the book for me was a very slow read - not that a book has to be a fast read to be good, but it just plodded along for me. Also I am not sure of exactly what or whom the author really wants us to follow and root for. It is obvious from her end notes that the book is a tribute to the character Hilda - who was a true radio broadcasting pioneer - but it really is Maisie whom we follow with Hilda always just being in the background and answering questions cryptically.What is good about this book is the obviously tremendous research the author did on her subject of Hilda and the early days of the BBC, along with the British Fascist party and all of the political turmoil that was going on in Britain in the late 1920's, which culminated with Parliament voting for Universal Suffrage and the women deciding the course of the next election.We follow all of this through the naive eyes of Maisie who appears almost penniless and somehow gets a job at BBC and eventually rises through the ranks and becomes quite the valued employee when she moves from being an assistant secretary to the Director General of the BBC to the actual Radio end of the BBC and begins to work with Hilda on the radio Talk shows. Throughout we meet a lot of characters, most all women being portrayed well and most men being either cads or bores. But we do see a lot of the British value system being upset as times move on with the Roaring 20's and then the beginning of the Depression. We also meet some real-life characters through the book which is a lot of fun: Lady Astor, Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Wolf, and many other prominent men and women.But, in effect the book is truly a tribute to the hard-working women of the BBC.This is a little less than I had hoped for with the book, but I do want to point out how little the BBC has changed in a manner. When the BBC started the book points out all the talk radio shows they produced and the division of the BBC. Most shows were from 15-30 minutes long and some got so popular they had to add an extra 5 minutes at the end of the show to go over issues not touched upon in the broadcast. Now lets forward to the age of the internet and one of my favorite Podcasts is the BBC podcast ""In our Time"" which comes out weekly in about 35-40 minute main episode and then at the end we are invited to stay an extra 5 minutes for matters not covered in the podcast - pretty darn similar if you ask me. It is a wonderful podcast with episodes dealing with Science, History, Arts, Philosophy, Politics, etc. or in other words all those sorts of topics the BBC Radio began with back in the 20's to attract and educate their readers. Pretty neat perspective this gave me about both the radio and the podcast.Finally, a shout out to the Shelby (NC) Community College Library for providing me with this book through the Inter-Library loan system!

This is a very well researched book into the Pazzi Conspiracy and the attempt that was made on the life of Lorenzo de' Medici, which resulted in his being wounded and the death of his brother Giuliano. The author presents us with a whole host of characters, not just the main plotters and victims, but allies, painters, philosophers, spies, etc. To be honest, it is a bit much unless you are super into this time period and the life of Lorenzo the Magnificent. I enjoyed the book, but the first half plodded along.

This 2nd half moves quickly and finally puts into motion all the characters who are more posturized in the first half. There also are new documents that have been uncovered and decoded that show the extent of the Conspiracy and how it was not just the Pazzi who wanted the Medici's gone, but other powerful figures throughout the Italian peninsula.The book concludes with a great chapter on Botticelli paintings, some of which are still in the Sistine Chapel and others at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and the authors attempts to use the symbolism of the Renaissance paintings to show the true meaning behind these paintings. It is a fascinating read and one that shows all the power and politics, the alliances and the duplicities that ruled that time period. Filled with many black and white photos of major works of art (actually this is one of my pet peeves - if you are going to use great art, at least use color copies which are available for all of these paintings) that help you understand the people, the symbolism and the power that was centered in the Italian peninsula during the Renaissance....more",Notes are private!,1,30,1,"Jan 26, 2017","Mar 14, 2017","Jan 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2940358-the-montefeltro-conspiracy

I guess as a retired attorney the topic of this book fascinated me - the story of a triple murder in which the perpetrator freely admits his guilt and willingness to pay for the crime, and then the attempt by his attorney to have him declared insane.Let me begin by saying this is a very well written book, and despite one of my favorite books (The North Water) not being on the Man Booker list I cannot say that it was snubbed due to this book.The book reads like non-fiction but is truly a novel and a very well conceived book. The book is divided into sections: Preface, Statements of Residents, a Map, a Journal, Glossary, Medical Reports, Book Excerpt by the one witness, and finally the Trial.The book is also set up by the author as if it was a quest to find out the truth about a long lost relative, and the book also has fictionalized footnotes, along with newspaper quotes, etc. To dismiss this book due to the subject matter is not doing it justice. Very little in this book is brutal or gory, yes there is a murder and about 10 total pages throughout that deal with the specifics, but rather this is a book about a young man whose family has been bullied by another neighbor for years and once that family gets power in the village things get worse. It is obvious that the young man snapped from early on in the book, but the reasons behind it are what drives the narrative and the trial. This is not a fast book to read, as about half of the book is the journal as written by the killer and we find out many of the details of life in rural Scotland in the 1860's, and which give us a very good look at the life of one Roderick Macrae. Give this book a chance and you might find that you appreciate it and like it. What is even more fascinating are the statements of the residents and trial testimony and the conflicting views that the community has about the killer and the decedent.

Fannie's most recent book take us back again to the familiar surroundings of Elmwood Springs, MO, and host of characters we previously have met in her works. She also has added some new characters who actually are the founders of Elmwood Springs and we follow those founders and most of their families through the years. As with past books, that I have read, she follows a tried and true format of dividing things into decades and hits the high points of the decade in terms of the families. But, as with her other books they seem to falter and the stories get shorter and a bit less interesting as we hit the more recent decades. Some of the decades are only 20 pages long and I would prefer a bit more meat in these sections since she does a marvelous job in getting us there. Most of the early decades cover 50+ pages and allows time to get know the players and their stories. Flagg is a great storyteller and writes in a folksy manner, one that makes her an immensely readable author. I flew through this book, partly because I love her style, partly because of her characters and partly because we were familiar with many of the characters and had heard some of their stories before. Did I like the book? Absolutely. Would I read it again? Most likely, as she has a lot of fun with characters who die and who miraculously ""come alive"" again in the cemetery and who remain integral parts of her story. I also think that Fannie and I share a love of yesteryear - Americana and about the way things used to be. You can do that and not be an old fuddy duddy because there is nothing wrong with pointing out how things have changed - some better and some worse. But if you are familiar with many, many small towns you will recognize her stories of growth and decay. Of modernization and improvement that changes the character of a small town, and which can also eventually lead to its death. The same with the citizens of such towns. I always tend to reflect a lot after reading her books and she remains a great storyteller, and chronicler of changes in society and small town lives, loves, and virtues. If you have never read any of her books, please give them a try. I might not start with this one, but it definitely appears to be the final chapter of her Elmwood Springs books and characters and therefore is a very good read for her fans and wraps things up in a nice and neat gift-wrapped package complete with a big yellow ribbon. Thanks Fannie, as one devoted fan I cannot wait to see where you take us in the future!!!!!...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jan 11, 2017","Jan 13, 2017","Jan 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28953126-the-whole-town-s-talking

I had this book on my Kindle for over a year and one day I was talking to the family about the old Mini-Series format from the 70's and 80's (by the way are the 10-episode cable series that dominate todays TV really any different from these? I think not!), and I remembered this show and the book. So I began this almost 900 page book and a lot of things popped out at me. First of all, how horrid the TV casting was of the characters in the book. I know this is a book , but the mini-series played a big part in why I read this and so I must digress a bit.One thing that I have always read is that TV shows or movies always seem to get the ages wrong on the participants in these historic events. In the book Pug Henry is 49 and his kids are in the early to mid-20's. In the mini-series we have 64-year old Robert Mitchum trying to portray this character and then all the other casting runs from there with actors portraying characters who are all 15-20 years younger than the actor. And who in their right mind would cast Ali McGraw and Jan Michael Vincent in their roles - I know it is always about ratings but these were terrible choices!As for the book, we have Pug Henry who is a 49-year old Navy man who has a wonderful sense of perspective and becomes FDR's eyes and ears to the early stages of WW2. His one son is a fighter pilot and other son eventually becomes a submariner, and a daughter who goes into the entertainment business. Not sure what Madeline Henry really added to the book, but maybe that will become more evident in the sequel ""War and Remembrance"".Here we get to see the buildup of WW2, the invasion of Poland which was allegedly due to the Poles invasion of Germany - a deliberate faked invasion made up by Hitler - as well as his defensive invasion into Russia. There is a ton of really great history in this book, including portions which give the German point of view and which are very informative and thought provoking.We see the plight of the Jews, the plight of the Russians, the desperate attempts by Churchill and Stalin to get the US into the war, the Lend-Lease program that was approved by a Congress that did not want to supply arms or supplies to England or Russia but who approved this subterfuge, the mixed convictions of the US populace that wished to remain neutral but also which had a great deal of support for helping our Allies. I will also give this to Wouk, he made up some very unlikeable characters: Pug's wife Rhoda who is a flighty flirt who drinks to much and is a spoiled brat worrying about what she will wear to meet Hitler at a reception than the fact that the Jews of Berlin are starving and being dispossessed of their businesses and property, and a woman who loves nothing more than shopping; his son Briny who is just an arrogant and moody person who falls in love with the half-Jewish Natalie Jastrow who herself has few redeeming qualities other than dashing throughout war torn Europe to see her relatives and then having Briny chase after her and continually rescue her; and I could go on for a few others, but Wouk shows that families are made of noble stock like Pug, and son Warren, and then there is the flip side of Rhoda, Briny and Madeline. We follow this crew through all these pages and know that we are slowly going to reach the inevitable climax of Pearl Harbor which sets up the next book that will dwell on the actual time the US is at War with the Axis forces of Germany, Italy and Japan.While this was more of a 4.5 on my scale I rounded the book up because of all the historical research and many of the additional facts that I learned through Wouk's writing. I will take a bit of a break now because the next book in the series is over 1050 pages long on my Kindle and for now the Henry family can blaze away in defense of America and democracy and I will catch up with their saga later....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 05, 2017","Feb 09, 2017","Jan 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21484.The_Winds_of_War

This book is the 3rd of her works and she really moves this one along, almost as she did with The Secret Adversary (a Tommy & Tuppence mystery). It has a good pacing, a very good plot and for the most part this is a fine effort, but once again she gets a bit too cute for my tastes in that the last 50 pages of the book we have a litany of ""solutions to the case"" and while each of them has parts of the mystery solved it is not until the very end that Poirot clears things up with the official solution. All these so-called solutions many of which even include Poirot just wear me out.In this case Poirot is called to France to come to the aid of a wealthy landowner, but by the time he arrives the landowner has been discovered murdered and he and his narrator (Hastings) are now invited to help the local police and judge try and solve the case. We also get the debut of French Surete Detective, Monsieur Giraud, who is not a fan of Poirot and who for much of the book crawls around the ground on his hands and feet looking for those minute clues that will allow he to solve the case. Everyone marvels when he finds a cigarette and match, but Giraud always seems to miss the big picture. This is really a fun paring and I am hopeful that Giraud will be in future books as this gives Poirot a real antagonist in trying to solve the cases and it allowed Christie in this case to let the reader go decide who was headed in the right direction for solving the case and the differences in the two types of detectives. We have a death in this book, another death, mysterious backgrounds and host of characters who both assist and hinder the solution. As I have mentioned it is my intent to read all of Christie's works in their order of publication and so I have seen a lot of growth already in her 3rd book and while Poirot is still not my favorite of her creations, I am appreciating his methods more than in the first book. Parenthetically, it is possible that I dislike Poirot because I am not a fan of the actor who portrayed Poirot for years and years. I personally loved some of the other actors who portrayed Poirot in the movie adaptations of her books. But, my wife has convinced me to watch those Poirot episodes of the books that I have read that feature David Suchet as Poirot - what the heck, no matter what I am sure it will be a fun experience!!...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,Jan 2017,"Jan 08, 2017","Jan 01, 2017",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/14525207-the-murder-on-the-links

Why? To get away from some of the issues he was involved in at Deva and also to please his housekeeper Tilla who is from this area.It does not take Ruso long to get embroiled in a murder of a Roman Legionnaire and other issues. Ruso is the proverbial reluctant hero, as he always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and therefore gets sucked into solving these murders and intrigues. A bit different from the first book, we actually see a return of some of those initial characters but they play a more minor role: Valens the physician friend and Albanus his scribe. Even housekeeper Tilla seems to have left his side for most of the book, as she returns to her home area and finds relatives who thought she had died and then spends an inordinate amount of time with her prior boyfriend, which gets you know who all jealous and upset. But here we have murders, blackmail, a Stag Man who haunts and taunts the troops, we find out a lot about Tilla's Gods and the beliefs of those in the area.

Quite a different feel from Hercule Poirot, to be honest I wish she had written more books based on the Tommy and Tuppence characters. An extremely fast paced book that is filled with 1920's lingo and a great peak into the language and lifestyle of that time period.Tommy and Tuppence were childhood friend who rediscovered their friendship during WW1 when she was a nurse and Tommy was recuperating from a war injury. Eventually they are both down on their luck and decide to start a Young Adventurer business and advertise in the paper. They have no qualifications but somehow this entire mystery finds them and despite their novice stature they are instrumental in resolving the mystery which involves a secret WW1 Treaty that was handed to a courier on the Lusitania, who then handed it over to another person before the ship sank. Despite being 1920 this draft treaty still is politically harmful if it falls into the wrong hands and that is where these two come in. There is a lot of excitement and both of these individuals fall into harms way more than once, only to miraculously turn the tables and escape or help find missing clues.At times I do think that Christie is too convoluted in her plots and I think that her scenarios are at times so far-fetched as to be unbelievable. But Tommy and Tuppence pull us through with the help of the supporting characters, and in the end the mysterious Mr. Brown - our dastardly villain, bent on getting the document and bringing down the British government - is surprisingly unveiled and there are enough red herrings in this book to keep everyone guessing who is Mr. Brown. Fun read, I had the large print edition and that was a neat edition for this story. I like her work, but after two books am not convinced of her greatness as an author, but my goal is to read all her books (in order) over the next two years and I look forward to being able to make a much more well-informed opinion as to her works.

Enjoy these types of books and Margaret Creighton really has expanded her reach with this novel - her past were mostly all books dealing with whaling and other nautical topics. As she casts the spotlight on the 1901 Buffalo Pan-American Exposition, it is easy for us today to see that this event never really had a chance to be all that it has hoped for. It was held at a time when Worlds Fairs were the rage and every ""major"" city tried to have one and outdo the other cities, in this case the Chicago World Fair was the example and standard. But one cannot help but wonder how a smallish town in the upstate on New York, a town without a huge city population and with other large cities not in that close proximity, could attempt to better the Chicago results. Yes, Buffalo had Niagara Falls and what really appeared to be a neat electrification of the Pan-Am Fairgrounds, but like all Fairs it had its cast of characters and that helps explain some of the issues here.The Fair never really got off to the rousing start that had been anticipated and when President McKinley was assassinated at the Fair things only got worse. Again, and I try not to repeat myself, Creighton really does an outstanding job focusing on the people and the issues of the Fair.We have midgets, African-American issues, Filipino issues, Indian issues (led by Geronimo), animal issues and many who try to become famous by doing daredevil acts at the not too distant Niagara Falls. It is a fascinating book, about a fascinating time and was a very fast read for me. The author also uses the last chapter to wrap up all the story lines and bring light onto present-day Buffalo. I so enjoy this new vein of ""people or event"" history, books that really tell us about what I deem Americana and relate facts and stories that are lost in the past to most all of us. This book is extremely readable and enjoyable and is truly filled with photos of the 1901 Fair, and which got me looking onto internet sites to find out even more about this Exposition. In the end we are left with a Buffalo that tried its best, but just was not able to live up to the standards and hype of Chicago, and with an Exposition that dazzled many but which quickly faded out of peoples minds and into History - awaiting Creighton's superb research and writing.

Thanks, I really enjoyed the first book I have read by this author.Krueger has a series of mystery/detective books, but this is a stand alone novel set in 1961. It involves a summer where there are 4+ deaths in the little town of New Bremen, MN. The story is seen through the eyes of the narrator who is 13-year old Frank Drum. Drum's dad is the local Methodist minister, his mom is the choir director and organist, brother Jake has a severe stutter and his sister Ariel, who is soon leaving for college.Throughout the book I had a feeling of Deja Vu, as characters kept reminding me of those in the film ""Stand by Me""and ""The Sandlot"", and while I am sure this is just my imagination, it is not hard to envision some of those movie characters in this book since it is told through the eyes of Frank and also has a big part for his younger brother. Death takes many different forms and methods in the summer of '61 and New Bremen has a Sheriff who has never even had one homicide case! There is a lot more than death, however in this book, as characters struggle in the personal lives, the Rev. Drum has to deal with a host of spiritual issues and people struggle with the role of God in their individual lives and in dealing with these personal tragedies.Unfortunately, I figured out the ending about 2/3 of the way through the book - I never read these books trying to out think the authors or the characters, but for some reason this ending hit me in the face and that sort of hurt the book.Well written, a lot of good dialogue and some very good characters, characters that we can all identify with from our own childhoods....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 30, 2016","Dec 05, 2016","Nov 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803059-ordinary-grace

As we all know, reading is personal and I am not about to tell you that Conclave is the greatest book of the year, the most well-written book I have read, but when it comes to telling a story Robert Harris is one of my favorites and his choice of topics for this book is right up my alley - The Conclave at which the College of Cardinals elect the next Pope. No, I am not a Catholic, but I am fascinated with the religion and the way they choose their next supreme leader the Cardinal of Rome, the Pope.This novel is seen through the eyes of Cardinal Lomeli, the Dean of the College of Cardinals and the person in charge of the entire proceeding. He is guided by the rules of the Conclave and yet he is also has enough independence that he is placed in situations that allow him to interact with the other Cardinals. One thing about Harris is that he is a fine researcher in his novels, and he gives us a lot of insight into the entire selection process and inner workings of the Conclave.This book gripped me from the beginning and has so many twist, turns and human foibles, that it never drags for one moment. A very good read, a very interesting topic and one that does not take days and days to read.On a personal level, I have had the privilege of being in the Sistine Chapel 4 times, the first 3 were jammed packed with tourists (most of whom have not bathed for days or are so over-scented that you noticed the odors rather than the chapel!), and then one time I was fortunate to be allowed in the Chapel with my family for 45 minutes without anyone other than a guard in the room. It was awe-inspiring and helped me process all that was part of this book. I shall never forget my experience and I can only imagine how it must feel to be a first-time Cardinal in a Conclave and the overwhelming weight of Divinity while there.But I digress with my personal story, this is a very interesting book to read and one in which we see all sorts of human frailty, and you realize how personal the selection of a new Pope is to all 117 Cardinals, and how politics, in addition to the Holy Spirit, plays a huge part in choosing the right man for the job! ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 30, 2016","Dec 03, 2016","Nov 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31019607-conclave

I have not read any of Ann Patchett's work previously - seems like a theme for me with so many authors here in 2016 - but this was certainly a very worthwhile effort and story. It is a book that leaves me thinking about families, both functional and dysfunctional, and how they get along through life.Here we have a story of 6 children in two families and eventually the mother of one family marries the father of the other family. Not a lot of time or effort is spent on the ""adults"" but rather this is a book about the kids and how they adapt (or fail to adapt), and what goes on in their lives. The book takes us through the joint family scenario, with the real story being that the six kids like each other and are united in their dislike of the parents and the situation in which they are placed. The story covers over 50 years and each chapter begins with another time jump, and sometimes it is hard in the beginning to keep who is whom straight but the story drew me in. See a family with a lot of issues that the kids did not notice until the boyfriend of one of the children eventually writes a book based on their childhood and things begin to change. As time goes on we see shifting relationships between kids, a more understanding relationship with parents, and I really wish that there were another 100 pages since there were relationships and characters that I wanted to know more about.Fast reading book - took me about 2 days to finish this - and yet one that makes you think a lot about your childhood, your children's life and even grandchildren's life, and how we all change and adapt as life goes on.

I think I put it off because everyone talks about it, and there are movie adaptations that frequent TV at this time of year, and because until quite recently I just was not into Dickens.I enjoyed the book and yet I was let down by the book because it is different than so many of those TV shows. I may be the only person who finds disfavor in Tiny Tim (of course I also did not care for the character Oliver Twist very much either!). I think that when Dickens want to portray sadness and suffering he goes a bit overboard and Tiny Tim, to me, is an example of a character that is so unrealistic that it makes his part in the book totally lifeless and blah to me (and NO, I am not a Scrooge!). There were parts of this book I really enjoyed, especially Staves 1,2 & 4. Did not really care for Christmas Present in Stave 3, nor the ending as set forth in Stave 5. The transformation of Scrooge, while good to see, again makes a mockery of the Stooge character. Yes, people can have their hearts and minds changed, but Scrooge becomes maniacal in his crazy giddiness of goodness. Again, this seems to be a technique that Dickens uses when he is trying to make a point, but I found it almost frightening rather than charming or heart-warming.So, the book only rates a 3*** for me, but I am happy that I have read it and neat year I want to try some of his other lesser known Christmas tales....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Nov 27, 2016","Nov 29, 2016","Nov 27, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol

Love Sinclair Lewis, heck I named my dog Babbitt in honor of his book by the same name. But Arrowsmith left me cold. It won the Pulitzer Prize and for what reason I cannot tell. I, personally, think it as for his body of work instead of this individual book.To me the book should have been titled, Arrowsmith: A Good Life Wasted. The book has one redeeming character, Arrowsmith's wife, Leora, who sticks with him through good and bad, and always is at home to lend an ear or a shoulder for him to rest upon. Throughout this book Arrowsmith cannot make up his mind as to his life, his career, and so many other things. He is the King of wishy-washy and moves his wife all over the country as his quest for what he really wants to do with life changes again and again. Arrowsmith is a doctor, but really wants to be a immunologist, but did not have the qualifications in chemistry or math to really do the job properly. He moves from family doctor, to lab technician, to other jobs as he goes across the US. He crosses paths with many whom he believes are fools but all of whom do extremely well and become influential, and meanwhile Martin Arrowsmith lives on a measly salary and spends days in his lab doing tests to find cures for diseases, but once found he does not publish his results, and wants to study for the sake of purity of discovery, not realizing that his discoveries could help his employees pay his salary with the profits from the anti-bodies he works on. Same thing with love, he loves Leora but is always looking at other women and goes back and forth to the point of being ridiculous.Will end up rating this 2.5 and that is only due to Lewis' ability to make me want to continue to read about a man of whom I have no desire to know or befriend. Not a fast moving book and filled with typical Boosterism language that befits the 1920's.

There is so much in this book in terms of genetics, cloning, etc. and it amazes me that H.G. Wells could write such a book back in 1896. As I read the book, and read about the Beast People a lot of extraneous thoughts came into my mind. From Brave New World, to Dolly the sheep (the first cloned animal) to A.A. Milne and the animators at Disney who gave us the Winnie the Pooh dream sequence with Heffalumps and Woozles. This is a book with deep philosophical implications about genetics and how such genetic research was carried out by Dr. Moreau and how he went about cloning parts of one animal onto another animal in order to try and create a new breed that resembled man. But throughout you knew that something was going to eventually happen, and the beast within the animal would eventually win out over the attempts at modification. This book certainly gives us all something to think about, with regard to the nature of man, the nature of animals and even how what is called in the book ""vivisection"" was used to try and create and overcome nature. Where does one draw the line? Almost every week we see stories about genetic modifications and also about artificial intelligence and one must worry what the long term effects of this will have on the human race.This book took me about 4 days to read because there was so many issues to contemplate and to try and dash through the book would be doing it a disservice. At the end, Wells even has a short note that one of the chapters of the book is based upon an 1895 article about cloning and here we sit almost 120 years later and you have to truly marvel at the imagination and the predictability of Wells and the people that he read or met who had filled his mind with these possibilities.Have not really read a lot of Wells work, but we are all familiar with his works. This book is not as shocking to our modern sensibilities as it was back in Victorian times, but nonetheless it is a warning of what can happen when genetics and cloning run amok and the natural order of the world....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 20, 2016","Nov 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/567707.The_Island_of_Dr_Moreau

And if you love Film Noir movies, or Alfred Hitchcock films, than Eric Ambler is the author for you! Hitchcock is quoted as calling him a ""phenomenon"" and reading this book you can see why. Written in 1937 the book takes place prior to WW2 and introduces us to a Hungarian name Vadassy who is taking a brief rest on the southern coast of France before traveling to Paris, where he is a foreign language teacher. Once he arrives at his hotel the fun, intrigue and mystery begins. Ambler is an expert (and one of the first) at having his protagonist be a regular man-on-the-street character who all of a sudden (through no fault of his own) is propelled into the world of international espionage. Vadassy is put into a situation in which he has no training or real ability but is being directed by the ""police"" to help flush out a spy who has taken photographs of the French seacoast fortifications. The spy is located at the hotel where Vadassy is staying and we now take part in his attempt to try and flush out this person from among those 12 or so guests who are staying there. There is an English couple, some Americans, Swiss, and others who all get their chance to be quizzed by Vadassy as he blunders his way throughout the book. It is only because he refuses to obey his directions, and instead strikes out on his own path of inquiry that misfortune follows him through the book.This spy novel could easily have been a detective mystery in the style of Agatha Christie, etc. but instead Ambler strikes out to improve upon the seldom written (at that time) spy genre of books. He is a master at this. Some ers say it feels old - well it is, but it is that authenticity that strikes a chord with me. There are no high-tech gadgetry in here, just a great story and one mans attempt to find a spy. Everyone is a suspect, everyone has a story, a hidden story, and everyone is a suspect until the conclusion of the book. And as an extra bonus there is a short Footnote by Ambler regarding the development of the Spy Genre of writing and some of the best early books in that genre.If you do like Film Noir and spy movies, let me recommend to you the movie, The Mask of Dimitrios"" which came from Ambler's book ""A Coffin for Dimitrios.""

Very well written book, wonderful prose, and the dialogue (although a bit spare at times) is very realistic.This is a book about a town, a time and a girl. An 18 year old whose parents have died and who goes to live with her distant cousin in the town of Century, Oregon. He is so different from her dad, even to the point where the cousin (Pick) does not even remember much about the cousin who had died or the stories he told! But here she is, Esther Chambers, 18 years old and put in the middle of a town that is being split apart by the cowboys and the sheepherders. Atrocities are committed by both sides, and even though Century is a cow town there are many sheep people who live and shop their. For about half of the book I think the reader is as bit confounded as Esther, as she is experiencing everything for the first time - she is a city girl from Chicago, all this is new to her.She makes some friends among the ladies, and a few among the men, and begins weaving into the society of the town. She grows from finishing high school exams in Century to eventually working for and owning a newspaper. She overcomes her shyness and hear early thoughts and prejudices and gets to see Century and its inhabitants for whom they really are. There is no one side that is right or wrong, but the town is in a death spiral that will only reverse itself if a train track comes through, but the town cannot even put away its divisions and work together for that.The ending is quite nebulous, and that has some readers a bit upset, but I think that adds to the book i that we are now 16 years from when Esther arrived in Century and she is now in San Francisco and it allows us to fill in the years and the story as we wish or think it should end. Not a fast read, and it did sit on my shelf for almost 4 years until I picked it up, but if you enjoy a well-written novel, a novel that draws you into the lives of many varies characters, and one that will slowly grow on you as you begin to appreciate the authors style, then you will enjoy this book.

OthMy second Dickens novel this year and it paled, for me, next to both The Pickwick Papers and A Tale of Two Cities (a book I read a few years ago). Other than the famous Oliver Twist line of ""Please Sir, may I have more?"" there is little about little Oliver that really appealed to me. I found his character to be totally flat, and unbelievable. A boy who was raised in horrid surroundings and yet had this amazing heart of gold. Also a young boy who no matter what happened he also ran into constant trouble, and some of the reasons he got into trouble were just a bit too unbelievable for me.Some of the supporting characters are fine, with many critics really concentrating their rave s on the Artful Dodger, criminal mastermind Bill Sikes, and pawnbroker Fagin (referred to throughout most of the book as ""the Jew""). Also the prostitute Nancy stands out as the prostitute with a heart of gold for Oliver. But in Nancy we also see Dickens, once again, focusing in on a societal problem. Nancy is abused by Sikes and despite being given a chance to leave him and escape her poor lot in life (a situation she readily acknowledges) she cannot leave the abusing Sikes. We see that problem even today with abused women always making excuses for their injuries and constantly going back to their abuser. While this phenomena may have been documented previously, Dickens really focuses on it in my opinion. We are faced with some overly flowery language when Ruth and Mrs. Maylie talk and to be honest it would be pretty simple for an editor today to lop off about 125 pages of this book that drags unmercifully! It is a classic and considered one of Dickens 10 best and some think it is a Top 5 Dickens novel, but for me it just seemed unrealistic and stilted. Yes, he describes a lot of the poverty and the abuses of the system in the beginning third of the book, but once Oliver moves onto London we now have the criminal element involved and leave most of the social system problems behind. We also do get a p of what is now known as ""the Stockholm Syndrome"" as Fagin knows that by keeping Oliver captive he can try and change his character and ""teach him"" all the education he needs to be a valuable youthful thief. So while there are certainly redeeming social issues that are brought forth in the book, the overall book just leaves me cold. It also made me wish that when Oliver asked for move gruel that kitchen warden would have just given it to him and spared us the rest of the story!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 12, 2016","Oct 28, 2016","Oct 12, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/693015.Oliver_Twist

The title hooked me and I was impressed by all the research done by the author, but the story is really one that I think I heard before as a child when I watched the Wonderful World of Disney and they did a story on the Lippizaner stallions. Have been fortunate to have seen them perform twice and they are remarkable.The book began with a lot of promise as the author introduced us to many of the ""Europeans"" who are main characters in the book. Gustav Rau was fascinating as he was a firm believer in Eugenics and it came out that horses were the example that Hitler used for his attempts to breed a master race humans. But then things go a bit sideways, as the only really big plan for breeding this race of of horses was by breeding them at younger ages and with close relatives. We never really see if those efforts paid off at all or the results of those testings.The title claims the horses were kidnapped by the Nazi's - not sure if that is really true. It was war, the horse were in the occupied area and the Nazi's used them. Hmmm, kidnapped?? I don't think so.That premise fails when the US eventually makes a made dash across the Czech border (contrary to the terms of the Yalta agreement with Russia) and captures the horses and takes them back to their side of the river, into territory the US was permitted to control. When there was an investigation into this the US declared the horses were ""spoils of war"" which is exactly what the horses were when they were removed from their home stables in Austria and Poland and taken by the Nazi's.The part of the book that dealt with the actual negotiations and one US officer crossing into Czech territory and actually being captured by the Nazi's was an interesting and fast paced part of the book, but once again we moved from a trot back to a cantor and eventually a really slow walk around the shed.I wanted to like this book, but the more I read it the more I felt the author added about 50 pages more than was necessary to tell the story. Her shorter chapters are pretty good but her longer chapters dragged on forever for me.She did make the point that the US had fully mechanized the calvary by WW2, whereas most all the European countries still relied on horses to move man and equipment, which was the reason they really needed the horses in the first place. She gave us some very good historical facts about the use of horses in the military and the amounts of horses needed to keep the Russian and German war machine moving and that really was some of the best writing in the book.I love horses, love the Lippizaner's, and enjoyed some of the personal stories in this book, but I guess I am spoiled by a book like ""Seabiscuit"" which is so well written and which keeps the reader enthralled from beginning to end that this book and the writing just pales in comparison.An interesting topic but a book without near as much suspense and drama as the title wants to indicate. It reminds me of those Daily Racing Form charts where a horse has won all these races at a lower level and then makes the step up to an Allowance Race. The competition is greater, and despite the big buildup most times those horses fail to perform as advertised! Whereas ""Seabiscuit"" is a solid $10 Win wager, ""The Perfect Horse"" is a jittery $2 wager to Show!...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Oct 11, 2016","Oct 18, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28007894-the-perfect-horse

A short novella, only 208 pages long and also small in physical size (the hardback copy is barely bigger than a large paperback novel), this little book packs quite the punch.We are transported to 1870 Texas and follow Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd as he reads his way through Texas, as well as makes a trek of well over 400 miles to return a 10-year old girl to her relatives - the young girl had been captured and kidnapped by Kiawa Indians when she was 6 and has forgotten all of her former life and has become a true Kiawa. Captain Kidd, who is called Kep-Dun by the young girl Johanna, is 70 and has been traveling through Texas for years. He had been a printer and now goes from town to town - including the new village of Dallas! - reading from US and Foreign Newspapers at local venues and charging a small fee for his readings. He brings the news to those who cannot read or who have no access to papers or who have no access to anything but local papers. It is not the most glamorous life but it is what he does to survive in post-Civil War Texas. It is at one of these readings that he is met by a gentleman who has been entrusted to return the girl to her relatives outside of San Antonio, and who cannot fulfill that task and therefore asks Kidd to take over the job. He reluctantly accepts, but in doing so he enters one of the most fulfilling chapters of his life.Kidd and Johanna form a bond, as Kidd is better than one might surmise at handling small girls because he himself had two daughters, and so the two set off from Wichita Falls on this epic journey through rough and tumble, as well as lawless Texas. Along the way we follow Kidd to some of his ""readings"" of the News of the World, as well as his efforts to ""recivilize"" Johanna by softly speaking to her, reintroducing English words to her and developing a bond that is stronger than most parent/child bonds.It is a story that quickly gets into its plot and journey and, just as quickly, grabs your attention. The chapters are short - most no more than 10 pages, and the author quickly covers details of the journey, from Highwaymen, to Indians, to Child Prostitute hunters, etc. all the way to Johanna's ""reunion"" with her formal and strict German Aunt and Uncle. Along the way, she is reintroduced to wearing dresses, bathing, and also a gun battle where she fights alongside Kidd and where her ingenuity saves the day.It is a very good book and I give this a 4.5****. Not quite a 5 * effort because the ending appears rushed and I felt that the duo was being led into perilous situations that just seemed to slip away a little to easily. But you really establish a bond with these two people and see how Kidd uses the wisdom of his 70 years to diffuse most of the dangerous situations, and how this grandfatherly figure eventually wins the heart and affection of Johanna.A definite recommendation, and one that any reader will remember for years to come. So come to 1870 Texas for one of the best heartwarming stories by an author who is really growing in her writing.

A very good effort on a very important and also complicated topic - Washington and Benedict Arnold. The My first book written by Nathaniel Philbrick. A very good effort on a very important and also complicated topic - Washington and Benedict Arnold. The book takes us through most of the Revolutionary War and focuses on a lot of Battles or skirmishes that I never was even aware of! The battles are supplemented by many maps of the battlefields and fortifications and there are a lot of sketches and drawings in the photo section of the book that allows the reader to put faces to the names.We see Washington as a charismatic leader, who struggles to overcome his military desire to fight head on battles with the British - and we see that at the beginning of the war he loses most every one of those encounters. He develops of strategy of a Defensive War, a war in which the sheer size and topography of the US will allow him to overcome the vastly superior British forces, and as long as he sticks with that, combined with some lightning attacks and Battles against the British he does well. On the other hand we have Arnold who is not a great military planner, but who also has the ability to grasp situations on the battlefield and who shows no fear of life or limb and is the opposite of Washington in that Defensive wars are not in his makeup and he prefers to go head on and wins so many of these battles. But despite his victories he is a seriously flawed character, a man who feels he is always overlooked and who is owed more by his country that they give him. Even his lack of a promotion to a Major General is a sore spot for him, and when he gets that promotion he is not happy since he is not given seniority over other Major Generals appointed before him.Arnold loves money, power and women and they are his downfall. He is constantly persecuted - many times without justification and his anger is always simmering beneath the surface. He is a favorite of Washington, who knows how good he is on the battlefield, but who also sees that Arnold is his own worst enemy.This is a very good effort and one that everyone should read as it is filled with many insights into our founding fathers, the British adversaries and the sheer luck that America had in the Revolutionary War. I came away amazed at how many battles, or events unfolded just by happenstance and how the course of history turned on such things. I also enjoyed the analysis of the author that Arnold's treason actually helped solidify our resolve to win the war and made people aware of the need to be united as a country to win and now continue down the road as 13 independent states, everyone doing as they wanted. At one point the one state militia's enlistment ended the night before a major battle and the head of that states militia and his men just left at the stroke of midnight. Chaos and confusion reigned in the early days of the Revolution and it was not until all these battles and events played themselves out that the country eventually became a truly United States of America....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 30, 2016","Oct 07, 2016","Sep 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26109390-valiant-ambition

After listening to Nancy Pearl rave about this book on her podcast I decided to give this book a try. There is no doubt that Peter Temple is a good writer, but this book was hard for me to follow with few people having full names, action jumping all over the place and a plot that for some reason was very easy for me to figure out. While this is a very good book I cannot for the life of me figure out why Pearl slobbers over this. It was a slog for the first third of the book and then things finally began to move along at a quick clip which I must admit helped raise the books rating. So much is left unsaid in this book, character development is nil and while it is good to read a detective story from a different country and different point of view, it is not something that makes me want to read more Peter Temple in the future.Now a word about Aborigines. Australia has a racial problem, and the aborigines are not exactly loved over there and that comes out big time in this book. But what I find particularly interesting is some very ""sophisticated and sensitive"" readers and ers have expressed shock and almost disdain for books like Huckleberry Finn and the Little House series by Laura Ingles Wilder due to their depiction of blacks and Native American Indians, those same people seem not to care one iota about the way the aborigines are depicted and spoken of in this book. Lots of derogatory language and references to them in this book and those same ""sophisticated and sensitive"" people shrug it off. Apparently it is OK to do this with books about foreign lands and to be self-righteous about these US books. I say hogwash! Listen, and I am not going off on a rant here, books are windows into ourselves and our history and just because something might not be politically correct today, does not mean that it has to be trashed and spoken of with disdain. If you are one of those ""sophisticated and sensitive"" readers than this book might make you squirm, but The Broken Shore does depict the racial rift in Australia and for that I must really give the author kudos. We do not see or hear about this that much over here in the US and this book helps give me a look into the issue. Language on the whole can be ""detective"" crude in this book and some of that crudeness seems a bit overdone. The ending of the book is good but not great and while Peter Temple may be a good writer (by the way there are no chapter divisions in this book), I doubt that I will seek out his other works.

I wanted to like the book that is sort of classified as a comedy but at the same time there are vast parts of this book that deal with the horror of war that, while realistic, really gave me a different impression on the book.The basic premise is that the town of Santa Vittoria is a great wine growing and producing area, and is the wine used to make vermouth.

The town, after the fall of the Fascist government, elected a new mayor who is charitably described as a Sicilian clown, except he is a much deeper thinker than they realize and he does things to help the town including hiding the wine. This is a book about occupation and resistance, about the Italians appearing dumber than the Germans and yet have outwitted them the entire time. Seen as that there is definitely amusement in the book.However, the scenes of torture by the SS, sacrificial citizens unwittingly being led to torture, a village hostage who is left tied up in the village square before being killed, the substitution of another citizen for sacrificial death, etc. all is a lot more than I expected and to me the book drags through these parts, as the citizens are forced to do all of this to protect their One Million bottles of wine. Not that realistic that wine is more important that people and dignity, and dignity is what is lacking in this book as the Italians are made to look like fools and in the end the German occupiers are made to suffer the same fate.Also, cannot stand the character Tufa who plays an important part in the book and certain storylines appear not to have been successfully tied up by the end of the book.A fast read, and at times a fun read, but not one I would really recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 19, 2016","Sep 25, 2016","Sep 19, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19290129-the-secret-of-santa-vittoria

This 3rd book in the series is quite a bit different than the first two, one of the big differences being the lack of dialogue in the book when compared to the first two. In this book we learn more about Philosophies of life, Botswana traditions and backgrounds and issues with the main characters. The cases are a lot less challenging, in my opinion, and we are really given an in depth look at Mma. Makutsi who began as a minor character and now has become quite the major character in the series as she has gone from a secretary to an Assistant Detective to now a new position as Assistant Garage Manager. She handles a big case with a big fee all by herself and it is fun to see her character develop. Mma. Ramotswe is involved in her own case out of the area, as well as being preoccupied with the two orphans who came into their lives in Book 2, and an illness that has befallen her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni,and this propels Mma. Makusti into the forefront. She gains the respect of the garage apprentices and proves herself a valuable asset to both businesses.it is another fun book, but not quite as rollicking as the first two. I would definitely not start the series with this book, since it is a definite build on the first two and character development propels the saga forward. It is fun to read, it is delightful to follow and since I am reading them consecutively it really is great to be able to quickly follow all the action of the series. This book is only 227 pages in length and is a fast read, and I just began book 4 and that one is only 192 pages, so these are great books to either get from the library or by use of the free e-reader delivery system from the library.

The first thing that hit mWhat a fine book and what an expose of crime in LA, black on black murder and how America seems to dismiss this phenomenon. The first thing that hit me was a quote from a detective who commented that one Saturday the LA Times ran a banner front page headline on how a rocket attack in Beirut killed 6 people. He went on to sat that same weekend there were 9 homocides of black youths in LA and not one mention of this was made in the LA papers, TV or radio. One understands what that community feels they are undervalued in the system.The book is basically about the homocide of Bryant Tennelle who was walking home one day and was shot in the head and killed. Making it more newsworthy was the fact that Bryant's father was a Homocide Detective and that the family lived in the less than desirable area of LA and had been a beacon of stability and help for that community. We first are introduced to the players - from the victim, his family, the lead detective and others who were involved in the investigation. The 2nd part of the book deals with investigative work and the trial. Despite being a retired attorney I found this part a bit tedious, and the author kept moving from one murder investigation to another - there are so many murders in the ""South of the 10"" region that the detectives work multiple murders at one time and I assume the purpose of all of these details is to let us see what really goes on, but to me it sort of took away from the book. Bryant Tennelle's case sort of became secondary to the story she was telling - despite the fact that is really is a fascinating story. We see what happens in Gangs, with witnesses, with the community and how hard it is to get anyone to talk about the crime for fear of reprisals and then when they get to a hearing or trial they recant their testimony and have to have it impeached. This is an eye-opening book in so many different ways but you are glad that there are so many hard working detectives trying to solve these murders, even though there is a group identified as the 40-percenters who have a much lower success rate.However, I feel that the books premise falls apart as the author tried to put a sociological spin on the black crime statistics in LA. She goes back to slavery, Jim Crow laws, double standards of enforcement in the past and in other cities, and the issue of economic stagnation in the black community. I agree with her points of economic stagnation, but are any of the reasons she gives sufficient for people to randomly kill other people? This is what I have trouble believing. We also see the stories that many of the gang members may have been the youngest children in their families or have some sort of ADD or ADHD disorder. In my mind there has to be a lot of change in the thinking of life and the destruction of murder. It is a major problem in not just LA but throughout inner cities, and while official police policies many times deal with prevention - black crime will not stop until there are major changes in attitudes.And to close with an even more frightening statistic - from the day the Bryant Tennelle was murdered until the day of the trial 2 years later, over 546 more black men were killed in LA. Something has to change and I thank the author for bringing this issue to our attention....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 30, 2016","Sep 10, 2016","Aug 30, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24399756-ghettoside

When I began this year with my personal reading goals in place I had no idea that one of my stops would be Botswana with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency! I had heard of this series and had thought that at some time I might give it a try and then, once again, thanks to all of you on Goodreads I kept seeing people reading this book and so I thought I should give it a try and so I logged onto my libraries webpage, searched, pointed and clicked and here it came to me in Romania! A very fast moving book filled with some fun characters, led by MMa. Ramotswe who decided to take her inheritance and open a detective agency. She is large, smart woman and here in Volume 1 we are introduced to her, Botswana, southern Africa and some of the friends and clients that I am sure will inhabit future books in this series. Is this a real brain teaser sort of mystery series - Not really. Is MMa. Ramotswe a very good detective? No overly. She gets results but these are early career cases and I am sure she will grow in future adventures. She is intuitive and has an uncanny way of solving mysteries and yet there are times you know that she is a novice and some of the case resolutions fall into her lap and others I am not sure that she really solves, but in the end her style of sleuthing works perfectly for where she is. This book is a super-fast read and is filled with about 10 or so cases that she ""solves"" one of which begins early in the book and we have to wait until near the end to find a resolution, but that is realistic because not all detectives work on one single case to the exclusion of others. I am currently in the midst of some long books set in England and this was a great way to break up that reading - since it is such a fast read one can quickly get back to other books - if I could make one suggestion to my fellow readers it would be to either get this book at the library or through your libraries free e-delivery system. The book is enjoyable but I would not go out and purchase it either in paperback or on my e-reader, it is just not that spectacular a book that it is worth you hard earned $$, but it certainly a book that is a fun read and will fill you with pleasure, and the desire to start Volume 2 in the near future!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 17, 2016","Aug 21, 2016","Aug 17, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6209790-the-no-1-ladies-detective-agency

Nothing is really known about his early life and for allegedly being a millionaire he died with huge debts and only $15,000. He seemed more of a con artist or ""trickster"" as the book calls him near the end. He never really worked but was an idea man.

For years I shied away from Dickens and his novels. But a few years ago I began I loved this book and am now proud to proclaim myself a Pickwickian!! For years I shied away from Dickens and his novels. But a few years ago I began with A Tale of Two Cities and loved it, despite its overuse of commas and semi-colons! So I decided to give Dickens a try and bought the first five of his novels in paperback form and his entire collection on Kindle. For a year the books just sat on the shelf and stared at me, as did books by Victor Hugo and Dumas. I kept saying I was going to start reading Dickens and finally the time came. The Pickwick Papers became my summer reading, as it is a easy book to put down and read others in between, but as time wore on Pickwick's adventures claimed more of my time until about 4 days ago I decided the time had come to finish it before Autumn began and I have accomplished that!!This is Dickens first novel and you can really see the serialized nature of the book as 2-3 chapters were published in his monthly paper. It is a humorous book with many passages causing me to laugh out loud. His characters are great and they are an oddball variety of people who either go with or whom he meets on his two-year trek to discover England. Pickwick had been a rather unwordly person, and who sees the world though almost child-like eyes. Good-hearted and always ready to see the best in everyone, this book is a collection of events during his travels. It is early Dickens but you can already see the keen eye he casts upon so many aspects of British life and society. You can see his disdain for lawyers, his shocking descriptions of debtors prison, his portrayal of doctors all in this book. Yet, wherever he goes he finds an adventure. Probably the weakest parts of the book, for me, is when he throws in totally unrelated tales that he hears of things that have absolutely nothing to do with the book. Some are good but many are just so-so and I could have done without. My favorite of these stories was of the Goblins that stole a Sexton and was related on Christmas Eve. Good story. There are loads of fun and funny characters, there are many scenes that make you just want to laugh out loud until the very last page where we are left with an elderly Pickwick now living in London. It was with a tear that I finished this book, as I felt I had made friends with Mr. Pickwick and his fellow travelers and companions. But it also put me in a mood to read more Dickens, including A Christmas Carol which I have yet to read in my 63 years here on earth. And so I come to the end of this  and give a hale and hearty cheer to my good friend Samuel Pickwick, I will never forget you or your adventures and you have kindled in my heart and spirit a feeling of goodness and revelry that has been missing for the past few years. Farewell Pickwick, we part as friends and say goodbye all the while knowing that you have added one more loyal and dedicated member to The Pickwick Society.

Having read a few of Dallas's books this one just did little for me. Oh, my wife enjoyed the way the mystery of who killed Lillie Brown was resolved, but to be honest both of us figured it out quite early in the book.Worse yet, I really found few quality characters in this book. I guess Mick the detective was a good character although there is so much left unknown about his surprising background, and the 2nd maid Nellie seems like a sweet enough soul, but that is it. Even her protagonist - Beret (an unusual name for a girl and one we never know why she is called that despite a few hints that the reasoning will be forthcoming) - is a very unlikeable character who does so many stupid things in her attempt to help Mick solve Lillie's death. Worse yet, as she does each and every stupid thing we know it and so does she, as the book is filled with her actions and then her realization that she put herself in a bad situation with no way out. But she always does get out of it, most times in rather far-fetched ways.We learn a lot about prostitutes in Denver and that the author makes a valiant to use French words and unknown language at time to describe things in the beginning of the book. When someone finally calls Lillie a whore that sort of stops the beating around the bush.She ties things up too neatly and to be quite honest there really is no logical reason why two more prostitutes need to die, and the entire Hop Alley cocaine situation just leaves me cold.I have ready about 3 or 4 of her books and this one just falls flat for me.

The Hamilton family was by far the more interesting group for me, although he sets up the conflict in the Trask family. Also there is so little interaction between the two families other than Sam giving advice to Adam now and then, as well as a short business deal with Will Hamilton and Cal.

It is possible that if I read this at another time I might have been more favorably disposed to the book, but after having read ""City of Thieves"" about the siege of Stalingrad all the pretend conflict in this book just fell flat. But, for me, it is the dual story lines that drift back and forth in the book and the fact that silly and made up names just kept me more confused than ever. It is a gender neutral book but most all characters are somehow or another all female (I really do not care if a book has all female characters), and it got to the point that it just confused me and I just could not keep everything straight. I will tell you that there was one small page in the book that really hit home. It was when the characters were describing luxury, and how one persons luxury is the result of another persons hard work. The author made a similar point when discussing homes and also how one who is basically raised in the lap of luxury expects that to happen and is entitled to that.

Again, a big shoutout to Jenny and Reading Envy podcast where I first heard about this book. Secondly, thank goodness that this book was available through the Greenville, SC library through their e-book system. And thirdly, thanks so very much to the internet. Why the internet? Well, it never ceases to amaze me that with a simple point and click things can be delivered to my electronic devices. We take that for granted, but not me. Why not? Well, for the past two weeks I have been in Romania and when I pointed and clicked the book was downloaded to my Kindle reader in Bucharest - utterly amazing!!!!Now the book. A truly fine effort by David Benioff and one in which we are placed right smack in the middle of the siege of Leningrad. This is a story of friendship, survival, love and one of the most amazing tasks that anyone has ever been assigned to handle. The story begins well into the siege and the city (referred to by its citizens as Piter) has run out of all foodstuffs. There is rationing, but what is rationed is pitiful to say the least. Bombing occurs nightly and in the middle of this we are introduced to Lev (a 17-year old who is now on his own in the city) and Koyla (a 20-year old Russian Army soldier). Both of these individuals are thrown together by circumstances and eventually are brought before the commander of the forces of Leningrad. Both fear that their past actions have condemned them to death, but instead of death they are give a task. Find one dozen eggs and deliver them in time for the Commanders daughters wedding, since they are needed for the wedding cake. And thus begins a paring and eventual friendship that takes these two outside of the city limits and through a no-mans land that is filled with misery and sorrow, along with images that haunt both of them as well as us the reader. Eventually the two meet up with a band of resistance fighters and their exploits carry them behind German lines in their quest for the eggs. This short book packs a punch and it is a fast read because I just could not put it down for the last 150 pages! We are left with great characters such as Kolya and Lev, along with Vika a female resistance fighter and ace sniper. The book ends a few years after the war and the author neatly ties up all the threads of the plots in the last two short chapters of the book and does so in such a way that it does not feel contrived or a mere exercise in ending the story. And as an added bonus, the book has a last line that (to me) is one of the best I have read!I also was able to keep my wife interested in the plot and story, as she kept asking what was happening and when I finished reading the book and then telling her how the last 50 pages ended she looked at me and said, ""What a great book"" and her words are those that I began this  with. Thanks to all for this great read, and while many women may not like war novels, this is certainly one that I can recommend to one and all, male or female. It is a great read, in my opinion, and one that can and should be read by everyone....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jul 10, 2016","Jul 17, 2016","Jul 10, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/8121694-city-of-thieves

As a man, I tend to shy away from the genre in which she has become very famous. But I have to once again give a great deal of thanks to my new Goodreads friends for recommending this book. I absolutely enjoyed it and I learned so much about a 60-day period in US history that I had never heard of in the past. The book revolves around the city of Elizabeth, NJ which is right next to the Newark Airport, and back in 1957-58 there were a series of 3 different airplane crashes that occurred there, all of which caused death and destruction, all of which made a profound influence on the lives of the many people who lived there. Judy Blume lived in Elizabeth, NJ and as a small child she grew up knowing about these incidents and used that personal background to give us a very insightful look into the crashes and families involved or peripherally involved with these crashes. A very well written book, one that uses well over 20 characters and 4 families to tell the story. At first it is a bit confusing to keep everyone and every relationship straight, but you eventually settle in and there are a few main characters, a few semi-main characters and a lot of background stories.The people involved have witnessed the crash, or have had a loved one die in the crash, one character even was a hero in saving people from a burning wreckage of the 3rd crash, and is based on the true details of those who first responded to the 3rd crash. Families and individuals are torn apart, character traits and flaws get exposed, other families break down while other relationships flourish. The center of all of this are two girls, Miri and Natalie who are/were best friends and much of the book is about them and their families. Extremely well done, the book also creates Miri's Uncle Henry who is a reporter for the fictitious Elizabeth Daily Post and between most every chapter there is a story about the crash, about news of the crash, interviews with families, as well as some ""columns"" about what is going on in the world at that time.What it is not, is a damning indictment of the airline industry or the CAB (the predecessor of the NTSB). Plane travel in 1958 was still new, technology was still not perfect and there was a lot of room for mechanical failure and pilot error, as well as what appears to be one instance of pilot ""error"" that was done to save lives on the ground. I only gave this 4**** because some of the personal events seem a bit contrived, and what happened to Natalie seems even more unbelievable to me (but then again I am not an expert in how people respond to traumas and tragedies). What it is, however, is a really great read. It is a book you can easily read quickly or put it down for a bit because chapters are divided into segments of stories based on a certain characters. It might not be typical Judy Blume, but that is OK with me and I will be looking forward to see if she reverts to her prior style of book or if she takes off into this new style of writing. I hope she does, because this is a very fine book!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 08, 2016","Jul 13, 2016","Jul 08, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24357287-in-the-unlikely-event

At the end of the book, the author then has about 4 pages of what is real and what is fiction and the reader will be amazed at both how well researched this book is, as well as how much of the plot is based on some pretty interesting public and published information.

Now this is the first of about 13 books in that series and so I will give it one more chance, since maybe this was an early career clunker. The characters are extremely stale and rather undeveloped and very flat. The plot revolves around the Bible and trying to find clues to some earlier Christian documents by the Kings Templar who are now holed up in current day Southern France. From the beginning it was obvious what the eventual outcome would be and the major discovery of a new book to supplement and explain the inconsistencies in the New Testament. Characters are thrown into contact from page one and to me this book is more of the author trying to impress us with his encyclopedic knowledge of the Templers and church history. What bothers me the most is how a 700-year secret is now so easily unearthed and how this group of people can suddenly become the smartest people in the room! I have recently begun to reanalyze my ratings and so mysteries are rated based on other mysteries, literary fiction against other literary fiction. So for this book I rate as a 3*** when compared to other books in that genre. But for me it was no more than a 1 1/2* on an overall rating scale.

This is the first of I think 12 books in his Inspector Colbeck mysteries, and takes us back to 1851 London and the advent of the railroad trains and the first train robbery that has occurred in England. It is a wonderful tale, and it filled with characters that seem right out of the Murdoch Mysteries series I watch on Acorn TV and which now begin their 10th season up in Canada. You have the rough and irascible Superintendent, the sidekick Sergeant and the debonair and intelligent Inspector Colbeck. Colbeck needs to figure out why the train was robbed, how the thieves managed to stage the robbery, who were the accomplices and then throw in a few murders along the way and you have all you need for a rip snortingly good read. I love Marston and he may be the best of the unknown mystery authors. Give him a try.

A novel based upon the actual diaries of Frances Frank (her changed name). It is supposed to be a story of her friendship with Rosalie Mendel. The book is a quick read, but not a fast read if that makes sense! It starts so very promisingly with the story beginning at an old age home and Rosalie being honored for the work she did in WW2. Frances is her best friend and also in the old age home and laments that she cannot tell her story and nobody knows wha she did. So she tells us the readers. The book is divided into 5 sections and really sections 1,2 and 5 are fast and fascinating reading. Half of Section 4 is very good also. It is Section 3 that brings this book down in my opinion. This is all the ""unknown"" story of the time Frances and her husband Ainslee were on the Galapagos Islands prior to WW2, and it is all speculation. The book drags here, so much so that one is tempted to just skip over the flora and fauna descriptions, as well as the attempts to make this a spy novel. I learned a lot about the Galapagos that I had been unaware of, but the entire spy premise is a bit hard to fathom, however plausible it might be. What we do see is a woman (Frances) who has lived an interesting life - not sure it was a good life, but it was interesting. We also see someone who gave up many years of her life to part of a rather unique marriage, move to Galapagos and then move back their again after the war. She was basically a loner and her friend Rosalie is not the most lovable character, but that is also tempered by parts of Rosalie's childhood.I would recommend this book for a limited group of readers. It is not for everyone, but there are some portions of the book that are highly enjoyable and give us a glimpse into the life of Frances which was certainly unusual and without a doubt interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 08, 2016","Jun 15, 2016","Jun 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26192488-enchanted-islands

A book that actually begins with an Afterwards, and then weaves a tale that goes back and forth through Antarctica, as well as the lives of the narrator Deb and a man she meets there, named Keller. It is a love story and an ecological story, as well as a an adventure story about a cruise ship that ventures into the realm of Antartica. I am not really a big ecology-oriented person, but this story really hit me as a wakeup call for all of those people who feel the need to be on all 7 Continents in the world and the problems that are created by the new massive influx of tourists who come to Antarctic without the least thought as to how they are affecting the seas, the penguins, and the fish in the seas. We begin with an Afterwards and then go back to a period a few years before the Cruise ship issue that is the main antagonist of the book. From there we swing back later into the narrators life and then back to a more recent period of time. It takes a really good writer to pull this off, and sometimes I have problems with this back and forth time period style, but Midge Raymond pulls it off beautifully.We meet the narrator, crew of the research boat she is on, passengers on that boat, her current lover and past lovers, we see her fractured family and her love of birds that led to her love of penguins. All of this is woven into a tight and compact 308 pages and is a fast, fast read, especially the two longer chapters that deal with the cruise ship disaster. As an avid cruiser, I board those boats and never think about the ecological impact they have on the seas. We hear how they are doing better and better while we are on the cruises, the but she sheer amounts of cruise ships that now ply todays oceans and seas makes me wonder about the impact they make. Again, not an eco-horror tale, but rather a love story that is squarely rooted in the narrators love of Antarctica and the penguins she goes down there to research every year, we follow a dedicated narrator who is brought to life expertly by the author.

This summer my daughter had a college class with Jenny who has the Reading Envy blog and after my daughter raved about her in class I became a Goodreads friend of hers, which begat other friends and thanks to those friendships I saw a lot of interest in this book, Green Island. I was the first person to get it from our library and was captivated from page one. The writing is beautiful. It is not a fast read. No, no. But it is a book you want to slowly devour as the author mixes a family history along with the modern history (since the 1940's) of the island we now call Taiwan.Written from the perspective of the families youngest daughter it begins the night of her birth which also was a night of a massacre on the island, and ends almost 60 years later. By the way the narrator is never named in the book which to me is unique. We follow her family, and her marriage. We go from Taiwan to Berkley and then back to Taiwan. We see Formosa become Taiwan, we see Taiwan go from a Japanese possession to a Chinese possession and then an outpost for Chiang-Kai Shek who became a key ally of the US. And then Nixon goes to China and no longer is Taiwan favored, and it is now the Republic of China, as opposed to mainland China being the People's Republic of China. You see the turmoil of the island and the people through the eyes of this family, as well as the protests of the dictatorship that Chiang created. There is a lot of great history here and I learned so much from this book, and we see how the family suffers and endures over the years.One of the very few books listed as a Best Book of the Year that actually lives up to its reputation....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 12, 2016","Jun 29, 2016","Jun 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25763894-green-island

They were enthusiastic over the book and even though it was alleged to be a ""woman's book"" I decided that their recommendation transcended any genre categorization.Reviews have been all over the place on this book with many not liking it because it was ""not like her other books."" Two things. First, I have never read any of her ""other books"" and therefore had no predisposed feelings about the authors style. Secondly, who really cares if it is not like her other books! I heard the same complaint about Edward Rutherfurd's book ""Paris"" since he did not follow the neat and order historical fiction approach he had used in the past. Get over it folks!!! Authors get bored at being stereotyped as producing one type of book or writing in one type of style. This book was personal for me because the story of Millers Valley is much like my hometown in Reading, PA where in order to have water management and create water fun for everyone, the Federal government bought up thousands of acres of land in the 1970's and created the Blue Marsh recreation area. Water fun with no flooding - of course since Hurricane Agnes hit our area back in 1972 there has not been anything near that type of storm - but we are now blessed with Blue Marsh so that folks from everywhere can come and play on our lake.The author maintains that Blue Marsh was not her inspiration, but we are located about 85-90 miles from Philly - as was Millers Valley - and she manages to use a lot of names and items that are remarkably similar to our area. She refers to a person named Fenstermach - Gee, I grew up with a bunch of Fenstermachers! She had the narrator as a little girl selling corn from her dads farm from a card table - which is exactly like my HS friend Donna Reed did for many a year. The parallels can go on and on, but it would bore those of you not familiar with our area. This is a book about a young girl and her family, a family that lives in a low lying region that the government wants to flood for water management and recreation. It is a story of the family and the region. Yes there are some stereotypical characters - from the Viet Vet druggie brother to the whiz kid narrator who is a complete 180 degree difference from him. But the book reveals family mysteries, family problems and family triumphs all of which are set in and around Millers Valley. It is a short and quick read which is perfect for the topic and leaves us with a 65 year old narrator - Mimi - who has lived a wonderful life and has returned to her hometown area. She recounts the past but does not live in the past (I hope that makes sense). She shows us that we can have our memories and our family secrets, triumphs and tragedies and yet we carve out our own existence is this world no matter who our parents are, no matter what our family history may be, and no matter what happens to our home town....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 03, 2016","Jun 10, 2016","Jun 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26131641-miller-s-valley

Well, it was not a bad read, and I am bored with those who think that only Le Carre can write an espionage thriller about the Cold War. But I felt completely in a fog at the beginning of the book because it referred to action and plot that appears to be a hold over from the first novel of this series. After a few chapters I got a chance to get into the book and there were parts of this that were extremely well written in terms of plot and characters. Not being an expert in Espionage or Espionage Thrillers I am unsure as to a lot of the details in the book, but it appears to be well researched, however some of the double-dealing seems a bit much especially when we get into Scams and old characters from 1947 (this book is set in the 1960's). The ending seemed contrived and hard to believe, from the hotel scene in East Germany, to the escape into the British Sector of West Germany, to the delivery of a special package at the end of the book.Also hard to digest is our protagonists relationship with his wife, who is the daughter of his superior and how he always keeps getting put into situations that just seem hard to believe.This book is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of Espionage thriller books then give it a read.

I gave the librarian the two books and headed back outside, and all of a sudden I am confronted by a display of books and smack dab on the middle was Deeds of Darkness. From a distance I thought it might have been a non-fiction book, but as I glanced a bit longer I realized this was a fiction book about home front detectives during WW1. So, I stopped and took a gander at the full cover and inside flap and discovered that this was the 4th book in a series by a writer I had never heard of previously. But the topic sounded interesting and despite my aversion to starting detective novels in mid-series instead of from book 1, I decided to give it a try. Well, little did I know how prolific a writer Edward Marston has been, nor how entertaining this book would become for me. A fast reading, page-turner that deals with a serial killer on the loose in London at the same time as the Battle of the Somme rages on France. This is a book filled with loads of excitement and suspense and does not have graphic and gratuitous violence. It centers on Scotland Yard detectives, and also includes a very interesting anti-war character, along with a top notch plot in which we only find out the identity of the killer a few pages from the end of the book. Very good characters and if you are fan of Murdoch Mysteries up in Canada there are some really similar characters in this book. You can tell that there will be more books to come in this series as there are some domestic issues that have not yet book finished with regards to the detectives, and that a sub-plot with a neighbor and her son are never finished in this book. So, the author has left a lot of the table or the next book of the series.

This is not that bad, but I am wondering if I got a copy of a different book from everyone else who has been raving about this?? It was pretty, pretty bad to put it mildly. First of all the book summaries begins by telling us a bit about the glass and mirror trade in Venice and secrets and mysteries that are happening there in the late 1500's. Then it says there are two other parallel stories that are set in the Venice Beach and at the Venetian hotel. Venice Beach in the 1950's and the Venetian in 2003. So, what do you assume the book begins with - THE VENICE OF 1500's?? Nope - we start at the Venetian then switch to Venice Beach and finally by page 165 we make it to Venice, Italy. By that time I am exhausted from a book that wanders aimlessly, with characters that have absolutely no depth and which I could care less about each and every page.The book becomes work and a book is supposed to be pleasurable. I got to the point where I did not care about the stories, the characters, mirrors or anything else in this book. Some say it is a great mystery and keeps you up all night in a page-turning frenzy.

It is like Heart of Darkness meets the whaling industry. Henry Drax may be the most realistically evil character I have ever met. So much to write about this short bombshell of a book. Let me begin by saying that if you are not a person who enjoys reading about some foul human depravities then this book may not be for you. While violence and sex (sodomy) are not graphic, they are ever present and yet for some reason this book kept pulling me into its story as I wanted to keep reading to find out what was finally going to happen to this whaling boat and its crew.

There are few redeeming characters in the books, maybe a few few Esquimaux characters who are described as heathen but are the most humane in the entire book!

This book continues to follow the exploits of a most different type of main character than we are used to in Jefferson Tatye, man who solves family genealogical mysteries. This book is different then the first one, in that the author fills in a lot of the missing pieces by going back and forth in time, from a current day search for clues as to a womans true identity, to back in 1944 in which we relive a lot of the incidents that occurred through the eyes of Philomena Lasseter. As seems to be the M.O. in all of these books, the family mystery always takes Tayte into harms way and this time it is not different as we begin the book with Tayte seemingly ready to be shot and then go back and find out how he got himself into this predicament. Was surprised at the ending of the book, in that you had a bit of an idea who was behind things, but iti is not until the last few chapters that we find out the motivation for keeping things secret. It is a story of a woman who was adopted and lives in the US and who out of the blue receives a package containing a red suitcase and she hires Tayte to find out who she really is and who her mother is. A bit convoluted in family history, but then again whose family does not contain a bit of convoluted history or at least some strange family members!!If you have never read any of this series they are so very different from the usual detective novels, and while we never really get that close to uncovering a lot about Jefferson Tayte the person, his cases and escapades are always entertaining and quick fun reads.

Also that the author has British wit down pat.Now the bad news. This is really a dreadful effort. I know it is based on the authors grandparents but I have not seen a book with so many flawed characters and self-centered individuals that one really cares less and less about as the book goes on and on. British humor is dragged out again and again, as all the individuals resort to comebacks and witticisms that lose their effect as they too drag on and on in the book. We have people who fall love at first sight and then do not see each other for years, but the one character is sure that they are in love, so much so that her mother even is also under the assumption that despite only one brief meeting her daughter is going to marry this person. Just beyond the realm of feasibility. Mary is so self-centered and selfish that she constantly wants and takes anything her ""best friend"" Hilda wants in terms of men and attention. To be honest I am shocked at the number of high ratings for this book as it truly pales in comparison to other fiction books about WW2 and the rash of new WW1 fiction novels.I wonder if the subplot about Mary's helping the black children left behind in London is there to try and redeem her character, but it is obvious by the end that even the black adults do not want her help teaching the children for obvious social reasons.

The story of a widower who after one year decided to finally discard his wife's clothing. As he was in the process of doing that he uncovered a charm bracelet that belonged to her and which he had never seen. This is a story about his adventures to discover the meaning of the charms and the secret wife of his wife before she met and married him. Along the way he discovers that his wife was a very different person than she had been the 40 years they were married. In addition he makes discoveries about himself and the new life he needs to live without her. To say a lot more would give away a lot of the plot and the fun in reading and discovering the meaning of the charms and I would not want to do that.

We once again are taken to Three Pines, this time as a result of the death of a hermit who lived in a cabin in the woods for years. Unlike some of her other books, the crime occurs early in the book and we see Inspector Gamache also early in this novel. But while the book is well written, there is something flat about the characters. We never seem to get true closure or satisfactory answers to the ID of the hermit, how items made their way into his cabin, and worse yet we do not have a really satisfactory ID as to the killer. Unlike other books, this time the focus of the killer is right in the center of Three Pines, and by the end of the the book we have lost two characters that have grown on us during this series of books. We also fail to find out why Gamache's daughter needed to speak with him early in the book and once the Inspector leaves Three Pines to investigate a clue in western Canada, the rest of the Homicide team becomes irrelevant and barely heard from again. This book halted the authors streak of award winners and I can see why. For some reason I feel that at this point she must feel either tired or things have gotten a bit stale in her series.

I never read his works until about 2 years ago and since then I have discovered his wonderful Chronicles of Barsetshire series. This book, Barchester Towers, is the 2nd book in the series and while we still have some of the same cast of characters as in his first book of the series (The Warden), there are a whole host of new and fascinating characters who join us in the fictional region of Barsetshire. This entire series deals with religious/theological intrigue and politics and in this novel we are dealing with a new Bishop, a new liberal government in London who choose that bishop, a new Bishop's chaplain, a new Warden and a new Dean of Barchester. Whew! Lots to write about and the stories are simple yet in his telling Trollope takes you into the minds and motives of everyone so that good and evil are easily spotted. Told in a remarkably detached and yet completely involved narrator it is a style of writing that has not been seen or use much. Trollope was not quite as popular as Dickens, but his works are much easier on the reader. There is very antiquated language and references to Mythological figures as the narrator equates actions of his characters to the acts in Greek Mythology and one needs to realize that they will have to do some work in order to appreciate these books. For me the best way to read Trollope is on a Kindle or some other e-reader. They have dictionaries that allow you to quickly understand some of words that Trollope uses and which have gone out of use. But this is a minor inconvenience. Give Trollope and his Chronicles a try, and hopefully you, too, will have an wonderfully enjoyable time in the region of Barsetshire....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 05, 2016","Mar 14, 2016","Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125321.Barchester_Towers

I learned so much from this book that I was unaware of with regard to this portion of the world and this conflict. How Arabs and Jews can reach an unwritten compromise and then have the Arabs come out and yell ""Death to the Jews"" and incite riots.

I am hoping that the Arnot affair is settled, but even though things seemed to be tidily wrapped up, she left enough room to have Arnot continue to haunt and torment Gamache.The plot of the murder has to do with the death of a person at a seance, and that was a very unique type of mystery that I had never seen utilized previously. It is funny, everyone seems to love the idyllic Three Pines, and yet bad things always seem to be happening there, so that the ""under the surface"" tensions in this allegedly idyllic and serene location are both puzzling as well as bringing out the worst of many human emotions and behavior.Not sure if anyone else sees the similarity between Three Pines and the town of Brigadoon, not exactly the same sort of locale, but on the other hand Three Pines exists on no maps and most people have no idea the village even exists - which is where I got my Brigadoon parallel.Have Penny's next two books loaded on my Kindle, and have left broad hints that paperback copies of and and all books after those first five would be a welcome Christmas present! ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 24, 2015","Dec 05, 2015","Nov 24, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8123447-the-cruelest-month

Jim Lynch has done it again with this tale of modern day Seattle, while blending in the 1962 Seattle Worlds Fair, as the starting point for Seattle of today. Chapters in the book switch back and forth between 1962 and 2001, as Lynch blends the story of a 70-year old politico who decides to run for mayor after a suicide jumper is egged on to jump by a frustrated driver stuck in traffic due to the potential jumper. We then switch back in time when the politico was the head (as well as the face) of the Seattle Worlds Fair. And into the fray jumps a newly arrived journalist who researches into Seattle's corrupt past and who tries to tie in this mayoral candidate to a 1962 Grand Jury inquest.Just a wonderful way the blend these incidents into a cohesive and fun to read book, While I was pulling for mayoral candidate, Roger, throughout the book, you can easily side with the reporter, the newspaper as it tries to expose the truth, as well as all the others who are being swamped by innuendo and partial truths. One of my favorite parts of the book came when Roger gave the journalist his version of her life story and she was appalled by his implications and innuendos, to which Roger turned it right back on her and said that she was doing the same thing to him.Really a fine effort and let me also recommend Tim Egan's book, Breaking Blue, about another State of Washington corruption books. Both are really well written and deal with completely different events, but the tie with official and police corruption is startling and amazing. I had the opportunity to speak with one of Lynch's publishers a few years back and he was amazed that someone from South Carolina would be reading and loving Lynch's work. I told him that to me it was a no-brainer, in that here was an author who could tell a great story no matter where the setting and since I have not spent a lot of time in the Pacific Northwest I loved his use of that setting in his novels, I guess I have gushed enough about Lynch, but if you have never had a chance to read his works it is worth your while to do so and this short (259 page) book is a great place to start!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Nov 2015,"Nov 05, 2015","Nov 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18932687-truth-like-the-sun

No way, shape or form like The Physician which is a marvelous work, The Jerusalem Diamond was a fast read but dealt with characters that were totally unappealing to me. The lead character, Harry Hupman did absolutely nothing that would make anyone really like him and yet he allegedly gets a Yemeni woman to fall in love with him and tell us all how lovable he is. Not really. An egotist, and a real showoff to me, Harry is supposed to be on the trail of a diamond that was stolen from the Vatican from the Mitre of Gregory. That is what we are told, and then we have about 300 pages of nothing to do with that diamond! The best parts of the book are the historical fiction chapters that are all in italics. They are enjoyable reads and deal with the history of diamond cutting and with Harry's kin throughout the ages. In between the beginning and end we find Harry trying to shag as many women as possible, and get into a whole different story about an archeological dig with another less than appealing character. So what did I like about it? Well the historical fictions parts were good, the story was a fast read and did not bog down into too many useless details, and the story that is written about is well written. But a whole lot of this did not make a lot of sense to me. I have read The Physician and I guess I expected a bit better from the author. I have 4 other of his books downloaded and still intend to read all of them, he is a very talented writer, but for me the Jerusalem Diamond was an improbably story with unlikeable characters made tolerable only because Noah Gordon is a fine writer....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 09, 2015","Oct 12, 2015","Oct 09, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19101588-the-jerusalem-diamond

It was a very good and very easy read, but the narrator was, in my opinion, one of the most unsympathetic characters I have read about. Not only that her problems seemed to be caused by her own immaturity and selfishness. Beryl's story is compelling in that it began when she was a young girl growing up in what is now Kenya before the start of WW1. Her father was a horse trainer and a rancher, but things changed for her when her mother left the family and returned to England when she was about 8 years old, and so it was just her father and herself until a new woman enters the family. Beryl rebels against any and everything, from the new woman (Emma) to going to school, to not being allowed to continue to grow and roam free as she matures. Beryl is rather headstrong to put it mildly, and eventually even her father lets her down by forcing her into a relationship at a young age that she is not prepared for. But things just keep always happening to Beryl, even though she becomes the first female trainer in Kenya there always is a problem and she loses horses and stables at an alarming rate. Things always seem to happen to her, some due her attitudes and the social structure of Kenya, and some due to mere misfortune (a rusty hinge on a stable door). Beryl is one of those who always seems to attract controversy and problems and I saw little growth in her as a person. But the story is eminently readable and since issues always were right around the corner I had this desire to see what would happen to her next. A novel based on true historical characters and events, I would recommend this and I think book clubs would have a great discussion with this title. The author used many of Beryl's true lifetime events that were in a book Beryl published - and even that was fraught with controversy since many wonder how Beryl could write such a book since she had little formal education. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 07, 2015","Sep 22, 2015","Sep 07, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25084367-circling-the-sun

Based on the Historical figure who began the forerunner of the London police department, this series alleges to follow some of the trials of this blind London Magistrate. It is a very interesting premise, and this first book sets up Sir John as a kindly, beloved and yet authoritative figure, one who takes the narrator of the series into his home after he was falsely accused of theft. Set in the mid-1700's this is a fascinating period of time and the author has done enough research so that you really get a feeling for the time period. This first case is an enjoyable mystery dealing with the death of a member of the House of Lords. The plot is interesting with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing as to how Lord Goodhope met his demise. The narrator at this point of the series is 13-year old Jeremy Proctor and that fact helps enhance the mystery and the plot since young Jeremy had just arrived in London when accused of theft. The case is seen through the eyes of the 13-year old, even though the narrator ""writes"" these tales as an old gentleman. Well done, and already have the next two in the series.

The second in his Empire Trilogy and I marvel at the authors writing style. In my opinion the book is a notch below his first book of the trilogy, Troubles. I would rate this one as a 4.5.Farrell is able to show the slow decline of the British Empire, this time set in 1850's India, and does so by rarely having any Indian characters in the book and showing the problem exclusively through the eyes of British, specifically the British East India Company. He also is able to use historical facts and combines them with remarkable symbolism to allow the reader to understand how the Empire began its slow decline that ended dramatically after WW2, although some feel it ended after WW1. He will continue this theme in his 3rd novel, The Singapore Grip, and unfortunately Farrell met an untimely and tragic death, and so we have to be satisfied with this Trilogy. Just an outstanding effort that was based up on the actual sieges at Cawnpur and Lucknow. It is a remarkable effort, filled with many memorable characters and one that will make me anxious (as well as sad) to move onto the third and final book of the Empire Trilogy.

As an aside, Anna tried her best to remain pure and virginal for Nick, but Nick had no such ambition and so I was a bit put off by this allegedly first and purest love of Nick when he seemed to fall in love with and bed every possible woman he met. This book only got a 3*** rating because the last section dealing with the War was pretty good, and the fact that my own father was involved in the Pacific Theater and in some of the same areas as Nick....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 07, 2015","Aug 25, 2015","Jun 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2530347.The_Persimmon_Tree

Connell in that Cisneros uses short vignettes as her chapters, but it is a much different book and one that I really cannot figure out why it became so popular. OK so it portrays a bit of the Hispanic culture as seen through the eyes of Esperanza but this book could have been fleshed out so much better and could easily have been 100 pages longer and it may have actually increased its appeal to me.There are certainly some poignant chapters but some events go by so fast with little or no reflection by the author. I know Esperanza is a young girl, and she does have some events that prompt a bit more reflection, but on the whole this is a book that many could have written with short, choppy vignettes from ones childhood.Not what I expected and not worth all the hoopla and ballyhoo.

Early years can seem to last forever and are filled with details and moments and then all of us hit a point where we are just going through normal routines, no matter how enjoyable, and thus I can understand the authors moving us through the last 30 years of the characters lives with little other than cursory details.I had never read any of Jhumpa Lahiri's works before this, although most of them are now sitting in my library! I am interested to read her other novels and short stories, but for now this will do as a amazing introduction into Lahiri's work.

There are still way too many names, and even though we have a chart in the front of the book to identify the cast of characters it gets difficult and time consuming to keep going back and forth.

Once there you had the predictable, yet quite charming culture clash that led to Hassan working for Chef Mallory. There were some times that the book was detailed as to what was happening and then months/years would go by between chapters with little or no explanation.

This time she combines her wit and wisdom by wrapping it around a story of ones identity and the ladies who formed the WASP's in WW 2. Filled with humor and memorable characters the books switches back and forth between the present and past, as well as ""letters"" written by some of the main characters. The story of Sookie Poole is one that really only begins when she is almost 60 and finds out that she is not the person she thinks she is. Characters like her mother Lenore, Marvaleen, Edna Yorba Zorba, along with Fritzi and all the other members of the Jordabalinski family from Pulaski, Wisconsin become friends of ours as Flagg does a wonderful job of telling a story of one lady's crisis and the touching story of the women who helped our Air Force during WW 2 and as a token of out countries appreciation were then ignored and dismissed, with their activities marked ""classified"" so nobody would fine out for over 30 years what so many brave ladies did to help the war effort. The books makes you laugh out loud as well as weep with sentimentality. It is perfect for any Book Club, and is as good as any that Fannie Flagg has written in her long and storied career. It is my sincere hope that this book will someday be made into a movie, as it is a story that could easily be converted to the big screen.

I started this book way back in March and 7 months later I closed the cover on this book for the last time. Why did it take so long? Well, I am done! I started this book way back in March and 7 months later I closed the cover on this book for the last time. Why did it take so long? Well, this is truly a weighty book with lots to digest and lots of really small type to navigate. It is a book that, in my opinion, one needs time to reflect upon and digest all that was going on over 100 years ago. So many similarities to today and such wonderful characters. 	The bigger issue is where to begin in this ? The writing – superb but a bit long. The characters – fascinating and yet flawed. The history – so wonderful to peel away some of the mystique that characterizes Teddy Roosevelt. The muckraking press – a lot like today, when the press makes itself part of the story instead of reporting the story. A thorough  would last thousands of words and bore everyone, I am sure.	Let’s start with a very well researched book that contains thousands of quotes. I cannot complain about the authors writing style, but I do think it could have been about 200 pages shorter and had the same effect. Goodwin writes as an academic which does not make for the easiest reading. For me the reader has to keep plugging away and when you do so you are rewarded with a lot of interesting history and you truly get a feeling for the time period.	Roosevelt – a fine US President but with an ego 10 miles long. A man who had to remake himself in order to try and run for President and challenge Taft in 1912. I truly believe that much of the new Roosevelt was an act, and when Goodwin points out that Teddy misread what the Democrats would do in 1912 you see the folly of his 3rd party run. He never expected the Democrats to run a Progressive Candidate like Woodrow Wilson since he says that if he had known that he would never have started the 3rd party. Teddy is an interesting character and there is a lot to like about him (and I think Goodwin really promotes Teddy), the later-years Teddy is not a person that comes across as genuine and instead it is all Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, as he personally destroyed the relationship with Taft.	Taft, on the other hand, comes across as a friendly and wonderful person. Maybe better suited to be 2nd in command, but nonetheless a President who has his principles and gets things done the proper way – no need for executive orders, he promoted bipartisanship and got things done the proper Constitutional way and actually accomplished a lot more than Teddy in terms of breaking up the Trusts and in Land and Water Conservation. But he did it his way and that upset Teddy and his supporters still in the government when Taft was President.	The muckraking press – very important. Teddy used them and they used Teddy. Some of the stories of McClure’s magazine are wonderful and the writers did a great job in exposing the problems in America. But they had an agenda – sound familiar?? After Teddy returned from Africa they almost appeared to goad him into challenging Taft who just was not Progressive enough for the muckrakers. I got a bad feeling about them, however I think that the author does not share that feeling. By the way, why is it always OK if the liberal press pushes and promotes a point of view or candidate, but it is not the same when the conservative press does that same thing??	Who caused many of the later-life issues between Taft and Teddy? Gifford Pinchot who seems like a real jerk since he did not like the new Secretary of the Interior and kept lying and pushing problems with his friends in the Progressive press (muckrakers), along with a Forestry official named Glavis who outright lied to cause problems. Add the press to this who goaded Teddy, and seemed to truly assist his campaign instead of reporting on matters and you get a story of a friendship gone bad, a GOP that was permanently divided and a book that is truly fascinating. 	I recommend this to readers who enjoy US history, but be prepared for a lengthy reading time. The first 250 pages and the final 250 pages are outstanding, but it is those middle 250 that dragged for me. And finally I can say that I have become a fan of William Howard Taft – a great administrator, President, person and judge....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 12, 2017","Oct 12, 2017","May 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17334495-the-bully-pulpit

I have not read Steven King for a long time, but had heard good word of mouth about this book and how it differs from his usual thriA 4.5**** for me. I have not read Steven King for a long time, but had heard good word of mouth about this book and how it differs from his usual thriller writings. So I purchased it over a year ago and there it sat in my Kindle library. Next thing I see is that HULU is adapting the book into an 8-part mini-series and the promos looked pretty interesting. I decided that while I wanted to watch the show on HULU, it would be best if I read the book first. And so I began back in June and, as usual, I had several reading projects and books during the summer and so it stayed barely started until I arrived in Romania and got a chance to concentrate on reading it. Wow!! Great book. Always thought that King was an absolute master with words and that in many of his books the first 200-300 pages were always so well-written and then things always got weird which sort of turned me off. But this book was great from beginning to end. It is a very simple premise - if a person could go back in time could they stop the JFK assassination on 11/22/63 and was Oswald the lone gunman so that if you stopped Oswald then JFK lives, and if JFK lives then the world would allegedly be a better place. And so thanks to diner owner Al Templeton, our fearless time traveler Jake, steps through a wormhole and gets transported from 2011 back to 1958. Both Al and then Jake make trips back and forth in time until Al no longer can do it, and so Jake takes over the task of trying to prevent the assassination. Lots of good stuff in here, and we see how Jake transforms himself into a new persona named George Amberson and changes bits of the past during the 5 years he is back in 1958 thru 1963. He falls in love, tracks Oswald, does detective research, makes some nifty gambling bets with bookies (all of which he wins because he knows the outcomes in advance, but the consequences of winning are different than he had thought), and becomes part of small town Texas. Eventually the day comes and George will try his best to keep Oswald from shooting JFK. But if he does that, then what happens to the future? The book has some definite alternate history tendencies (and an author named Turtledaub has made this a very popular genre), and King takes a whack at this in the book. The last 300+ pages just flew by for me, and the only reason I gave it only a 4.5 rating is that I felt the book was a definite 150 pages too long. Why? Well when Jake/George travels back in time he is given a huge notebook filled with everything he needed to know about Oswald, but while there Jake/George immerses himself in finding out all the minute intimate details of Oswalds life, most of which he really knows and none of which actually advance the plot of the book or add anything to the story. If you want your character to spy on someone then don't give him research on the exact same thing. Now, I can see how this would be necessary for the TV series, and I am sure it is integral in that medium, but to me it is unnecessary excess for a book that is outstanding in all other areas. A great read that I would recommend to anyone and no scary parts!!...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 05, 2016","Aug 05, 2016","May 15, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12530184-11-22-63

What I got was a book that held my rapt attention, a book that was a super fast and interesting read, a book that includes two characters that also appear in Charles Dickens book Oliver Twist, and a whole lot of really great history on England, the British legal and penal systen, and Van Diemen's Land, which is now known as Tasmania.We follow the fortunes of Ikey Solomon (Fagin), a young street urchin in London (The Artful Dodger), Bob Marley, Ikey's estranged and vengeful wife Hannah and her children, Mary Abacas who is truly Ikey's love of his life and who turns from prostitute to business woman when her fortunes turn, and one of the great characters I have ever come across who is eventually known as Sperm Whale Sally!This is an eventful book that follows the fortunes and misfortunes of Ikey and how he gets in and out of trouble, along with the journey of Mary who is a mathematical whiz with the device that gives her her last name. We follow them through all sorts of adventures in London and then when they all eventually are banished to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land, and how this trio act and sometimes interact on the island. It is a wonderful read and is the first of a trilogy, the second being Tommo and Hawk, and for me this was a wonderful and enjoyable read....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 12, 2017","Jun 04, 2017","May 15, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19047800-the-potato-factory

I felt the entire Hobie and Pippa storyline was unfinished, and that the narrators relationship with Kitsy and her family ended up being rushed - something that seems hard to do in a book this length. By the end it was the fact that this book could not hold my interest for long periods of time that led to this rating.

We go to Oman where death, destruction and chaos reign! For me it began as a fast read and the further I got into the book I just wanted it to end fast!

Interesting story, not quite what I expected from s, but interesting nonetheless since it does a fine job of switching back and forth between the WW 1 War Zone and the home front in Canada. Ending was a tad weak, and I thought there were a lot of loose ends when it came to relationships. It would be fascinating if the author would continue this storyline with a 2nd book since the war still rages, Angus's relationship with his wife if weak (if there ever really was a relationship), things are never resolved with the schoolteacher or the father, along with Juliette and Paul over in France. There is ample material here for a 2nd book. But taking all of that into consideration it is a very different book about WW1 and that makes it a very good and interesting reading - plus that the book is written by a Canadian which gives us a very new and fresh perspective on the war....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 16, 2015","Jun 07, 2015","May 15, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18667322-the-cartographer-of-no-man-s-land
