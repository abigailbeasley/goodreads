These careers where disempowerment is so systemic are not for everyone. And for McCurdy to have all her life choices completely negated by own narcissist mother, shows the reader what a tough baseline she was working from in her quest for personal evolution. McCurdy proves herself to a brave, deeply intelligent woman. We follow her on her journey to own her own life and it's inspiring. In general, I find the concept fame in the internet age deeply problematic. We laypeople are often bombarded with the options and recommendations from people with questionable intelligence. I once heard the phrase, ""These are people who were born on 3rd base and think they've hit home run."" I'm not particularly interested in the recommendations and opinions of people with no sense of context regarding humanity. To take it a step further, sometimes I feel like I'm bombarded by the opinions of mentally ill people while voyaging online. In a way, the fact that they seeking massive fame doesn't sound particularly balanced (but I'm not psychologist). Ultimately, they have the right to yell into the void, but how can I avoid them? How can being online be a positive experience for me? (Apart from Goodreads :) Then you have people like McCurdy who have ended up famous and are smart enough to be rendered uncomfortable by it. Her contribution by writing this novel is helpful for humanity. It's not self-pitying, it's not lecturing, it's not holier-than-thou, it's a well-produced document of her own struggle. I think these types of memoirs are additive to the larger conversation.

As an uneducated cheese-lover, I was delighted to learn about the chemistry of the cheese-making process and the very specific ways in which cheese is classified. The second half of the book is dedicated to each of the 45 AOP cheeses in France, giving practical information about storage, what to look for when buying the cheese, and most importantly how to eat it and with what. I'm going through each cheese one at at a time and have already fallen in love with several cheeses that I probably would have never purchased had I not read about them. (Never judge a cheese by its rind!). A few recommendations: Banon is truly delicious, creamy and simple; Charolais, a firm, subtle goat cheese has a delicious peppery aftertaste; La Fourme D'Ambert is a satisfying subtle blue that doesn't overwhelm (I had always been distracted by the more overbearing Roquefort, but the D'Ambert might have replaced it in my heart). ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Apr 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42731483-fromages

However, I enjoyed this book. I realI'm not a reader with a vast amount of knowledge about cooking nor the Franco-American foodie scene of the 1970s. However, I enjoyed this book. I really liked the construct that M.F.K. Fisher was facing her old life and, now stale, views. There can be a romanticism of France that blinds Americans -- it's not Emily in Paris --and it was interesting to see how these notorious American expats balanced their lives and opinions between the two countries; And, how their views evolved over time. Fisher is such a sharp and vivid writer that her excerpts and observations were the highlight of the book. Not surprisingly there were also many interesting cooking tips and tidbits inserted throughout. As someone who has never chronicled my own meal in my entire life, I found the whole thing novel and therefore arresting. Side note: if you are interested in Fisher, Consider the Oyster is another gem. It's snappy and dry and filled with recipes and restaurants that conjure up smoky American roadside diners and elegant pre-war hotels. Julia Child, as usual, seems to sail through the book, untouched. There is something so unapologetic about her character she sparkles right off the page. The other characters held varying degrees of my interest. I'm not surprised that this book was written by a relative of M.F.K Fisher, it goes to a level of detail balanced with nostalgia that only a member of family would take the time to write. To me it seemed like an author's labor of love and a very touching tribute to his family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Mar 04, 2021","Mar 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17737022-provence-1970

ForThe extraordinary story of the elegant and aristocratic Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, an unlikely leader who ran a resistance network throughout WWII. For me the book brought several elements of the war starkly into relief.

The level of risk and the consequences impressed me. How you would behave in the same situation, would you be that brave? Or would you be filled with energy to have something to fight for? The portraits of some of these people positively sparkle.

As you watch them grapple to resolve the mental and physical versions of yourself in their mind you often get very interesting clues about their true character. Online dating must be like this all the time! Anyways, Bateman describes how fame descended on her at age 16 and how for many years of her life she had other peoples' strange perceptions of her projected upon herself. It sounds miserable. Everyone just wants to be understood. Being fundamentally misunderstood every second of your life must be maddening....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"Jul 29, 2020","Jul 27, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41183658-fame

This is a book of many layers, a book that keeps on giving. Brodesser-Akner has so many astute observations about marriage and being a woman--particularly interesting is her thesis that a story must be told through the perspective of a man to be taken seriously. Then she uses her skills as a writer to do just that, beginning her tale through Toby (a man's eyes), who is going through a divorce and using a constellation of characters around Toby to fill in the details. It's  very clever. The way she reverses roles, and without giving away the ending, makes her point very clear. I initially struggled with the novel because I found many of her characters unlikeable. They are smart, witty and sometimes wise, but then they would treat other people poorly, such as their devoted nanny. The main characters are scornful and derisive, they pass judgment on everyone: their life partners, the preppy kid, the sad ""non-working"" mother. For example, Rachel says, ""The only thing more offensive than Miriam not working was Miriam thinking she did work. But Miriam would never know true success. She would never know achievement. She would never know what it was like to build something and hold it in your hands."" There is so much judgement in that sentence! We are all fallible, we all make mistakes. The strange dichotomy is that these characters seem so frustrated with their own mortality, and yet are so judgemental of everyone else's sloppy, imperfect lives. I found them in many ways to be petty, with a hyper-focus on money, status and external success. After I finished the book, I went to bed, a bit disturbed. I woke up thinking these characters perhaps lacked an internal life. It was quite a contrast after just finishing four Austen books, where inner life is held up so highly in her careful hands.But ultimately, I had a lot of sympathy for the mother in this book. She is a highly intelligent woman who on the surface appears to have it all. A very wise octogenarian once told me, ""You can have it all, but not at the same time."" I've often reflected on this comment. The mother in this book is trying to do just that: for her it's having a big job and being the boss, lots of yoga, being involved with her children lives and activities, and vast social commitments. Personally, I've found it impossible to do many things well at the same time. Something is always breaking down. Another wise octogenarian I know (I love to talk to people in their 80s), once told me, ""It's no problem to have a big job and an involved relationship with your children, but then you must have no social life."" I have also pondered that comment over the years. Anyways, at this moment, during a pandemic, we are all suffering from a new normal. I've seen many women posting in social media about how this current pandemic is difficult for them. All the things they used to outsource are now on their shoulders while they still have to continue their old jobs (and did we mention homeschooling?). When you try to do everything at once, how can you do it all well? Time is finite. Women and men are forced to make difficult choices. I'm glad that Brodesser-Akner has contributed so thoughtfully to this debate. This book is a great one for starting up important conversations....more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Apr 22, 2020","Apr 23, 2020","Apr 22, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42103980-fleishman-is-in-trouble

I must admit that I hit a wall with this one.Sense and Sensibility moved along so merrily and with great suspense, while Northanger Abbey had a few moments where I thought, ""Oh gosh, do I really have to pick this book up again?""After I finished the novel I started doing more research including reading the introduction by crime writer Val McDermid (I make it a policy never to read introductions as I they often include spoilers), and realized that this was the first novel Austen wrote. From that lens it all makes sense. The novel has the feeling of being with someone who is trying on various outfits. Austen plays around with the gothic and supernatural, a la Women in White or Frankenstein, with varying degrees of success. Yet her sparkling Austen wit is simmering beneath the surface. This makes for a tone that is a bit uneven: mysterious characters, romantic comedy scenes, moral digression.You also see the origins of Austen's house fixation (she really likes nice houses); Her overwrought and romanticized description of Northanger Abbey was one of the sections of the book where I needed a breather. There is also a really interesting moral condemnation of romanticism, which I think was Austen's illustration of her female protagonist evolving from a girl to woman. It's a transition that she handles as a first-time novelist, successfully in many areas, but also a bit heavy-handed in others. However, it's all good work, because you see the foundations of her later beloved characters in these experiments. Isabella, the annoying female who is slippery and selfish speaks more in monologues than Austen's later works has so much meat to her and reincarnates into many of Austen's beloved later characters. Her sketch of the rake is suitable annoying but still a bit unrefined. And as for Mr. Tilney, the love interest, the tension is not quite there, but you have all her other books to look forward to....more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,"Apr 16, 2020","Apr 20, 2020","Apr 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey

This time it was Sense and Sensibility. (I started with Persuasion, followed by Mansfield Park.) Sense and Sensibility struck me as remarkably boisterous after Mansfield Park, which seemed to meander in details. And Marianne is by far the most modern heroine I've read in this binge of three. Her habit of expressing exactly what she thinks and feels seems much more inline with current behavior. And vanity, selfishness and seriousness were three tropes that played loud and long. There is always a rake in Austen's books and Willoughby is one of the best in her quiver. He's handsome, charming, fun and goes along with things. But behind that easy-going nature you find a man that doesn't take himself or others seriously. I think seriousness, which is one of the redeeming qualities of Elinor and Colonel Brandon, is a quality that Austen takes great pains to extoll the virtue of throughout this novel. ""Take your heart seriously! Take yourself seriously!"" she seems to be saying. I appreciate this emphasis on respect of the mind and the person because it renders her characters positively feminist. Her heroines are never silly. And many of Austen's other characters are fabulous foils to her women of integrity: that vile Lucy, idiotic Lady Middleton, small, mean Mrs. Dashworth. Also, the dialogue between Elinor and Lucy is some of the best in the book. Austen conveys such a subtle nastiness that leaves you on the edge of your seat. There are so many layers and double entendres as Lucy tries to incite as much pain as possible. It's a ringside seat to horrid girl games at its best. Finally, as I was reading this book, and I stopped at one point and thought to myself, ""She really is a master of uncomfortable situations."" You cringe in the beginning when Mrs. Dashword convinces her husband to give his sisters nothing but occasional acts of kindness. Elinor and Edward's dysfunctional dynamic leaves you in spasms of pain. Marianne seeing Willoughby in London makes you want to cover your eyes with your hands! Austen's a specialist of tension in Sense and Sensibility. You're never quite comfortable until you reach the end. And when you do, you're disappointed. Somehow you've gotten used to a prolonged state of discomfort!...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,not set,"Apr 08, 2020","Apr 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility
