It opens with the amputation of a gangrenous foot, and then expands to show a gangrenous system, striated by race and class and dialect, reinforced from the top down over 325 years of travel with no end in sight. Rivers Solomon is absolutely unflinching in looking at how this system affects characters who are black, queer, neuroatypical, or combinations thereof. Aster, the protagonist, is an indelible character, and the book is one I'll be thinking about for a long time. I'm very impressed with the book and the author. This is not only meticulously plotted and conceived, but the prose is clear and unobtrusive in the way that is meant to look easy to write but is most definitely not. When the meaning behind the title revealed itself, I stopped and savored it for a moment.I had tiny quibbles here and there, but I'm not going to explore them or ding the book for them. My only regret is that I didn't read this in time to put it on my Hugo, Campbell, Locus, and Norton ballots.

Both of them referenced this book, which prompted me to grab it at the library this week. It's not at all the memoir I was expecting. Martin has a better memory for detail than most of the actors and musicians whose biographies or memoirs I've read. He's also incredibly gracious; I don't think anybody is put into a bad light. Okay, maybe his father, but that falls under familial complexity. The book more or less ends at The Jerk, with a few forays into the nineties to tie up personal loose ends. As a look into his artistic process, even when his choices were made out of necessity or chance, it's fascinating. The prose is solid too. A quick and enjoyable read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 24, 2016","Jul 26, 2016","Jun 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/773858.Born_Standing_Up

I knew that Miles' story really began there, and that the first book had won a Hugo. I was assured that I could come back to it out of order. My mother read the entire series out of order and loved it anyway. So here I am, several years later, having read Warrior's Apprentice through Cryoburn (but not the Ivan book or the one that just came out), catching up on Shards of Honor and Barrayar.I read Shards of Honor yesterday while I was supposed to be helping repair our fence. I held boards in place with my right arm while I held the book open with my left. ""Do you think you could put that down? This'll be steadier if you use two hands."" The fence looks good enough. I didn't put the book down. That said, I'm glad I read them in the order I did. There were some weird time jumps in this one, things left unexplained. It's a good adventure, but the romance seemed a little forced to me. I didn't see much evidence of attraction - a little respect, a little trust - before love was suddenly blooming.There are other things that I think she smoothed out over time in her writing style.

I think part of it might be that the events Carrie Brownstein talks about are more recent: the book mostly spans her years in Sleater-Kinney, the decade starting in the mid 1990s, with a few chapters about her childhood at the beginning. She also seems to have a good memory for detail. My own experience says that when you're scrapping together a tour it's fairly easy to remember detail because each night is different. Instead of endless interchangeable hotels you have the dubious thrill every night of finding a place to stay, of crashing on boxsprings without mattresses, couches with mysterious stains. Brownstein also knows what people want to hear about -- tours, band dynamics, individual songs. I would have liked her to get to Portlandia as well, or her other acting projects, but maybe she's leaving that for another book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Feb 05, 2016","Feb 12, 2016","Feb 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25065629-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl

This is a thrilling debut novel, full of bone towers and skymouths and humans flying on well-engineered wings. Engineered. This is fantasy without magic (there are creatures WE might call magic, but I would simply call them fauna native to this particular world), a society built on tradition and Laws, but with the reasons behind many of those things lost to a more chaotic time. We don't know how they rose above the clouds, or what exactly their city is built upon.Our narrator, Kirit, carves a path between the known and the unknown. She's a fine character to hang a story on: clever and loyal and stubborn and tough. I appreciate that most of what transpires is caused by her own choices; while she does have one important hereditary trait, this is not a Chosen One narrative. I appreciate that she has goals from the beginning, but that they shift over time.

The prose is lovely and the structure gives room for more SFnal ideas in one book than many novelists get to put forth in their whole career. The characters are reinvented over and over again, always in orbit with each other, as the larger story gradually unfolds. There were one or two characterizations that put me off (view spoiler)[example: there's one iteration in which Hector and Adrian are in an institution and Adrian makes Hector very happy by calling Hector Helen, which Hector says is her true self -- but then the choice to refer to Hector as 'he' through that section is authorial, not narrative. Adrian/Adrienne and Antoine/Antoinette are allowed to be what they are in any given moment (even when they have moments of confusion), but Hector/Helen is misgendered in a way that bothers me, given the nature of the text  (hide spoiler)]but kudos to the author for the strength of her vision, and to Aqueduct Press for publishing it.Edited to add: The author wrote this very spoilerific blog post in response to the thing that bothered me in the spoiler, which suggests that others also had the same question.

For months I couldn't shake the feeling that I had somehow corrupted myself with that vision of the future. Kunstler's World Made By Hand helped somewhat, offering me an alternative vision where people banded together to survive. I'd read other apocalypses before and I've read others since, but it is not one of my favorite sub genres. I'd so much rather read brighter pasts and presents and futures.I can't say this book doesn't instill that same panic at the tenuous nature of our society, but like the Kunstler novel, it has a more favorable view of humanity. The people who survive in this book write plays and poetry, and perform Shakespeare. They live by a creed lifted from Star Trek Voyager, that ""Survival is Insufficient."" And that somehow lifts my heart, makes this world the author has imagined infinitely more palatable, makes me willing to lose hours of writing to linger with these characters in their post-plague world.

Only the fact that so many of my friends had recommended it so highly kept me reading, and I'm glad I trust them so much. I'm easily put off by grimdark and the sort of grandiose heroism that I (perhaps unfairly) expect to encounter when I open a book of high fantasy. This was in fact a lovely character study, and a deeper meditation on stagnation of power. Maia, the eponymous Goblin Emperor, is a good character to hang a book on: enough of an outsider to explain the world to readers, but savvy and thoughtful enough to survive in the role that is thrust upon him. He reminds me a little of Nicola Griffith's Hild in the ways he learns to use his power, though he doesn't have her prodigious acumen. I'll admit the sheer number of characters overwhelmed me sometimes, but that got a little better once I found the glossary and list of characters at the back. I realized I could stop stressing over it and most scenes could be repopulated by context; behind the names, the characters were drawn so distinctly that there was no doubt who was talking. I'd also like to give the author a few points for using ears to denote emotion. I've often wished people could be as expressive with their body language as horses. Points also for writing a world this complex but being content to leave it as a standalone novel.

They're lovely stories, with depths that aren't hidden: the water is crystal clear, so it's perfectly obvious that the lake has no bottom, and you could just dive forever, and there are always more facets to explore. I liked ""I Can See Right Through You"" better this time around. My tendency to skim stories I read electronically had robbed the story of some of its nuance. ""The Summer People"" and ""Two Houses"" (the latter one of my favorite stories that came out that year) were just as strong on re-read. The mundanity-of-superheroes stories were cool too. Both ""Origin Story"" and ""Secret Identity"" had really interesting twists on a genre that has been done and done. The casual acceptance of things that lie at slight angles to our own reality is one of my favorite things about a Kelly Link story. Of course people can have two shadows. Of course you can have a superpower, but it may not be a very impressive one. The previously unpublished (I think?) ""The Lesson"" was no less rich for its lack of weirdness, and turned out to be one of my favorites. A wonderful collection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 06, 2015","Mar 18, 2015","Sep 24, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22125258-get-in-trouble

It's not a paint-by-numbers pseudo-European medieval fantasy; Hurley has created a world that is wholly her own. It's a menacing place, full of deadly plant life and dogs and wolves and riding bears that probably aren't anything like our dogs and wolves and bears. Magic has cost. There are numerous distinct cultures, with their own beliefs and customs and cuisines. Women with major roles. Varied expressions of gender. Strong action, good writing. A fantastic opening scene. Complex, nuanced politics. So many things to like.But - I'm still not a fan of this particular sub-genre. It gets too dark and graphic for me, verging on horror sometimes. I don't like threatened rape (that it's women threatening a man doesn't make it better.) I'd rather get to know a couple of characters very well than pass through dozens of characters. The latter makes sense in a book like this, since there is so much information to impart and things look different from different perspectives, but I sometimes get lost trying to keep track of who is who (it's an indicator that I don't read a lot of fantasy that I didn't think to look for a glossary at the back, but there's a nice one that also includes the cast of characters). It's to Hurley's credit that I felt compelled to finish it. I'm not rating it, because I think it's a good book; I'm just not the right audience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 29, 2014","Sep 06, 2014","Aug 26, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20646731-the-mirror-empire

Or worse, authors that use a second book in a trilogy entirely to set up a third. There are exceptions, of course: series that invent and reinvent themselves as they go along. Series with greater ambitions and a strong structure, like Vandermeer's Southern Reach or Jo Walton's small change.As much as I loved Ancillary Justice, I didn't need to see it duplicated. So when I realized that Leckie had other plans, I was overjoyed. Part of what I loved about Ancillary Justice was that even though the overarching story was huge and centuries-spanning, the focus was on the characters. In Ancillary Sword, she manages to move forward with the big plot put in motion in the first novel, but the focus is tight. Most of the action takes places on one station and one estate on a planet. It concerns a finite set of characters. It reminded me in some ways of Bujold's Mountains of Mourning, my favorite of the Miles Vorkosigan stories. We're given a chance to see how Breq deals with human sized problems, and how Breq approaches power.

I could open to almost any page and find something worth quoting. The commentary on race is well done. As for the take on Snow White, it feels more like a variation on the theme than an actual retelling. It's a book about passing, on multiple levels, and a book about beauty. It's at its best when characters are telling each other stories. I sometimes felt like characters were acting roles, that they were being squeezed into the Snow White parts rather than allowed to be themselves. Boy's story made sense up until the end of the first section. I never did fully understand her actions.The ending didn't quite feel complete, and the told-story that serves as a culmination came out of left field. That last recounting soured me a bit on a book I was liking until then. I know it's one more story about passing, but it felt gratuitous somehow. It just isn't handled with the same nuance as the discussions of race. And while I can stomach the characters' reactions as of their time, if we're to accept Mia's story about Boy's parent as true, then I'm disappointed on a larger scale. The tropes in that one story detract so much from my enjoyment of the book.Even when I didn't think the characters were acting in character, I never once thought to stop reading.

With the first book, I thought Grossman had a clever look at genre going on, by a writer who had clearly read a lot of fantasy and wanted to synthesize what he had read. The second book felt more sincere, with the result that the writer was stuck writing about places that necessarily felt derivative (since the first had a backdrop modeled on Hogwarts and Narnia).

I guess that's because it starts with Pops but finishes with Mavis. At times it felt a little superficial on some of the personal milestones, but the detail on the music portions makes up for it. When I saw Mavis play last year, I noticed that her sister Yvonne - the only other Staples on the stage - looked like she wasn't entirely excited to be there. This book made me far more sympathetic. Yvonne comes across as somebody who would do what was needed of her. If her family needed her on stage, even if she didn't want to be there, she would be there for them. Lots of other little details added to my picture of the band: I didn't know they went to high school with Sam Cooke, or that Mavis and Bob Dylan were sweethearts.

I'm not sure I was 100% satisfied with the ending, but the experience of the book and the margin notes and the artifacts and the codes was so much fun that it doesn't matter. For those who don't know what this book is: it's a JJ Abrams concept implemented by a novelist. The book that slides out of the slipcover is not ""S."" but ""Ship of Theseus,"" a novel purported to be written by one V.M.Straka. It's made to look like a mid-twentieth century library book, with yellowed pages, stains, spine sticker, library stamps. It's made to be read on one level as a novel. On the next level, the fictional translator has written footnotes that include coded messages. Then there are several passes through the book with handwritten margin notes by a grad student and an undergrad trying to solve the mysteries of the book (and to figure themselves out in the process); these are done in different colored pens so the reader can parse the timeline. Finally, there are artifacts: a map drawn on a napkin, a sepia-tinted photo with scalloped edges, postcards. This is an ode to BOOK, and all the things a book can be that an e-book or an audiobook cannot. As somebody who loves finding margin notes or shopping lists stuck in used books, I fully approve. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 05, 2014","Feb 11, 2014","Jan 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17860739-s

It's beautifully written, giving a sense from the very beginning of everything protagonist Alana has at stake: her love of ships, her family, her ability to work and live in a body that is slowly betraying her, her love of ships. I mentioned ships both first and last because the book itself is most vibrant when talking about starships and living ""in the black"" or ""in the big quiet."" They're lovely images, full of weight. When the same passionate language is used for another character not long after Alana meets her, it felt sudden.Things I liked: the prose, the seamless integration of hand-wavium into the story's high-tech world, the forthright looks at class and disability and sexuality and personhood. Alana's disability is an important part of who she is, and permeates the plot as well: it doesn't disappear when it's inconvenient. Race and sexuality don't seem to be issues in the world we are given, but there is no white straight default. I appreciate that. I like that there is no shame or doubt regarding Alana's sexuality. I like that we're given a world that includes women and men and both and neither, in which most of the main characters are competent women because why not? Spoilers in the things-that-didn't quite work for me: (view spoiler)[Everybody was a little too attractive for me. Alana fell for the captain SO quickly, and I didn't feel enough reason for her to call it love beyond physical attraction. The destruction of the world her parents were on felt abrupt: we were told it was important to Alana only in the seconds before it was gone. Her sister felt like a caricature for the first half of the book. The way Slip set Alana up at the beginning felt more manipulative than necessary given the relationship among crew members. Alana forgave some pretty awful behavior fairly easily. I'm not a romance reader, generally, but the romance in this was well integrated. It would have been even slighter if Alana wasn't such a processor, giving us her emotional state at every step.  (hide spoiler)]All of that said, I couldn't put the book down once I started it.

I really regret not having finished this in time for my year-end list for 2013, because it would be high on the list. I'd read and loved Adichie's short stories, but not her previous novel. This was a real treat. She hooked me very early on with a line about the familiarity strangers adopt after sharing disappointment in a public service. The language was at once elegant and intimate and plain. The jacket copy bills it as a story centered around a young man and woman from Nigeria, and while the man, Obinze, does get some chapters in his perspective, it was Ifemelu's voice that drew me in. Her experiences as a Nigerian in America, the blog she wrote about being a non-American black woman in America, her experiences returning to Lagos after years abroad, the small moments of self-reflection: all felt note-perfect. There's a posh dinner party partway through the book, and buried in the conversation there is the novel's thesis. A tertiary character remarks, ""You can't write an honest novel about race in this country. If you write about how people are really affected by race, it'll be too obvious. Black writers who do literary fiction in this country, all three of them, not the ten thousand who write those bullshit ghetto books with the bright covers, have two choices: they can do precious or they can do pretentious. When you do neither, nobody knows what to do with you. So if you're going to write about race, you have to make sure it's so lyrical and subtle that the reader who doesn't read between the lines won't even know it's about race. You know, a Proustian meditation, all watery and fuzzy, that at the end just leaves you feeling watery and fuzzy.""Adichie manages precisely that. A thoughtful, thought-provoking, funny novel about race, about multiple layers of race and being and belonging, with a love story painted over it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 05, 2014","Feb 03, 2014","Dec 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15796700-americanah

A narrative that jumps seamlessly between past and distant past and present, and between the ""I"" of Breq, chasing a particular gun, and the ""I"" of the ship Justice of Toren, and the many ""I""s of One Esk. The result is a peculiar first person narrative that can describe events that take place across time and space and seemingly private conversations to which it might not have been privy. It isn't omniscience, just the broadest definition of the first-person perspective that I've ever seen. Brilliant. I'm not going to go into any of the events of the book other than to say thank you to Ann Leckie for making me realize the strange fact that most of my favorite SF novels include a trek through an icy landscape.

She battled and battled until her character was so powerful she could just look at a horde of wraiths and they would shrivel up and hand her their belongings. This book might be for her.)I do remember every milestone referenced: the text-based games, the pixellated figures that came after, and every breathless ""those graphics are so real!"" that was outdone by something else the next year. Grossman does an excellent job of capturing that excitement. The insights into how games work were compelling, since I've really never peeked behind the curtain.The plot itself was clever and self-referential and full of meta-game details. The ""You"" of the title is the you of video games, both you-the-player and you-the-character, as narrated by a game. The third layer here is you-the-reader. Russell is our player character. He is thrown into a new situation, as anyone is when they start a game. He's forced to learn the rules by interacting with those around him and with his environment. (That's the only explanation for why a guy who had no experience in the industry would be promoted above those who had been with the company for a while.) There are occasional cut-scenes and flashbacks, and puzzles within games, and artifacts to seek out as he runs through the levels and life.So yes, clever and fun, and compelling enough that I didn't put it down. But ultimately it felt like it was speaking to somebody just over my shoulder, not to me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 19, 2013","Aug 20, 2013","Aug 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790854-you

I have a habit of sometimes reading to finish a book, rather than reading to experience it. I lived this novel, the grit and the grime as well as the glamour. It is a lush imagining, an act of deft, from-the-ground-up worldbuilding. I love how everyone has things to do, whether they are men, women, nobles, farmhands: there are herbs to collect, sheep to shear, cows to be milked, people to be healed, cloths to be woven. I love that the women have purpose and agency, and that every single character has wants and needs of his or her own. And Hild herself develops so organically from bright, observant child into larger-than-life seer.

It explores the lives of a young woman with a developmental disability who is institutionalized by her family, and a young man who winds up in the same institution because of his deafness. It casts an unflinching gaze on the horrible practices within the institution. Those passages were excellent, and I think the book was at its best when stepping behind the curtains without moralizing. It was obvious to me from early on that this was a book that would look at the darkness but provide happy endings for all the characters we come to care about. I don't blame the author for doing that, and I appreciate a satisfying ending, but I like a little more dramatic tension. I didn't buy the voice when she was writing dialogue for children and for some other characters later in the book. All of that said, as a work of fiction meant to illuminate our horrifying past and the strides we have made, this is a fine read.

The first section was mostly about the Occupy movement, and a good portion of the second section was made up of war stories and hospital stories. There was an excellent piece about the experiences of a woman who gave birth in prison, and a compelling piece about a soldier's return from war that I am pretty sure (but not positive) was fiction. And I liked the Louise Erdrich story. But other than that, I found myself skimming a lot.

The book seems more concerned with wrapping up their stories with marriages and new jobs. One absolutely fascinating side story was told about an otherwise healthy man who was brought to the hospital at Oak Ridge after a car accident in the vicinity. Rather than setting his broken leg, they injected him with radioactive isotopes (without his permission) and removed fifteen of his teeth, keeping him in the hospital for weeks. His story is wrapped up in a couple of lines because it doesn't fully keep with the ""girls"" narrative, but probably merits a book of its own if there hasn't been one already.

The book is actually a box of independent pieces, meant to be picked up and read in any order, but to form a cohesive whole in whatever order you read them in. Young's book is like that as well: more of a collection of thoughts than a journey, told in whatever order they occurred to him, without any regard for linearity or theme. Some of it comes across as a bit of an advertisement for his current projects: the Lincvolt electric car, and his crusade to restore musical fidelity (called PureTone through most of the book and then Pono in the last hundred pages). There's surprisingly little about the music itself, or songwriting. What there is of songwriting is mostly about his fear that he won't be able to write now that he's sober. Beyond that there's little introspection: most of the book is composed of tributes to friends and musicians, and tributes to well-loved vehicles. I'm pretty sure there are far more words devoted to his hearse than his guitar. Shakey: Neil Young's Biography goes into more depth in general. But why do we read a musician's biography or autobiography? Is it for the name-dropping? For his recollections of his glory days? Salacious stories or salvation stories? If it's to get a glimpse into a mind that wrote some of my favorite songs, then this book is it, in all its rambling, ragged glory. We're used to linearity, but he's spent his whole life composing in cycles of chorus and verse. I think this book is just another song. Probably a Crazy Horse song, with meandering instrumental passages and occasional returns to theme. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 24, 2012","Dec 24, 2012","Dec 24, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13586786-waging-heavy-peace

It's reminiscent of The Left Hand of Darkness and Ammonite: anthropological and travelogue-ish in the best senses. Lord develops characters slowly, letting the reader discover them through their actions as they are placed in new and strange situations. The story begins with a large-scale tragedy, but starts the action some time later, so that the book is about long-term personal coping rather than the immediate aftermath. I have a couple of minor issues with the book. Though it is very different from Lord's first book, Redemption in Indigo, she at times falls back on some similar narrative techniques. Addressing the reader works in a folktale, but pulls me out of the story here, making me wonder how the tale is being related to me and why in a way that I shouldn't be questioning.The book is very episodic, and some of the episodes were more resonant than others. Some threads seem like they would come back again, but really don't make any return appearance. I love seeing sexual minorities and ethnic minorities portrayed in SF, and for the most part Lord handles those topics well. There is a character of ambiguous gender in this novel who is written as a well-rounded member of the team, neither a curiosity past the initial mention nor a source of ridicule.

They tell stories in ways that incorporate the best parts of film and prose and visual art and transcend all of the above when they get it right.This is not a great comic. The best I can say for it is that it's better than season eight. The writing relies on the art to tell us who is who, and on our previous experience with the characters to fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, this artist's renderings of some characters leave me wondering who they are. New characters look interchangeable. It's very distracting. The writing has some of the snap of the TV show, but lacks something. Heart, maybe. I just don't feel the connection with the characters. The storyline has potential, but I wouldn't have bothered reading it if I couldn't get a library copy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 27, 2012","Sep 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13576260-buffy-the-vampire-slayer

A few are from the other type of news, surprising deceptions carried out on an individual or group.

The loving introduction and the even more loving opening essay by Bradbury himself show that this was meant as a living tribute. And it's excellent. The Kelly Link ghost-stories-on-a-spaceship story is beautifully done. There are a number of stories by authors I wasn't really familiar with that I would count among my favorites here: ""Children of the Bedtime Machine,"" by Robert McCammon; ""Young Pilgrims,"" by Joe Meno; ""The Companions,"" by David Morrell; ""By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain,"" by Joe Hill. At museums, I often get so distracted by the great text on the walls that I forget about the works themselves. I like the sculpture, but I like it even more in conjunction with the story of how it is the only sculpture that its maker ever made, carved out of a log of applewood that he found in the woods on the grounds of the asylum. The notes that accompany these stories are like that. I particularly like that there are multiple writers in the anthology who describe having written to Mr. Bradbury at a young age and getting personal responses. This is a quality anthology that shows the depth and breadth of Mr. Bradbury's influence on contemporary fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 24, 2012","Oct 09, 2012","Jun 22, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13329252-shadow-show

I'm not sure it needed to be the female fables in particular, or that having chosen that mission, it lives up to it. The first volume consists of two stories: a main arc concerning Ali Baba, Briar Rose, and the Snow Queen, and a single issue story concerning Beauty & the Beast.The odd thing is that both of these stories ostensibly about fable women start out with male POV characters. Both hinge upon decisions made by the male characters. Both involve female fables getting rescued, even if they are also allowed to turn the tables at other points in the story. The main story spends a lot of time following around fairies with strategically shredded costumes, striking poses that seem anatomically problematic (I may just be sensitive to this right now because of Jim Hines' cover photo poses and the Hawkeye Initiative). In other words, these stories may include some strong and independent female fables, but the creators still assume that their audience is straight males (or that female readers will put up with the things that are necessary to invite the male gaze). That said, the art is excellent, and the issues raised in the final story are intriguing and disturbing....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 10, 2012","Jun 18, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13536522-fairest-volume-1

It contains some similarities to the author's adult novel, Who Fears Death: a strong female protagonist who is just coming into her own power; a band of young friends who need to take on a larger evil; an African setting (far-future Sudan in that case, present day Nigeria in this one). If I remember correctly, both also begin with first-person sequences in which the protagonist gets a hint of her own power, and then segue into third-person for the remainder of the book. In both cases I get the impression that the story may have been written in first person and then changed to third in a subsequent draft.There are a lot of similarities to Harry Potter as well, which is just to say that the book uses the touchstones of the YA-fantasy genre to tell a story that is entirely its own. A young girl named Sunny plays the role of the child who discovers that she has access to a magical world that goes unseen by the mundane majority. She is Harry Potter and Hermione rolled into one: smart, good at sports, self-conscious about her appearance, the child of two non-magical parents. She's an American-Nigerian, a Free Agent, and an albino, traits which combine to make her an outsider wherever she goes. Sunny is a great character and role model for young readers.

This book's protagonist is less sympathetic; he's a jerk to his wife, and takes on the countenance of an addict before too long. I don't mind an unsympathetic lead, but in this case, Richard isn't really all that interesting. My bigger issue is that the section of the plot that takes place in the past bored me. The protagonist wasn't allowed to interact with anything he observed in the past, and thus the past characters remained only characters in a play that unspooled before his eyes.

I had a vague knowledge that it was narrated by dogs, and a vague knowledge that this was a ""fix-up novel"" - a group of short stories tied together with an overarching structure for publication purposes. I'm glad I didn't go into it with any further preconceptions. Simak did an excellent job of linking the stories; I thought the conceit of the story notes added great depth to the ideas put forth in the stories. The book consists of eight stories and a framework of notes that precede each story. I'd like to call them anthropological field notes, but I think the more accurate term might be caninological, since they are written by an advanced race of dogs. ""These are the stories the Dogs tell, when the fires burn high and the wind is from the north,"" says one of the early notes. The stories the dogs examine span twelve thousand years, starting in a near future with dates now past. Some of the stories are put forth as apocryphal, some as fables, some as containing a germ of truth. They discusses the nature of time, and the nature of the bond between dogs and people, and the nature of dogs, and the instincts that govern both. A human family by the name of Webster is present in almost all of the tales. The Webster family robot, Jenkins, serves as the human proxy when no human is available, and as a common thread woven through the lengthy timeline. Jenkins is a surprisingly rich character, with fascinating motives. I had never read Simak before, and didn't expect the beauty of the language or the depth of the ideas he explores. Though this is a story of dog, it is also a story of mutants and robots and ants and men and websters and Websters and cities and aliens and cobblies, all of which cycle in and out of the stories. I loved the way various members of that cast of characters appeared and reappeared. New situations were sketched with a deft hand, bringing the reader up to date quickly despite jumps of thousands of years. If I have any complaint, it is the absolute lack of female characters. I don't think a single female dog is named in the entire book, and there are only a couple of human women, dismissed quickly. I can justify it somewhat by making a connection to fables and fireside stories, and suggesting that each Wolf and Bear and Squirrel is meant to stand for something larger. Still, it speaks to the quality of the stories and the concepts and the prose that I was mostly able to ignore the rather glaring omission of half of the population. I would probably name this as my new favorite novel-in-stories. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"May 28, 2012","May 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/222093.City

He has elevated ""write what you know"" to an art form. There's a boy with a single mother and an absent father (see also Owen Meany, Garp). He grows up to be a writer (Garp). (view spoiler)[There are transgendered former athletes (see Garp) and little boys who play dressup (Hotel New Hampshire). (hide spoiler)] It's set in New England (Owen Meany, Hotel New Hampshire, Cider House Rules, um, almost all of his books?) with a boys' boarding school (Hotel New Hampshire) and a trip to Vienna (Hotel New Hampshire). There's a grand old house (Hotel New Hampshire, Owen Meany) and a domineering grandmother (Owen Meany) and a jock older male relative (Hotel New Hampshire). There's a character whose every sentence is cried rather than spoken (Owen Meany). And of course, lots of wrestling.That's just the physical resemblance. Stylistically, I was impressed as always by his ability to weave time backward and forward. Other familiarities grated a bit. With the time-weaving comes a certain amount of necessary reminder, but I thought he didn't trust his reader enough, and spelled out every conclusion even when the event being referenced was fresh in my mind. There were certain words and phrases that he italicized every time he used them, which also felt like it was meant to serve as a reminder to a neglectful reader. There were multiple characters with the same strange psychological affliction in which they could not pronounce certain words. Every character seemed to have a habit of discussing words separate from their meanings: multiple characters used the phrase ""the _____ word,"" say ""the table word"" to differentiate from the actual table. To address the subject matter, this is the story of one man's life, and specifically his sexual development as a bisexual man. It addresses Stonewall and Vietnam and AIDS, all through Billy Abbott's eyes. Irving has written GLBT characters before, but not as narrator (as far as I remember). Irving has done an interesting thing here. If this book had been a gay author's first novel, I think it would be filed under ""gay fiction"" and would not reach a mainstream audience. Irving has a particular bully pulpit. He has a chance to reach a mainstream audience that he has already inured to shock, and then see if they are actually inured. I only guess at his desire to shock because of the italics and the fact that most of the beats of the story concern sexual reveals. Or perhaps that is meant to be Billy's writing style, since Billy is a novelist himself. The characters don't always ring true, which might also be a product of Billy's style rather than John Irving's. (view spoiler)[I felt as if his relationship with his mother was left very sketchy compared to other relationships. She was treated as fragile and perhaps even mentally challenged, with minimal development beyond those characteristics; she seemed to be universally scorned or pitied. Also, I found it a little hard to believe that this many members of a single family turned out gay, and this many people in a single small town ended up with the same particular and specific proclivities repeating. I can't tell if he's implying the cause lies with Shakespeare or genetics. In one family there are two men who enjoy wearing women's clothing (one gay, one straight), one bisexual man, one lesbian. (hide spoiler)] I guess I appreciate the story he is trying to tell, even if I didn't love this book the way I loved some of his previous novels. I will say that I've never seen a book of mainstream fiction with this volume and variety of nuanced, sympathetic QUILTBAG characters. It almost felt like he was trying a little too hard....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 27, 2012",Jul 2012,"May 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12758317-in-one-person

For me, the most interesting parts of this particular guide were the annotated story, in which Knight broke down everything he had done in a short piece and why, and the section on controlling a story. Knight compares the experience to that of a stage magician, and proceeds to break down those skills. He says the writer needs to command, to focus attention, to hypnotize, and of course, to create illusions. ""There is no such thing as a story. The words on paper are only instructions used by each reader to create a story. The story itself exists in the reader's mind and nowhere else.

Do you remember those old commercialsI have mixed feelings about this new haggadah edited by Jonathan Safran Foer and translated by Nathan Englander. Do you remember those old commercials in which ""we've replaced this man's regular coffee with Folgers - let's see if he notices?"" This haggadah seems to be a a project born of passion and enthusiasm, but I'm not sure there was enough forethought involved. They want to replace the Maxwell House haggadah and see if people notice, but ultimately I don't think they set a high enough bar for themselves. The Maxwell House haggadah may still be ubiquitous in some households, but I would think the goal would be to make a great haggadah, not merely one to replace the bland standard. There are several interesting features. A timeline of Jewish history runs along the top of each page, from biblical times through the modern day. The Hebrew typeface for each page purports to represent the common look of Hebrew printing in whatever time period is being discussed. Cool idea, but in practice this means some pages are easier to read than others.Englander's translations are vigorous and passionate. They reminded my aunt of Rumi. They are fairly literal. He translates ""Eloheynu,"" for example, as ""God of us,"" when the suffix ""nu"" is generally accepted to correspond to the English first person plural ""our,"" and ""Eloheynu"" to mean ""our God."" Interesting choice, a little distracting. The plague of darkness -""choshech""- he translates as ""a clotted darkness."" So at first I thought he was just being extremely literal, and later I decided he was trying for poetry. At that point I got annoyed at his insistence on non-egalitarian translations. It's the twenty-first century, your audience is likely a liberal one. Would it have hurt to use a non-gendered pronoun now and again? In Hebrew, a mixed group is generally captured with a masculine pronoun, but in English it's easy enough to get some diversity in there. Instead of ""sons"" you can say ""children,"" for example. You can say God instead of ""Lord"" and ""Master.""Not so hard. There are a few pages of commentary interspersed between the traditional text. They arrive in groups of four, labeled ""playground,"" ""nation,"" ""house of study,"" and ""library."" There is no explanation of what those four designations mean. ""Playground"" was written by Lemony Snicket, and is generally funny. I didn't recognize the other authors, or get a good sense of the character of their commentaries. Because they came in groups of four and only sporadically, they tended to all comment on different aspects of one particular piece. They were interesting but not really illuminating, in my opinion.My aunt had heard several interviews with Foer and Englander, and bought their Haggadah on the basis of what she had heard. She said that they had each discussed growing up with the Maxwell House haggadah and its rigid form. As they got older they longed for something that would speak to them, and set about trying to create it. They said that a lot of Jews identify culturally but are divorced from deeper knowledge of their culture. And I know that I'm probably not the person to critique their effort; while I'm no Judaic scholar, I think I have a a lot more working knowledge than the average Joe(seph). But if I were somebody like Foer or Englander who had sat through sixty-some Maxwell House seders in my lifetime, and was curious about going a little deeper  this would not be the haggadah I would turn to. I would turn to the lovely Passover Haggadah: The Feast of Freedom = or A Night of Questions: A Passover Haggadah. or The New American Haggadah, all of which include wonderful commentaries and examinations of the text. Or one of the dozens of others that have made the scene since Maxwell House. Again, I know that I may not be in the position to see what the majority of people are doing, so maybe most households are still stuck on Maxwell House, but I'm not sure those people are going to switch now if they haven't switched yet.Ultimately, this haggadah comes across to me as the work of some people who set about making a haggadah that would speak to them without looking at what was already out there, at what works, or what people are looking for. They even named it the New American Haggadah and cited a tradition of naming new haggadot after where they were produced without noticing that there already is a lovely New American Haggadah by Gila Gevirtz. It faithfully reproduces all the traditional text, but doesn't bother to give a WHY for anything. It carries a timeline across the top of each page to connect history and present, but there's no real reason for any aspect of that timeline to be tied to any particular page. It doesn't reflect when a piece came into the seder, for example. And at most seders I've been to where people actually take the time to ask questions or read side-texts, the population of the Jewish world in 500 BCE would have no relevance to the questions at hand. It wouldn't spark conversation, which in my opinion is what any additions to the traditional text should do. So, is it worth buying? Perhaps a single copy as a supplementary text. Some of the translations were interesting, and Lemony Snicket's rumination (pun intended) on the goat in Chad Gadya was entertaining. I wouldn't make it my primary haggadah for a seder, though. Ultimately, it's pretty, but lacks depth. At best, I would hope that it would frustrate others and convince them to continue their search for a haggadah that asks and answers and illuminates. ETA:Okay, the second seder I went to this year was a Maxwell House seder. It was an absolutely lovely traditional evening, of the sort where you read every line of every page without much question or comment or discussion. We were a seder of eight women, though, and what little extra conversation took place hinged upon the archaic translations (""giveth"" ""lifteth,"" et thetera) and the masculine language. The grace after meals starts with ""Gentlemen,"" for example. And one of the older women in our group - in her eighties, I think - told the apocryphal story of the orange on the seder with great gusto. I think all of these women would have loved Englander's more poetic translations, but they would have loved an inclusive translation even more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 06, 2012","Apr 06, 2012","Apr 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10833741-new-american-haggadah

I bought this directly from the author at the Baltimore Book Festival after listening to her speak at the SFWA booth. She was the only one on her panel to speak with any sense of history or context. I decided on the basis of that talk that I wanted to buy one of her books, and I chose this one because she had referenced it and it sounded like something I'd be interested in reading. She was kind enough to sell it to me for the remaining cash I had on hand, even though I was a few dollars short.On the surface, the book has several elements that appeal to me. It's about an ordinary guy who suddenly finds himself in possession of some pretty impressive powers. I like books in which mythology intrudes on modern life, such as Lisa Goldstein's Dark Cities Underground. I like superheroes. I like the idea of exploring what that power would ultimately mean for someone who suddenly found himself in possession of it. Clough does a good job at that last one in particular, exploring the dark side of superpower in a way that isn't often done.Unfortunately, I had some issues with the book that detracted from my full enjoyment. Some of it seemed a little overwritten, heavy on the adverbs and adjectives that are currently so out of vogue. The dialogue didn't always ring true. Both Rob and Edwin, while strong characters, seemed to converse a little anachronistically. A few too many ""Holy Mike!"" and golly and goshes for me to believe them as thirtysomething guys of the nineties. There were a few other characters who seemed to speak in constant exclamations.Despite those flaws, I thought it was well paced and well plotted. The central conceit was examined well.

I loved the way Rebecca's character loomed so large over the others that she is a constant presence despite her death before the start of the novel. I love the way Manderley takes on the role of a character, with its own moods and whims. Like Josephine Tey's Brat Farrar, Rebecca has a timeless feel despite the specific setting. The book is firmly anchored in a period and a class in which a man's hat (or lack thereof) says something about his character, in which letter writing and visiting are the chief concerns of the day, and in which a couple might reasonably be accommodated for a four course luncheon if they happened to stop in at that time. At the same time, the nameless narrator's voice and mannerisms - her nail-biting, her attentions on the dog when she wants to hide her emotions - make her come across like a modern girl of her age. Her desire to please and her insecurities about replacing Rebecca are perfectly in keeping with her background and her personality. The only thing that came across as truly dated was the narrator's occasional voicing of her perspective on her role in their marriage: she wanted to be wife and mother and daughter to Maxim de Winter, who is a little bit of a jerk himself. I found that extremely off-putting, but was willing to overlook it for the novel's overall strength. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 27, 2012","Apr 02, 2012","Mar 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50238.Rebecca

As he says in the second sentence of the novel, ""I think I was kidnapped from nineteen thirty-one and brought here [2002], and I think the aliens sent me back to put the whole human race in a box."" He is willing to accept that he may be crazy, but his clothing and fillings are period-appropriate, and he carries with him a seemingly-brand-new copy of Astounding Stories from 1931 (which has an odd role to play in the story as meta-commentary). He also wears a ring that he claims was given to him by the aliens, which causes anybody who comes in contact with it to acquiesce to his wishes: it seems the aliens (if they existed) were not unaware that his request might be met with skepticism. The ring works. All of this is provided to the reader in the first two chapters. This novel seems to have time traveled from an earlier age, much like its protagonist. It is almost as if Knight set himself the task of writing a Golden Age novel in the nineties. And yes, I realize that 1931 was pre-Golden Age. It may in fact want to be a pulp story like the one in Stone's copy of Astounding, but the pace is slower and the themes more complex. Still, all of the characters speak like they've stepped out of an earlier age. There's only one female character, and while her role is a large and participatory one, we aren't given a lot of insight into her driving forces. Then again, we don't see the driving forces behind many of the characters at all; even Stone is a cipher. The thing that most gives it its archaic feel is the technology. For a nineties projection of the early twenty first century there are some odd gaps in technology. At one point in the story DNA testing would have been mighty useful. I would rather have seen some line about how it had been outlawed instead of having it ignored. Minor complaint. The tone of the book is about what you would expect from something that is subtitled ""a comic novel of the destruction of the human race,"" and which is prefaced by quotes from both the Koran and the Marx Brothers. There's something pretty hilarious about Stone's forthrightness, and about the ways that people set about putting his plans in action. I think my favorite chapters involve a bunch of random talking head characters sitting around and debating logistics and marketing to get people into the Cube. It drags a bit in the final acts, and doesn't quite answer every question it puts forward, but I found it pretty satisfying. Ed Stone is a strange messiah, but these are strange times. If he's right we have about two more years.

It illuminates a North Korea that seems all too real, while telling the story of a man whose feats of survival would turn him into a folk hero in any other context. This is an excellent book but not easy or light reading. ETA: I keep thinking about the fact that Jun Do chooses his own identity from the beginning. Is he ever told he's the orphan master's son, or does he assume it because he gets the worst punishment? Which stories that he tells himself are true, and which are true enough to get him through the situation he faces? He plays many roles in this novel, some of which he chooses and some of which he is forced into. Through all of it, there is a theme of the stories people tell to get themselves through harsh realities. From early in the novel the protagonist is shown the machinery behind the magic. He harbors no illusions. That and his identity as the lowest of the low - an orphan, or a perceived orphan - allow him to what it takes to achieve his goals and maintain his own code of honor. In doing so, he attains mythic status himself. Only he and the reader are privy to the true story, and even that story is subject to question.

It's a strange thing reading a dystopian novel on public transportation. I read this book in its entirety on the bus from New York back to Baltimore. It's a strange thing reading a dystopian novel on public transportation. After every chapter I paused and looked around: at the cars traveling in both directions, obeying commonly accepted rules of the road; and at the forty five strangers sitting around me, all adopting a social contract in which we sit quietly for three hours, keep our own personal space, and leave others to their seats, their money, their food, their coats, their belongings. I thought about the home-compounds I've seen in South Africa, surrounded by high walls and razor wire, guarded by dogs, and how those do not make the walled community at the start of this novel such a stretch, even if the world outside those walls is not as bleak as the one depicted here. I tend to wade into dystopian novels carefully. My tendency to apply whatever I'm reading or listening to or watching to real life makes it a bad idea for me to read bleak books. The Road turned me into a hermit for weeks. Thankfully, Butler managed to weave a thread of hope into Parable of the Sower. It helped that the narrator, Lauren, is a teenager. She is pragmatic but not completely jaded. She has grown up in the world as it is, and doesn't harbor memories of the world as it was. There are many incidents in the book that were difficult to read, but I was too wound up in Lauren's story and had to keep going to find out what happened to her.There are actually a number of similarities between The Road and Parable of the Sower; so many that I can't help but wonder if McCarthy's book is in some way a response to this one. McCarthy's novel got far more attention, but I think Butler actually paints the more accurate picture of humanity, for good and for bad. ...more",Notes are private!,0,182,1,"Dec 17, 2011","Dec 18, 2011","Dec 18, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower

I borrowed them one by one from my high school library, and devoured each one regardless of my interest in the individual movies to which she referred. I joined the school newspaper, and tried my best to imitate her strange approach to her subject matter. This book didn't really do anything for me that Kael's own books didn't do better. It gave a little context for some of the s that I read out of time and out of place. It sketched out her biography, which didn't really add anything for me.

I think the fault lay more in the artwork than in her writing. It's very hard to tell some of the characters apart. Moments that on a TV show would have been big ""Whoa!"" were instead big ""Wait.

If I were rating on the artwork alone, I would give it four or five stars. Thompson's penwork is outstanding. He has grown as an artist over the course of his career, and he started at a pretty decent level too. Gorgeous design work, beautifully composed panels. Not Thompson's, but the hardcover edition is itself beautifully designed and a pleasure to hold.Unfortunately, I don't think the story is quite equal to the art. It's very good, probably better than my three star rating suggests. I had two issues. One was a failure to believe in a major plot element. (view spoiler)[I loved Dodola and Zam's relationship on the boat, her stories and her protection. I thought the changing nature of his feelings for her were well done. Unfortunately, I didn't believe that her feelings for him would change from nurturing to romantic. (hide spoiler)] My other issue was the author's obsession with the female form and absolute disgust with the male. Some of it made sense in the context, but as it seeped into the stories it felt like the injection of authorial opinion rather than a narrator's decision. Naked women at every turn, but the men were all discreetly hidden behind props, Austin Powers style. There's a delicate line at which the truth of the story can spill into salaciousness, and unfortunately Thompson crosses it. Lastly, though this wasn't truly a detraction, I thought it was interesting that the book began in what felt like a timeless storybook landscape but gradually pinned itself down to a strange throwback kingdom within the modern world. I felt absolutely unmoored as the trucks and tanks and highrises appeared in what earlier had seemed like a period setting. In the end I mostly just loved the stories that Dodola told Zam; I can't truly get on board with a book with this much sexual violence. I can say it was beautiful, but not that I enjoyed it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Feb 14, 2012","Feb 18, 2012","Oct 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10138607-habibi

I had heard great things about the Starman revival, but the truth is I wasn't invested in the original character. Actually, that's a silly excuse, since I didn't need to care about the original Sandman to fall in love with the 90s version. I guess the book didn't make me care enough. I did enjoy the character of Jack Knight, and the development of his relationships with his father and brother, but the villains seemed to come out of nowhere, and didn't get the same careful treatment.
