The characters were given a bit of background which I enjoyed and found made it easier to connect with them. My one largest complaint is it felt at points like there were too many characters to entirely keep track of everyone. My favorite part of the novel was basically unconnected to the plot, but rather a subtle detail. At one point Mike mentions how Bethany saved his life, not from a physical threat but by showing him acceptance for who he was. The metaphorical sense of saving someone is a theme I love to encounter in books. And in this case made me think of how powerful acceptance can truly be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 21, 2024","Mar 08, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58957615-the-bullet-that-missed

Merkel espionage, Berlin housing, East/West divides! There was such a wide range of topics which kept me interested as I read, never bogged down by intense descriptions. At certain point I thought chapters lost focus and could have been better organized. The economic history of Germany went over my head a bit. However, much of what I already knew was mentioned, expanded upon, and connected to larger Europe. Overall I enjoyed this book and feel that I did learn more about Germany!

I really liked learning more about the character Britt-Marie and her background. She was so unbelievably black-or-white about every decision, which made the book funny at certain points and feel slightly unrealistic at other points. The development of her relationship with the soccer team and people in Borg felt natural and was very sweet to read.

At the beginning I was not sure how the story would develop, but by the end I enjoyed each page. Francis as a character didn’t seem to know what kind of man he wanted to be, which I found aggravating at times and had mixed feelings towards him. Is he the sober one? Is he the loving husband?
