Young Javier could not tie his shoes and was terrified of using a toilet, but was sent on a harrowing journey to the US alone. Surprisingly, Zamora never questions why his family, which was clearly loving and supportive, decided he should travel then and not wait a few more years until he was stronger and more independent. Thankfully along the way he was taken in and cared for by a few fellow travelers, forming a surrogate family, and their compassion shone like lights in the dark of so much of this memoir. The level of detail in Zamora’s recollections was a strength and, in ways, at least for me, a weakness. The story moved incredibly slowly—of course the arduous journey was slow, so in ways perhaps the telling was meant to emphasize that— but the inclusion of each minute detail made it hard, at times, to stay connected to the narrative and even the emotions.

I was intrigued by the idea of a The Great Gatsby (which I love) retelling with queer, feminist, futuristic elements, and I appreciated how closely the author stuck to the Gatsby plot line for the majority of the novel. And, yes, I get the “twist,” but not how it was executed. Similarly to Gatsby, few to no characters are likable.

I loved the way the concept of this book made me uncomfortable and I especially liked how the protagonists are perspectives I haven’t run into before in YA lit: two teen boys (one is bisexual and Cuban, the other is gay and Puerto Rican, and I really liked that their sexualities and ethnicities are in no way the focus of the story. It’s just who they are) who are pulled together into a friendship that becomes intense quickly because of their openness and circumstance. What’s the circumstance? Death-Cast (which you can choose to subscribe to and is always accurate) informs them separately that today is their End Day, the day they’ll die. So what do you do, besides say plenty of painful goodbyes, in your last up-to-24 hours when you know it’s your last everything but still don’t know exactly when the clock will run out or how? You use the Last Friend app to connect with a stranger who’s in the same situation. This book is really about life more than death, and I enjoyed seeing Mateo & Rufus’s relationship bloom as they brought out the best in each other while packing as much as they can in one day while coming to terms with their fates. While I didn’t feel this book as much as I expected to and it kept throwing me that it’s set in 2017, not the future, I was glad for the uncomfortable constant reminder that today or any day could be our End Day, so why not truly live it?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 10, 2020","Jan 31, 2020","Jan 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33385229-they-both-die-at-the-end

I really like that this book is about the friendship between two boys, Luke and Toby, who were born poor and into circumstances that are continually against them. And although Toby is a brilliant outcast and Luke is a brilliant wrestler, the only real stability in their lives of chaos is each other. The novel opens with a letter from Luke. He’s on Death Row, clearly having committed a horrific crime but what he did isn’t revealed until the novel’s end. The narration begins what must be a few years earlier with the two teenage friends hanging out at an old airplane they found as children in the woods. That plane is their safe haven, the place where they can dream of flying from lives filled with abuse, neglect and struggle. However we know that despite their dreams and promises to each other, something awful will happen soon. Alternating between letters from prison in which Luke struggles to come to terms with what he’s done and how he can possibly find meaning in a life that will end in execution, and narration of a week of Luke and Toby’s lives in which so much goes right and so much goes terribly wrong, We’ll Fly Away shows how sometimes a series of decisions plus being born into truly crappy circumstances can lead to disaster. But it also shows that the hardest lives can have moments of beauty and joy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 13, 2019","Jan 25, 2019","Jan 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35959354-we-ll-fly-away

There’s a whole lot of love and affection and messiness of mixed messages and missteps by Coop, Jupiter, and Rae as all try to come to terms with their pasts and present identities. A few things I didn’t like: the really heavy “teen-speak” slang that was just trying too hard, even beyond the slang some of the voices felt contrived (like what person uses the word “comestibles” instead of food? And this wasn’t even from the character who was known for writing crosswords), I think all of the main characters should have been the same age (ranging from 15 to 18, and even 20 for another, with sex involved just feels wrong even though, sure, it happens in real life) and the book’s cover. It’s just bad. There’s a weirdly blue-tinted photo of three teenagers who are supposed to be the three main characters, and they just look all wrong.

Some are phenomenal: beautifully written, layered, and powerful for all readers, young or adult. Others, like this book, may not be great in the context of all books, but are engaging page turners and quick reads, especially for those who may not love reading so much. It's a classic kidnapping story in many ways, but what makes it more thrilling and interesting is the teen kidnapped is blind. Another aspect that adds a bit of complexity is the kidnapping was accidental and by another teenager whose life is filled with crime but it's not a life he chose.

And although it seems the program and schedule work for some parents and babies, I continually thought many of the authors' claims were bs. 98% success rate of sleeping through the night by week 12 was one. I also found something about the tone of this book off putting- almost like a patronizing preacher. Finally, much of the cited research and statistics just do not match what I found when searching online to see if they were true.

The plot, concept, and incredibly well researched details concerning the roles of two teenagers who become a pilot, a spy, and fast friends during WWII are fantastic. However, it took me ages to actually ""get into"" the book. Really, I wasn't hooked until at least 100 pages in.

I enjoyed the book for what it is: two stories juxtaposed which illustrate the immense challenges of what it was like to grow up in neighborhoods run by drugs and crime. However, one boy comes from an extended family with a history of college educations (and the job stability along with community connections those degrees afford) and the other comes from a family with fewer supports and a mom who tried hard to attain a degree but was unable. Because of these differences despite name, race, and general proximity, these lives aren't as comparable as the author makes them seem. However the two stories of divergent experiences are still important to read and may help inspire young readers of today by helping them reflect on and learn from each Wes Moore's experiences. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 28, 2016","Dec 29, 2016","Dec 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8377052-the-other-wes-moore

I was also looking for a bookI went into this book pretty blindly, hoping for something that would make me think and help me see things more clearly. I was also looking for a book that would be a good addition to my high school class library. I didn’t know much about Benjamin Watson besides that he was a great football player, but I hoped his relative fame and every-man athleticism might make the book appealing to students who wouldn’t pick it up otherwise. I wish I had done a little more research and knew going in how religious Watson is, and I also wish the blurb on the back were more forthcoming about how much of a Christian text this is.Watson shares some powerful stories and makes thoughtful, earnest points and connections, and he writes in an almost conversational way that is easy to read and would make this book accessible to my students. But I was frustrated by Watson’s proselytizing, and while I respect that religion may be the way many people are introspective and make powerful positive changes in their lives, I firmly disagree with Watson’s assertion through the book that it’s the only way. Every time he built to a point concerning a nuance of race or racism it led, eventually, to Jesus. It was hard for me to read that “It is only by the power of God that our hearts can be transformed from the inside out. It is only by the power of God that changed hearts will produce changed behavior and a changed society,” and that “only through our relationship with Jesus Christ will the earthly distinctions between us fade.” It’s the use of the word “only” so often through this book that frustrated me incredibly and make me realize this book is not so much about race relations but about Watson’s ministry. Prayer and religion are one way to be reflective and introspective. They are one way to goodness and action. They aren’t the only way, and I do wish the final assertion was not to “pray for God’s healing hand on America,” but a call for us to take action, to use OUR voices and minds and hands to make a change....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 22, 2020","Jun 28, 2020","Dec 26, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26167262-under-our-skin

Instead of transporting me and helping me feel the urgency, fear, and courage, I felt more that I was reading a textbook in the first person: names and events were listed (three frames on Emmett Till? Three on Rosa Parks?) and facts were shared, but beyond the feelings that always accompany learning about this time in history, I didn't feel further enlightened from reading this book.

The result is a book of transcripts, media clippings, photographs, and paintings that feels almost like a case file.

Over the course of a week each boy works to process his role, standpoint, culpability, and responsibility. To add complexity, they attend the same high school and have overlapping friends (although they don't know each other), and the young police officer who beat Rashad is almost a surrogate father to Quinn. The writing is clean and the message concerning racism and the responsibility for all to take a stand and not be bystanders is clear. But that's my problem with this novel: while it is excellent to engage young readers of all races in such an important topic, the writing is incredibly preachy. While reading I never felt lost in the lives of the characters but was acutely aware that I was continually being taught a lesson. The best books transport you and make you feel as you work to understand and gain empathy through emotion. I would have loved to have moments through the eyes and voice of the young police officer to help me understand why he did what he did and how he felt in the aftermath. I would have loved to have more ambiguity in a few places to help me empathize with where he was coming from. Instead, from the first chapter, he was clearly the one in the wrong. Because of this, I don't think many of those who believe ""blue lives matter"" or ""all lives matter"" would be open to this novel. That said, the reality of racism and the responsibility for all to take a stand against it is a vital lesson to learn, and if American Boys can open some minds and start conversations, I think it's done what it set out to do. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Aug 07, 2019Dec 20, 2016","Aug 15, 2019Dec 26, 2016","Jan 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25657130-all-american-boys

Dana is a young black woman with a white husband, Kevin, living in 1976. On her birthday, she has the first of many uncontrollable (until she figures out how to somewhat control them) time travel experiences to the antebellum South where she quickly learns she has a cosmic-type connection to a young future plantation owner, who is also her distant relative. She is tied to this complicated young man in ways that she wishes she weren't and as a woman of the modern world must navigate the world of slavery. This concept is incredibly cool and I did wonder how it would be resolved (despite sort of beginning with the ending); however, while I found the characterization of the myriad people she grew to know in the past interesting, this book didn't have a whole lot of emotional resonance for me, in the sense that while I did, of course, feel horrible about the horrific mistreatment of many of the characters in the time of slavery, I didn't feel a true connection with any of them or Dana....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Aug 09, 2022Jan 18, 2016","Aug 21, 2022Jan 25, 2016","Jan 09, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60931.Kindred

Of course the story itself, of a young man with so much promisI'm glad I read this book, but as badly as I feel saying this, I expected more from it. Of course the story itself, of a young man with so much promise in the prime of his life being struck by terminal cancer and trying to live well for as long as he can with the disease, is a tragic story worth telling. I had heard that this book was inspirational, beautifully written, and a profound reflection on life and death. But after I finished the book none of those descriptors rung fully true for me. I'm sad that the book is a fragment, which is of course symbolic of Paul's life. And for me, the last passage he wrote in the manuscript (about his infant daughter) was the most poignant, the one that felt most true. When I realize that, I realized what the book was missing for me: depth of emotion. I think if Paul had the benefit of time and the benefit of working closely with an editor he would have gotten the feedback to loosen up, to tell the truth of his fears, his disillusions, his resonant sadness. But instead, I think Paul was fighting against time to chronicle his life, to show us why it wasn't fair that he was going to die and not live to see the future he had prepared so long for. At times Paul seemed arrogant to me, reminding me as a reader over and over how talented he is, how hard he worked. And I think an editor would have helped him write past that need to tell instead of letting us feel along with him. I was diagnosed with lung cancer in my early 30's, and I was much more lucky than Paul with a stage 2 rather than a horrific stage 4 diagnosis. I was treated, and I have (so far) lived. But I know what it feels like to have your life change in a moment: your relationship with time, with your body, with your sense of self, and so much more, changes. You feel absolutely betrayed by your own cells and you feel that everything that was so sure is now unsure for ever again. As I read, I kept waiting for Paul to put into words, better than I can, that feeling. I kept waiting to feel his pain, to feel the agony, and to feel the way he transformed those into purpose. I saw it, in a way, through his attempts to work and his attempt to write this book, but in his writing he held back. He never let the reader fully inside, and instead focused on more of the superficial while occasionally cracking into a true, resonant, emotional voice, like in the final passage about his daughter.It wasn't until the epilogue, written by his widow Lucy, that I truly felt this book. Lucy wrote more plainly and truly than her husband. She let me see and feel the truth that he obscured with his detailed stories of surgeries and accomplishments.

The pacing was quick, and I appreciated that each brief chapter is marked by a time that progressively move to (and past) the 2 A.M. of the book's title which mark's the novel's climax. The characters are likable, especially aspiring young singer Madeline and her teacher Sarina, but with the quick perspective shifts they can be difficult to get to know and connect with. In many ways, too, this novel felt that it was trying too hard to be coy. I was irritated, not amused, by the repetition of lines that clearly Bertino though were good enough to re-use, verbatim, multiple times in the work and similarily irritated by her lifting of and slight twisting of lines from other writers' works. Lifting the brilliant last line from a masterpiece like The Great Gatsby and plopping it into the middle of your novel with no allusion to where its pilfered from? Ugh.

Ingrid’s journal entries and sketches, found posthumously by her best friend Caitlin whose world was shattered by this unexpected loss at the end of her sophomore year, are full of longing and ultimately emptiness as they punctuate Caitlin’s journey to find meaning, establish new relationships and reconnect with the old.

I think that’s what I liked most about this book—it’s not perfect, but it’s really, really good, and it rang true. Be sure, too, to read the Author’s Note at the end.

This book is so gripping and powerful that at times I had to put it down to give myself some mental breathing room and other times (like when I just read for two straight hours to finish) it was impossible to turn away from. Over and over I had to remind myself that this epic family drama was real. I kept wondering how the author possibly got the details and gained these people's confidences. In the afterward and through the writing itself it is clear that she spent over ten years as a friend, confidant, and observer and had intense respect and empathy for the men, women, and children whose lives she painted with beauty and pain in Random Family's pages. It's an engaging, exhausting, and eye-opening read. I kept rooting for Coco, Jessica, Mercedes, Serena, Milagros, and the men in their lives and now that the book is over for me, I miss them. I optimistically hope they're well, but as Random Family shows, there are so many obstacles that can make the smallest triumphs extraordinary but fleeting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 24, 2015","Dec 31, 2015","Jan 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/385255.Random_Family

The Red House I like to slip into the world of a book, almost effortlessly, and let the characters, places, observations, and conflicts wash over me. The Red House is not that type of book. At least at first. You have to work hard for the reward, too hard I think, and that's this novel's major fault. The premise is simple and interesting: two families that are actually more than two families and only one family at the same time (think stepfathers, estranged siblings) go on a week's vacation together in an attempt to rekindle fractured relationships. Of course, things do not go as smoothly at the characters may have hoped. The problem is the extreme fragmentation of the narration. Yes, having each small section (sometimes only a paragraph) from a different character's perspective in third person limited omniscient form emphasizes Haddon's major point that even when together we are alone and it is impossible to fully understand each other, but the constant shifts feel tumultuous and the first half of the book was exhausting. However, sticking with it has rewards. Eventually it is less difficut to center yourself with each narrative shift, and there are interesting overlaps in the perspectives. The novel echoes with melancholia and moments of light. I especially enjoyed the view of eight year old Benjy-- Haddon captures his view of the world and that of adults through his eyes beautifully and with humor....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 22, 2013","Feb 24, 2013","Feb 22, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12878667-the-red-house
