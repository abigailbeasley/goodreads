I’ll start with the good; this book really leans into being “dark” adult fantasy and puts an original spin on a very malleable and open-ended fairy tale. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the darker elements, veering into candy-coated horror at times.Some criticisms that I have would be; that the plot meanders, the character arcs are predictable, and the limited perspective of Natasha the “dark twin” harms the storytelling, because her jealousy toward her sister Clara comes across as annoyingly bitter- and gets old fast. Also, the horrible historical fiction turn towards the end…. and the surface-level commentary on the Russian Revolution… yikes that was so bad....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 09, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Nov 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123176586-the-kingdom-of-sweets

However, I did find myself wishing that the arguments Klein presents in here were more even-handed and grounded in reason. So much of her framing of “disaster capitalism” is hinged on anecdotes and emotional appeals- and what is most frustrating for me is that it didn’t need to be this way. Don’t get me wrong, some of the anecdotes and insights provided are spot-on…. but it sucks that these valid critiques of Friedmanism are mixed up with so many lies and half-truths that only serve to weaken the overall argument. Klein’s insights were cutting-edge at the time, but in retrospect feel shoddy and under-researched, and she bombards us with so many global problems while failing to prescribe any workable solutions....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 15, 2023","Apr 07, 2024","Nov 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1237300.The_Shock_Doctrine

This book specifically focuses on the time period between the beginning of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) up to the election of Hamas in Gaza (2006). It includes commentary on the U.S. role in legitimizing the “War on Terror” (in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East) and how it changed the political dynamics in Israel in regards to the Palestinians. It also speaks a lot to the moral bankruptcy and ultimate decline of the Zionist Left in Israel- and how it subsequently facilitated in disastrous and blatantly genocidal actions taken by the Israeli government since the turn of the century. I wouldn’t say that this is the most comprehensive account of the conflict to exist, but it posits some important ideas and presents an incisive political history that offers important context for current Israeli bombardement of Gaza....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 15, 2023","Dec 17, 2023","Nov 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1143611.Between_the_Lines

A fun fantasy romp that is really well plotted and features some really memorable characters. I definitely want to read more of Michael J. Sullivan’s Riyria world. Sure, this is far from the most “original” fantasy worlds- my biggest criticism would be that some moments felt a bit too familiar. Nonetheless, I personally found this series to be wayyyyy more appealing than Robert Jordan’s WoT books (for example) mostly just because the themes are more interesting and characters are more dynamic....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 09, 2023","Nov 28, 2023","Nov 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26863057-age-of-myth

Julia Fox is a fantastic writer- and despite being only 33 years old and only very recently becoming famous, it seems as though she’s lived many lifetimes as she describes her time as a dominatrix/sex worker, a recovering drug addict, and her unlikely rise to fashion icon status, all with astute wisdom. With Down the Drain, Fox’s unique insights into womanhood (shaped by her experience growing up poor and unruly in New York City in the time of late-stage capitalism) comes to the light and reveals her to be so much more than a momentary meme or an air-headed caricature. This one is a must-read (especially for the girls and gays).“Sometimes you have to say fuck it and throw your life down the drain just to see where you’ll come out on the other side. The most profound beauty emerges from the ashes of destruction. And by that, I mean that sometimes you have to burn your life to the ground in order to experience the life that is truly meant for you. It is in letting go that we are forced to carve our own destiny. We must be willing to relinquish all we once held dear if we are holding on with fear. If you believe in the power within yourself, anything is possible. Because the truth is, anyone who is ‘someone’ first started out as a delusional dreamer.”...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 25, 2023","Nov 16, 2023","Sep 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123183412-down-the-drain
