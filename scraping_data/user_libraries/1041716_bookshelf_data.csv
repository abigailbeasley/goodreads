Barry's flood of words make you feel every raindrop, surge and swell, which might make you wish for escape as did the victims in its path. (But you can't and wind up feeling waterlogged at best.)

This is especially pertinent as I live in a region wooing Amazonia II and its 50,000 highly paid, highly educated, but possibly brainwashed, and likely obnoxious workforce. Having read and enjoyed Eggers before, I am surprised that the writing is so baggy. It suffers from a surfeit of asides and subplots.

And it's hard to caThe Band was of outsized influence given its relatively small recording output and only one certifiably classic album ""The Band""). And it's hard to call them influential as they bucked the psychedelic/heavy metal trends of the day with their rootsy, literate storytelling music that featured accordions, mandolins, and haiku-tight guitar solos. At the time they were almost a curious (if incredibly talented with a dozen indelibly great songs) anachronism only cited as influential much later by bands like Counting Crows. They also helped made rock culturally respectable when they landed on the cover of Time magazine in 1969. But in other respects The Band was everywhere and most especially in the thick of Bob Dylan's electric revolution that created folk rock. The Band backed up Dylan's first full-blown electric tour and had to endure the jeers, boos, catcalls and outright threats made by folk purists during a worldwide tour. (In addition, Dylan was essentially a solo artist and had to learn how to lead and play with a band.)Somewhat curiously, Robertson focuses the book on the first 33 years of his life leading up to and including their final Last Waltz concert, memorialized in Martin Scorcese's flawed but wonderful film of 1978. I'm still debating whether this was a good choice, but probably yes. We are spared Robertson trying to breath life and significance into his later works (a couple of pretty good solo albums and film scores) and moreover the tragic declines of his bandmates Richard Manuel (suicide), Rick Danko (died in sleep at age 56), and Levon Helm (cancer)--verily the voices of The Band as Robertson limited himself to writing, brilliant guitar fills, and background vocals. Also he only hints at the decline of his marriage. Thus he avoids one weakness of Keith Richards' ""Life"": Keith's attempts to make us care about the recording of ""Bridges of Babylon,"" duets with Ronnie Wood, and details of his later domestic happiness in a Connecticut mansion. On the other hand, Robertson's 1976 curfew makes for an oddly impersonal narrative; it's a more novelistic, neatly tied up ending that omits the wages of years of substance abuse, and the ultimate outcomes of the ""band of brothers"" The Band became. Robertson's wacky family history (half-native American, half Jewish mobsters in Toronto) makes for a good intro. The formative years touring with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks are a bit protracted but they do explain how four Canadians slowly annexed a Southern rock and roll roadhouse band while the Deep South seeped into their bones (and Robertson's lyrics), leading to classics like ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" and ""Unfaithful Servant."" Musicians will especially enjoy Robertson's detailed account of the recording process, which The Band upended by rejecting sound baffles, isolation chambers, and overdubs. Essentially they chose to record live; at least for their first two albums, which sound as though they were made in a pine-panelied living room. (Despite the woodsy, Upstate New York vibe of The Band's eponymous album, it was recorded in LA, in a retrofitted house once owned by Sammy Davis Jr.)Somewhat disappointing are the (perhaps inevitable) show-biz trappings of the narrative. Names are dropped like notes in a self-indulgent solo, from Jimmy Carter all the way down to Larry Hagman. Band-members who dressed like sharecroppers bought Mercedes 600 limos with rear curtains. Refreshingly though, Bob Dylan emerges as a real character, pretty much a normal guy who drives a blue station wagon and dotes on his wife and kids (granted this was the ""New Morning"" phase). As other ers have observed, Robertson's storytelling skills are excellent (if too frequently self-serving) and the writing highly uneven. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2017,"Jan 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25982551-testimony

Unfortunately it's all true and people really dieDays of Rage reads like a thriller full of shoot-em-up scenes, jailbreaks, and hair-raising escapes. Unfortunately it's all true and people really died in a 10-year scourge of bombings and shootings by the radical underground--Weatherman, Panthers, Symbionese, Puerto Rican Liberation Front and more. Although Burroughs clearly sympathizes with the innocent cops, Brinks drivers, cabbies, and others who were slaughtered, the book does not dodge the moral question of when acts of terror may in fact be justified as acts of war. This issue dogs us today as we face many outbursts of terrorism globally. What are oppressed people to do when they are unrepresented with no political options for change, or a moral imperative to take any means necessary to stop wrong-doing at the top or rife throughout society? I abhor attacks on abortion clinics, Tel Aviv buses, Parisian cafes, etc., but you can understand the twisted logic that leads to such drastic and tragic action. That said, Burroughs portrays many of the terrorists as rich kids playing dangerous games (Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dorhn come to mind), corrupt, or perhaps deluded or deranged (the Patty Hearst-kidnapping SLA). Fascinatingly, much of this history has been forgotten, even by folks like me, who came of age in this era, and lived in the prime targets of DC and NYC. Also interesting, much of the action occurred well after American radicalism peaked (probably 1968-70) and certainly after it plunged as the Vietnam War wound down and ended. To the end, the Radical fringe was sure it would ignite a violent, grassroots uprising. As interviewed by Burroughs, many Radical survivors today recognize the errors of their thinking. It might be comforting to know that their numbers were tiny. Often fewer than 10 people supporting an entire organization with only two or three trigger-pullers and bomb-planters at the core. Gaining even one recruit was cause for celebration. It makes you wonder how many violent radical Islamic operatives exist. Less comforting, it only takes a couple of folks with bombs and machine guns to make the appearance of a large fand well-organized network--part of the ""beauty"" of terrorism.The FBI and other law-enforcement agencies agreed the saw a threat writ large. They spent years and countless resources trying to track down ringleaders with surprisingly little success. Famously they resorted to dirty tricks like illegal wiretaps and burglaries, which backfired when agents (including Richard ""Deep Throat"" Felt) were indicted and convicted, receiving somewhat harsher sentences than the few radicals who were tracked down or surrendered (although others received life sentences or were shot dead in the streets).The book's most original take is its exploration of what it truly meant to go underground, a topic not previously researched or reported, according to Burroughs. For the Weatherman, it often meant cushy living in rented beach houses, supported by Radical Chic lawyers. For true tough guys like ex-con Ray Lavasseur, it meant faked IDs using the socials of dead infants and constantly moving between ratty ""safe houses"" while also raising semi-normal families replete with Montessori school educations. Others split for Algeria or Cuba. After I wrote this , I checked others and was surprised to see some so negative. I agree that Burroughs is no left-wing apologist for violent radicals, but neither is this book a Fox-like hatchet job. Clearly he admires the intelligence and perhaps even the moral position of at least some of his subjects. Others were deluded buffoons or trigger-happy charlatans, and he says so. A key pivot of the book is the internal debate between symbolic acts of terror (blowing up empty bathrooms in government buildings at 2 am, for example), vs. overt ""kill the pigs"" mindset of hunting down cops, or ""you can't avoid the collateral of war"" (eg, killing innocent bystanders). Interesting that some who inadvertently killed innocent bystanders continued to engage in acts of terror. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2016","Apr 24, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22571602-days-of-rage

The proliferation of characters and Byzantine plot also make the book hard to follow; despite some memorable characters, there are just too many of them. Hallberg was born about three years after the time the book is set and he manages to include numerous anachronisms that uncut ""City on Fire""'s attempts at gritty realism.

In 1962-64, Motown and the Mustang were king. The city of 1.7 million was considered a paragon of economic equality and (relative) racial harmony. Detroit made a strong bid and was a serious candidate to host the 1968 summer Olympics. Martin Luther King came to town for a huge and peaceful march in which he tried out a draft of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech that seemed to destined to make history until the Lincoln Memorial gathering made Detroit a footnote. This colorful, entertaining book focuses on a few main characters--Henry Ford II (""the Deuce""), Walter Reuther, the Rev. CL Franklin (Aretha's dad, a legendary pulpit preacher), Lee Iacocca, George Romney, and Berry Gordy among them. But it also sprawls and loses focus with too many minor characters. The Motown story has been told many times and, much as I love classic Motown, takes up too much of the book. Still, this is well worth reading.

Most famous for his work with the Stones, Johns worked with them all including the Beatles, Clapton, Led Zepp, Emmy Lou Harris and lots of minor figures such as Spooky Tooth and the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. This makes Johns a bit of a Zelig as well as perhaps the only coherent person in the room (he claims to have never taken drugs) most of the time. Refreshingly, Johns does not take credit for the success of his employers, truly viewing himself in a conduit to let the talent shine through with empathetic sound. We've all read/seen too many ""I-was- the-REAL-genius"" books/docs about producers, film editors, backup singers or even a particular sound board. Johns keeps his story and considerable contribution to the side, where it belongs. Although I enjoyed reading this, the book has several glaring weaknesses. One is the lack of insight into the process of making music. This is especially surprising as Johns himself is a fairly accomplished musician who recorded several albums and supposedly had a minor hit in Spain with a cover of ""Lady Jane."" There are refreshing exceptions such as his decision to record Pete Townsend playing live amid a cluster of 60 string players for the Townsend-Ronnie Wood Album ""Rough Cut."" Another is his lamentation for the passing of semi-live recording sessions for the studio overdub process that recording musicians one at a time in isolation sound booths. His sympathetic portrayal of Brian Jones is a treat. Another weakness is Johns's show-biz, nice-nice glibness: ""He was a lovely chap and unfailingly polite and I regret I did not see him before he died,"" etc., repeated over and again about many different major and minor characters. (Occasionally he mentions not getting on with someone but at about the same level of detail). Johns himself remains a cipher. You just don't learn much about him beyond a good yarn about accidentally breaking into the industry and references to one or two marriages. The book is neither critical analysis, soul-baring or kiss and tell, so what is it? This pales in comparison to Keith Richards's literate and insightful ""Life,"" for example. Really just a long chat with a charming old dude. I give it four stars for enjoyment but two for content.

This book seems original in its take that the Paris we love is an intentional creation of the 17th (not the 19th) century. I'd add a star for urban planning geeks; others may be less excited about the etymology of the sidewalk There's lots of social history intertwined that helps explain Parisian fascination with food and fashion, but you sometimes get the sense of the author trying to shove every social invention into the context of urban design (I will prove my thesis, I will!) or simply going on too long. Update: What I learned (if you buy what the author is selling):Paris/Parisians invented the sidewalk, public transit, department store, fashion trends and industry, postal service, department store, and the entire idea of public space. At one time in the 1700s, there were far more purveyors of luxury goods in Paris than everyday tradesmen like glaziers. Based on the export of luxury goods (as well as protectionist policies), France ran huge trade surpluses. Occupy Place Vendome! France and Paris gave rise to the first class of get-rich-quick financiers. They were made possible by French kings running up massive war deficits; thus the financiers were needed to finance the debts. They built gaudy townhouse palaces on Place Vendome and were generally derided in the press, on the stage in French farces and also through new terms like parvenu and nouveau riche. Also occasionally subject to protest and even personal attack.Paris also gave rise to the first class of real estate developers (thank you, today I have a job) who built the townhomes around Place des Voges, Place Vendome, and numerous neighborhoods. Even then developers were widely hated. The author's most interesting ideas connect the development of public space to the rapid evolution of Paris as a center of fashion and style. If you follow the author's logic, Paris created places for and introduced the concept of walking for pleasure on clean, well-designed, lighted and connected streets. People seen in public needed to look good, which upped the ante for public dress inspired by the aristocracy and even royalty. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Aug 2014,"Jul 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17978088-how-paris-became-paris

The authors are Quebecoise sociologists who went to FranThis book was a useful (if overly detailed) companion for my first trip to France in decades. The authors are Quebecoise sociologists who went to France to write one book and came back with another. Fascinated by the idiosyncracies of French culture, they write about social mores, the educational system, politics, immigration, race, the French economy, and the dark psychological after effects of World War II and the Algerian conflict. Sloppiness is a weakness. At one point the authors contend that Charles DeGaulle was from Belgium (he was born in Lille, France) and in another instance place the city of Bordeaux East of the Pyrenees (it is almost as far west as the Atlantic). Catching those two woofies made me suspicious of the accuracy of other details.Still I learned lots and it helped me navigate France with a greater appreciation and enjoyment of the French (hint: apologize for your poor or nonexistent French first; be polite; and you will be repaid in kind with kindness). What I learned (according to the authors' narrative):--The French do not officially track the demographics of race or ethnicity. They have a longstanding policy of considering colonists French which has led to free immigration from Algeria and Africa in particular). Yet they have hardly mainstreamed all their ethnic strains. The Muslim slums of Paris are but one notorious example.--During the Nazi invasion of WWII, the French were hardly the cheese-mongering surrender monkeys of lore. In fact they fought hard (if briefly) and suffered 130,000 casualties. The fall of Belgium simply left their flank too exposed.--On the other hand the Resistance is a bit of a myth. It existed but hardly with the widespread participation of most Frenchmen. One estimate places their number at 200,000 from a population of 40 million or so. The brutality of the Nazi occupation had its effect of creating fairly submissive collaboration. The French certainly suffered under the occupation. Their GDP fell 80 percent and perhaps 75% of the Jewish population was exported to the gas chambers--Anti-semitism (latent or otherwise) remains a strain of French culture. Bigoted right-wing parties (who are generally anti-immigration) average 20 percent in national elections--Central gov't control is almost absolute. For example, there are no local school districts or boards. Schools are essentially federal. The idea is to create all schools as equal. Doesn't seem to work, though. It's still hard to get good teachers to work in bad areas like the Paris slums, and the local schools can be dreadful.--The central gov't is also huge; it accounts for 56% of GDP. Small business taxes can be as high as 66%. Still the French enjoy a good standard of living with universal health care and life expectancy of 81 (exceeds US)--They live long with good health despite chain smoking and consuming an average of one pound of animal fat per day --The Mayor of Paris is treated like royality. He (generally, he) gets to live in the palatial Hotel de Ville (near the Centre Pompidou) and enjoys a substantial slush fund for ""discretionary"" spending-- The French are generally indulgent toward their politicians. Scandals (especially sex scandals) get a wink rather than an impeachment process; politicians can hold multiple offices. You can be mayor of Paris and President at the same time (I believe Jacques Chirac did this)--Strikes are so frequent that are are scheduled and posted in newspapers--Strikes often involve posturing rather than staking a legitimate (or even specific) position or demand. In one famous case, transit workers went on strike after a transit worker was ""killed"" in a confrontation with a turnstile jumper. The strikers demanded greater protection for union workers, and drew sympathy strikes from other unions. Within a day or two, it came to light that the dead transit worker had a heart condition and died of a heart attack not related to the turnstile jumper. The transit union issued no apology; it simply changed its position to demanding ""better working conditions."" All told, I learned lots from this book but could have used shorter chapters and less detail on such strictly local matters as school administration and town government. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 15, 2014","Aug 10, 2014","Jul 15, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27584.Sixty_Million_Frenchmen_Can_t_Be_Wrong

In the late 1970s, A young woman artist who has a fascination with motorcycles falls in with two groups of political radicals. One is based in foreclosure-era New York City band of avant-garde and conceptual artists. The other is an Italian group of working-class, armed radicals taking part in kidnappings as well as a violent March on Rome. Both portrayals are rooted in real events and organizations of the time--in NY, the minimalists, conceptualists, posers, and hangers-on at the Chelsea Hotel; in Italy, the Red Brigade related to the kidnapping/murder of Aldo Moro and the bombing of the Bologna train station.Aside from Kushner's concrete, vivid and often funny writing style, what drew me in was her seemingly neutral attitude toward her subjects. She does not inflect sympathy, empathy or irony about her characters. Many are rude, obnoxious and pretentious, but also occasionally brilliant, principled, and sensitive. Kushner has the rare ability to let the reader decide what's going on, who to like or hate. She also excels at evoking the sense of place in grungy NY and Rome, or for that matter the ungrungy Italian Lake District.This would be a five-star book if not for Kushner's surprisingly wan portrait of her central character Reno, who often narrates as well. Although adventurous enough to ride a motorcycle at 150 mph on the Salt Flats as part of an art project, Reno often seems a pawn to manipulative men. Her boyfriend Sandro, creator of Donald Judd-like minimalist boxes and the reluctant scion of Italian industrialists, is much more sharply drawn and ultimately more empathetic. It seems odd that a female writer can get so deeply into the male psyche but not her own gender. Perhaps Reno is more observer than participant, but it leaves the book's core a bit hollow. The stunning conclusion reads like the ending of the greatest Antonioni movie never made. Told in a series of historical flashbacks, her depiction of the Italian Futurists is highly topical given a current retrospective in New York. Along withe NY setting and the focus on art and art history, there are several other serendipitous parallels with The Goldfinch that make this an excellent companion.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 03, 2014","Feb 23, 2014","Feb 03, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803141-the-flamethrowers

She is brave author for a) tackling the male perspective (difficult for either gender to cross over) and b) for giving us an initially sympathetic character who's morality erodes (badly) during the book. At the end we ask: Do we root for Theo, or is he just a little shit? And why does that matter?

WRecently I saw the documentary film ""Dirty Wars,"" which claimed that the US is engaged in covert anti-terrorist military operations in 75 countries. Whether that number is correct or not, this book explains how the US gets entangled and what spooks (military or otherwise) really do. Bowden's book is apolitical and somewhat amoral on this subject, but it does raise tough questions: what would you do in the face of abject evil? Would you (as a person or a society) have the courage to stand up, even when that evil threatened to blow up you and shoot down one of your kids on their way to school? Is crossing the line into ""exra-legal"" (eg, illegal) activities justified when that evils engages in international terrorism, political assassinations, and even threatens foreign governments?Of course it is also the story of the world's greatest outlaw, Pablo Escobar, the Colombian coke-smuggling king of the 1980s. A chubby soccer-playing pothead with a calm, soothing and even mesmerizing style of speech, Pablo came from modest, middle-class roots. From a small-time, car-nicking thuggery, he grew a $5 billion empire that included dozens of homes in Colombia and Miami, a huge staff including the vicious sicarios (hit men), and essential ownership (through bribery and intimidation) of hundreds if not thousands of politicians, judges, police and military men. When challenged Pablo would not hesitate to gun down or blow up his rivals, whether they were judges, military commanders, and even a popular anti-narco presidential candidate. He also went after the families of all of the above.Meanwhile Pablo himself threw Gatsby-scaled parties at his Medellin estate stocked with exotic game-park wildlife. Those who displeased him might wound up hog-tied and thrown into the pool to drown while Pablo and guests laughed ruefully.He became a media celebrity whose every move was covered like an Onassis and successfully ran for Congress although he held the seat briefly.The burgeoning cocaine scene in the US made Pablo and his largesse possible. Behind Nancy Reagan's ""Just So No"" slogans where Reagan administration officials seriously worried that cocaine would destabilize our society (you could argue this came true with the crack wars a few years later). The US avoided confronting Pablo until Escobar made a pact with Colombia's communist guerrillas in an effort to control trafficking routes in the jungle. This brought anti-communist special ops into play who worked closely with US ambassador Busby and with Colombian officials.Confronted with this alliance of power, Pablo turned to the people and presented himself as a modern-day Robin Hood or Bonnie and Clyde. His system of cocaine trafficking simply redistributed wealth from foolish, coke-nosed Gringos into a Colombia desperate for investment. Colombia grows lots of cacao and Gringos will buy it for a high price. Simple, yes? Pablo appealed directly to the people through the media but also cozied to the Catholic church and built public housing projects and soccer fields.The hunt for Pablo escalated into an all-out covert war with thousands killed. Pablo ordered massive bombing of public buildings and places while his sicarios gunned down hand-picked enemies. At one point he blows up a commercial airliner with Americans on board. The first President Bush considered himself a potential target for assassination.In a bizarre twist, Pablo eventually turned himself in under the condition he would plead guilty to a relatively minor charge and be able to live in a prison he constructed himself and furnished with whores, waterbeds and high-end audio equipment. Eventually Pablo goes underground and a protracted electronic hunt begins. Bowden does a great job of describing the internecine disputes among the supposedly cooperating covert ops both Colombian and American.The book's weakness is that this story needs more streamlining and pruning. There are simply too many characters and subplots to track. And since the book begins with the ending, some of the storytelling feels anticlimactic and limp.Also there is a direct link between US intervention and Colombia's improved circumstances today, where cities like Bogota and Medellin are celebrated as vibrant cultural outposts rather than feared. Did this end justify the means? That would be the subject of another book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Aug 17, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/419083.Killing_Pablo

As other ers note, the book is a competent but dry and colorless retelling of 500 years of Argentine history from A to Z. For example, we learn a lot about Juan Peron (and Evita) and their policies, but very little about them as people with character, motivation. How did Peronism (a quasi-fascistic melding of populism and military rule, somewhat recalling Huey Long's Louisiana) come to be? We'll never know from reading this book. While I am no jingo-ist, this book made me appreciate being an American. At least our history has a founding story with an arc, some underlying values, and a constant sense of course correction. Yes we had slavery and bigotry; we suppressed women; we raped the environment, and fought unjust wars. Yet counter-movements have attempted to address each of these with some real progress achieved through blood and sweat but also through progressive thought, politics, compromise. Argentina's tale reads like a series of weak thrusts and counter-thrusts between quasi- (if corrupt) democracy and military rule. While we US Americans fret about a long, slow decline, Argentina has experienced just in the last 31 years:--An embarrassing home-team loss in the Faulkland War--A significant guerrilla/terrorist movement with up to 650 public bombings, kidnappings, etc. a year--The countervaling Dirty Wars in which the military government tortured and ""disappeared"" thousands of citizens--Hyperinflation of up to 3,000 percent a year, which resulted in looting raids on supermarkets --The biggest-ever government loan default to the IMF in 2001--An economy that has (over a couple of generations) plunged from 7th to 67th worldwide--30 percent poverty rate--The growth of a huge ""cartonero"" class--people who drag (with their bodies) U Haul-sized trailers around Buenos Aires picking up recyclables--A reversal of immigration from Europe, which once rivaled the numbers coming through Ellis Island Again, not to be too smug, but this does make me appreciate living in a country that, despite its many excesses, moral shortcomings, and pecadillos, is relatively stable, reliable, safe, and yet creative, forward-looking, attractive to people from around the world, and growing. Argentina is blessed with an educated populace, many natural resources, a beautiful capital city. I hope they turn it around. Bizarre sidenote in the ""what I learned"" department: Argentine terrorists seem fascinated with graverobbing and in some cases severing the hands of noted citizens, including Evita and Che Guevara.In a calculated political maneuver, Evita's corpse ""disappeared"" in Europe for 17 years. This backfired by inciting a rebel movement in which revolutionaries kidnapped and killed Argentina's military leader.

The one problem is a big one: the vacant hole of the central character, Alan Clay, an aging salesman sent to make an IT pitch to the King of Saudi Arabia. Clay's career went down with Schwinn bicycles, his marriage has imploded, and his tenuous relationship with his daughter is limited to fragmentary, self-pitying letters he cannot finish. Furthermore he is haunted by the avoidable drowning death of a neighbor and a mysterious fleshy growth that clings to his neck, which is also being breathed down by creditors (hey, give me credit for trying with that last sentence). A presentation tent in King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC, a real place I had never heard of) provides his last chance to pull his life together.

That gives Clay the modern-day Willy Loman time and opportunity to escape the sweaty tent and to (accidentally) probe the mysteries of a Saudi society torn between the 11th and the 21st centuries. Many other vivid and colorful characters populate this book and Eggers is a wonderful and straightforward storyteller. If Alan Clay is not too soft a character for you (and you will know within 50 pages), take this worthwhile trip to the desert sands. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2013","Jul 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13722902-a-hologram-for-the-king

Saunders is particularly expert at capturing the way average (or sub-average) people speak (and write, as some of his short stories are written as journal entries), and then throwing in a nasty little dystopian sci-fi touch about mind-controlling drugs or third-world women who volunteer to become yard ornaments rather than be sold into sex slavery. It's like Ray Carver meets The Office meets Philip K. Dick. Although guffaw-out-loud funny, his writing feels a deep undertow of sadness about folks who have lost opportunties, but perhaps never had the position, looks or smarts to even glimpse an opportunity from a distance. I detracted one star because of the disjointed title story; easily the weakest of the collection. I will now find and read more George Saunders. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13641208-tenth-of-december

Katrina fatigue"" was the consensus response. Still I felt obligated to read Nine Lives as the author is a neighbor and slight acquaintance. A couple of things held me back. One was ... Katrina fatigue. Also I had never visited New Orleans and regretted that I missed my chance before it was swept away by a Cat 5 hurricane, broken levees, polluted floodwaters, failed policies. The reason I never visited NOLA was I harbored a deep suspicion that it was a cartoon, a failed city hiding behind a Mardi Gras mask. Sort of like Santa Fe and its adobe Conoco station and tiny, cutesy, contrived core engulfed in a sea of low-rent sprawl. That was my prejudice. Ok, that's a lot of background. I finally went to New Orleans a month ago and was swept away by its depth and complexity. In a city that was 80 percent underwater, decaying for generations, still plagued by corrupt government, lingering segregation, terrible numbers for health, education and crime, and a limp local economy, more than 80 percent have moved back. Poor blacks and white exiled to Baton Rouge or Houston clawed to get back to a semblance of their lives in an unpainted shotgun house. They have been joined by an influx of young musicians and entrepreneurs, some of whom came to rebuild homes as volunteers and just stayed. Rich whites re-invested in stately homes that are really so much termite fodder. We biked all over the city and found new vitality everywhere. It turns out that Bourbon Street is the cartoon, but it is engulfed by richly layered multi-part novel. During a brass/hip hop concert in Congo Square, I stood among thousands of dancing New Orleaneans (?) and said to my daughter, ""Do any other residents love their city as much as this?"" She shrugged and replied, ""Maybe New York?""So I came back to Nine Lives to understand why. I was rewarded with a deep look inside the city over a generation. Katrina is just the climax. The book is beautifully researched and written like a fine novel. As I past journalist I can appreciate the time Dan Baum has taken to recreate scenes (some 50 years old as the book begins with Hurricane Betsy in 1965) with a high degree of nuance, dialogue and insight. He captures the poetry of everyday people, including cops, grifters, band leaders, a track repairman on the St. Charles lines, the King of Carnival, and the unforgettable Frank Minyard, the trumpet-playing coroner who waited a week for Katrina's casualties to show up in his provisional morgue. If you've been put off from reading Nine Lives by Katrina fatigue, go read Nine Lives now. It's just good literature. If you haven't been to New Orleans, don't wait your whole life like I did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Apr 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5501146-nine-lives

Most of what I knew about Long I gleaned from the Randy Newman album ""Good Old Boys""I read this book in preparation for my first trip to New Orleans. Most of what I knew about Long I gleaned from the Randy Newman album ""Good Old Boys"" with songs like ""Louisiana 1927"" and ""Here Come the Kingfish."" White's take is a straightforward, relatively concise and highly entertaining look at Long's life, in chronological order, from humble beginnings to corrupt end as a US Senator who posed a serious threat to Franklin Roosevelt's re-election in 1936. One of many conspiracy theories surrounding Long's death (assassinated by Dr. Carl Weiss in the Louisiana State Capitol in 1935) is that FDR was behind it. Long was one of the most talented yet least scrupulous and disciplined politicians of all time. When each one of Louisiana's newspapers opposed Long, he started his own daily mouthpiece and subsidized it by requiring every state employee to subscribe. Kickback and graft schemes were legendary. He accepted only cash which he stored in his Deduct Box (which resembled a giant ballot box). He hid the Deduct Box and died without revealing the location. It has never been found. Supposedly it was stuffed with more than $1 million in cash as well as papers and photos damaging to his enemies. You can see a replica in the opulent Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, a place Long was drawn to for its party scene although he detested (and ultimately dismantled) its ""Old Regular"" power structure.Long had many enemies whom he sought to destroy not just defeat. He instructed to the state legislature to outlaw the sale of funeral insurance, which happened to be the occupation of one vanquished opponent. He attacked opponents with profane epithets and accusations ranging from supporting blacks to beastiality. He called one genteel opponent with a Col. Sanders beard ""Old Feather Duster."" He threatened rivals with fisticuffs and firearms and employed the State National Guard to do his bidding, including an armed invasion and occupation of New Orleans. Long consolidated power by rigging elections, bribes, threats, and packing the legislature and courts with his lackeys. When elected to the US Senator he briefly retained his position as Governor and later continued to run the state through his proxy O.K. Allen. Through such remote control, he rammed through dozens of bills penned by Long himself with virtually no floor debate or opposition. This gave him total control over all patronage, courts, and even appointed positions in New Orealns. He was shameless. He once took a parish vote unanimously with more voters than registered by at least 500. In the Senate he became a scourge to FDR and refused to disburse New Deal funds within Louisiana. In 1932 Long stumped for FDR (who found Long's pig-in-the-sty eating habits and dandified outfits appalling) but by 1935 he spoke of opposing FDR as a third party candidate. Pundits thought a Long-led ticket could take 3 million votes and throw the election to the Republicans.Long generated fierce and vitriolic opposition. Prominent New Orleans residents spoke openly of assassination. J. Edgar Hoover sought to snag Long on tax evasion and may have been close when Long died. He was almost impeached and censured several times. With his back to the wall, Long employed two strategics. First he would turn to he populist base, the poorest of Louisiana poor. Long had a genuine commitment to elevating the lot of poor whites (otherwise he was initially as racist as they come)by providing free textbooks and building roads, clinics and schools. To pay he took on Standard Oil and the Baton Rouge refineries by dramatically raising their taxes. The poor whites of Louisiana supported the Kingfish unconditionally and would rally to his side as needed within hours.(Long favored radical redistribution of wealth to be funded by corporate taxes and caps on personal income. While his goals were socialists, he used the means of a fascist and was often accused of being a dictator.) Second, Long could switch on a dime from ranting demagogue to the most persuasive and rational orator. He possessed a keen (and largely self-taught) legal mind and could build a case like a Darrow or Bailey. Time and again he painted himself into the tightest quarters and literally talked his way out. He also was a master of the media: vanity newspapers, radio, and a medium he invented: roving trucks mounted with giant loudspeakers. If you've seen ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou,"" you get the idea.When Long died (he might have been saved if surgeons rushing from New Orleans had not crashed their car; an inexperienced doctor botched the operation to remove a bullet), huge crowds attended his funeral. For years many refused to believe he was dead. He was the Elvis of Southern politics. He left his mark everywhere; from artifacts at the Roosevelt Hotel to the massive Huey P. Long Bridge in New Orleans; to the 450-foot-tall State Capitol spire he had designed and built in one year in Baton Rouge and a complete overhaul of his beloved LSU. He also had the Governor's Mansion rebuilt to resemble the White House, so he ""could get used to living there.""

Great man-cave stuff about jazz, record collecting, comicsCons: To much inside baseball for some readers? Overwritten and often overwrought. Unconvincing and weak ending. Twisted navigation into scenes. Condescending women-cave stuff about birthing and babies. This book may leave many readers bewildered, as I felt after reading two recent Chabon books, Summerland and The Yiddish Policeman's Ball (was that the title?). After those two fantasies, Chabon grounds this book in gritty Oakland. Again the main characters are buddies (as in Kavalier and Clay), in this case the co-owners of a dying record-collector store. I rather enjoyed it because jazz--specifically 1970s jazz, including the syrupy-yet-virtuoso music of Don Sebeski's custom-packaged CTI catalogue--is close to the heart of the story. The book is full of insider references to this oeuvre (sp?) and as a kind of bonus CD includes a wonderful anaylsis of sides that do no exist by the fictive Hammond B-3 player Cochise Jones. There's also lots of guys stuff about Kung Fu and Blaxploitation flicks and comics that is not quite balanced (hey ladies, lookie here!) by a clumsy subplot involving midwives. Apparently Chabon does know something about birthin' no babies. And he's determined to let the women in the audience know this. Which is about as convincing as Mitt going on about the ""binders full of women."" The book is frustratingly elusive. You don't get much of a bead on the main characteres Archie and Nat. Better drawn are some side characters such as the corrupt city councilman/undertaker Chan Flowers, the entrepreneurial retired jock ""G Bad,"" and the late, leisure-suit clad Cochise Jones, slain by his own hefty keyboard. And of course the inevitable gay subplot. Chabon tries way too hard to convince us of his insider knowledge of these various subcultures and never quite goes post-dilletante.Another flaw is his tendency to back into scenes. Utterly confusing. But this weakness is also a strength. It forces you to reread sections two or three times discovering the most wonderous imagery and turns of phrase. It's the quality of the prose, not the characters or plot, that keep you reading. Plus Chabon's wonderful ear for the city, be it the sighing of a kneeling bus or the smell of a greasy donut shop that also serves carryout.About two-thirds through even the prose gives out and the book deflates like a wounded zeppelin. There are wearisome hijinx substituting for logical plot progressions. One involves a zeppelin; another the introduction of a state senator (the book is set in 2004) named Obama. It all ties up too neatly, but not nearly soon enough.Better editng would have helped but editors are as rare as live checkout at Krogers; and Maxwell Perkins is much more dead than poor Cochise Jones.Okay, I like books about jazz, vinyl shops, and cities.

In 1919, a young military man named Eisenhower joined a convoy a trucks attempting to cross America from DC to California. Within 38 miles of leaving the convoy broke down. It took months to plod across roadless America and the entire mission was almost entirely lost in the Great Salt Desert. Intended to demonstrate military might and mobility, the mission turned into a fiasco. Eisenhower promised to do something about it someday--and he did as President in the 1950s, signing into law an act creating the Interstate Highway System.This did happen but there is a back story that is somewhat less and also more interesting. In the 1890s bicycling became popular. A dearth of paved roads made longer rides impossible. A young bicycle promoter named Carl Fisher helped start a Good Roads movement. Early in the next century cars came along and immediately caught on. But there were still no good roads. Rails connected towns and cities. Within cities, horses (and horse urine and poop) and streetcars were the rule. Fisher dropped bicycles and immediately began applying his considerable promotional skills to the auto. He helped launch the Indianapolis Speedway (with disastrous and fatal initial results) and opened an auto showroom downtown. He was addicted to gimmicks like dropping an auto (secretly reinforced) off the roof of his showroom. The Goods Roads movement was taken up statewide but somewhat ad hoc, Chamber of Commerce-like groups. About 1920 this enterprise was turned over to colorless bureaucrats and starchy engineers who truly launched the system--routes, funding, engineering standards, construction techniques. The author is unfortunately smitten with this group and overloads the biographical detail. (An exception is the Lear-ian RObert Moses, who has a small role in this book and is much better explicated by Robert Caro in The Power Broker.) Come the 1950s and the book jumps to life as the unintended consequences of the Interstates become apparent. In 1958, Lewis Mumford launches an attack on the Interstates that galvanizes a movement. In the 1960s, protests against Interstates being rammed through cities as a form of ""urban removal"" sound one of the major notes of a turbulent decade. In the narrative, the faceless bureaucrats fall into retreat to be bested by heroes of historic preservation, racial equity, and neighborhood rights. What makes the book work so well is Swift's balance. He sees the good and the bad of the Interstates and is able to amplify both equally. A major point that I agree with (although I am a proponent of walking, cycling, compact cities, and mass transit), is that the rise of the auto and highways was a popular movement. Americans fell in love with the auto from the get-go and clamored for highway construction well into the 1960s and 70s. Swift also lances the popular myth that the oil companies conspired with car and tire manufacturers to destroy (then privately held) transit companies. People voted with their feet and ran away from transit toward cars. Now they are finally feeling stuck with them and starting to vote with their feet in the other direction: toward transit, biking and walking, and away from typical suburbs into more compact and walkable, transit-served neighbors. This movement is a trickle rather than a stampede. But it is discernible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 09, 2012","Nov 07, 2012","Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11094651-the-big-roads

You are not vacation; you are in uncharted territory on a scientific expedition and there is no way out. Although the natives are relatively untouched by modern civilization, they are hardly innocent and unspoiled. They steal, express affection by slapping, and are immune to sharing. The expedition is lorded over by an imperious, white-haired ice queen who keeps a deaf waif like a dog. The other doctor/researchers are a bland bunch.

Just get us out of Manaus and into the jungle so we can get to the bottom of this. But the jungle is no escape. Patchett keeps piling on characters with little or no plot advance until you feel like you're in the Marx Brothers cloakroom. With biting insects.

In 1972, Jack and his wife Diane came to the Pacific lowlands near Dominical to manage a cattle ranch and rice fields. The Colorado natives found the ranching poor but they were enamored by the flora and fauna in five discrete ecosystems located on their Hacienda Baru. In the 1990s the Ewings bought a stake in the ranch and began to shut down agricultural operations. They planned to let the rice paddies and pastures regrow into native mangrove and cloud forest; to build a small eco-resort; and to train local people as guides through this rich environment full of toucans, monkeys and more.I had a huge respect for this undertaking but was doubtful. In 1991, Hacienda Baru was a long way from anywhere over poor roads. The idea of ecotourism was new and unproven. Would people pay to tramp through the forest and stay in rustic cabins? At the time Costa Rica operated under more of a Hawaiian resort model emphasizing beaches and large, air-conditioned motels.This year my family returned to Costa Rica for 10 days of volunteer work and tourism. I wondered if Jack and Diane had succeeded or even if they were still alive. Google quickly led me to the web site of what appeared to be a thriving enterprise. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Hacienda Baru has been designated a National Wildlife Refuge. Then Amazon Kindle led me to this book, which I bought right away and read in Costa Rica. During the trip we stayed at Hacienda Baru and reconnected with the Ewings, now in their late 60s, and employing more than 30 locals who work running an open-air restaurant, gardens, and lodging in simple screened cabins, along with a thriving rainforest guide service that attracts busloads each day. We had a small, private tour with a guide named Olman who grew up in a peasant household learning to track animals. He still tracks them expertly, but only to see, not hunt. We learned that Jack wrote the book as a series of guest columns for local publications in Costa Rica. The essays are short meditations on the natural phenomena of Hacienda Baru based on Jack's own careful observations. You learn how a leaf-ant colony has an amazing social order for 5 million individuals; that the charismatic toucan is a ruthless bully to woodpeckers; and generally that nature is fascinating but not nice, simply a well-design and efficient system to recycle all biomass as new life. Jack apologizes for not being a wildlife biologist, but he is an expert storyteller who makes what could be dry science come alive with personal experiences, characters and dialogue. He says he learned his craft while taking creative writing classes in high school in Greeley, Colorado. Then he honed this skill while bedridden and accepting assignments as term-paper ghost-writer. Knowing Jack only as an acquaintance, I suspect he is the rare natural writer. The story of Hacienda Baru is a hopeful one for the future of our natural environment and resources. Since letting Hacienda Baru ""go native"" and linking to other habitat areas through wildlife corridors, the Ewings have witnessed an explosion in the diversity and recurrence of native species. These include white-faced monkeys, toucan, coati, jaguar and panther. With the ecosystem more in balance from the bottom to the top of the food chain, Hacienda Baru has also seen a reduction of pests such as mosquitos, who once found halvah in the rice paddies. We stayed three days and were amazed by the diversity of life but bit once or twice. I strongly recommend both this book and visiting Hacienda Baru; its gardens, trails and lovely pool where bats and nighthawks swoop down at sunset. You can even get there easily since the paved coastal highway 34 opened in 2010. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jun 24, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88466.Monkeys_Are_Made_of_Chocolate

This is a story of lost youth and the impossibility of reconnecting with the dreams of those times. Ellis Hock is a 60-ish haberdasher who finds himself suddenly alone. His wife divorces him after finding incriminatingly intimate emails on his iPhone; his daughter is an estranged brat, and his multi-generational downtown store falls victim to Men's Warehouse. So he travels back to a beyond-remote African outpost in Malawi, where he had some success in the Peace Corps 40 years earlier, building a school and finding an (unrequited) love, for example. He shows up uninvited and with a valise full of cash, with mostly disastrous results. Along the way Theroux indicts an entire system of corrupt officials and NGOs and the corrupt, scavenging villagers himself. His lost love Gala is still alive but an aging wreck. His only balm and hope is Gala's 18-year-old granddaughter Zizi, whom Hock can't decide whether to conquer as a lover or protect as a ward.Flaws of the book include the unlikeability of the central character of the peremptory Hock, who seems alone and friendless with good reason. Another is the pervasive sense of hopelessness. You have to remember that in all his travels (documented in all those travel books), Theroux never seems to have met another soul he remotely liked; he is the ultimate curmugeon, which is part of his entertainment value.This book is not entertainment. It is both gripping and haunting. Thus the four stars and recommendation.

But how was it recovered? Scribe monks copying great works from We know that much Roman and Greek thought was lost or forgotten during the Dark Ages. But how was it recovered? Scribe monks copying great works from papyrus to parchment supply part of the answer. In a work that manages to be both authoritative and highly (perhaps too highly) speculative, Greenblatt finds the answer in one character. He is a 15th-century ""book-hunter"" named Poggio (once the official scribe/notary to a disgraced pope)tracking a particular volume, ""On the Nature of Things,"" by an equally obscure Roman writer-philospher named Lucretius. Essentially an epic poem of surpassing grace, ""On the Nature of the Things"" contained the seeds of humanistic thought that supposedly launched the Renaissance.Greenblatt is a dazzling ""popular"" scholar, but he employs a strained technique that I question. As in his ""Will in the World,"" he reconstructs complex scenarios using sophisticated speculation, but based on very little evidence. The ""what ifs"" pile up like a Jenga game and teeter at the hint of reader doubt. Then Greenblatt shows his dazzle with a discourse on Cicero or Petrach or the early Catholic church or something else you feel guilty about never properly studying as an undergrad. Some of this is right on; other times murky distraction.Still you can learn a lot from reading Greenblatt. --How text evolved from scrolls to Codex to books--How monk-scribes were fairly low characters and treated no better than calves penned up for veal --How the explosion of Vesuvius and destruction of Pompeii created a treasure trove of lost manuscripts--What was the Alexandria library? How did it come to be and what caused its downfall (religious intolerance, especially for ""pagan"" though) The bigger picture, of course, is that of a world emerging from willful ignorance and rote thought into one this is inquisitive, exploratory, and (with the soon-coming Gutenberg press and opening of the New World) expansive. This is what keeps me reading. I've finished the book and it is as I suspected from past experience with Greenblatt. He is a brilliant popular scholar but goes way too far with shaky constructs and conjecture. Specifically his argument that the rediscovery of the text of Lucretious led directly to the Renaissance is weak. The book would have worked fine as a kind of detective story about the recovery of the lost text and the startling ideas it contained. Still it is good enough; well worth reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 25, 2012","Apr 24, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10954979-the-swerve

The dynamic recalls Tracy Kidder's work in ""House,"" where he documented and brought to life the tensions among architect, builder and client In the process of designing and building, Pollen sees his little building representing the span of architectural thought and history, at least from Vitruvius to Peter Eisenman. (He also skims the history of landscape design, in particular 18th-century England.) In the process he asks big questions. Can architecture be art for art's sake? Why do proportions matter? Do we perceive reality differently when we look out through a large plate glass window compared to one divided by mullions? Such musings present problems for some readers. For the architectural sophisticate, this may read like a primer. The unititiated may get lost during digressions into the roots of modernism or other isms, or they may just not care.

Will the architect's scheme of hiding concrete foots in drilled boulders work? Tense moments ensue when the building settles, unexpectedly throwing one 90-degree corner off to 88 degrees. WIll Charlie's idea of custom-building in-swinging windows work, or will Pollen have to settle for factory windows that lose the effect of ""opening up the building like a roadster.""

Atillus, a water engineer (aquarius) from Rome, is dispatched to fix a problem in the local aqueduct system--the water has been infected by sulphur and is undrinkable. At the behest of a freed slave, Ampliatus, who has become Pompeii's foremost nouveau riche mover and shaker, he climbs Mt. Vesuvius with a reluctant and truculent pick-up crew seeking to repair a breach in the system. Along the way he is trailed by Ampliatus's willful and beautiful daughter, while tracking the mystery of the disappeared previous aquarius.

There's even geeky engineering stuff about how aqueducts work. The book feels steeped in research but the pulpy plot and vigorous, concrete descriptive writing keep things moving. You learn that Pompeii was a kind of Strivers Row of the Roman Empire. The Pompeii soil contained the essential bonding ingredient of Roman concrete. This made local fortunes and resulted in gaudy palaces, real estate speculation, groaning Grand Boufe feasts.... pretty much everything you would find in Potomac, Maryland, or Cherry Hills, Denver, today, minus the Lexus dealerships.

Like a low-key take on ""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" heavy on compassion and easy on the sarcasm, Waldman's wonderful what-if tale (what if a Muslim won the 9/11 Memorial competition?) successfully explicates a kaleidiscope of viewpoints (try saying that fast three times): the upper-crust WASP widow of a humanistic Cantor Fitzgerald-like financial trader; the lowlife brother of a dead firefighter who straightens up and becomes a Muslim-baiting, Archie Bunker-like spokesman; the bloviating governor; the inscrutable, assimilated architect Mohammed (""Mo"") Khan, in his heart about as Muslim as I am; and my favorite character, the wounded but also wounding tabloid reporter, a fading blonde whose interview questions are like waterboarding for her even-more fragile subjects. I picked up the book because I heard it was an accurate description of the world of architects and in particular design competitions; areas I have covered as a journalist. Waldman spot on captures this mileau. Her evocative description of the fantasy memorial (the book is indeed pure fiction and the real memorial has since been built) provides an excellent example of writing about landscape design.Waldman skillfully handles her ensemble cast in a way that recalls ""The Wire"" or ""Hill Street Blues"" or perhaps an Altman film like ""The Player"" or ""Nashville."" Her writing is is slick and cinematic (fast-paced and pulpy, but not trashy, if that's possible) in pacing and description and pithy dialogue. She's got a wonderful eye for small, telling detail. I would not be surprised to see ""The Submission"" optioned for big screen or HBO. ADDENDUM: I visited the 9/11 Memorial on August 12, 2012. I guess I was not reading the s close enough, but was disappointed to learn this is a private, ticketed space. Not only do you have to cough up $15, but wait in an endless line in the broiling sun and then (irony of ironies) go through airport security to ensure you are not a terrorist out to implode a huge granite memorial. To take nothing away from the heroism displayed on 9/11, I am not comfortable with the canonization of New York's Finest and the resulting sanctioned police state.That said it was worth it. The monumental memorial is extremely moving. I particularly enjoyed the ambiguity of the statement, the peaceful feeling elicited by the massive downward fountain draining into the infinity of the earth. It works for families, it works for New York and memorialization, and it also works for mild 9/11 skeptics like myself who see the efforts of the past 11 years as vast resources (and perhaps the last of our personal freedoms) going down the drain. Or perhaps it is the remnants of our economy being drained by triumphant Wall Street still ascendant all around? On the other hand, the Freedom Tower is just another banal, glassy high-rise, and the financial district (with the Occupy-ers vanquished from Zuccotti Park to a thin sidewalk outside Trinity Church) as soul-less as ever. A good friend lost his brother in 9/11. He worked for a financial company high in the WTC. I never met him and was pleased to be able to look him up and visit his inscribed name. Again this is a memorial that works on numerous levels. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2012","Jan 08, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10364994-the-submission

This is a police thriller with social significance, driven by Sides's fascination with the sometimes sordid past of his hometown, Memphis, Tennessee. In 1968 Memphis society is busily preparing for the annual cotton festival, as big a deal as it gets in upper crust white Delta society. At the same time black sanitation workers are on a strike that brings the city to a stinking halt. Theirs becommes a civil rights cause celebre that attracts Martin Luther King Jr. to come lead a peaceful parade. When violence breaks out, King decides to return again from Atlanta to make amends. Five years after his ""I Have a Dream Speech,"" he and his nonviolent message seem increasingly irrelevant and King risks becoming the rear guard to the Black Panthers and Stokely Carmichael. Because of King's outspoken opposition to Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson has abandoned King. (Later Stokely Carmichael attends King's funeral but Johnson, who only days earlier announced he would not seek re-election, sends Hubert Humphrey.)Having been criticized for staying in a white owned motel on his last visit, King checks into the Lorraine Motel, black-owned and associated with Stax Records (""In the Midnight Hour"" was penned in one of its rooms). A George Wallace supporter has been staking out King from a rooming house 200 yards away. Armed with a 30.06 and binoculars, the amateur assassin guns King down and escapes in a white Ford Mustang. The police take pursuit but are called off the scent by a mystery CB voice issuing a false report of a high speed chase. The FBI of J. Edgar Hoover, a sworn enemy who was disgusted by King's philandering, is handed the job of tracking down the fugitive. With American cities, including central Washington, DC, two blocks from the White House, about to burn in what were then called race riots, some at the FBI celebrate King's death. Can the FBI be trusted to find the killer? Was the FBI complicit in the act? Although occasionally overwritten, the book pulses with tension and almost--but not quite--answers the questions: Who killed King?

Glaeser's underlying theory is this: the last two generations of new urban form--the industrial city and automobile suburbs--are basically aberrations. Traditionally the city has been a place to make ideas, not automobiles, and places designed to attract the educated and the skilled, not the unskilled factory worker. The knowledge blender does not have to happen in a dense traditional city--the low-density Silicon Valley of office parks has launched many of our best innovations for decades--but low-density suburbia is not sustainable. Glaeser manages to hatch some truly original ideas. Some are provocative, others just eccentric. You choose:--Why cities need and are good for poor people (but not all poor people)--Why more people (a lot more) should live in San Francisco and LA--How to revamp taxation to level the playing field between cities and suburbia--Why Detroit failed and probably is never coming back--How low-density cities that exclude affordable housing are killing themselves and the environment--Why high rises are good for you--How India's rural biases are strangling modern cities like MumbaiIn some respects this is the perfect cocktail party book that will supply you with Gladwell-ian trivia and hypotheses to ensure a longueur free evening.

Why so cranky, you say? Okay I had a tiff with the Mrs., who wanted me to vacuum yesterday, and I didn't get to it until today, just as company was arriving. I will finish this book. If it gets better I'll say so. Just don't let Simon Winchester know I've written a few book lest he is a vengeful person. UPDATE: On page 209 Winchester finally begins the book I was hoping to read--the social history of SF and what happened during the Quake. It's good, lean writing and quite enjoyable and informative.

That's a bit like owning a copy of ""Beatles 1"" and thinking you know the Beatles. In this companion book to a British TV series, Schama takes you under the skin and the canvas of 10 masters from Caravaggio to 1970s. The book's premise is that certain artworks have the power to elicit emotion and even action. Why is this? Schama actually answers that question. This is not a primer or a ""lives of the artists."" Schama assumes you know something (which in my case is literally true--I know something, but not much) about the artists and their times. He fills in plenty on such topics as religious worship in the 17th century, construction of St. Peter's, the French revolution, and the bombing of Guernica. This really is art criticism at its best. There is little painterly (or sculptor-ly) jargon and lots of living, breathing analysis and history (and even dirt on topics like Bernini's slatternly, adulterous girlfriend, fully realized in a bust that blazes with concupiscence). He never fawns over his subjects while recognizing their flaws and laziness as well as their genius. Unlike almost other ""companion"" books, which take a scrapbook approach, this one has real substance and easily stands alone (although my mother tells me the DVD of the series is also excellent). The book is nicely produced and beautifully illustrated with a few well-chosen plates. Schama's descriptive prose is so fine that you easily resist the urge to go to Google images (at least until later) because you can't tear away from this book. ADDENDUM AUGUST 2012: I was visiting my mother and watched the DVD sections on Caravaggio and Bernini. They were ridiculously overamped (and also felt padded and repetitive). When describing Bernini's ""Ecstacy of St Teresa,"" in which the floating stone nun appears to have a cataclysmic orgasm, Schama appears to have a involuntary wet dream of his own while indulging in some anachronistic purple pornographic prose. Then he has the nerve to add that the statue has inspired quite a lot of bad writing. Case in point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"May 13, 2011","Jun 06, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19797.The_Power_of_Art

UnfortuThe idea behind this ""brief insight series"" is great--give readers a quick, intelligent hit on a big subject in a boiled-down textbook format. Unfortunately Guy is a dull, elliptical writer who seems bored with and dismissive of his subject. (With a curt wrist flick he dispenses with the Six Wives of Henry VIII, for example, by saying a lot has already been written on this.) He treats the rise and fall of Cromwell as little more than a box score.

That a lot of people died during the Black Death and England's population grew after it was over. Wow. I hear Brits also drink tea and it rains a bit there. They like their soccer, too. The ludicrously entertaining series ""The Tudors"" drew me to this subject wanting to know the real story of Henry VIII beyond the college boy haircuts and rough sex scenes.

Along the way he virtually invented jam-band music, jazz-rock, Southern-fried rock and maybe another genre or two. While documenting encounters with producers, porn stars, Jimi Hendrix's guitar, and even Norman Rockwell, Kooper shares musical insights along with the inevitable tales of debauchery, broken contracts, and drug flameouts. It's all fun to read if amateurish; it reads like a self-published vanity book with little if any editing. For example, Kooper constantly uses exclamation points and italic asides that a pro editor would delete on the first edit. But he also spins great stories in vigorous prose and a humorous, self-effacing style. The nuggets reprinted from his photo albums are a bonus. Somewhat like Keith Richards's book (another brutally honest tale conveyed with few regrets), the book loses steam as Kooper's career winds down. After getting the inside view on the making of ""Blonde on Blonde,"" you are not compelled by the guts of producing the likes of the Tubes and Eddie and the Hot Rods. The sputtering out of Kooper's solo career is sad but mitigated by the sense of his comfort in playing in a pickup band with Dave Barry and Amy Tan, just for fun. The touching denoument finds Kooper dealing with blindness and diabetes but still carrying on. If you dig Kooper's music (the good stuff has held up well) or just like reading about the music scene of the 1960s and 70s, this is highly recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2011","Mar 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/692333.Backstage_Passes_and_Backstabbing_Bastards

Looking for a pure musical experience, he stumbles Some years ago rock critic Siblin attends a U2 show in Canada and is put off by all the spectacle. Looking for a pure musical experience, he stumbles on Bach's six Cello Suites. Learning they are of uncertain provenance (no score exists in Bach's hand), he searches for the work's origins and uncovers the connection between Bach and the Catalan cellist Pablo Casals, who popularized the Cello Suites after discovering a score in a Barcelona music shop in 1890. From this modest premise a gripping tale develops around dual biographies of Bach and Casals (with Siblin's own tale of a rising classical music nerd woven in). Cello Suites engages sweeps of history including the era of Frederick the Great and the Spanish Civil War. (Initially Siblin's prose seems stiff, clunky and even ungrammatical, but he warms up after about 50 pages.) The book is structured around the movements of the six suites and includes plenty of musical insights. It helped me to download a complete cello suites. For all of his admiration of Casals (who became an international political figure and advocate for nuclear disarmament), Siblin warns you off from the master's intepretations, which suffer from poor recording quality and overblown sentiment. I bought a $7.99 iTunes-recommended recording by Ralph Kirschbaum. This is gorgeous. Handily Siblin tells you exactly where to go to find, for example, a Zeppelin-esque cello riff or particularly somber sarabande. Following Siblin's path I am delving into more Bach.

Petit himself is a character and that is the first problem--there is no way this book could capture the drama and beauty of this act as adeptly as the documentary film ""Man on Wire,"" which also pulled off the impossible by triggering nostalgia for the brutish World Trade Center as an architectural paragon. The story starts well and evocatively in Dublin with the tale of two Irish brothers; one an ordinary Joe and the other a self-styled saint who joins a brotherhood and moves to the smoldering projects of the Bronx as a protector of an entire gaggle of Wizened Whores with Hearts of Gold. (Here the reader experiences the first signs of panic.) Along the way we meet a kid obsessed with photographing ""tagged"" infrastructure in obsure, hard to reach places; a group of Ur-hackers; a hit-and-run couple of no-talent conceptual artists; and a whole lot of other folks you care less and less about as the narrative dribbles away.

I loved this book. It reminded me of a streamlined ""Freedom"" with its quirky, self-destructive characters, a keener satirical edge, and similar punk rock subthemes full of boomer-packed references. Similar to Jonathan Franzen, Egan sets her characters off of a course of self-immolation fueled by their own tragic choices and self-deceptions. But unlike Franzen's unlikely denoument, Egan redeems her characters only partway and a small portion of the time. The settings are New York, LA, Africa, San Francisco and an unnamed Latin American dictatorship, where some of the book's best scary-funny scenes. And scary-funny is what Egan does well, packing her book with kleptos, nymphos, meglos, and has-beens that can leave you squirming, while also relishing each moment. With 9/11 as a backdrop, the scariness has a point driven home in the chilling final two chapters set in the near future. The book contains an entire chapter relayed in Powerpoint graphics.

I won't tell you more about the voyage lest ""spoiler alert,"" but it did not turn out the way I remember from age eight and it's hard to imagine why I fixated on Magellan as a hero. ""Over the Edge of the WOrld"" was informative, meticulous researched and written in clear prose, although full of colorful arcane terms like arquebus and maravedi. Yet it's chore to read. Bergeen is handed the narrative gift of a voyage and he follows it from A to Z. He might have done better to shuffle the sequence. The voyage is full of Sargasso Seas and often reads like one damn thing after another. Magellan as a main character is a problem. He's 400 pages of churl and we can't get that close to him since his own journals were lost. (Bergeen relies primarily on the diaries of the wonderfully named Italian chronicleer Pigafetta, a supernumerary and Magellan loyalist during one or two mutinies and the subsequent inquiries upon the voyage's return to Seville.) For all the adventure at high seas and encounters with exotic (and sexually kinky) natives in South America, Africa, and Indonesia, the story lacks voltage; although in its documentarian dryness it does convey the advanced boredom and privation that realistically accompanies such a voyage. The producers of ""The Tudors"" might have been brought in as consultants to volt things up a bit. (TV miniseries available on Netflix. Formula: Three minutes of horses and swordplay and then sex with chambermaids. Just before closing credits, another one of Henry VIII's wives loses her head.) Still if you have had a half-century hankering to get the inside dip on Magellan--""Over the Edge of the World"" is your man. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 25, 2010","Jan 15, 2011","Dec 25, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/174354.Over_the_Edge_of_the_World

Keith also draws a fairly balanced self-portrait of a man capable of generosity, love and respect for his parents,friends and allies, but also surprising violence (guns, ""blades,"" fists, knees, kicking feet in pointy rock star boots) and needless to say epic, unprecendently self-indulgence, often involving crashing Bentleys and Mercedes or a speedboat trip to Italy for breakfast.

Another nice technique is the inclusion of two-three page guest voices (helps fill in Keith's many blackouts).Like any good memoir Keith's includes a sense of times with guest appearances from Truman Capote, John Lennon, Gram Parsons, and more.

I swam at his Jones Beach with its gorgeous bathhouses and boardwalkRobert Moses was the towering figure of public works in the New York of my youth. I swam at his Jones Beach with its gorgeous bathhouses and boardwalk that felt like a stroll on the deck of a luxury liner. It seems Moses shaped the entire waterfront including the crests of the waves. I was driven on his parkways (Belt to see grandma, Meadowbrook to get to Jones Beach). He shaped the 1963 World's Fair (a money loser) and eventually gained control of a half-dozen public agencies. The Moses name seemed to loom on every construction sign and cast a long shadow over even the egomaniac Governor Rockefeller. Moses' own megalomania was documented in Robert Caro's tragic biography ""The Power Broker,"" a Shakespearian tale of genius gone wrong in which Moses is blamed for just about everything that went wrong with American cities and suburbs after WW II--misbegotten public housing, decaying public transit, numbing sprawl, traffic jams, you name it. Jane Jacobs was his foil--an autodidactic Greenwich Village ""housewife"" who became a writer for Architectural Record and ultimately of ""The Death and Life of American Cities,"" a polemic in defense of the small, spontaneous and neighborly, rather than the planned megaproject. Jacobs' book remains a classic 50 years later while Moses (despite some efforts to rehab his reputation) is largely reviled as the devil of top-down, arrogant, urban soul-sucking planning. Like Godzilla vs. Mothra, the two titans faced off in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s. The forces of Jacobs triumphed over a Moses highway scheme and today we have an intact SoHo to show for it. Roberta Brandes Gratz grew up in a Greenwich Village neighborhood that was ripped down for urban renewal. Her family (art-appreciating owners of a dry cleaning operation) moved to Weston, Connecticut, a rural idyll that Gratz saw overrun by cookie-cutter suburbia. She found her way back to Manhattan by way of NYU, went to work on the New York Post (with Pete Hamill and Jack Newfield), discovered architecture, and later became a celebrated writer on architecture and planning. Gratz takes a personal view of the Moses vs. Jacobs debate, having lived through it at close personal range. This is not really an urban planning book but a charming memoir of growing up in New York and its suburbs and of a young Jewish intellectual woman coming of age during an era of powerful women who really did change the world--Jacobs, Rachel Carson and Betty Friedan among them. As I read on I deducted stars. The book becomes a repetitive recap of 1960s planning battles--stories told with more verve elsewhere. The towering personalities of both foils are curiously missing.

Just a few years before his death, Steinbeck set out with a big poodle and a specially appointed camper-top pickup to find America and he found it in bits and shards. For a famous populist he did not seem to engage much with felllow Americans. I estimate the book recounts less than a dozen encounters over the course of months and thousands of miles. Steinbeck hates cities and avoids them, thus skipping 90 percent of the populace to begin with. (Note: I recall driving vacations through cities of the Northeast at this time and they were pretty dreary and congested.) On the other hand there are long disquistions on subjects like the rise of mobile home parks and how you can tell when to trust a veterinarian. Still this is worth reading to compare the America of 1962 to today. Slightly before the rise of major fast-food chains, Steinbeck complained about the sameness of roadside food everywhere. He worries that regional accents will disappear yet they are still with us.People seemed loathe to discuss politics and did not wear their affiliations on their sleeves or bumper stickers--unless you mentioned the USSR, a topic everyone agreed on. Perhaps the nation united against the Red was too preoccupied to argue with each other. Race was a big issue. Eight years after Brown vs. Board, Steinbeck was drawn to the spectacle of huge protests outside a New Orleans public school where a tiny black girl had enrolled. Daily she was escorted into the building while a chorus a local moms (dubbed ""the Cheerleaders"") led a bulging crowd shouting vicious epithets. Yet the (too) moderate Steinbeck worried aloud that blacks would advance too fast, ultimately damaging their own cause by creating a backlash. Steinbeck's tone is cranky but unthreatening, like some old opinionated codger (although he was only 57) you might meet in a KOA campground.

In this imperfect but worthwhile narrative, Reston links the rise of Spain as a religious monarchy, primarily powered by war and the Inquisition, to consolidation of power and ultimately the conquest of colonization of new lands. He does a good job of drawing and humanizing such characters of Isabelle, Ferdinand, the Inquisitor Torquemada, the upstart, social climbing Columbus, Pope Alexander and his vile bastard offspring, the Borgias, and many more obscure historical figures. Granted this is a complex narrative but Reston hurts his cause (for most of the book) by offering too much detail, too many characters. Stay with it as he gains momentum in the last one-third as the Spanish monarchs close in on the final outpost of Granada (taken in an anti-climactic capitulation from the well-named Boabdil the Unfortunate, the final Moorish caliph of Andalusia). I learned that Columbus, who was elevated to royal status after his 1492-93 expeditions, led two far less successful explorations and died more or less a miserable failure. Note: I visited many of these sites a few months ago, for example, Seville, one of the world's most charming, exotic and picturesque cities. I learned that the plaza outside the cathedral where I sat sniffing orange blossoms and listening to classical guitar and flamenco was the site of a gruesome podium/smudge pot where hundreds of ""heretics"" were burned at the stake. And why did the Inquisitors burn at the stake? Because of churchly prescriptions that no blood be spilled in the ""relaxation"" (this the actual term they used) of heretics. Finally I praise the author for maintaining a relatively balanced point of view. Only when you get to the epilogue does he reveal a somewhat politcally correct point of view. And while he hardly views such characters as Ferdinand, Isabella, Savonarola and Torquemada as noble, he does seem to respect the true depths, however misguided, of the religious and spiritual passions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2010","Jul 28, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55694.Dogs_of_God

What the ""nesters"" went through is not imaginable. Dust storms that could last a month with gale-force winds clogging their homes and dugouts and of course their lungs. Parches months when ground temps could reach 150. The hostility of a nation--disbelieving to the East until the Dust Storms actually migrated to NY and DC, and gripped by a kind of anti-immigration fervor to the West, where Californians erected ""No Okies Welcome"" signs as far east as Tulsa. Egan explores the lives of of about 10 ""nester"" families (and their briefly thriving communities) who moved to the southern Great Plains expecting a bonanza and received in the form a rainy decade (1920s) and record grain prices. Expecting even greater profits they plowed up millions of acres of prairie grasses and topsoil that had evolved gently over millenia. Then the Great Depression hits; grain prices plummet and finally a 10-year drought ensues. Spoiler alert: The book lacks a gratifying conclusion. You are primed for Roosevelt and the WPA to ride to the rescue but their flagship reclamation projects flops when contour-plowed fields are attacked by locusts. The Dust Bowl simply seems to end in a spirit of semi-formal cooperation to change ag practices; while ag is doomed anyway. Egan's point seems to be cautionary, not inspirational. The stories of survival are not uplifting. They just leave you wondering why the stragglers did not leave this land where you might not see a single green thing grow for five years.

Suffice to say it's almost as good as the first one. The character of Lisbeth Salander becomes even richer and scarier; the action sequences, if improbable, are heart-thumping. A few criticisms:1) Book one was rich in Swedish sense of place. Larsson does not pay as much attention to these settings (exotic to me anyway) beyond naming a few locations. 2) Too many characters, especially among the mix of public-private detectives. Couldn't keep them all straight. A strength of Book One was Larsson's absolute clarity in the face of a tangled plot and cast of characters. 3) It's starting to go Hollywood. The diffident, shambling Mikael Blomquist veers dangerously close to unlikely superhero, a la Dan Brown and his increasingly swashbuckling professor. Some of the action scenes seem written for the approval of Jerry Bruckheimer. That said, the first two volumes are among the best beach books ever.

On that last note, festivals often include a turd-like pinata and a Catalan toast might be something like, ""Eat strong food, crap prodigiously and live a long life.""The book also recounts a host of colorful historical and political figures, including the unifier Guiffre the Hairy, and the 19th-century who grew his sideburns out like Rapunzel's locks and of course the crazed visionary Gaudi, who was emblematic of right-wing, regressive Catholic thought. Nonetheless his fantastical buildings and Parc Guell have inspired generations of freethinkers. Gaudi has reached cult status in Japan, which provided much of the capital to restore Gaudi and other Modernista landmarks. I recently visited Barcelona and read the book both before and after. Barcelona has always been a city on the make. Hughes captures these asperation well, even brilliantly. Barcelona does not have a real harbor and overcame its shallow, sandy coast to become a major port. About 30 years ago the city fashioned about five miles of beaches from an old industrial waterfront. Today it's as crowded as a Coney Island heyday and women in gold lame string bikinis routinely and surrealistically wander up from the beach to the Ramblas and ancient Bari Gotic. Like Chicago, Barcelona is a city of architecture but it feels a little insubstantial: buildings with strange wrought-iron gaps and warbling facades seem more committed to decoration than innovation. And in the last 20 years (Olympics, etc), Barcelona has collected more celebrity ""starchitect"" buildings that just about anywhere. Anyway, a wonderful book that captures a dazzling, puzzling, incredibly vibrant city. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2010","Jun 23, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/599106.Barcelona

As the title proclaims, this book focuses on his life as a drunk. Luckily it's about much more than that: Hamill's true subject is growing up poor in Brooklyn in the 1930s, the war years, and the intellectual and cultural journey of a young man who dropped out of Catholic high school and could easily have worked anonymously at the Brooklyn Navy Yards for 30 years. It's a fascinating memoir. Fortunately the drinking is pretty incidental and we are spared the usual ""Lost Weekend"" details (Hamill says he can't remember most) as well as the harrowing AA tales of redemption. It's all just a lot more cut and dried, but nothing tied up in a neat bow either. There's some two-bit philosophizing about Why Men Drink but not crashing epiphany that led to sobriety. Hamill was the son of classic Irish drunk, the one-legged Billy Hamill from Belfast, who worked night shifts and plied the Irish bars of Park Slope by day. Billy was a beloved songster and storyteller in the bars and a different (or rather indifferent) person at home. He showed little interest in his son's burgeoning interests in art and letters with never a kind word or hand for his classically long-suffering Irish-American wife and their slowly growing brood (7 kids over 21 years). Pete manages to draw an affectionate portrait of Billy and love him as well as his saintly mother. Drinking Life is strong on the details of a working class childhood that straddles the Depression and WWII: games played on rooftops involving dares to leap over airshafts. He also touches on the Irish-Italian zoot suit gangs of the late 40s and more global trends like Brooklyn flight to the suburbs. There's also a lovely portrait of Mexico City circa 1952. At about age 35 he abruptly switches from detailed sketches of character and place to summary; Hamill knows the best part of his story is over and he tiddle-ee tiddee-ahs his way to the end. As my bro in law Brian says, sometimes people are more interesting when they are drinking. Celebrities wander into the story (Hamill lived for a time with Shirley McLain; Mick Jagger and Keith Richards drop in). Not to be missed is his tale of being in Belfast the day JFK was assassinated. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 16, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/79107.A_Drinking_Life

This was the greatest workplace loss of life for decades before and 90 yThe great garment district fire of 1911 killed 146 people in Lower Manhattan. This was the greatest workplace loss of life for decades before and 90 years after, until 9/11/2001. The average factory loft (today converted into a swanky condo) was 10 or 11 stories, meaning four floors beyond the reach of the highest hook and ladder. Fire escapes were grossly inadequate and no-smoking rules usually ignored. Scrap heaps beneath each work table provided a highly combustible matrix--and cotton is incredible friable. Fire equipment in the building consisted of a water bucket placed here and there and a few fire hoses that malfunctioned when needed. The book is an unsparing account of what it was like to be an immigrant sweatshop worker, which was only a short step above slavery and so grim you might wish to perish in a fire. My Sicilian grandmother Maria Sgalambro was one of those workers doing a piecemeal jobs on a foot-pumped cast-iron sewing machine that we later kept in our house like some kind of trophy. But she worked at home sewing ornamental collars on shirtwaists (blouses), not in a factory. My mother was born in a tenement on what is now the Silk Stocking district, the Upper East Side. Like many immigrant families, her's moved often to take advantage of a month's free rent offered by landlords during the Great Depression. On another personal note, I just moved my office to the sixth floor of a building constructed in 1892. After reading this, I plan to install a coiled rope anchored on the balcony. The writer (a Washington Post reporter) does a very good job with grim subjects: not just the grisly details of the fire (of 146 deaths, about half were burns and the other half jumped eight stories or fell off a failed fire escape); but Russian pograms and the Southern Italian droughts and volcanos (factors that drove Jews and Sicilians to emigrate); tenements, sweatshops, arson and the complicit role of insurance companies who discouraged fire safety; and the sorting out of charred and crushed bodies on the piers of Manhattan (a ghastly scene re-created on a larger scale after 9/11). These details are so unstinting that I had to skim a few sections. I am just getting to the part about building code reform and the rise of union power. This history is well-rooted in my New York Italian family and that of our Unionist Irish in-laws the Powers. This makes family lore frightening real. ""Triangle"" is also an excellent companion to Richard Price's novel ""Lush Life,"" a tale of Lower East Side gentrification haunted by tenement ghosts.

Gladwell is a skilled storyteller who brings characters from different walks of life -- airline pilots, software geniuses, nuclear scientists, the Beatles, and finally and most touchingly, his Jamaican grandparents and parents--into strong focus. The lessons learned are as rock-solid and eternal as last night's (9/8/09) Obama platitudithon delivered to (some of) the students of America. Hard work is rewarded. Success requires a little genius, a little luck. Practical intelligence--the ability to negotiate, to maneuver, even to cajole--is just as important as IQ. Who can disagree? Just read the book.

This is still worth a scan if you want to understand more about the rise of Brazil Russia India China (BRIC), which he enumerates in terse historical detail.

My curiosity was further piqued by the Dead-centric ""Psychedelic Posters"" exhibit at the Denver Art Museum. To learn more about the band and its legacy I picked up this book on Goodreads' recommendation. I was dismayed to learn that the author served as the Dead's publicist during the mid-late Jerry era. That did not bode well for a balanced or thorough bio. But Dennis McNally is also a biographer of Jack Kerouac. He is up to the task of describing and evoking the 1960s Bay Area beat/folk/jug band/psychedia/hippie scene with such figures as Ken Kesey, Neal Cassady, Timothy Leary interlaced with Jerry and the Dead. His writing is concrete and vivid (albeit a bit pompous) with dazzling re-creations of dozens of long-lost encounters and, yes, ""happenings.""The first 100 pages are a savvy you-are-there recounting of this scene. They read more like intellectual history than a typical rock-fan book. The discussion of arcane philosphical constructs must leave a few Deadhead scratching their dredlocks. Then LSD comes into the picture and this becomes a book about taking drugs. The Dead and their cohorts must have ingested more drugs than food. A good trip becomes a bummmer fast. I tuned out and dropped out save scanning for key points. What creative circumstances and energy went into the back-to-back masterpieces ""Workingman's Dead"" and ""American Beauty""? How did Jerry, the passive leader, handle trying to kick Bob Weir and Pigpen out of the band? What is 'China Doll' about? The answers are there, satisfyingly rendered, And now I am done with ""A Long Strange Trip."" My own reassessment of the Dead: the jam-band tag is unfortunate. Although Phil Lesh, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Kreutzman are very good musicians, they are not good enough to sustain 45-minute C-chord jams. Trained in contemporary classical composition and jazz, Lesh led the band into Space Music, but he was not successful in competing with his hero Stockhausen or his contemporary Steve Reich. They were inspired by John Coltrane but do not ascend to anything near that level. And none of them can sing a lick. What makes them rise above the jam-band scene they spawned is some excellent songwriting, which at its best rivals Bob Dylan and the Band in telling the memorable stories of losers toiling in coal mines and freight yards. McNally does a great job recalling the Berkeley folk scene that led Garcia and Robert Hunter to pen such timeless songs as ""Cumberland Blues."" The Dead's reputation may rest on Americana, no psychedelia. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 13, 2009","Jul 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7283.A_Long_Strange_Trip

Rockefeller, Harry Sinclair, Winston Churchill, King FaisaOil is the thread connecting 130 years of global history through such characters as John D. Rockefeller, Harry Sinclair, Winston Churchill, King Faisal, Warren G. Harding, T.E. Lawrence and many more. Our oil addiction stemmed from the discovery of oil ""seep fields"" (think of teh Beverly Hillbillilies ""bubblin' crude"") in Western Pa. The original oil boom sought to exploit kerosene as an improvement over whale oil burning in lamps. Oil fever waxed and waned until the commercialization of internal combustion, which transformed the US in a mere decade and is still transforming the world. The story of oil is the story of huge historical themes and events: the rise and fall and rise of monopolies in the U.S.; the Bolshevik revolution; and the colonization of ""protectorates"" in Mesopotamia to create states like Iraq. Oil was the lynchpin resource of both World Wars. In WWII the Allies destroyed Rumanian oilfields in a race against time against marching Germans and Turks. In a lesser-known variation on the Miracle of Dunkirk, the French discovered the utility of internal combustion when the military drafted thousands of Parisian cab drivers to transport troops to the front against marching Germans. Without this improvised troop movements (and yes the cabbies were encouraged to run their meters), the Germans could have easily taken the capital and possibly ended the war with a different result. Suddenly cavalry was ""out."" Tanks (a code name that stuck) were invented to break the gridlock imposed by trench warfare. Internal combustion also fueled dogfights in the sky. In months airplanes went from unreliable toys to 150 mph fighting machines, which were made obsolete by a new generation of war planes in only another six months. In WWII we outproduced the Axis as much as defeated them. Yergin set out to depict a fascinating historical sweep through an oil-filled prism. He is partially successful. He vividly recreates characters like Rockefeller, Teddy Roosevelt, and Marcus Samuel, the founder of Shell Oil who got his start selling curios and souvenirs covered in glued-on sea shells and also became Mayor of London. But the journey feels more episodic than sweeping as this very looonnnggg book is splintered into two- and three-page chapters, almost each commandeered by a new Superhero/Master of the Business or Political Universe. He also over-focuses on the business dealings of Big Oil, sometimes to the point of tedium but often to the exclusion of the social side of the story, such as: What was really happening in Mesopotamia while the region was being pawned between England and France? Oddly Yergin's chapter on the rise of the drive-through gas station is more compelling than his re-creation of this ""Great Game"" between superpowers. Still there is much fascinating between these pages and I will soldier on through completion--I'm up to about 1928, or page 224. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jul 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/169354.The_Prize

The search leads them across enemy lines into cahoots with resistance fighters and then into the hands of the Nazis. If you care about things like this, the book lingers in some not-unpleasant DMZ between pulp fiction and literature. There's lots of crackling Rambo-like action but also a clever novel-within-a-novel and many references, tacit and explicit, to Russian literature.

There is sexually explicit and bodily function gross-out humor that wears thin. Yetthe book is suspenseful, even gripping, and contains memorable characters. Despite the unsparing treatment of a grim subject--not just war, but what people resort to during war and a city under siege, this is entertaining and even hopeful.

It steers close to being a crime novel a la George Pelicanos (that's a compliment) except the cops are far more inept. The setting is Alphabet City on the Lower East Side where gentrification is colliding with tenements and housing projects and their residents. Symbolic of this clash, a couple of project hoods knock off a bartender who refuses to hand over his wallet during a stickup. The closest thing to a likeable character is Matty Clark, the overly empathetic Irish-American detective put on the case. Matty badly muffs the investigation by following a false lead too far and alienating his star witness Eric Cash, a failed writer just coming to grips with his career as a waiter. Price can be impressionistic with his characters and settings; his physical descriptions of the Lower East Side are hazy, for example. Oddly enough he really shines when describing the (usually grimy) interiors of buildings and homes but the street settings are pencilled in. Still the book pulls you along well enough, partly by sheer din of human foible. Just when you start really liking and rooting for a character they completely mess up. This reminds me also of The Wire (which also has Pelicanos fingerprints) where half the cops are brilliant but because of their own weaknesses and blindspots don't really perform any better than the drunken ward-heelers who are their colleagues. Both groups are snagged in the same bureaucratic snafus where public officials caught in the media glare are ""just like the roaches in your kitchen when you turn on the light, scampering under the oven."" Is this a character study or a literary crime mystery story? Doesn't matter.

She does not attempt re-appraisal or re-interpretation and openly ackowledges previous works by Brendan Gill and Meryl Secrist, as well as Wright's own autobiography. In a sense this makes this more book report that book, but the brevity is a blessing. Although the book is engaging, you're real eager to get away from Wright and all his pompous creepiness. Ada Louise's real accomplishment is to separate the genius of Wright's work from the shallowness of his thought and deed. And the self-taught Wright, who eschewed Beaux-Arts architectural training in Paris, has to be one of the shallowest geniuses ever. Yet what he produced over a remarkable 70 years was almost always a game-changer with lessons still being absorbed and misunderstood today.

Why we invaded there first and not directly Europe (disastrous pre-Normandy landing at Dieppe, etc.). Atkinson is quite a good writer who vividly brings to life such characters as Eisenhower and DeGaulle plus dozens of minor players you never heard of or who are killed shortly after being introduced.Like the Vietnam writing of Tim O'Brien, Atkinson does not emphasize the heroism of war. Instead it's really just a bloody disorganized fragging mess full of things like cargo ships sloppily retrofitted with a couple of steel plates and then sent on suicide missions into Oran harbor. The description of the marshaling of materiel for the African invasions would be side-splittingly Michael Frayn-screwball-slapstick funny if not so pathetic. I will get back to this book so I can earn the right to read part II on the invasion of Sicily. Direct interest: My Sicilian mother and her parents strongly considered moving back to the Old Country in 1939. My mother and Nana took a steamer over and checked it out thoroughly.

People would become extinct if not for the chance that a small colony survives on the uninhabited islands of Galapagos, of all places. They wind up there when ""the nature cruise of the century"" goes badly awry and quickly devolve into semi-aquatic creatures who leave most of civilized thinking, mores, customs, tools and technologies behind. Vonnegut's premise is that civilizations and people have over-evolved in ways that negate Darwin's laws of natural selection: hence as we get more advanced and sophisticated we actually become weaker. The story is pretty good, although told in an arch, intentionally and irritatingly repetitive shaggy-dog style. The thinking is both profound and bumper-sticker simplistic (""war is bad,"" ""greed is bad"").

Spent my time listening to atonal jazz and attending Fassbinder film festivals. In my more middlebrow middle-age I cocked a resentful brow when Martin showed up as New Yorker essayist. Does the inventor of catchphrase comedy (No I won't excuuuusssssee you) and star of ""The Jerk"" and hideous overpopulation comedies like ""Parenthood"" and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" deserve this lofty perch? Couldn't I, for example, do a better job? The answers in order are 1) almost and 2) no. Turns out Martin is a pretty thoughtful guy. The first part of the book is an insightful dissection of ""what is funny"" mixed in with a revealing autobiography. (I always wondered what kind of person would make movies like ""Parenthood"" and the answer is: Someone who had a relatively unhappy childhood ... dinners over stone silence, an airhead mom and a resentful, real estate-shucking dad quick with the belt.)Martin was the first mega-star comedian. Borne of a pre-comedy club era, he parlayed SNL success into arena gigs, once drawing 45,000 to the Nassau Coliseum in three days. After a near heart attack and sense of lost connection with his audience, he abruptly calls it quits after only a couple of years of true success. When ""The Jerk"" hits big (despite awful s from people like me who attend Fassbinder festivals), the decision becomes an easy stick.Enamored of collegiate philosphy, literature and agit-prop art, Martin claims he introduced conceptual, largely physical, post-punch-line comedy to a mass audience. I'm not so sure. He does cite a number of schticks with payoff lines belted from the borscht. I always thought of him as a kind of neocon comic, not an iconoclast like George Carlin or Richard Pryor. We do have him to thank for a generation of sneering irony. The books tails off toward a skimmable end heavy on show-biz name-dropping, replete with tributes to Sammy Davis Jr. and Johnny Carson. The alternative comic is now part of the establishment; the vulnerability that make the earlier part of the book engrossing gives way to glibness and a sense he's leaving out the good stuff.

This book does not do justice to its topic. It focuses on one aspect of New Urbanism--the development of new suburbs that are more compact, diverse and walkable than typical master-planned, garage-dominated, cul-de-sac suburbia. The author walks you through every step of finance, zoning, design, planning and construction of a subdivision called New Dalesville in Chester County, Pa. One of the book's weaknesses is that the main characters--the developer and his planners--just aren't that interesting. Or maybe they are but they do not face any major travails or dramas in getting their project approved. In any case much of the book's ""action"" takes place in planning board hearings that are essentially transcripted. In every other chapter the author takes off on a ""bigger subject""--how suburbs came to be, why we live in houses, etc. Rybcinski's weakness as an urban thinker has always been that he tries to be a realist but winds up being an apologist for business as usual--Phoenix is not really sprawl, suburban development simply responds to the marketplace, etc. He regurgitates the usual Independence Institute drivel about how the country is still 95 % empty so why worry about growth patterns? Unfortunately this type of thinking got us where we are today--facing crises in climate, housing, energy, infrastructure, education. The way we live, where we live and how we get around do matter.I recommend this book as a primer to anyone interested in how and why suburbs get built. He does walk you through this process clearly. I also recommend, ""A Clearing in the Distance,"" a great biography by Rybcynski of Frederick Law Olmsted--abolitionist, experimental farmer, landscape architect of Central Park and many great city park systems, co-founder of the National Park system, co-creator of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. This is a remarkable book and a true life & times. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2008","Oct 08, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15588.Last_Harvest

The swift, clean narrative is not his strength--he often introduces too many characters (and then drops them with no resolve) and twists and thus loses the thread of the story. His descriptions of engineering feats (supposedly his strong point) also get foggy. The inclusion of phrases like ""Be that as it may"" and ""He himself"" drives me batso. Still this is an amazing portrait of Brooklyn, 19th-century NY life, the Roeblings. I will visit NY next month and hope to clutch a copy of this book while walking across the Brooklyn Bridge promenade to the Heights. Update: McCullough also tends to dits around before getting to the core of his subject. In this case: the sinking of the caissons in the East River muck needed to anchor the two bridge towers. This middle section of the book is fantastic reading. Now I'm doing my best (on about page 350) to get excited about stringing the wiring. Similarily, in ""The Path Between the Seas,"" the book picked up with the intro of a central character, Theodore Roosevelt, who was dropped like a cheap date and replaced by the narcolepsy-inducing William Howard Taft. And again once the major challenges were overcome (malaria, the Culumbra cut) the book still has 200 pages to go.Still well worth reading; I just have a headache after drinking too much wine last night while friends showed a fascinating (but endless) slide show of a Nepal trek. And I did not walk over the bridge clutching the book; I passed it on the N train en route to Bensonhurst. The bridge remains the most delicate and beautiful and inspiring thing in NYC--especially when you realize those 284-foot-high towers that have stood for 132 years are load-bearing masonry. Jan 30 2008 update: I finally gave up on this book. Too much about wires and cables. Still at its best a fascinating portrait of 19th century life in NYC and the USA. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 30, 2008","Oct 08, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2369.The_Great_Bridge

The subject is fascinating--the history of the ""A"" list Tin Pan Alley songs and their composers, what makes them great, and why we keep coming back to them (yes, even Linda Rondstadt and Rod Stewart). Yet the author seems to have done no research. For example, I finished the chapter on Irving Berlin and know nothing more about him than I did. How did he write great music when he couldn't read it or really play the piano? Where did he get his ideas for lyrics? The author barely even quotes from lyrics much less analyze them. Instead we get half-baked bios that are gossipy but not juicy, with some spliced-in sociology (Jews and blacks hated each other but stole from each other). The book reads like an unedited transcript of a long (and I mean loonnngg) dictation from a lively but superannuated mind no longer fully in possesion of his memory. This joins ""Absurdistan,"" ""Post War,"" ""Pillars of the Earth"" on my ever-growing list of discards.

I avoided the book for a while because it sounded inevitable and depressing. It's actually tart and delicious, with dozens of well-drawn characters.

When the Prince escapes to a high-class whorehouse in Palermo, he takes along a priest as cover.

The prose is so good that I am almost able to forget Ken Follet. PS--I finished the book and have to take a 1/2 star off. I don't think it reads like a finished ms. Too many loose ends and plot fast-forwards. The climax is really an anti-climactic afterthought. I also could not see the difference between pre- and post-Garibaldi life in aristocratic Sicily.

He loves his wife but lusts for the witch, then goes back to focusing on his lesions.As the family nears starvation, the wife goes into labor in the gelid forest and dies in childbirth. The baby lives. The mason abandons him and staggers off into the forest. The witch-babe comes upon the mason for a brief prurient-interest sex scene. She's on top and her breasts swell to his touch. You get the idea. Then she feeds the builder and his kids soup in her cave, which is appointed like Hugh Hefner's ""After Dark"" lounge. The baby is then rescued by monks who feed it by dipping a cloth into goat milk and letting the lad suckle. The monks seemed relieved from their daily routine of plain song (oh, for a drum sample!), beer brewing and long, steamy group showers. They quickly devolve into bitchy ""Three Men and a Baby"" behavior. This book is 124,000 pages long and I am on page 98. Why I am reading it? 1) Hanging out with my father-in-law in hospice.

Once these fun and games are over, he he plods through a series of Weighty Topics (economics, socialism, industrialization, etc) nation-by-nation in almost exactly the same sequence: England did this, Italy did that. His attempts to leaven the load with analysis of pop culture is risable, esp. his takes on Italian cinema and the British Mod scene.

Judt tells you plenty about the Marshall Plan but never explains who Marshall was, what he looked like, or how he invented the plan. In short, the book has the personality of, well, Brussels. What I learned: We Americans think Europeans inherited a trememdous transporation infrastructure as a birthright, and that we could never catch up even with major investments (hence we are stuck in our cars on gridlocked highways with no options). In fact almost all of Europe's rail (to say nothing of rolling stock) and even highway infrastructure was destroyed in WW II and has been rebuilt since. Once again: GO USA!

A Nike employee with a conscience tries to turn state's evidence and discovers, of course, there is no state, unwittingly precipating a Smackdown among the two biggest corporate giants. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2006,"Apr 04, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33356.Jennifer_Government

The group has waxed and waned and we even had a member die inSince 1995 I have been in an architecture book group of friends from Boulder and Denver. The group has waxed and waned and we even had a member die in 2005. The value of the group is that we read books I would not even have heard of otherwise. Some are abstract architectural tracts with all the readability of legal notices. This book is one of the better ones. Kahn's story is most popularly known through the documentary My Architect, by his bastard son Nathaniel. This book goes lightly over the ground of Kahn's quasi-bigamy and focuses on his creation of monumental buildings in India, Bangladesh, Philadephia, Fort Worth, and San Diego, among others. The book's main strength is that is is clear-eyed; the author does not idolize Kahn, who is revered in architecture as a mystical figure. This is also the book's main weakness. In revealing Kahn's may flaws, he books a huge chink into the legacy. For example, Kahn was notoriously impractical and many of his buildings simply did not work functionally or for the comfort of occupants. For example, the Phillips Exeter Academy had to spent $7 million to fix Kahn's mid-1960s library, which was built without insulation in New Hampshire. Ultimately Kahn comes off us as the consummately arrogant modern architect designing his buildings without concern for occupants, site, comfort, budget, or durability of materials. I have seen one Kahn building--the Salk Reserch Center in La Jolla, Calif.--and admired it greatly. He emerges from this portrait as a tarnished angel. And maybe that's okay. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2008,"Apr 04, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/369471.Louis_I_Kahn
