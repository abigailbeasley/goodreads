Nothing feels colder or more bleak and hopeless than the setting of this detective novel, which takes place at Christmas but feels more like the deadest of dead winters in a smallish village in the 1950s, where Protestants are despised and where they equally disdain the Catholics and their power. So the vibe is there and I'd read more novels with St. John Strafford as the lead. All of the women in this novel, however, are mentally ill, frigid, or sex-crazed (or just middle-aged with zero personality). The men are varied but traumatized, repressed. The story is good and I think I'll long remember reading this one, but some aspects of it left me dissatisfied. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 20, 2024","Mar 12, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50353739-snow

Famous real life historical personages and fictional ones, as well, gather on a British island to investigate the disappearance of a whole family in the early 1900s. Some of the group are sceptics and others are agnostic. So it's a good setup. But the execution didn't pay off. The female characters in particular were unnuanced and their dialogue was flat. There was a lot of atmospheric tension and a good representation of the development of new technology cloaked by the trend of spiritualism of the time. But the conclusion, and in particular the ending, absolutely did not work for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2024","Feb 02, 2024","Jan 29, 2024",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/58502749-no-one-goes-alone

The narratoFaith is a solid, thoughtful novel about a family in crisis caused in part by the Catholic Church abuse revelations in Boston around 2002. The narrator is Sheila, a single woman in her thirties who has two brothers. She slowly reveals their story by looking back at her family through the years leading up to an allegation against her brother, a priest, Arthur, and how it affects them and their already terse communications. What sticks out to me are the particularities of the neighborhood and how the politics of the Church dominates everyday life for its parishioners until scrutiny causes people like Sheila to move far away from its prying eyes. This is a book I looked forward to returning to because of its strong characters and observations. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 07, 2024","Jan 11, 2024","Jan 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9592213-faith

In a couple of cases, the stories felt like they might still be in need of more polishing and development. Furthermore, it is one of my biggest pet peeves that chapters of novels are treated as short stories, even if the writing is excellent. The short story as its own artform should be celebrated and knowing that a ""story"" is a chapter of a novel removes the context that situates it into a greater work.

So this time around, I found a funny satire about the world of literary fame and scholarship. Four characters have a vested personal interest in the life and poetry of a tragic self-taught poet named Mary Swann, who was tragically murdered by her husband and left little trace of her life aside from the poems she wrote on scraps of paper. Each of the four gets their own section and we learn all about them. However, the form takes a jarring turn for the final quarter of the book from straight narrative into a more meta take via screenplay and for me, it doesn’t work and in fact derails the novel. So what was rather pleasurable becomes more tedious. The pleasure of Shields’ prose work in the earlier sections foretells her (better) novels to come. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 13, 2023","Dec 27, 2023","Dec 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/368499.Swann

The first two are connected in an odd way and play off of each other as a woman in a lonely marriage recounts a previous boyfriend who was physically abusive. In the first, there's a detachment and it plays with language and form, but in the second more conventional narrative, the same protagonist follows the same abusive boyfriend around town years later to enact a form of vengeance. The stories I'll remember for a long time are G, The Returning, and Peking Duck, which is an examination of stories and authorship as a writer uses one of her mother's actual life events to build a story of her own. When we get to the final scene, there's a lot to think about. I can't wait to see which story is featured in Best American Short Stories 2023, ed. Min Jin Lee.

It focuses on a love story between the two main characters who are gay and mostly trying to hide their sexuality. For me, the writing lacks emotional truth and feels like it owes an enormous debt to Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy, though those books are not mentioned in the acknowledgments. In any case, the comparison is inevitable and the older novels are much more complex and interesting on literary, historical, and psychological levels. ...more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,"Oct 02, 2023","Oct 08, 2023","Aug 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59948520-in-memoriam

You (she) tells her life in an stream of consciousness style that slowly reveals the details of family life, what it's like in school and dreaming and laughing with other people in the town. When the older sister Emma's comes home for a visit, there is a shift as the parents are confronted with Emma's adult life and choices, and this deeply affects their relationship with the narrator, as well. It's a relatively short novel with a cataclysmic escalation of disappointments.

The narrative tone stays consistent from beginning to end. How the characters, just coming out of grad school, are on the precipice of the next phase of their lives and they are unsure of themselves or the choices they've made, which feels true to life. Most of the group of loose friends are gay and there is a fluidity to connections and disconnections.The novel examines nuances in race and class identities but doesn't sacrifice the specificity of each character. What I liked less:There were many characters and none of them are the protagonist of the novel, so there is no central focus. There is also no central plot other than the one that surrounds a looming end to grad school. It was sometimes hard to remember who was who. In that sense, it felt more like connected short stories. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 22, 2023","Jun 27, 2023","Jun 22, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62092265-the-late-americans

There is one character who is essentially the center of the universe for his sister, her husband, and her children. Everyone loves Robbie and Robbie loves them all in return. But as far as affection goes between all the other characters? Isabel and her husband, Dan? No. Isabel and her children? No. Isabel is depressed and detached and that's before they are all quarantined. There is a lot to be revealed in faked social media posts, unsent letters, texts, and long stretches of chilly conversation. Perhaps that's one of the points of this story, that we are all disconnected from our real lives due in part to fear of the future, the hard reality of the present, and the romance-tinged memories of the past.

In the case of Burkhard Bilger, his curiosity and drive to find out more about his grandfather's role as a Nazi official during the terrible times of World War II took him to the Alsace area between France and Germany. From his research and dogged determination, he is able to write this fantastic memoir. Was his grandfather a despot or a pragmatic and compassionate man? Where were the facts, in stories told by villagers, in archives, in the accusations of a striving politician to enact revenge? All of this comes out in the telling, along with lots of interesting history of the area and its vacillating control by French and German rulers.

Blakinger is able to quit taking drugs and finally find a way to deal with it all by becoming an advocacy journalist to expose the greatest inequities of our prison system.

But in a recent By the Book, Rebecca Makkai answered the question What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of by saying: ""It’s not that unknown, but everyone’s out here loving Jennifer Egan and somehow not reading 'The Keep,' her best and weirdest novel. She gets away with things no one has any right to get away with; that’s my favorite kind of book."" And then a bunch of writers I like on Twitter talked about that response and raved about The Keep and I had a severe moment of Fear of Missing Out and so I saw that I owned the book already and I had no excuse not to try it again. And I wasn't disappointed.The pleasure of this short novel is the writing and the puzzles the story is presenting. The writing itself is lively and full of the energy of its characters as they strive and obsess and get into their own heads. And it all comes to a head near the end. So satisfying.

Highly recommended.The Romantic is engrossing historical fiction and the latest of William Boyd's whole-life novels that recounts the remarkable life of Cashel Ross. The frame story, set by an introduction by the author, posits that he, ""WB"" was given a packet of documents, drawings, diaries, and clippings that chronicle Ross's life (and a lot of the history of technological advances like train travel) starting in 1800 in Ireland.Ross has a questionable origin story and is impetuous, ruled by his heart and not always his intellect. He is also a lovable character and his adventures take him all over Europe and to the United States, introducing the reader to some real-life historical figures such as Mary Shelley and Byron, as well as lesser-known historical events. Ross is driven by a romantic entanglement that propels him from place to place, always looking for his first love in the faces of others. Boyd's writing, as ever, is full of detail and emotion. Much of the story is funny, though there are melancholy episodes as he hops from one profession to another, including being a soldier, an explorer, a farmer, and a diplomat.For readers who loved ""Any Human Heart,"" this novel will satisfy that thirst for a strong central character and lots of historical detail.Thanks to Netgalley and Penguin books for an advance copy of this novel in exchange for a fair ....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jul 05, 2023","Feb 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60049861-the-romantic

So few families are chosen for this event that most will never have the chance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2023",Feb 2023,"Jan 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56269286-the-waiting

And there is an alluring element in Norwegian Wood and the way the prose is written that weaves an enchanting pathway. Yet in this novel, there are sexually immature preoccupations and death fixations that the rest of the story can't overcome. And since this one didn't include much else in the way of plot (no cults, no double moons, no slow chopping of vegetables) it didn't work. It had too much teenage boy fantasy to lend itself to strong female characters, and has an unnecessarily enigmatic ending.*I did like the references to The Magic Mountain and its security of long sanitarium stays.**I do not recommend the audiobook.

She is a novelist and professor who teaches at an Iowa University (just like the author) and is in her later child-bearing years. She has suffered a miscarriage before she had a daughter. Mix in real-life elements like climate change, bioethics, Covid, and the severe threat to women's reproductive freedom and the novel becomes a direct examination of the state of our lives in the moment without allowing us to see anything beyond character's viewpoint. Mary Shelley becomes a touchstone for the narrator, both her life and the creation of the novel, Frankenstein.

Over the six months of the journal, Valeria examines her life, the weaknesses of her children and husband, the severity of her own mother's judgment against her, and her abject loneliness in her role as a woman of the time. The author herself was a feminist anti-fascist who was arrested for her protests against the Italian government and who also kept diaries that later influenced other writers like Elena Ferrante.

And I had to ask myself if the novel was telling me that what I've been reading is farcical rather than a wrenching examination of griefs of all kinds. Because I think that's what I got out of it, around the slapstick dialog, a deep well of loneliness and loss. Finn is a late middle-aged teacher whose romantic partner Lily has been suicidal for a long time. The story is set right before the calamitous election of 2016, years before Covid, too, though I felt ghosts of oncoming loss from that terrible first year seep in through the prose, as well. Finn is visiting his dying brother in a hospice and gets word he must come home and deal with Lily. How much to give away here? I am not going into the plot, but it takes a bizarre turn from realism to what feels like a fevered dream of a road trip. And the OTHER part of the novel is a series of letters from the post-Civil War era from a boardinghouse owner to her sister, mostly about her troublesome tenant, a la Faulkner. I do not know that those parts of the story did anything for me but distract from Finn and Lily's swansong. There are some gorgeous passages that carried me along, but I'm still trying to figure out if there was something I missed. I love Lorrie Moore's short stories and wish this were more like those.

This collection of stories is about relationships in various forms: parents/children; divorced couples; co-workers.

Another is about an a small life adventure at an airport after all the flights have been cancelled. Every once in a while, there will be a sharp jolt of recognition by the character about the reality of existence.

I liked it enough to want to know what would happen at the end, but had to make a chart to keep all of the characters and their relationships to each other straight. ...more",Notes are private!,1,10,1,"Nov 14, 2022","Nov 18, 2022","Nov 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60254211-flight

I stayed up way too late and then finished it this morning. Here is what made this book so good:1. The writing. It's lively, honest, and the dialogue isn't stylized. 2. It grapples with moral issues revolving fundamental Christianity but isn't at all trying to preach anything other than love.3. The strong main character Corinne won't compromise her values but still wants to be loved and accepted by her family. Her love interest is frustrating in the best way--he is so torn over the way he was raised and his deep love for Corinne.4.

Sally is a comedy writer on an SNL-like late night comedy show and this is where the story shines. I love workplace stories, and this lays out how the show is structured, some of the politics, and how the show's producer is odd and commanding without being (totally) a tryant. The guest host rock star Noah works with Sally on some sketches and they have chemistry. But Sally messes it up. Then Covid hits. There is sufficient conflict and lots of inner-turmoil; the characters shine through. I might prefer Sittenfeld's deep dives into the imagined lives of real people, but this was fun and fulfilling.

The protagonist relates a period where she is given leisure time (through a loveless marriage to a wealthy man) to practice writing. She is not interested in the commerce of writing and seems to have no will to publish, but because she is no longer a cleaner in an art gallery, she has all the free time and resources she requires to contemplate visual art and then write about what she sees. Her closest relationships are to other women, one of whom is a dancer, and another friend who goes with her to listen to music. Through painting, dance, and performance, the narrator finds in herself the ability to make a choice for her own life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 13, 2023","Mar 28, 2023","Oct 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45892263-indelicacy

In this collection, however, the collection is highly curated by Valeria Luiselli and features specific themes, much of it about the beginnings of Covid, and highlights ten stories in translation from Spanish, Russian, Norwegian, Polish, Hebrew, Bengali, and Greek authors. There are surprises in mood and tone; a couple of the stories are absurdist and a couple of them are about writing and storytelling themselves. There is an amazing/puzzling/thrilling/grotesque long form story about two characters who meet during the fall of the Soviets (Horse Soup) that I'm not sure I completely understood but was riveted by. And there is new work by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie about ghosting and a Covid-set family story by Lorrie Moore. I am inspired to read more of some of these writers' works.

Sullivan relays the changes that have come to the profession with the advent of social media and of the deepening cultural divide in our country.

There isn't much gossip but we do get to know some of the people in power and the struggle to put out ethical stories pitted against profit.

Prior desperately wants to return to battle after a stay in the hospital to treat his war trauma. He has a chance to work in an office in London but rejects that idea and goes back to France to fight with his regiment.In the meantime, Rivers continues to take care of war-torn patients and recall his visit to a group of native people in Melanesia. The narrative moves back and forth between Rivers in the past and present, and Billy Prior's experiences. There are shared themes and brutalities in each part. Barker's style is descriptive and portent with emotion. It is an indictment of war and colonialism, all about men in the throes of crisis: physical, spiritual, and emotional. This was nothing like I expected, a war novel about human misery and connection. The whole series is brilliant and this final volume pulls everything together. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 09, 2022",Sep 2022,"Aug 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/151926.The_Ghost_Road

The characters, particularly the three characters the book is focused on, are drawn with such care. Agnes Lee, whom I consider the heart and soul of the book is in her eighties, a writer, and an unconventional woman who is unafraid to ruffle the sensibilities of her family and community. Her lifelong best friend, Polly, is always trying to do the right thing, and always giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, to her peril. They meet a young woman named Maud who is capable of injecting new life into what could be staid. The Maine setting, too, is essential, as is the land that generations ago was structured to be a protected land trust for families to visit and pass down as inheritance one generation to the next. So we've got what could be a formulaic family saga but it is much more. In spending so much time with the characters, we watch them struggle, and even in their old age, grow.It's best to go into this novel without knowing much. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 16, 2022","Jul 26, 2022","Jul 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58438505-fellowship-point

In the early part of the novel, his wife has abandoned him with an infant and few answers, and he must learn how to navigate that loss, which is mixed up with his conflicted feelings of another betrayal that happened when he was a teen. Baines is also affected by world events as they happen; Chernobyl, the fall of the Soviet Empire, and many more, but it's the personal that dominates the bulk of his observations, desires, and sorrows.

One is a painter and the other a linguist with a lot of emotional baggage. It takes place in 1979 and the novel matter-of-factly recounts brutal murders between unionists and nationalists in an escalating cycle of mayhem. But that's not the bulk of the story, which is more personal and claustrophobic when it focuses on the island-bound subjects. The narrative easily passes off between four main characters and gives access to each one's stream of consciousness perspective revealing their motivations and capacity to hurt one another. Art, cultural identity, gender roles, and paternalism are major themes and it becomes clear who is deserving of sympathy as the tensions rise....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 30, 2022","Dec 08, 2022","Jun 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57977494-the-colony

All the characters in the stories are middle-aged parents, mostly fathers, who find themselves shut off from the world starting in March 2020. Some couples use the opportunity to grow closer, and some to break off from tired relationships. One man suffers from a panic attack and remembers something hard from his childhood. One father decides to break curfew and go find his drug-addicted son in Dublin. Doyle is the perfect narrator for these stories; I could listen to him all day long. It is possible that readers might not want to look back so soon at the moments when we didn't know what to expect from global catastrophe. But it feels somehow familiar, comforting.

Karr's exaggerated storytelling (in the style sense) works well for these larger than life characters who happened to be real people. I particularly like how she admits she's forgotten some of the details and owns up to some of the slippery facts of memoir writing. It's a great book to read for an example of shaping the sentences for great effect. This was a re-read, though I remembered essentially none of the book from the decades-past first go-around.

Robin Black, herself a novelist and short fiction author, examines the craft in this long-revered classic. But she goes beyond just how the novel was written. She is able to describe how she interprets Mrs. Dalloway down to the bones of the sentence level and what is possibly left out of the narrative and why. Why is Septimus Smith featured in the novel? Is it okay to be bored by Clarissa's daughter, Elizabeth, and why might that be? Why do readers get so hung up and judgmental about the depiction of mothers in Woolf's and in Black's work? There is a tension here between reading and writing and living, and what it did for me is to remind me how much I enjoy thinking about it on different levels: how/when/where/why we read.

They had reconnected (the story of which was recounted in ""Oh William"") and he told her that he wanted to save her life. And so we hear Lucy recount what happened over that first year, good and bad things that were happening to people they loved and remembering other things that had affected her life. She captures the uncertainty and disorientation of the pandemic and also the deep political divide that widened in America. Lucy is here in this story as it reaches out and asks for empathy and acceptance, to confront the past and figure out a way to move ahead.

It is historical fiction about two of Charles Dickens' sons who are sent off to Australia to make their own lives in the world of sheep ranching. The first person narrator, Edward ""Plorn"" Dickens, is the youngest child of ten and Keneally has imbued him with emotional sensitivity and youthful exuberance as he arrives in the colony right before he turns seventeen. So it's both a coming of age novel and a fish out of water story, with the added benefit of Plorn's ambivalence in being a Dickens son who has yet to read any of his father's novels. Everywhere he goes, people quote their favorite passages and recount their favorite characters in the Dickens oeuvre, and young Plorn has to pretend to go along. The novel brings the bushland to life and doesn't neglect to address the harms done to Australia's native people under the strong arm of Britain. It's funny in the Dickensian sense and a novel I couldn't wait to return to.

In this story, we see the excruciating process for Elena to take medication, wait for it to kick in, then travel by bus and cab on her trip. She can see the world only from the waist down and as she moves, she remembers moments from the past and discussions she's had with her now-deceased daughter. The lives of three women unfold as Elena reaches her destination. So good! But it's brutal and no one is spared from examination, including a powerful patriarchal society that makes rules for women that force them to submit.

So it succeeds in getting a reader like me interested in von Arnim's life and work. Von Arnim was a wildly successful novelist who (seemingly) weaves her own life into her books. The author of this memoir, Gabrielle Carey, however, projects her own life events onto the ones in von Arnim's, with flimsy analysis and specious, vapid proclamations. One of the most egregious is that von Arnim couldn't have been depressed/unhappy during a particular point in her life because it was then that she wrote her most happy novel. I'm glad I read it and want to know more about the von Arnim circle of friends/lovers like HG Wells and the Russell brothers and other literary luminaries of the time, but this book could have been so much more in its execution. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 11, 2022","Apr 21, 2022","Feb 17, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54876680-only-happiness-here

Overall, it's an incredible novel highlighting our need for love and our inevitable folly. 1. The novel's main character, Bjartur, is selfish, lacking empathy, and misogynistic but has such a fool-like nature that it's impossible to despise him despite his flaws. His refusal to listen to anyone else in regard to anything leads to many tragic events.2. There are incredible passages of beauty and wonder. 3. Other characters in the novel, notably Bjartur's children, are nuanced and individual. The eldest daughter, Asta, is established early on as a dreamer thwarted by her place in their society. 4.

In this examination, she conveys her sincere desire to question and understand her parents for their toxic beliefs about race and religion, and for actions her parents took that did actual harm to their children. Newton's colorful extended family is part of the subject of inquiry, the good and not so good. And she makes a case for what tendencies, physical and emotional, she might have inherited.Newton also discusses genetics and some of the theories of genetic trauma that might be ensconced in brains decades or even centuries later, patterns of behavior that are sometimes repeated, and, finally, a real effort to connect to ancestors through guided meditation. This attempt to communicate with spirits is one of my favorite parts of the book; whether there was something ""there"" or it was a product of her mind doesn't much matter to me. I liked hearing about the experiences the intentions behind them.Readers are sure to consider their own family histories and how to perhaps forgive past generations for terribly wrongs.

I am torn about how I feel after having finished this novel, 85% of which I couldn't stop reading. But that last 15% was an enormous struggle to finally limp to the end. The nine narrators of this upside down two days in hot Norway are well defined and I was able to keep them all apart in my mind. Theirs are the mundane lives and worries of people. Boredom, frustration with spouses and children, aging parents, and some mental illness are all things to contend with. Knausgard adds in elements of a looming apocalypse and the characters in varying degrees either underreact or completely rationalize the irrational events taking place, and I'm still invested. It all feels close to home and our current circumstance with adjusting to or suffering from the pandemic and our democracy slipping away. We live our lives as best we can and try to ignore/stay numb or wonder what we can possibly do to make things better? What is death? What is living? Who can say?I read that there is another part coming to this new series and so yes, even with my hesitancy to recommend a book with a suffocating final chapter, I'll want to see what comes next.

This memoir discusses that journey. What sets it apart from similar stories is her curiosity and engagement with the wider world. She has a successful career in the arts and must work diligently to keep producing art while taking care of babies and her own health. And so she asks what does a smile mean, anyway? Why must a woman be expected to smile in every circumstance? Will her babies be alienated from a mother who can't beam down at them with a loving face? And beyond sociology, Ruhl must also navigate a complicated medical system that doesn't know how to go about treating her. Both sorrow and a nod to the absurdist situation this condition has brought to her are here in the story. And it might be a sort of path for others in similar circumstances to follow.

She moves to an upstate New York rental and starts writing scraps of thoughts (letters to her deceased cousin, to her estranged boyfriend, her younger self) and pieces together memories of those thoughts with texts and emails. It's all kind of a mess and maybe that was intended to echo the chaos of those months for everyone. But that randomness isn't necessarily especially interesting to read.

Throughout the novel, just ONE character who is Chinese is called by name; the rest are lumped together with adjectives like: inhuman, gross, etc. So that's an undeniable part of the story and it's hard to read. The exoticism and out and out racism serve to show how blatantly white people were and still are as colonialists. In between the condescension and insults, there is a wonderful individual story about a woman named Kitty and her own dawning realization that she is not a good person but would like to be. Kitty has been raised by another not-good person, her mother, and has been taught that a good marriage to any man of means is Kitty's sole reason for living. And when that doesn't pan out and she settles for someone she can barely stand, their destinies are set. On top of everything else, this novel has a cholera epidemic. Because, of course it does. Epidemics are endemic. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 13, 2021","Jun 15, 2021","Jun 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99664.The_Painted_Veil

I was heavily invested in the main character Nella as she brought her life as a Black assistant in predominantly white publishing house to the reader. Nella is smart, engaging, and full of ambition. So the novel excels in building a world where culture and discomfort from being the only Black person in a white space (and the big power imbalance that's built in) raises questions about how authentic can you be if everyone's weighing everything you say and do and comparing it to the status quo. Where the novel doesn't work as well comes later, where the plot takes a turn that throws things upside down and does not feel authentic to the story.

The writing is deft, and the structure is unconventional. Cass White starts with some assertions about the reading life in general and then goes on to a deeper analysis that uses literary works to back up her thesis. This was the strongest part of the book, looking at how reading is transgressive and an act of self-containment that rebels against the forces that would control us. She uses (among others) Dorothea Brooke and Frankenstein's monster as demonstrations of the power reading has to expand, instruct, and possibly disappoint, and has an especially rich analysis of some of Elizabeth Bishop's poetry. Cass White also makes it clear that reading in and of itself is not morally superior to any other pursuit, yet how for some people there's a pull to depart from the immediacy of the present and enter the state of reading that can be akin to dreaming. It's an excellent thought experiment.Thanks to NetGalley for an advanced  copy of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 11, 2021","Jun 13, 2021","Apr 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54785524-books-promiscuously-read

She has a best friend named Baba who bullies Kate, and though she's bratty and brazen, Baba also provides Kate over the course of years with a stable and loving friend. Kate's father is a mean alcoholic and her mother is kind but weak. As the family breaks apart and Kate is first sent off to convent school and then tries to start an adult life in Dublin, she is always aware of natural beauty and the humanity inside odd and difficult people. Her love life takes over and things take a turn. She is initiated into adult behavior and falls in love with an older man and matures.But the third novel is a whiplashed departure from the tenderness of the first two. And because the point of view switches from first person to third (and some chapters from Baba's perspective), Kate's strong voice and ways of seeing the world are lost. As her character recedes into the narrative, so do her chances for happiness.As a whole, the three novels are beautiful and full of empathy for their characters. The novels were considered scandalous by Irish society and the Church, unsurprisingly, because O'Brien's stories prick the secretive oppressions of life during that post-War time and show what it was like for women.

This novel is an example of starting with what might seem to be an intriguing idea/image and then shoehorning in a story to make it fit. A child and her extremely evasive father live together on an island and he trains her to learn how to smell things because scents are SO important that he casts away his life to commit to preserving scents via a machine, and their isolation and his refusal to talk about anything else gives her no other context for thinking or living. He calls her ""Little Lark"" as a term of endearment and it feels so cloying.The narrative pounds the scent/smelling concept into every encounter. The child has almost no personality or inner life other than how sense memory (stimulated by scent) affects every thought and personal encounter. It's written in the tenor of a fairy tale or fable, which keeps the reader far, far away from the possibility of accepting the story as a realistic portrayal of the protagonist's coming of age. When she does finally get off the island, she has difficulties adjusting. The novel reminds me of How the Crawdads Sing and The Language of Flowers, and since I didn't like either of those books for similar reasons, this one doesn't fare any better. I'm not giving it a star rating to feed the algorithm because my motive isn't to trash the book.

His wife Harriet has some romantic notion of what their marriage will be like and finds her expectations to be upended due to Guy's personality, the pressures of an impending war, and her loneliness. There's so much more here than the core relationship. A colorful cast of secondary characters surround the Pringles, sometimes friends and sometimes not. The gamut of human behavior and emotions are in these pages; there are no real heroes.

Amma has finally been accepted by a mainstream theater group and is showcasing her feminist play about Amazonian women. Old friends and family gather to watch and celebrate Amma’s career. The rest of the book is about the histories of her friends, foes, and offspring. This is not a plot-driven novel. Instead, it is formatted as close-omniscient chapters in the “voices” of the featured characters.

A (slightly unsatisfying) meditation on the question: What are women for? Adam Bede and his brother, Seth, must care for their ailing mother and find enough work to support their small family. Both fall in love with women unable to love them back. Rivalry, religion, the role of women at home and outside the home, what happens when moral codes are broken and when landowners have dominion over their tenants; all of these ideas come together in the tale of this small community in rural England. Here, men are generally given the benefit of the doubt and women who stray in the least are scrutinized until they prove themselves pure of heart. There are many things to think about in terms of the subjects, themes, and tone. The deepest emotional connections come from the two women at the core of the narrative, Hetty and Dinah.

Darren, a 22-year-old barista (hence his corporate-bestowed nickname, Buck) is lured from the easy life of coffee service to the cult-like hell of a startup that is ""disrupting"" counseling services. The company, Sumwun, sells corporations on zoom-based counseling for employees. But what Darren endures during his training goes well beyond the fervor of company pride and he is subjected to blatant aggressions as the sole Black employee of the company. And what follows is life-changing for Darren and everyone he knows. The plot is propulsive and lightning-fast, raising the melodrama and satire level. Readers are asked to examine their own biases and must also suspend disbelief to get to the end. Overall, Black Buck examines the ideas of saleship and adherence to personal, tribal, and corporate allegiances. Buck's relationships are mostly superficial, though he seems to yearn for more....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 21, 2020","Dec 25, 2020","Dec 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53091994-black-buck

He obliged by publishing them regularly, and for a number of years, I read them as quickly as I could. After Pet Sematary, however, I'd had my fill. It was just TOO gruesome for me and I started reading more of other stuff. Now, in 2020, I had the chance to buddy read this novel with a booktube friend and all the things I used to like in King's novels was here. Joe Hill does a good job of setting up tense scenarios and building mostly-believable characters to pull us from the beginning of the work to the end. His writing is packed with colorful descriptions, never skimping on the gore or perversity a story like this can require. There were nods to other books: a beloved Saint Bernard pet, undead children, a possessed car, a distressed teenage girl. And there was even a tiny homage to the DeZoet family from David Mitchell novels, a little Easter egg for an observant reader.There were some questionable moments, including the scope of the violence inflicted on the main character, Vic, that even for a horror novel seemed over the top. And maybe it didn't have to be quite as long? But those are small complaints; overall, it was a scary/fun/timely read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 29, 2020","Dec 06, 2020","Nov 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15729539-nos4a2

James Wood's discourse is easy to follow, and it's clear that his conclusions are the basis for his life ing other writers' work. He talks about point of view and free indirect style. He talks about the purpose of fiction, art, and the artifices of realism. But at the very core--and it reaffirmed something important for me in terms of my own views of the worth of fiction--pleasure is attained when a reader can identify what Henry James calls ""a blue river of truth curling"" through fiction. And then as he has done throughout, Wood provides passages that exemplify what he is talking about.

Glenconner tells her own story about growing up in aristocratic circles and how one in that protected world is raised to perpetuate the system through marriage and children. So she's good friends with Princess Margaret and becomes for many years Margaret's official royal companion. We learn about protocol, royal loneliness, and the seemingly appalling way that children are pushed aside to be raised without much or any parental intervention. Glenconner marries a man with clear mental health issues (explosive and inexplicable rage, highly impulsive, and rich enough that he gets away with everything.) In this way, the memoir is conflicts with itself. She has problems in her marriage and with her children, like everyone. But she doesn't seem to grasp how their very jet-setting lifestyle (decadent parties, island-buying, her husband's crass/gross behavior) gave her many more options than any working-class person would ever have access to. This is a fascinating glimpse into a rarefied world, yet the reader is left wondering where Glenconner could have donated some of that astounding privilege to the suffering of working class people in the empire....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 05, 2020","Aug 08, 2020","Jul 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49945845-lady-in-waiting

I've seen s where people out and out deny what's being told, that Machado's experience wasn't ""that bad"" and compared to ""real"" abuse, this was nothing to write a book about. But suffering and pain aren't a contest. The amount of intentional pain and brutalization humans inflict on others is incalculable and a person, an artist, shouldn't have to quantify the pain in order to use their perceptions as a basis for expression. We need lots of stories, not just the ""worst,"" to understand each other as people. I believe her account and hope that other readers can expand their empathy or at least their sympathy to allow books like this to be published.The most successful parts of this book are when Machado uses her knowledge of film and theory to contextualize the relationship, how she isn't afraid to explore queer abuse, how in the past the existence of abuse in same-sex relationships weren't considered plausible. She upends history, using her own dysfunctional partner as evidence.What didn't work as well was what to me was the excessive overwriting. I understand how her metaphors and fairy tale chapters heighten the emotion, and in a short story I can see how that works. But for a long form piece of writing, I lost patience with my reading experience. Another small quibble is the sudden revelation that Machado had a therapist over the course of this experience and only once mentions this after the romance with the abusive girlfriend had ended. Was she seeing this therapist the whole time? Did it help? Impossible to know and I suppose none of our business except then why bring it up?I'm glad this book exists because it adds another voice that might help someone in a similar situation feel less alone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jul 2020,"Jul 07, 2020","Jul 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43317482-in-the-dream-house

A family of four has rented the home, but the owners of the home retreat because the power goes out in the city. As the families uneasily co-exist, the world around them reacts to the event. There is an exploration of wealth inequality, race, and the inevitability of death. There is a palpable feeling of unease and the uncanny, and each character has their own specific reaction. Rumaan Alam's ability to observe human behavior and turn over the rocks where people hide their feelings and motivations is astute. What starts off seeming like satire soon pares down into a serious novel about the ends of the earth. Highly recommended to people who don't mind reading about human emergencies during our own pandemic reality. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 09, 2020","Jun 10, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358031-leave-the-world-behind

The author goes out of her way at the beginning to stress this is not autobiographical, and I found it to be a plausible examination of the damage one person in authority can do to another. Told in two timelines, when she is fifteen and then when on into her later twenties, the perspective comes completely from the title character, Vanessa, which was a relief. I have read enough novels about the pedophile's point of view and would rather hear from the victim, whether or not they feel they have been victimized.

The author of this novel imagines the private lives and thoughts of several people in the Plymouth colony as they confront the murder of a new settler by a former indentured servant who is aggrieved and resentful when he is scorned as a troublemaker. While the murder and trial are historical, everything else in the text is fiction. What I like about the novel is how what we think of as ""the Pilgrims"" as brave and pious, fighting for their right to worship in their own way is opened up to more natural, normal human desires and victims of circumstance. It's often hard to imagine a person in the 1600s suffering extreme poverty and hardships, and the novel supposes that many of them who imagined a utopia were disappointed yet didn't have the means or opportunity to leave. Meanwhile, policies set forth by the extreme religious leaders of the group morph into a kind of dominance over Native American people, slaves, non-religious servants, and women.

She's been trying to write the same novel for six years, has a masters degree and a ton of student debt, and a job as a waitress in a Cambridge upscale restaurant.The novel is a first-person mix of comic self-analysis that goes back and forth in time as Casey meets some new potential love interests, pursues her novel, has a health event, and must figure out her life from the pieces. What I love about this book Casey's love of books and authors, her sarcastic yet never cruel view of other people, and her desire to find her path toward a writing career and new family life. The voice is contemporary and candid; this is not a deeply philosophical nor lyrical novel. But it rings true and is richly satisfying. Its other strength is Casey's ties to other characters, her brother, her best friend, her boyfriends, and best, the people she works with, not all of whom are nice or accepting. Some of the novel's best scenes take place in the restaurant, the gritty and harrowing shifts where she's doing her best even under withering glares from some of her superiors.Perhaps it works so well because there's a dearth of good news and a lot of latent and not-so-latent anxiety these days.

(Trigger warning: Political opinions are included in this .)This novel both succeeds and fails because of its Closer to three and a half stars. (Trigger warning: Political opinions are included in this .)This novel both succeeds and fails because of its proximity to real life and real circumstance. Were it written about entirely fictional characters and events, it would have been a fun and thoughtful book. But because it's about actual people who have dominated our political landscape for thirty years and flips the plot of real vs. ideal on its head, readers can in no way enjoy it as just a story without the weight of reality and the mental acrobatics required to separate fact from fiction. And how much the reader has loved/admired or loathed/dehumanized real life Hillary and Bill Clinton will also probably affect their reactions, too. How it succeeds: As a reckoning for the distorted and vicious treatment of Hillary as a serious and capable public servant, this version is wish fulfillment. The novel treats seriously the obstacles of women and minority politicians as they try to ascend and affect policy. Friendships are key to this novel and so those relationships that fictional HR builds feel authentic. Some ers have commented on the sex scenes in this book, which are not especially erotic but did allow that sex was a strong motivating force for some of the characters. That treatment enhanced character building. Shifting narrative timelines keep the novel from seeming like a chronological autobiography and builds some suspense about what happened, and when.How it fails: The publication and placement of this novel against the backdrop of the Trump presidency and its massive failures on every front somewhat spoils the book, through no fault of its own. Donald Trump the character is a blowhard buffoon who wields some political clout. Donald Trump the real person was given all the power of the presidency without him having the ability to listen to people with more experience and knowledge of systems and to rule with utter self-regard. The novel could not predict how dangerous and completely incompetent and amoral he is. To a lesser degree and because of the reality that contradicts it, this novel doesn't live up to the brilliance of Sittenfeld's previous novel, American Wife, which is a complete reimagining of Laura Bush's inner life. Rodham doesn't and probably can't get into the head of Hillary. Perhaps it's not fair to compare the novels, but American Wife has more depth of character and emotion. It wasn't supposed to be a reckoning or settles scores in the same way that Rodham seems.No matter what ambivalence I feel toward this novel, Curtis Sittenfeld is a writer I trust completely. I've read all her novels and her most recent story collection and aside from real life now messing up my ability to process Rodham, I'll still read everything she writes. She is intuitive and writes with extreme care....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 25, 2020","Dec 31, 2020","Feb 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50253429-rodham

She and The protagonist of this novel is smart, a good mother and teacher, but also is depressed, financially insecure, and at times self-sabotaging. She and her husband must declare bankruptcy at the beginning of the story and their security teeters on the brink of collapse. As she's working two jobs (as an adjunct professor and as a high school teacher at a corporate-owned charter school that believes its sole purpose is test preparation), she spends a great deal of time ruminating on a past friendship with Sasha, her closest friend from high school. So the narrative switches back and forth in time and the pivotal moments of both time periods come into focus. The chief concern of this story is how what people want drives their behavior. For this character, she wants to be understood and refuses to stretch or perform beyond her own limits to break away from the problems that weigh so heavily. She wants her parents to love and forgive her; she wants her husband to accept her while many times hiding key information about her mental state from him; she wants to teach her high school students how to think and the joy of learning; and she enjoys the unconditional love she receives from her daughters. She also struggles to find an ethical balance in the midst of this personal crisis. While this is not a happy novel, it is honest and does a lot to pick apart the false hopes we have that everything will always turn out in the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 08, 2020","Jul 11, 2020","Jan 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44009968-want

The novel's strengths are its ambition, fantastic writing, overly confident main character, and diabolical god-like villain. Its weaknesses are its male-gazey view of women and their place and the novel's long, long slog through parts of the adventure. We are supposed (?) to root for the twenty-four year old man who has the arrogance of someone much older and experienced. He thinks of himself of a sophisticate, yet he's easily sucked into the schemes and high drama of a man running what is essentially a 1970s larping escapade.

Over the last twenty years, when a novel set in New York starts out with a vivid blue morning sky on a Tuesday, you know planes will soon be crashing into buildings. The two images are paired, the blue sky before the terror. I guess now, when a novel starts out in October of 2016 and the characters are just going about their lives, maybe speculating lightly about the upcoming election, you know they probably are going to be traumatized and horrified by the outcome, much like many of us, the twinned emotions of life before and life after.So Right After the Weather begins, and the first half of the novel establishes the setting, a forty-something woman named Cate who is a theatrical set designer living in Chicago, trying to find the right woman to date, dedicated to her best friend Neale and Neale's pre-adolescent son. She's also taking care of her ex-husband, whose mental state is precarious and gets worse once the outcome of the election is known. Trauma comes in many forms, and this novel is full of various assaults, mental and otherwise. It might be trying to do too much, but it also conveys to the sympathetic reader a state of agitation and moral decay, alongside trying to simply live our lives. The novel's observations are cutting; the main character very rarely doles out the benefit of the doubt toward her romantic partners or herself. But there are small glimmers of happiness that peek out from time to time.All in all, thoughtful and downbeat.

It's about the year 1968 when four young musicians are brought together by a manager to form a psychedelic rock band in London. The novel is about their development and career trajectory along with the back stories of each band member. The characters are richly drawn, flawed, funny, and talented.I was pulled right into this specific universe, which is set in real, historic period, so figures like Janis Joplin, Crosby, Still & Nash, Jimi Hendrix, and Leonard Cohen (among many) make appearances in the story. The rollicking energy of Mitchell's prose and the distinctions between the characters, both as band members and with very detailed backstories, will keep you entertained all the way through. There is also the expected Mitchell practice of introducing characters from past novels, specifically The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet and The Bone Clocks. While it's not 100% necessary to have read those novels to enjoy this one, it would enhance understanding some of what's happening to one of the characters. This novel is exists in both the fictional Mitchell universe and the actual history of the time. It's satisfying and fun.Thanks to NetGalley for an advanced  copy of this book in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 24, 2020","Jul 07, 2020","Sep 26, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/51341638-utopia-avenue

The portrait of these characters is not to elicit sympathy, but to draw on the deep well of loneliness and a dawning realization of what growing up can mean. Most of the book takes place in the Colorado mountains during the 1930s; the children take dirty trains to visit their uncle there and are surrounded by people far removed from their mother's pristine, prissy sitting room and the fawning next-door minister who comments on their behavior incessantly. Stafford builds a world that contains the brutal practices of hunting and farming; peril lurks around every corner, but nothing in the outside world can rival the peril of the children's private thoughts. That's as much as I want to say about the book without giving up its mysteries. If you want to read it, go in as blindly as possible.

She is the center star around which all the other characters orbit, but is essentially a cipher to the reader, painted as such a weak and incapable adult that she is forever being sheltered (and by extension, lied to). Likewise, my favorite narrator, Marian, was cut off from the story too early. Her wit and verve is much stronger than Walter Hartright's (nudge to the overly-obvious name choice) and I wished I could have spent more time with her superior mind.

But as in all the previous novels about Brodie, his past returns to haunt as he goes about co-parenting a teenager with his old love, Julia. The setup is similar to the other Brodie novels. The first third or so of the story introduces a bunch of seemingly unrelated characters and situations. With detailed exposition, the reader gets inside the minds and histories of these characters; even the ones who will turn out to be terrible people get a full introduction. And just as the setup follows a pattern of previous installations, so too the theme of lost and exploited and hurt children is the focus of Big Sky. There's an old human trafficking ring in the town where Brodie lives that's still active, though it takes a lot of policework (featuring When Will There Be Good News's best character, Reggie) and serendipitous detecting by Brodie to pull it all together.Atkinson excels in all her novels in character development, and particularly of children and adolescents. In Big Sky, a young teen named Harry shines. His mother has died, his father is remote, and his stepmother takes him under her wing. His portrayal of wit, innocence, and hunger for love is the novel's strength. Jackon Brodie doesn't fare as well here. He's aging and at times aimless, and his perception relies too much on what he imagines Julia will say about his every thought. He doesn't know how he fits into the #metoo age. But the women of Big Sky have no trouble finding agency and a new strength with new thinking. Big Sky has fantastic writing but might rely too much on the events of past novels. It would not stand on its own, apart from its predecessors, without a lot of confusion. And while Atkinson is a master of mixing timelines, in this novel, there is an excess of time and point of view shifts. Attention must be paid in the transitions to figure out who is talking, and when. All in all, it's an enjoyable return to the Brodie universe even when he's not the star....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Aug 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43251694-big-sky

That's unfair to both novels and then we were faced with our catastrophe and then it didn't seem to matter too much feeling peevish about thinking about these novels side by side.

It's also about big and small delusions, those that we tell ourselves individually and those that are national and even global. There are a variety of perspectives and personal failings. No one comes out the least bit better. And at the writing level, Mandel is still able to write characters with mysterious inner lives.

She's loading the car when she gets the call that her husband has been in a car accident. Tim's death leaves an opening for Evvie to evaluate her life and her own state of mind. When she rents out a spare apartment to a washed out baseball superstar to help pay the mortgage, the possibilities loom large.What's lovely about the way Holmes has written this story is that she is patient. She has taken the time to introduce and then develop the main characters, especially Evvie. Evvie doesn't tell us everything in the beginning. We get to know her as she gets to know Dean, her tenant. We get to root for her and then we get to experience her turmoil with her. Holmes controls the story and we don't mind getting immersed in this world of Evvie's big house, big hurts, and her vitally important connection with her platonic buddy, Andy, before it wobbles. The novel transcends the typical formula romance because there is significant time and development of relationships outside the core love interest. Evvie's friendship with Andy is long-standing and somewhat co-dependent. She was there for him during his divorce; he was there for her through her husband's unexpected death. But she has been holding back certain things and when Andy finds out, there is a rift. And we get to know the baseball player, Dean, too, to a lesser degree. It's definitely Evvie's story, but the narrative makes sure to show why Dean is worth so much investment.Yet the themes of this novel go beyond romance. Mental health is key, and so is the disruption of the traditional gendered expectation of a woman being a supportive spouse behind the career of a successful professional husband. Holmes explores these ideas gently and with a great deal of empathy.The author of this novel is well known to the pop culture world and anyone who's been following her trajectory over the years will recognize how interpreting and promoting good things like movies, books, and other podcasts has shaped her world view. Her willingness to open up about her own life and tastes are evident in this heartfelt and tender story.Finally, this would make a fantastic movie, that is, if anyone wants to make a zillion dollars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 24, 2019","May 26, 2019","May 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40514431-evvie-drake-starts-over

I almost didn't want to go on if this was how it was going to be, no matter how nice it was. But then the narrative opened up to the boy's parents and future siblings, one chapter for each in the life of this Iowa farm family starting in 1900. With this structure, the characters grow and change and suffer deep disappointments, some catastrophic and others just the run-of-the-mill pains of life. For lovers of family sagas, long, long histories that develop, a tight and tender writing style that is probing, frankly erotic, and nuanced.

The parents work for a This is a riveting, if at times challenging, novel about a family in Topeka, Kansas, in the last quarter of twentieth century. The parents work for a renowned psychology training institute/mental health hospital they call The Foundation and they have a smart and often angry son named Adam. The novel is divided into chapters between Adam, Jane (his mother), and Jonathan (the father), where the main story unspools. There is also an account at the ends of these chapters of a fourth, an outcast named Darren, who bears most of the torment his classmates pile on him. While this is an insular family saga, it's also a chilling social commentary, a deep exploration of the limits of language to express existential discord and looming systems collapse. The tenets of psychoanalysis rule the inner workings of The Foundation, friendships are formed and broken on the backs of confessions made during long analysis sessions, and troubled youth are pulled in for counseling, All this leads to a targeted indictment of politics, systems, and child rearing practices from the 1990s to the current day. The Topkea Schools manages weave together distinct voices, science, sociology, economic systems, misogyny, and dread. We end up caring deeply for the characters but hurting for our world. Highly recommended.PS: I didn't know until I read some other s that the skeleton for the family in the novel is the same skeleton as Ben Lerner's real family.

There have been some recent examples of this type of multi-perspective novel, including Lisa Halliday's Asymmetry and Lauren Groff's Fates and Furies. These types of novels require a concerted effort to understand what core truth will hold its parts together. And Susan Choi's novel fits into the category, though not as successfully.The first half of the novel is about Sarah, one of the teens in love, who attends a prestigious arts high school. She meets David; they have a powerful sexual connection but are unequipped to relate beyond the physical, and things fizzle after they have a public act of sexual congress in their school hallway.This third-person narrative is about Sarah's breakup agony and her pain when beloved drama teacher Mr. Kingsley mines the Sarah/David relationship with some repetitive trust exercises the whole class must watch, ""So much of what they do, with Mr. Kingsley, is restraint in the name of release. It seems they have to throttle their emotions to have complete access to them."" (These excruciating scenes recall the brainwashing episode in the movie The Master, where nascent Scientologists make Joaquin Phoenix run into a wall over and over again). Eventually, Sarah is demoted to the crew that takes care of the costumes and lighting. In her castigation, Sarah is out of Kingsley's protective embrace and left to the wiles of a troupe of students from England, and their teacher, Martin, who were invited to put on Voltaire's Candide and end up scandalizing the program with a bawdy performance that causes the show to be cancelled.The writing in this first part is stylized and energetic, ""By and large, the girls grow increasingly serious as the boys grow increasingly ludicrous. The girls no longer walk, they glide, they skim, they slice"" and Sarah's honest observations about the limits of the teenage perspective and the perils of thwarted romance leave readers with an assumed understanding of the facts.The second part of the novel knocks those facts down. Here, a character only barely mentioned, Karen, is out to avenge herself because she'd been unfairly excised in Sarah's published novel. That's right, Part One is not an omniscient close narration of Sarah's story, but Sarah's own words ripped from her life, molded into art, by her. In Karen's view, Karen and Sarah were in a friendship that has been unfairly kept from Sarah's novel. Karen regards herself as a person with impeccable memory and precise language. She relies on dictionary definitions and word origins to bolster her arguments; they are proof that she is the better thinker, that she knows herself better than Sarah knows Sarah via the novel. Yet Karen reveals that she has read only 131 pages of Sarah's book, which, if true, means that she isn't responding to the text as much as she is the erasure of the friendship and the weight it deserves.Carefully recalling the details of both stories, the ""real"" novel becomes more metafictional exercise than cohesive story. While it is supposedly a correction to the record from the artifices of Sarah's novel, Karen's account farcically manipulates the characters, twelve years later, into performing in a bad play. To achieve this, Karen finesses an alcoholic, abased David into letting her manage the details of his theater productions; she insinuates herself into a starring role in the play; she lures novelist Sarah to come be her dresser for old time's sake; she eagerly awaits the arrival of playwright Martin, the former teacher from the fiasco that was Candide. For Karen had had a sexual relationship with Martin, who had been over forty at the time she was sixteen, and after he returned to England, stopped communicating with her. As payback, she will surprise him as his co-star. And she has a surprise for Sarah, also payback for being abandoned by Sarah in their lives and in Sarah's novel. Karen's accounting of all this feels like bent nails cobbling together a manic convergence of all the pain from her past. Karen will not be a side character. No way. Karen's final paragraph could have been the end of the book, but Choi wasn't content to stop there. Instead, a third voice emerges, one not yet heard from in either Sarah's or Karen's sections. And while the facts of Karen's story aren't pushed aside, this new perspective adds confusion that destabilizes Choi's novel further. At minimum, a successful reading experience asks that the reader be gratified that the effort yields some satisfaction, if not enjoyment. A challenging text can be a revelation, even if it requires some thumbing back through the pages. Yet if there are no markers to a truth, it is nothing in the end more than a game. That is the fate of Trust Exercise. A strong first half buffeted by a frenetic rebuttal might have been enough. But some of the power of that interplay was blurred by the coda....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Apr 10, 2019","Apr 14, 2019","Apr 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40046059-trust-exercise

The stories take place from 1950 to the 1990s, with the distinct sensibility of a pre-technology era. Many of the stories are about family who are cast out from their expected roles due to poor luck, addiction, and mental illness. Orner's prose pulls on threads of loneliness and exhaustion, and within the collection's thematic sections, the brief stories connect to one another. There are two sections of this book that feature one narrator. In short glimpses, this unnamed man, who is a writer, explores the plights of people in his family, aunts and uncles, town criminals. Later, we see him look back at his education, then his life with a wife. These micro-stories, which are not conventionally formed, are vivid and poignant. And the narrator uses language that feels conversational. He says of an aunt, ""[she] was in her late forties when she moved back home. The word was that she was ""a little off."" Nobody by my father went as far to say she was crazy. He'd tell anybody who listened what a loon his sister was."" In a sense, the writer's whole childhood and young adulthood come alive on the page. The way he tells his stories confer an understanding of our common humanity, a love, even for the castaways of modern life. This is the collection's most ardent theme. In addition to affection for the disaffected, religion, commerce, and sexual connections are important, too. These themes come up often in the novella ""Walt Kaplan is Broke."" Relying on some history from earlier stories, the novella takes place in Fall River, Massachusetts in 1977. Walter Kaplan has bypassed death by cardiac arrest, leaving him to evaluate his whole life, marriage, friendships, and the history of the town itself. Walt has been a business failure, and was depressed before he nearly died. When he wakes up, he has to find his place among the living. Orner has the ability to give a skeleton of details about a character's life and trust that the reader can fill in the gaps and leap from story to story to understand an overarching message about our pasts. It's a rare talent and these stories are its evidence....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 29, 2019","Jun 05, 2019","Apr 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42779087-maggie-brown-others

It's engaging, especially after the drug-fueled first section, which was bogged down by the character's visions and dementias. The core story is about four young people from broken and flailing realities (the battlefield, the school, the town, the state, Ohio, the country, the planet) who harbor secrets and deep miseries. Markley has created strong and distinct characters, and a tone that presents us with the chilling realities of modern twenty-first century life. There are plenty of specific details that bring the characters front and center. It becomes possible to see them, loving, struggling, and in many cases staggering under the weight of their circumstance. But the downside of what the author wanted to be a symphony of socio-economics, politics, and generational gloom is too much literariness. Every situation was embellished with long-winded metaphors and explanatory prose that take pure clarity away from the bedrock storytelling.

(This  contains spoilers if you haven't been watching the news for the last ten years.)Michelle Obama excels in telling the story of her life, from a loving lower middle-class childhood through all the travails of life as a professional, mother, and wife of an unlikely politician, Barack Obama. I feared that it might be a sanitized account of her life, but instead Michelle is able to bare some of the tender hurts that come with being labeled a villain and disrespected for virtually everything she did, said, wore, or emoted.Mostly, she shows herself to be a kind and empathetic person who wanted to make a difference in the world with the power she held as first lady, and she also shows how protective she and Barack were of their daughters. Politically, Michelle touches on some of the biggest news stories of the administration, bringing them right back into our reality and to her personal observation. The pain in her voice as she recounts the murders of first graders and then the murders of black men, one after another, at the hands of the police is memorable and rough. My one criticism of this book is that she demurs talking about the methods by which DJT ""won"" the election, and if there was any alarm that could have been sounded before the election was held. But all in all, I couldn't stop listening to her story.This memoir is a jarring juxtaposition to what's happening now, which makes some of the hope and optimism I and many others felt during the beginning of the Obama presidency feel so fleeting and far away. It hurts to know how divided this country is, how a segment of our citizens hate and fear and despise what isn't in their world view, and how they seem to revel in the misery of other people. Michelle makes it clear that while she's fearing for the country and the world, she will not be part of the political machine. If anyone cares about her, they wouldn't wish for her to join that cesspool again....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 13, 2018","Nov 21, 2018","Nov 11, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38746485-becoming

It's a novel that chronicles the main character, Dolly Wilde's (not her real name) awakening to her sexual agency and to her place within the caustic misogyny of the London music scene of the time. It's also a capital-R romance novel, like a revved up Bridget Jones with a dash of the energy you might remember from Love Actually. There's a lot to like about it, especially Dolly's real kindness to her younger brother and her admiration of her completely irresponsible and drug-happy best friend. I also admire the appeal from Dolly to the rock star to respect his teenage girl fans, no matter how goofy or how much they are misfits in a world who does not at all care about teenage girls. But where it falls short is that her wisdom seems much older than her nineteen years. And her parents and brothers are excised from the book about half way through, after they'd been featured a good deal of the first half.

Set in Britain over the period of twenty-five years or so, the novel is immersed in the lives of several families, mostly upper class though there are others that strive to escape poverty. It's a big cast of characters that Byatt handles with care. The narrative maintains a balance between the events that shape the characters' psychology and the events that shape the looming twentieth century. It does seem to bog down nearer to the end with an abundance of politics, yet it's made clear that politics are influencing the course of the characters' existence. So that's a minor complaint. This novel bears re-reading and won't soon be forgotten.(Favorite characters: Dorothy and Tom)Four and a half stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Sep 2020,"Sep 26, 2020","Aug 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6280379-the-children-s-book

Overall, I was moved by the chronology of the life and death of Sally Horner and how her story may have influenced a major literary treasure in Nabokov's novel. I'm not sure the import of Nabokov's denial of influence of the Horner story on Lolita is as strong as this exploration in the book asserts, however. Maybe it was a conscious choice to deny the real-life case as pivotal to the novel (even though the case is actually named in the novel itself) or maybe it was repression. I'm not sure it matters all that much so many decades after the fact. But there is a tie to this old novel to the current climate of speaking out. It's odd because just as I was reading this history, a #MeToo villain wrote a self-pitying essay in Harper's about his ""exile"" after being exposed as an abusive and inappropriate jerk, and he has the gall to liken his own plight to that of the fictional ""Lolita,"" rather than the predator Humbert Humbert.

It's somewhat embarrassing to admit that I have always understood Ireland's Troubles to somehow refer to its potato famine and found out after reading the novel (first) and the John Banville introduction (after) that Troubles really refers to the Irish/British war that started in 1919, right after the first world war. Our protagonist is a British officer who ends up in a dilapidated hotel on the Irish coast to marry a woman he believes he's engaged to. That match doesn't pan out, yet he ends up staying in the hotel for years, and the uprising of Sinn Fein against the British occupiers unfolds before the Major's eyes.

But the detached, clinical, fable-like language used to explain the actions of nanny against children, mother and father against nanny, the strata of classes in Paris that strangle any chance the nanny has to treat her severe untreated mental health issues, is key, and for me gratuitously leaves the ultimate victims, the dead children, as nothing more than blanks to project fears upon by the other characters. You know those kids are going to die on the very first page, they're already dead, and their humanity within the novel's world is elided. Furthermore, we are made to spend so much time inside mind of the mother and then don't get to see her in the aftermath, nor her husband. It's as though they were killed, too. It doesn't matter that they were made to look utterly selfish and clueless, but we still were owed the chance to see them through the crime. After all the buildup, this is terribly dissatisfying.

It's perhaps overlong, but the main story is rolled out meticulously over 400+ pages. The element that work best for me is the abject loneliness of Alison, the novel's sad, bereft, and ultimately outcast protagonist. She's a psychic whose life is possessed by terrible 'fiends', grotesque and surprisingly corporeal holograms from her past. There's also the post-9/11 anti-immigrant politics of Britain and the acknowledgment of the earth's climate changing for worse. This was written in 2006 and all the gloom of those years has only multiplied to our current political disasters, making the novel prescient. Uplifting, it's not.

It has the usual frames of late 19th century novels, letters, recollections, conversations, and omniscient narrative that shifts from a first-person storytelling by Grace Marks that is split between her discussions with the psychiatrist Simon from talking directly to us readers without Simon as a filter.

If ever there's a need for community and doubt and an exploration of the Tragic vs. Trivial planes of existence, it's now. The memoir covers a single year, 2012, of monthly meetings for contemplating works of art that question our purpose. Woven into analysis of the works that were chosen is the story of Gisleon's family history: her challenging and larger than life father and all his contradictions, the elision of her mother from hard truths about family secrets, and her tragic sisters' early and self-chosen deaths. It seems at the beginning like this might be superficial, but it's anything but. I felt a connection to the stories and the primal need for community that comes through deliberative acts of wanting to learn more.

This novel is about the pressures those abuses can press upon a marriage, upon any relationship, really, including gender expectations and the bonds and betrayals of parents against their children.

For the Brontes in this book are ill-mooded, always coughing, often beleaguered with aching heads and low fevers and an incredible propensity to avoid personal contact with others unless absolutely necessary, and then only when they are so starved for company or wanting to bestow benevolence on villagers worse off than they are.They live at the foot of an old musty graveyard where tainted rain runs down to their house and causes them all unending misery, from both health and psychological perspectives. Mrs. Gaskell paints Charlotte as so righteous and self-sacrificing that no doubt her friends might have rolled their eyes as she protested their praise, scolded them for suggesting she and her kin were novelists, and in general, was insistently morose, if not brilliant.I am hesitant to give this books a judgment of stars. Gaskell is a wonderful writer, but she elides so many details of what might make these sisters more than saints, more than martyrs, more than scolds.

The Mare got a lot of criticism for the ""white savior"" aspect of a liberal white couple who support some children from the Fresh Air fund project. I think those readers might have missed out on the complexity of the issue and more so how Gaitskill relies on psychology and the mysteries of human behavior to address those complexities, and should they wish, they should read the essay, wherein she and her husband do almost exactly what her fiction couple does in The Mare. Some of the brief s in the collection I only skimmed; they are full of insight and thorough analysis, but maybe not subjects I'm interested in, or are about books I want to read before I am subjected to Gaitskill's impressions.Also, the essay where she talks about the 2008 election and declares Sarah Palin a sadist, is a gem.

The stories of people who have been either unjustly sentenced for crimes they did not commit or over-sentenced by racist jurists is heartbreaking enough, but when coupled with the reality of the coming dark days of the Trump administration promising to wreak brutal chaos on every system of government, it's almost too hard to bear. However, if we don't bear witness to things that might not ever happen to people we know, we are part of the system that turns its eyes away.I don't know what the answer is for reversing cases like this.

One woman in the story comes across as a mystery, and an unpleasant one. There's the refuge of a bridge where Amy (I do not like calling her 'Little Dorrit') hides from her life and her mistreatment. And there's a stubbornly rebuffed love story, and moving passages about loneliness.

This is how I read Circling the Sun, though the native Africans aren't infantalized as much as the GWTW slaves. In Circling the Sun, the story completely ignores the harm done to the people of Africa by the what to me are selfish, thoughtless colonizers. The native people are portrayed as the happily conquered, eager to help with safaris, horse training, servitude, any and everything whites may require. They worship the character Denys and will even deny themselves food and comfort in order to get back to him and serve. (Denys is a problem throughout, shown as a irresistible specimen of learned masculinity.) While we do see some of the native people in their own environment, their portrayal seems to be in a spirit of exoticism. I don't think McLain intended to do any harm in writing this weirdly-paced novel, but it doesn't shed much light on the real issues of Colonialism aside from how it affected the colonists. Maybe, like Scarlett, Beryl was clueless about the impact of domination. But McLain should have figured out a way to bring it up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 03, 2016","Aug 04, 2016","Aug 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23995231-circling-the-sun

The language is dense with imagery and the action of the goshawk's flight, and when I became impatient to find the threads of the author's story, my eyes would skip vast swaths of words. Then I would stop and go back a page or two to reassert my concentration. I could never be a falconer, but I enjoyed stepping into this very specific world where humans and animals bond tightly....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 11, 2016","Mar 18, 2016","Mar 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18803640-h-is-for-hawk

In Zero K, we meditate on the privilege of choosing to die and perhaps be resurrected in a post-human world, rather than to succumb to a basic run of the mill death from disaster, war, or disease, which the ethos of the novel assumes is imminent. So here, billionaires form a sort of cult around this dream of a tomorrow yet to come. But their gambit depends on the continued care and maintenance of their eerie, watery suspensions, which is like gambling on the honesty of timeshare sales people or the Church of Scientology. In this book, a billionaire's restless son witnesses his father's Quixotic attempt to command the future, and in seeing it up close, rejects the pursuit. While the whole book is well-written and philosophical, I was ready for it to be done a few chapters before we came to the end.**The blurb for this book says of it, ""The wisest, richest, funniest, and most moving novel in years..."" and I would say this book isn't funny in the least.

I still haven't read the second and that's coming next. But I wanted to get in the mood first. I noticed that several times Lucy mentions that this ""isn't the story of her marriage"" to William. I paid a lot of attention to the times she talks about him, his chilly relationship to her parents, who hate him for his airs and because he lives in New York. So those details are on my mind. I still cried at the same part I cried at the first two times I read this, when Lucy's father humiliates her brother in front of the town for being gay in a spectacularly cruel way. It hurt so much to think of this scene. With this third time reading, I noticed how many characters are suffering from the aftermath of traumas and so humbled by kindnesses from teachers and strangers and friends. And at how deeply Lucy forgave her flawed, incapable parents. 2017: Probably one of the saddest, most revealing novels I've read. It's on the same level as William Maxwell's So Long, See You Tomorrow. There's no great mystery about what this novel is. Lucy Barton is not an unreliable narrator; she's a narrator who sees clearly how she became who she is. She is acknowledging the severe disappointments of life and the pain and beauty of relationships and love. She is asking to be seen, to be allowed to know and say her own name. Now I'm going on to read the companion novel Anything is Possible. 2016: This brief novel unwinds slowly. For me, it pulled up feelings about childhood and then later, aging and marriage, so strongly.

I would have been fourteen years old at the time, and there's no way I could have understood how much loss and misdirected lust drove the storyline. I didn't remember much, if anything, about the actual plot, especially the anarchists and prostitutes of Vienna. Yet I always had an abiding love for the book, like all the other Irving novels like Garp, Owen Meany, and Cider House Rules. So something in the novel's words spoke to a teenager, and they speak differently to me now, the empty-nest mother and middle-aged wife. The world's so much worse now than the world of this novel, which was pretty terrible, post-Holocaust and easily accepted rape and shame of women and gay people. It is a novel that fit into the 1980s, but might be too simplistic for the times we're living in now.8/18/2015: Reading this again because it popped up on my tivo suggested movies the other day and I knew I'd rather read it than see the bad movie.

Their actual weights are revealed as more of an indictment. The are depicted as constantly eating and/or thinking of what they'll serve at their wedding reception. The protagonist, Cressida, herself has many problems that include obsession with a married lover, a prolonged lack of remorse, and an eating disorder that makes her unable to eat because she's so lovesick for a very underwhelming man. This back and forth with the married boyfriend goes on FOR YEARS while hardly anything else happens in the book, and the fat people look on and wonder why she doesn't move on with her life, applying their scowls and showing their [implied] ignorance and provincialism. If this served the character's development, then sure, I guess I could go along with it. But it's apparent to me that this is the author passing judgment on people with weight control problems. Even though her main character has NO self-control when it comes to her infidelity. But it's more okay [in the universe of this novel] because she is thin. 3.

I did enjoy Lowe's recounting of working on failing television shows because they taught me about day to day decisions that make or break a show in the industry--I like this kind of insight. But the collection as a whole sums up Rob's insular worldview: He loves his kids and wife a lot. He adulates self-determination. He slyly slips in admiration for Atlas Shrugged as great literature. He has a steadfast work ethic and has made strides in his own psychological development. He is sober and happy. So it's a mixed bag of sometimes interesting, sometimes quite boring, anecdotes. Take it for what you will. What pushed me from indifference to slight disdain is his parenthetical claim that libraries are irrelevant. That silly and slight remark captured Lowe's persistent glibness that shows he doesn't think much about anyone but himself and his inner circle.

(Are you listening, Harper Lee?)But when you take into account the beauty of the physical book itself, the meticulous and almost obsessive research that adds so much to our understanding of Wilder's progression as a writer, it is elevated to a full five-star accomplishment.

I'd love to see the Indesign files if they exist.]I'm reeling a bit from having to separate the novels and their lovely fictions and skewed timelines apart from reality (or a cobbled together reality from myriad primary sources of information). My mother had a boyfriend once (short-lived relationship, I'm still thankful) who corrected me when I said the Little House books were autobiographical and therefore true. He said no, the books might have been based on memories, but they couldn't be attributed to truth. I was furious that he would say something so mean to me, an affront to my sixth-grade self that questioned my reading of the text and personal relationship to the novels. Well, Art, I still think you were not the right match for my mother, but I have to hand it to you now. The books are fiction, written by Laura, coached and edited by Rose, and I still love them.___________1/9/2015: I just found out that the Ingalls family left Jack, beloved and almost human himself Jack, in Kansas.

I found a scathing Kirkus  from 1966 that reveals the ending and the uncredited critic's bitter words clinched my decision. I know I shouldn't judge the mores of the past with today's opinions, but when being called gay is painted as the very worst thing that could ever happen to you, akin almost to murder or other ""deviant"" moral crimes without irony and without any acknowledgment of the homosexuals' basic humanity, it's hard to bear. The novel's ethos asks white readers to see African American life from the shoes of those who had to live in a Jim Crow south, but doesn't ask for the same consideration of anyone else who doesn't conform to values that appear to be attributed to the views of white people and Christians.

Also, the novel and its characters' beliefs and judgments have aged less well over that decade, especially in terms of LGTBQA+ themes and race.

Some people have complained that the protagonist, Nora, is whiny, that nothing happens in the book, that the prolonged screed isn't credible because 37-year-old women in real life aren't yet ready to throw in the towel. I would argue that the whole purpose of a novel isn't to show the median level of acceptable response to feelings of inadequacy or (as is central to THIS novel) longing. The author Claire Messud builds a credible case for Nora's despair and if we believe that, we have to take Nora's word at face value.The work of the novel is to delineate the character's singular experience and elevate it beyond a mere telling. Nora may be a lot of things that we're told by some critics is unlikable, but nonetheless Nora is smart and honest about the areas where she feels bereft. And she acts on those feelings (for better or for worse) and is transformed. This book isn't cautionary; it's relevatory. ""Not a lot happens,"" especially if you're comparing it to thrillers and crime novels where a very heightened tension is near-mandatory. Instead, The Woman Upstairs itself is like Nora's artwork, wherein she recreates seminal moments in the lives of feminist artists (like Woolf, Neel, and Dickinson) in stark miniature, distilling complex sets of feelings and cramming them into tiny domestic spaces. I wish I could see the artwork that Nora describes in such detail. But the works' ekphrases, Nora's words, are are almost as satisfying. Her interior life is not withheld from us.

Tampa the city has little or nothing to do with the story; it could have happened in any sterile suburb in any part of the country. By setting it in a generic city, Celeste's perverse and cruel acts point right back at us and our larger culture. Like so much covered in the media, Celeste is so glib, so oblivious, so immune to guilt that even though she admits she has ""broken"" her victim, Jack, there is no remorse for it, not even a crumb. And there are no people in her life that matter to her unless they can be used to further her mission. To Celeste, all people are judged by their sexual worthiness. In her mind, no one is worthy of her but young boys. Therefore, she mocks and ridicules her colleagues, the parents of students, students who do not meet her criteria, and her hapless husband. This mockery is all internal, but it is written in such a way that reminds us that culture does this to anyone who isn't beautiful and camera-ready, through television, internet comments, and anywhere else where the id can run wild. While this book was written as satire and some people say they found some of Celeste's narration 'darkly funny,' there is nothing amusing about it when you consider her power to destroy lives because she gets away with so much based on her (very superficial) qualities of attractiveness.Celeste's narrative becomes at some level pornography; all the actors in the story are reduced to bags of meat that will or will not satisfy Celeste's tastes. And in our culture, we are subject to that same tendency. Stories about beautiful, i.e., worthy of sexual congress, women are elevated into myth on cable television, and hot teachers fulfill the fantasies of their maturing students. Tampa shatters the myth that hot teachers are doing their male students a big favor. Celeste's primary victim, Jack, is ruined by the end. She rejects his love, puts him in constant danger of being caught, and will allow nothing to get in the way of her desires. But even if Celeste cannot feel sorry for Jack and his family, we certainly can....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2013","May 03, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17225311-tampa

They gather with Ed's family at the country house to celebrate Ed's mother's sixtieth birthday. Julie has a sort of love for the family, but always feels like an outsider, and she consciously holds back things about herself from them to maintain a level of reserve. It's not clear if this is for self-protection or to maintain a sense of self that she feels she might lose if she were to reveal it.Without giving too much away, Julie shares a secret about her past with someone, and she does it not with just words that describe her memories, but with a sort of pantomime. She shows the character the way she dressed by putting cloth on her head, shows him the way she held her hands while she was praying, and then reveals more. There is a pulse in the story, summed up by the line, ""The understanding came to her that these alternating moods were two pulses in life, opposite and yet related, like the expansion and contraction of a heartbeat: one diffusing sensation and sending it flying apart, this one gathering it in the living centre.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 26, 2013","Feb 02, 2013","Jan 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13623891-married-love-and-other-stories

Enjoyable novel with a few bumps along the way.****I went for a walk today and started listening to this novel and as I walked along, all I could think about is the time when the lady I shared carpool with asked me when I was going to buy a minivan so I could carry more kids and when I said I wasn't, she fired me from carpool. A couple of years later, she was distressed by the woman who was in charge of our kids' charter school newsletter and when I expressed mild interest, she set up an interview with me at Starbucks, feverishly writing down my master's degree and even my college degree in English as qualifiers that would allow her to oust the other woman and put me in. This little coup made her feel good and me feel queasy, magnified every time I edited the newsletter columns and carefully laid the whole thing out in InDesign. Did a charter school need its weekly newsletter designed in InDesign? I'd say no. But I had volunteer hours to fill.

It is the stories of the saints that matter here, putting a spotlight on human nature and its attraction to violence and dreams of redemption. I knew nothing much about saint culture; I only vaguely recognize the impact of saints on art, language, and pulling older myths into religious frameworks. It's short and funny, worth a read.

One of my favorite posts so far this year is by Julie Buntin, which I'll link here.  Buntin talks first about reading The Stone Diaries, which is a book I consider a ""favorite"" but of course do not remember much of. So, as a tribute to amazing women writers and as a quest to see if I still regard this novel as one of the best, here we are again.Daisy Stone’s small hurts and disappointments, her larger heartbreaks, resonate now that I’m older. I see the implications of years slipping by. I see how aging softens us, yet we care less about the inconsequential. Shields’ writing is so precise. She creates a distinct vista and plops us in the middle and then we’re allowed to see Daisy from birth right to the end. Was this novel slighted at the time it was written as being ‘about nothing’? If it was, shame on those judges. The lives spelled out in the novel are worth reading about.-----First read in 1993. I read this book so long ago that I didn't think I should add it to my list.

This job training by proxy was in addition to the effect of several hours of intense counseling, having been steeped thoroughly in the worldview and psychological state of its main character, Frank Bascombe. When I’d finished the novel, I felt qualified to go get a real estate license and begin a new career that would allow me to find inner equilibrium, face my personal demons and heaviest regrets, and make the world somewhat better for those clients I would soon serve. This was a passing dementia, but strong, nevertheless.While Canada on its face has nothing to do with the more contemporary Bascombe trilogy, it is every bit as rich and complex if you’re looking at how a character can communicate his thought processes and state of mind from within the story. The narrator, the now-adult Dell Parsons, recounts the time he was fifteen and his world was detonated by his parents’ hapless reaction to external stresses. While the events themselves are riveting, the value of the novel lies in Dell’s recollection and storytelling, his ability to explain how children (or adolescents) think and react and construct coping mechanisms for events beyond their control. There is also a case to made for optimism, a commendation for people lucky enough to be born to choose the least-bad from an array of poor and poorer options.Dell emerges as a singular personality, separate from his identity as a son and twin brother from a family of outcasts; the now-adult narrator has been able to see the maturation and articulate it within the narrative. Is it coming-of-age? Well, it’s not so easy to boil the novel down to a “this” or “that.” It’s Dell’s story, first. But it’s also a clear portrait of a primitive and clannish America of 1960, before civil rights and Vietnam or the looming horror of our now post-9/11 and our utter surrender to our ugliest inclinations. Canada doesn’t romanticize the era; cast-offs and poor people and minorities are at the forefront, and cruelty pervades. Yet in the middle of all that, in the formative part of his life, Dell is still a child, even at fifteen, with an aching need to be loved and recognized as part a family of man. And then he lives his life accordingly.And so now I have a new tool in my kit, a way to see my life play out and try to make the most of my days, a way try to avoid judging too harshly those people I know who are unable to see their lives with that same spirit that things might improve. Ford’s writing is generous, and he evokes for me one of many artists who produce a superlative spirit of American writing. I admire and respect the work, and will not apologize for my belief that some books make us better....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 21, 2012","May 28, 2012","Dec 05, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12872236-canada

It's a good counterpoint to Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things.(view spoiler)[A few thoughts:Since this book was published in the late-1990s, our sensibilities about rape have changed. The idea that the Jesuits and their inquisition of Emilio Sandoz after his return are all predicated on him being ""a whore"" and murderer based on a limited report, one which contradicts all they know about Sandoz over decades of knowing him, is so unfair. Why they didn't consider him innocent and a victim of circumstance? Were they so small-minded that they couldn't accept that another planet with different species might be unknowable and unpredictable? Why the insistence that Emilio finally say ""rape"" when that's what he's been describing? What power is there in saying the word? And I wonder about all the humans in the novel's world who were being sexually exploited over centuries right there on planet Earth. Where was the Jesuit's concern and action to put an end to suffering of non-Jesuit peoples?Some of my favorite passages in the book were small conversations between characters.

In many of the cases, this is precisely what happens, and it becomes incumbent upon the reader to judge whether the texts *work* as part of the pairing. For example, Amy Hempel and Samuel Ligon both write short stories about a family in a car, and though the tone and effect of each story is completely different, the pairing makes sense.

That being said, the book's discussions are political, psychological, and philosophical in nature; the Contract looms in the background of discussions but is not explicit in all of the transcripts. Like all dialectical pieces, you can't skim this book. If you're willing to read slowly and absorb what each of them is saying about his/her experience as sexual and political beings in the post-WWII era that cleaved gender and sex and brought them to the fore, you might be able to determine where your own roles and expectations have steered you, your parents, and will push your own children. It isn't much in vogue to talk about Feminism (with a capital F) anymore; we say we are post-feminist, post-racial, etc. But without a doubt, the seminal 1950s, 60s, and 70s turned culture on its head.

As in Coffins, there is a signal that the old world is falling away, and only the artifacts of old junk shops and small town newspapers remain as psychic portals to the past....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 15, 2011","Jan 07, 2012","Apr 09, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/225089.The_Phantom_Limbs_of_the_Rollow_Sisters

Rather,there is a core set of characters and the novel branches out from each of them. But the way HM handles time and the three POV alternating chapters, the way he spreads and stretches a relatively small story, makes the reader's experience part of the narrative. If he'd truncated or a wily editor had cut out a third of the text, we wouldn't have become as immersed. The science behind the science fiction isn't cohesive; it does not click at any point into comprehension. Like religion, you have to take it at face value and not puzzle over it too much. The year 1Q84 is like the novel 1Q84. HM's style is deceptively simple. His characters chop vegetables and lead quiet and disciplined lives. They are cultured and introspective. By reporting their lives through their daily habits, he allows the reader complete access to essences. And with each reiteration of what happens on a minute to minute basis, we can slip a bit deeper into the characters' psychology and build for ourselves our own hope for the story's outcome. Yet even as the story pulls together, there is no glossing over and there is little hidden subtext. Happenstance and deliberate overlap between Tengo and Aomame are there on the page without irony or ambiguity....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 19, 2013","Mar 09, 2013","Mar 30, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10357575-1q84

I didn't mind it too much because the storytelling that came before it informed my understanding of the ending. It was like a lush epic novel and the sum of its parts created a glorious whole. For Sunset Park, however, there are glorious parts and a weakened whole, as the book ends at a moment of crisis that is unsatisfying and overwrought. I loved a lot of this novel, and in its scant pages, felt I was growing to know the interior lives of at least a couple of the featured characters. Auster is a master of bringing in the cultural to shape a story, and in this novel's case, The Best Years of Our Lives, the seminal home from war movie of the late 1940s, is its touchstone. But he doesn't take anything far enough. It's as if he were 2/3 done and decided he was tired of the story and so just cut it short. I'm glad I read it for its glorious good.

Some of the other s I've read here describe the grandmother as cranky, but I don't see her as a curmudgeon. Instead, both Grandmother and Sophia are experiencing awakenings and they slip back and forth from one psychological stage of maturation to another, and this motion causes some discomfort for each of them as natural time unfolds. Often, Sophia is so enraged by her inability to articulate her feelings which are on the cusp that she lashes out at Grandmother, and to her credit, Grandmother is not offended. She absorbs Sophia's curiosity and grief, and in turn, Sophia can return Grandmother's love in surprising ways, through stories and other acts of creativity. For her part, the Grandmother's own frustrations with aging are manifest as she sometimes regresses to child-like state of mind more in league with Sophia's. The natural setting of the island where these characters spend the summer symbolizes those forces inside us that cannot be contained; wildness is part of who we are and how we live with each other.Writing teachers would do well by their students by sharing this lovely and sometimes rebellious novel....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 29, 2011","Jun 12, 2011","Jul 05, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2263969.The_Summer_Book

He was thirty-one, married to a free woman named Caldonia, and they owned thirty-three slaves at the time of his death. Henry was born a slave, but his parents, Augustus and Mildred, worked hard to buy their own freedom and then Henry's freedom several years later. While they were free and Henry was not, he endeared himself to his owner, a man who had two families, one white and one with the love of his life, a slave. After Henry dies, there is unrest and some slaves disappear. This is the barest plot summary possible, because in actuality, the novel contains multitudes.If you're looking for a novel that will make you care deeply for the characters, be enraged at the untenable practice of slavery, and think about the parallels of hypocrisy then and now to justify the unjustifiable, this might be the novel you need....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 16, 2019","Feb 25, 2019","Jun 28, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34017093-the-known-world

But why be stingy? They're only stars. And I know how hard bringing a book to fruition is, how because there are so many books piling up in our lives and ever more hurtling toward us year after year, we take for granted that each author generally intends to make art. If I conclude that a book rises to the level of art on some level, and that I'm somehow affected by it, that I'm certain it will stick with me in a big or small way, that I was made to feel, then it becomes a four-star winner. A three says I read it, it was okay, it rose to the middle. And a five is a four with an exclamation point, one of the worst and most overused marks in language.Let the Great World Spin has scope, good writing, insight, and evokes empathy. There were days where I was tired, wanted the book to end somewhere in the middle. Then a new section would open up and I could tie narrative threads together, and in the end, the sum of all the parts, those voices and unexpected turns, the little acrobatic flourishes of writing that brought danger and passion alive, well, they kept me going to the end.

Stoner is a martyr, but a touching, likable, generous-hearted one. He was born in 1891 on a very poor farm in Missouri, and then spent the rest of his life there, teaching in the English department. His wife was insanely malicious, and his only child, a girl full of affection, deteriorated as he watched. His hopes, and his trust in the world, came to an end when his one true love--a pretty, serious-minded graduate student--was driven away from the campus by threats of scandal and professional ruin, and he died, unprotesting, in 1956. Mr. Williams shows extraordinary control and discipline in telling this extremely difficult sotry of the life of an ordinary, almost invisible, man.""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2009","Nov 03, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

Sittenfeld has expertly constructed and presented a believable main character and prep school setting, but the overall effect is left wanting. The author states in the reader's guide that she despises books with children narrators--thus having Prep's narrator be telling the story from a decade's distance because she hates it when the main character is dumber than the author (hey, C.S., read David Mitchell's Black Swan Green)--yet the main character's very ordinariness is a distraction and disappointment, and even her adult self reveals only the barest glimpse of herself as a woman. This mundacity of character lumps Prep in with Wally Lamb's I Know This Much is True or Stewart O'Nan's The Good Wife--fiction whose heart is a wooden trophy to realism, its blood completely drained and bottled for some other work of art.

How different we are as a country now, just a decade past the publication of this novel. No one could write a convincing portrait of Trumpland. It would seem too ludicrous. The novel American Wife, however, is a rich and deep plunge into marriage between two people who don't always agree, a showcase for the supportive wife trope we're all accustomed to. Sittenfeld's novel is so thoughtful and digs down into the ways that life circumstance can affect everything. I'm glad I took the time to listen to this audiobook over the last couple of weeks. 2018 note: I feel like I'm in such good hands when Sittenfeld is writing, and this novel was unfairly maligned because of its subject matter, the fictionalized life of Laura Bush.

This would be a great book club pick.2020 thoughts: In The Spiral Staircase: Karen Armstrong has just left the convent and must navigate the changed world of the 1960s. She didn't fit in as a nun and doesn't feel comfortable or happy in the outside, either. The memoir charts her journey of finding her place in the world, thinking she'll be an academic or a teacher and struggling in those fields, all while experiencing blackouts and exhaustion, which is written off for years as psychiatric and therefore not real. She's finally diagnosed with epilepsy and at that point she investigates various religious figures and the notion of God over centuries. Her conclusion after writing numerous books about Saint Paul, God, Islam, and more is that the worth of religion comes through acts. The memoir is highly critical of the institutions that suppress personality to the point of erasure. The nuns of Armstrong's world are not the well-meant and kind nuns in Rumer Godden's invention. Instead, the nuns in charge of Armstrong's life are petty bullies who belittle weaker nuns to the point of breakdown, then call them 'melodramatic.' The worst parts of organized religion are in this recollection, yet Armstrong dedicates her life toward understanding the importance to culture and human experience the desire to seek meaning beyond physical existence. The analogy of the spiral staircase, taken from Eliot's poetry, shows how Armstrong cobbles together a faith that does not depend on an institution. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,"May 08, 2020Jan 2004","May 13, 2020Jan 2004","Nov 15, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27308.The_Spiral_Staircase

So it is a novel where real estate features heavily into the story, but it's more about how the lure of easy money, tax dodges, adulterous affairs, and self-regard* create intoxicating thrills and certain moral failure. The novel's tone is pure masculinity, or, that is, masculinity as it was reinterpreted by Jane Smiley as she wrote this novel in the early 2000s. Interestingly, the women in Joe's realm can be studied only through Joe's perspective, so they emerge solely as they benefit or bother Joe. If there were one word to sum up the insights and recriminations Joe is able to recognize, it would be ""folly.""*Maddeningly, it has a short passage about Donald Trump and for the love of all that is good, why do I have to keep running into him everywhere?My memory of my impression when I first read this book in 2003: I like novels about real estate....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Jan 31, 2021not set","Feb 13, 2021Jan 2003","Nov 15, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/671573.Good_Faith

The rest is pretty good.Read for the first time in 1999; completely different, better, closer reading in 2010. There's so much inside this novel, yet it clearly predates the 9/11 age. Lots more to say.What does the novel's backward-in-time structure achieve? It's an analogy of deep memory. You have to worm your way through to the core of experience to make sense of all the stimulus and circumstance that's buried beneath the most recent and therefore accessible memory material. Nick Shay's organizing principle is the time period surrounding his youthful affair with Klara and then the accidental (?) murder he commits. What could have been the spiral into a life of underclass crime instead becomes his path to the Jesuit education and an almost routine life of middle class angst in a nuclear age. Each of the novel's central characters work their way backward from middle or late life to its genesis of the 1950s, where in Underworld, everything changed with the Cold War.Klara, talking about the atomic bond says several things that hint at Underworld's greater purpose:""They had brought something into the world that out-imagined the mind...Something that eludes naming is automatically relegated...to the status of shit."" 77""What I really want to get at is the ordinary thing, the ordinary life behind the thing. Because that's the heart and soul of what we're doing here.""How does nostalgia reflect or deflect truth?""Sometimes I think everything I've done since those years, everything around me in fact, I don't know if you feel this way but everything is vaguely--what--fictitious?"" Klara to Nick 73""You know how certain places grow powerful in the mind with the passing of time."" Nick 75""I remember sitting out there rocking lightly at anchor in some deserted cove and feeling a sense of awe, a child's sleepy feeling of mystery and danger and beauty."" Klara to Nick 75How does repetition and poetic prose work within the Underworld text?How does technology, especially film, reflect the novel's themes of memory and anxiety wrought by the nuclear age and Cold War?""And an approaching object made me think of a hundred movies in which something comes across the wavy plain..."" Nick 64Amalgamation of themes""Yes, that long ago, and after all this time it might seem to her that I was some invasive thing, a figure from an anxious dream come walking and talking across a wilderness to find her."" Nick 67 (Calls to ""comes across the wavy plain"" as a film motif.)""Power meant something thirty, forty years ago. It was stable, it was focused, it was a tangible thing. It was greatness, danger, terror, all, it held the world together. You could measure things. You could measure hope and you could measure destruction...Many things that were anchored to the balance of power and the balance of terror seem to be undone, unstuck.""

But all that really just allows us to coexist with the inviolable, untransversable, and utterly vast spaces between us.""The first half of this remarkable novel sets up a problem that is difficult to answer. If each of us have our own language and system of justice, can we come together? How to love fully, how to forgive, how to bless a person who presents himself as unworthy of all those graces? In Gilead, the Rev. John Ames writes a letter of reckoning to his young son as Ames is nearing the end of his life. The first half of the novel has Ames's narrative full of stories about his own family, particularly his father's rift with his grandfather, and later Ames's friendship with another minister he's known since they were boys, Rev. Boughton. So that is the setup. And in the second half, many of the things Ames was reluctant to explicitly discuss are revealed when Boughton's son Jack approaches him, transgressed and bereft. He'd been gone for a long time after he brought a terrible shame to the town. The reason for his return is undisclosed, but he clearly desires a sort of peace that only his father and Ames can bestow. It isn't given easily, and the discussions between Ames and Jack are halting and even cruel as the clock runs down and the story reveals itself.I read this novel closely, making marks in the book and approaching it as a way to evaluate life, even as an agnostic person far away from the setting and the circumstance. John Ames's story drifts between his memories, ideals, and realities just as our own thoughts meander as rivers. His heart wants so badly to open to love....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 06, 2021","Nov 13, 2021","Nov 13, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/68210.Gilead

But it meanders far outside the contrived boundaries of April 1999 into so many rivulets that it is more than that, and less. The novel fails, ultimately, as it tries to do too much. The main character, as Lamb notes in the afterword, is in a complicated labyrinth made up of family history, social inequity, genetics, fabrications, and universal chaos. In the end, the narrative offers up the platitude of ""hope"" and boils down to the secret of life being able to cope with whatever it hands you.

""Angels on Toast""It's uncanny when you read a novel that transcends its plot and becomes something else, all in the space of just a handful of pages. ""Angels on Toast"" is just that kind of literary sustenance, much more a meal than, say, what seems in comparison to be a vapid moment-in-time book, the current social novels I've read recently like ""The Emporer's Children"" or ""All We Ever Wanted Was Everything,"" novels that offer crumbs of insight and only scant entertainment. I've heard of but had never read any of Dawn Powell's work until I bought this title, and I can see now why she engendered a loyal following. ""Angels on Toast"" manages to be several things at once: it is a prescient critique of the rise of business and how from that ascent the American Dream is spun from vapor but ultimately falls flat; it is a psychological gender study that examines the plight of the white collar man, his harping and tragic wife (or wives), and the lures of the manipulative but self-preserving mistress. These characters might be stock in the mind of a lesser writer, but Powell achieves, with flair, to painstakingly mold the individual worlds of each of the three main characters so that the stock situation, when met by society's expectations, renders something far beyond a traditional American tragedy or even a comedy of manners. If you're tempted to try ""Angels on Toast,"" pay attention to Powell's focus on light, how it enters the room, how it shines on or evades the scene, whether its source is from nature or incandescence. The lights help us piece together the novel's mysteries of love and desire, even as they are unraveled and laid bare right in front of our eyes....more",Notes are private!,0,12,2,"Apr 29, 2021not set","May 10, 2021Aug 06, 2009","Jul 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/217076.Angels_on_Toast

Not that John Sanford's Lucas Davenport series isn't lit, but it is tightly-boxed within its genre. There are no big ideas or themes or symbols or other literary devices that take the Prey series from one setframe into the larger literary universe. I like them for what they are: tight prose, emotionally complex, round characters, a few hints but just enough mystery to keep you going. Remember when I read ""The Moonstone"" in Jeff Franklin's class and wrote all those papers about detective fiction as shaped by reader response criticism? Ah, those were the days...I digress. Who will Lucas bed or accidentally get killed next? What happened to his daughter? Does Lucas fundamentally change from one book to the next? Does it matter? I wish I felt like reading EM Forster or Faulkner this summer, like I used to. Or I could pick up Woolf's ""The the Lighthouse"" and really revel in that incredibly sparse but strangely lush prose. But I don't. I just don't feel them right now. But on the good news front, my book club is reading ""Through a Glass Darkly"" for the July pick. I read this book when it came out, probably fifteen or more years ago, and loved the reading experience. So I'm looking forward to that.

You can read the backmatter and blurbs if you want to know what happens in this novel. Had I been able, I would have given this book 3.5 stars, but can't bump it all the way up to four. The novel is successful in linking the concepts of women in pre- and post-9/11 life and the work they do or do not do, but does not construct a complete world where these characters are supposedly living. The tone is almost too polemic, and there are some plot contrivances that require more dramatic resolution. Wolitzer has a strong grasp of character building as far as she goes, and there are a couple of very lovely moments, but ultimately, I was left wanting more than she could deliver.

And it will be studied for its themes of loss and immediacy, as well as its duality of innocence and experience. To me, it's not a cautionary tale about what might happen to us in the postapocalypse. That's the setup to tell a more important story about resiliency and goodness.
