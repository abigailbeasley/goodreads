Some lengthy quotes-“You probably have access to an abundance of love already. This kind of love might not kiss you in the rain or propose marriage. But it will listen to you, inspire you, restore you. It will hold you when you cry, celebrate when you’re happy, and sing All Saints with you when you are drunk. You have so much to gain and learn from this kind of love. Carry it with you forever, keep it as close to you as you can. ““It is futile and knackering to try and make all your tiny choices representative of your moral compass then beat yourself up when this plan inevitably fails. Do as much good as you can. The weighty representation of the world cannot rest on every decision you make.”“Life is a wonderful, mesmerizing, magical, fun, silly thing. And humans are astounding. We all know we’re going to die, and yet we still live. We shout and curse and care when the full bin bag breaks, yet with every minute that passes we edge closer to the end. We marvel at a nectarine sunset over the M25 or the smell of a baby’s head or the efficiency of flat-pack furniture, even though we know that everyone we love will cease to exist one day.

Quick read that I thought of more as cute rather than a mystery. The narrator is described as “different, special, unique, etc.” throughout the book. She is very kindhearted and defaults to giving people the benefit of the doubt, which lands her in less than ideal situations. My biggest takeaway is to be kind, always. “Thats the trouble with pain.

But if it doesn’t matter, then why is validating?) I thought she did a great job showing the span of emotions someone can have about a singular event.

What struck me the most was that once the veil was lifted and defectors knew the lies and corruption of the regime, there was sometimes still a longing to return. Left behind family, familiarity of lifestyle, and having a solid identity were all things that they left behind that tug at them throughout the rest of the book.

In short, the book is about a woman who loses 10 years of her memory which include significant life events. The most interesting part to me was that her personality changed back to 10 years ago, and then returned later when she regained memory, although she maintained parts of her younger self that she previously lost. One line in particular stood out to me “hearing the facts of her life, without the memories, untangled her feelings.” Made me wonder what I would think about myself if I were given my untangled facts.

This premise of this book is Black Mirror-esque which made it both uncomfortable yet hard to put down. The premise is the intersection of DNA testing and dating apps - a service that genetically “matches” you to your soulmate.
