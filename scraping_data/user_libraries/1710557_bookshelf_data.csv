JamilIt's true when they say that books can take you to other worlds. those other worlds may not even be far a way, or fantasy/science fiction based. Jamila Minnicks has created a world rooted in the Civil Rights era of the United States-- the one that shaped my childhood world-- to New Jessup, Alabama. There, the residents of the all-Black town hold tight to the town they've built, and have rejected integration. Instead they work to keep the community they created from the swamp itself safe, secure, and segregated. Yet there are those who live in New Jessup, and love it, too, who hope to move the town into the mainstream of desegregation, and increase the town's political power in a new world. The characters Minnicks has created are full-fledged, bringing forth the joys and sorrows of life at the time clearly. For many readers, opposition to desegregation is taught mostly as a white issue, but the struggles and opposing viewpoints of desegregation are fully examined from the African American point of view as well.The voices of various 20th century civil rights leaders appear are heard throughout the novel. It is a thought provoking novel, a lesson in social history, beautifully told, with characters that spring from the pages of the book into the imagination of the reader.

Thank you so much.Though not of the tech world, I have family and friends that flitter through it in varying capacities, and have learned that ""There's an app for that"" is one of modern day life's Golden Rules. In this case, there are several apps, though the main focus is WAI (pronounced way) which is ""A social network for the meaningfully curious"". The Starter Wife chronicles WAI, from its beginning as an idea in the head of its creator, Asha Ray. It also chronicles Asha's relationship with her high school crush when they meet again years later, their whirlwind romance, marriage, and the formation of the team working with them to spearhead WAI. The times are quirky, fluid, and evolving; the characters in the story are too, as they work to build an app that hinges on the rituals of faith without delving into religion. They succeed, and WAI skyrockets into and beyond the popularity of all the current big dogs on the internet. And that's just the beginning.I marvel that Tahmima Anam was able weave so many critical issues of today into the fabric of The Starter Wife, with such a deft hand. She doesn't just issue/name drop; her attention is sincere, and uses a critical eye. Let me also mention some of the build that went into the advertising of TSW. It in itself is a work of art. There's a landing page for both the US and UK editions that links to Facebook (of which I no longer have an account, so was unable to explore further). Also, there's https://www.utopiacollective.ai/colle..., a page set up as if it is the incubator which Asha, Cyrus et al ended up in as they worked to breathe life into WAI and beyond. Take a look at some of the other startups incubating there. This is part of the cast of characters interacting (though my favorite secondaries do not show up on that list, Asha's family. They are spectacular.)I'm not going to try and summarize the novel. Suffice it to say it occupied my mind quite thoroughly while reading it, and still does. I'm in the process of clearing my bookshelves, but this one stays for a bit.One final note: I've lived through far too many disasters (world, national, and personal). When catastrophes, or other life events I've experienced start appearing in books, it can be a little uncomfortable. I was a little worried when I saw the timeline moving toward the COVID-19 pandemic. I shouldn't have been. Like the writing and the sensitivity of the rest of the book, Tahmima Anam handled it with skill and a keen awareness of the times....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 10, 2021","Jun 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711675-the-startup-wife
