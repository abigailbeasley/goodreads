A double edged sword. But when her brother goes missing for his political views, her world collapses.From a historical perspective, it was interesting learning about the Kurdish people. How they lost their country when the British drew out maps of Iran, Iraq and Turkey -excluding them. A culture pulverized for its identity, history, language and brutally punished when not complying with the Iranian laws. And of course the oppression of women whose lives were worthless.While I found this to be a revealing story of the devastation these people have suffered -there is much ugliness in the treatment of the Kurds - I had difficulty maintaining my connection with Leila. This didn’t happen until nearing the end of the story. Without revealing any spoilers, she seemed to transition to being inconsistent & unlikeable.

And it’s intense.Marianne, a mother, is the centre of the universe for her 2 teen daughters, Mae & Edie. But when she attempts suicide, the girls are forced to move in with their estranged father. The story is told from multiple POV’s -each voice distinctive in their own perceptions of what they've witnessed in this dysfunctional family.This is about mental illness and abuse- how they become entwined; the victims; the social injustices - the obvious ones but also the hidden ones; the betrayals from the ones who should have been the most trustworthy.The prose is beautiful and poetic; the subject is brutal and raw. A debut from 2018 that flew under the radar. Clearly an author to watch for (Apekina has a new release coming out this year!)Thank you to my GR friends who brought this one to my attention although I’m now emotionally drained.5⭐️...more",Notes are private!,93,140,1,"Jan 14, 2024","Jan 18, 2024","Jan 02, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40663721-the-deeper-the-water-the-uglier-the-fish

The peaksWhat happens behind closed doors…when they are thrown wide open.This is an exploration into the circadian rhythm of a marriage; of a family. The peaks and the valleys; the past childhood traumas that shaped the characters into who they became.Hill takes on a journey within this 20 year relationship. Elizabeth, with a PhD in psychology, constantly comparing studies, conducting experiments within her business and her own relationships; constantly on the search for improving every aspect of life. Jack, the artist and pleaser, always fearing rejection. We meet them early on in the exciting days of dating to the consistency and monotony of a long relationship on the verge of a crisis.Themes of abandonment, anxiety, guilt, the impact social media has on mental health, redemption and acceptance.This did drag in one area when we are taken into a deep dive on Facebook algorithms. 40 pages -Yawn. The structure also was a little messy for me: was I reading about -child Jack or adult Jack? Only took a few sentences but enough to break the momentum. Perhaps this was Hill’s own social experiment for the reader. However, despite my criticisms, overall this was a well written story on human psychology.

On and off with up and down s.Groff hasn’t disappointed me yet- so I took a chance.Her writing is captivating. A servant, who we only know as Girl, has run away and is in the vastness of the wilderness. We learn she arrived to the new country via a boat with a family and how she lost her first love aboard (or overboard in this case) only to find this new country riddled with famine, disease and some barbarian behaviours. This is a story of courage and survival. The hardships of starvation, assault, poverty, and atrocities done to man by man.But it was also a visceral read. I felt the dampness, the cold; smelled the fields and the wilderness.This plight was a fight. It started off as a fearful one which gradually became a quiet and lonely one with only her thoughts; musings; fears; her reflection and acknowledgement of the past; visions; hallucinations and how strength and resilience build character.This won’t be a read targeted for everyone. It is dark. It is depressing.

This is one that does that but this is also based on real events and real people.When the Japanese entered the war in 1942, many evacuees tried to get out of Singapore. Some were luckier than others. One merchant ship, Vyner Brooke, attempting to get people out, was hit sending terrified people into the ocean.Some managed to make it to safety on an island only to be captured and held hostage for 3 years 7 months.This was a story of brave sisters. Holy ones; biological ones; and ones who became like sisters. It’s about formidable women who had much strength during a time of captivity. About friendships developing in the midst of trauma.The disconnect for me were the many characters to keep track of which prevented me from connecting with any.However, that being said, Morris opens the story with a worthy tribute to nurses; and closes it with the her notes which really were the emotional link I was looking for.

Not so much.I’m fascinated with the concept of fasting and the healing aspects as well as the muscle building properties of the food we eat and when we eat them as we age.She is compelling, charismatic and a strong voice on a taboo subject that has widely been ignored. I think her messaging is on target: avoid toxic ingredients (read labels); sugar bad; complex carbs bad; fruit and vegetables good; protein animal and/or plant good; good and bad fat; good and bad oils. Fasting with your hormonal cycle and putting your body into ketosis where the real healing begins. Is fasting the holy grail of weight loss and healing? It makes sense and has been around for many years- this isn’t the first book to explore this. But I don’t think it’s a complete program. Although she does goes deeper and considers insulin levels, monthly cycles and hormones. Since I started following her, I do a 13 hour window fast daily. Rather than weight loss however, my focus is on functionality as I age and cleaning up my internal carburetor.What throws me off is the “Dr” title. It’s misleading. She is not a physician but a chiropractor. LeAnn Rimes does the intro which doesn’t add credibility to the subject matter. This, however, could just be a me problem. Overall, she does disseminate info in a powerful and impactful voice and although she isn’t a leading medical doctor/scientist/biologist on the subject matter, I think her value here is as an advocate for women trying to lose weight at different times in their lives.3.5⭐️For those interested, in longevity I also highly recommend Andrew Huberman, Scientist hubermanlab; Gary Breker, Biologist @ultimatehumanpod; KarenMartelHormones, Hormonal Specialist; Netflix series The Blue Zones w Dan Buettner.The more info we are equipped with the better choices we can make to live our best and healthiest lives....more",Notes are private!,79,119,1,"Dec 14, 2023","Dec 15, 2023","Sep 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61369435-fast-like-a-girl

A fight to abolish slavery dividing a country. There is no place for neutrality. Either in or out.Joetta, a woman who won’t compromise her principals and wishes to remain neutral, discovers the hard way that being neutral is seen as being disloyal. Her husband has left to look for her eldest son who has enlisted. She’s left to take care of the farm, her young son, and a cantankerous father in law who doesn’t hold her views.This wasn’t so much about the war but rather how relationships change when views differ and the damage to the closest ones without realizing their vulnerability. Everhart paints a picture of the desolation and isolation in these towns during this time. Heartbreaking yet this character demands recognition for her strength, courage & bravery, even at the cost of devastation and loss.4.5⭐️...more",Notes are private!,69,109,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 10, 2024","Aug 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/138378707-when-the-jessamine-grows

Hannah’s writing has matured much like a fine wine. Each of her stories becoming richer, more complex, multi-layered.The Women is a tribute to the many unsung female nurses who served in the Vietnam War. Frankie, 20, has graduated nursing school and has enlisted. Although green, her nursing skills sharpen during her 2 tours. However when she returns home, the welcome isn’t a warm one.The brevity and courage these veterans had. Not only fighting for their lives over seas, but fighting for their own recognition at home amid a storm of protests and division. The sacrifices made. The lies told.Hannah masterly develops a character from a young naive girl, to a professional combat nurse, to a veteran returning home experiencing many of the symptoms men did- except many unaware women even served. Grief, PTSD, shame, addiction and healing.5⭐️ Hannah, you knocked it out of the park....more",Notes are private!,117,217,2,"Feb 19, 2024Feb 19, 2024","Feb 21, 2024not set","Jul 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127305853-the-women

Yet, we see still see the costs women endure of this narrow minded thinking and the inequalities that exist be it in another country, another state, another race, another religion.

I was in Vietnam with the heat, the bugs and witnessing the startling beauty paralleled with the sadness of poverty and disease. This is a story that takes place in Saigon, just before the war erupts in 1963. American women who work together to be ‘help meets’ for their husband’s blossoming careers. Their naïveté in thinking the small acts they committed were helping a greater cause. McDermott masterly takes us through a characterization of quiet expansiveness while bringing us on a journey to a place in time where a country, in its own greed, failed to recognize it didn’t belong.5⭐️...more",Notes are private!,96,167,1,"Nov 12, 2023","Nov 19, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/101404407-absolution

She has penned and developed a character who is strong minded and tenacious. Indentured to a family at the age of 10 when her father left, Deborah (Robbie)grew up with a family of boys. A girl, who in 1776, wants to fight for the cause - for the Revolution. She can after all run, shoot, cook, barber just as fine as any male can- maybe even better. She can also read, write and quote scriptures with a passion. But, the times prevent her from enlisting. It’s sheer determination and desire that propel her to a place in the war. A place where it is more difficult and hazardous to hide what’s known to be true.Themes abound. The sobering of soldiering a war not fully supported. The disheartening truths of war. The factors of weather, hunger, poverty, heartache and grief that comes from insurmountable losses-all for a war on the verge of mutiny. Loyalty, friendship and love layered into this story.Fascinating enough, Harmon discovered this rebel of a woman existed although little was published about her. You have done her justice, Harmon. She’s a magnificent character and woman who many readers will come to cherish.Another 5⭐️ for this author who has quickly become my go to favourite for HF. ...more",Notes are private!,12,153,1,"Aug 09, 2023","Aug 12, 2023","Mar 23, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58769584-a-girl-called-samson

I love when I can relate to a story with the mention of monumental markers: the Eiffel Tower, the arc du triomphe, the cobblestone roads. Ah, give me a croissant avec a cafe au lait, and I’m there.The Golden Doves are 2 women who were part of the resistance in France against Hitler. Josie & Arlette. How they were recruited, how they were captured and sent to Ravensbruck, and how they survived the after when so many did not. 8 years later the 2 are on searches. One on the hunt for a notorious doctor who did unspeakable procedures on women at Ravensbruck; the other, for her missing son abducted there.The story is clearly structured with some back and forth timelines that worked well. The characters physically and emotionally scarred from their past.But it’s more than a survivor story. It's a game of cat and mouse. MHK’s research reveals these rat lines where Nazis were able to escape to other countries with the aid of various organizations. Overall, there were a few moments of implausibility. However, MHK has written another well researched fictional account I found compelling.4⭐️...more",Notes are private!,2,123,1,"Jun 09, 2023","Jun 14, 2023","Mar 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61714636-the-golden-doves

The war where children are stolen and not returned to their jewish families.An annihilation of a faith. Of a people. Children passed around from place to place; country to country.

Preventing them from returning to their roots.

From Somewhere in Africa, where the slave traders raped the women, burned the villages and shackled those they thought would bring them an income.

Loved the Diamond eye which I read in France last year. Now I have dusted off this one and she is joining me on the beaches of st.Lucia.This is a twofer. It is historically paralleled - first Great War (1915) and end of WWll (1949) with Eve being in both. A British spy in the first war and the trauma she suffered to the present day (1949) where she has been asked by a young girl to help locate her missing cousin. Revisiting the locations years later, jars Eve’s memory into sharp focus and the years sacrificed being a spy.This was fascinating. The Alice Network being a group of women spies. Trained to bring intel to the Brit’s. Historical buffs will love this one as it is based on some truths. It was intense at times, brutal even. Themes of early pregnancy, trust, grief, shame. And most significantly, the role women played during both wars. 4⭐️ ...more",Notes are private!,0,141,1,"Jan 09, 2023","Jan 16, 2023","Jan 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32051912-the-alice-network

He delivers a Holocaust story with brutal precision and bold prose.91 year old Greta is reflecting on her life. Her shame and guilt that has followed her as her father was a nazi commandment of one of the internment camps. How at 12 years of age, she and her mother escaped to Paris, with new identities, afraid they would be discovered for their own complicity in war crimes.When a neighbour’s child enters her life, 91 year old Greta has an opportunity for absolution. Or the closest thing to it. She confronts her own dark past and finds the strength and courage to defend someone vulnerable, as she had failed to do for any of those Jews camped outside of her home.Boyne does a deep dive into this deeply flawed character. How one can never escape the past; How events shape who we are; How we remain broken until we can reconcile the past with the present; how we can still change who we are from who we were. Even decades later.Boyne, you took a chance delving into this genre, but successfully left an impression of Greta and a reminder of all the victims who suffered. My heart now breaks in many places.5⭐️...more",Notes are private!,8,174,1,"Jan 02, 2023","Jan 05, 2023","Jan 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61111301-all-the-broken-places

I really wanted this one to speak to me as her others have. Here she attempts to intricately weave 4 stories together.There is a Sam’s story - a survivor of those children sent on a Kindertransport train out of Austria during WW2 in 1938.There is Anita who emigrated with her mother from El Salvador only to be ripped apart at the border in 2020 during the pandemic.There is Selena who is an immigration lawyer trying to locate Anita’s mother. Then we have Leticia. Whose own heritage is that of an immigrant from Central America. Personally, I think it was far too ambitious. The child’s POV just didn’t work for me. Significant events could have had their own stories: The plight immigrants experience when making their way to the US only to be separated. An inhumane policy. Paralleling the peril of children from WW2 whose parents gave their children to other countries to ensure their safety. Both facing risks of abuse.The writing is Allende awesome.

Inga, an Austrian, marries and relocates to Moscow, 1955; Anya, a student, has had the opportunity to go abroad and is now back in Moscow working for the state, 1980.Dual identities developed to survive in a communist regime. To serve only the state. A country known for its violence as a solution to nonconformists. No democracy; no freedoms. To live there is to either accept the defeat of reality or rise up and risk your life.A compelling story of intrigue, betrayals, loyalties and espionage. The west vs the east. CIA. KGB. Strong female characters who hid in their own shadows for fear of being caught for their own treachery.

This was another path of destruction where the Nazis formed a blockade around Leningrad and kept its citizens in a noose-thereby cutting them off from food and other supplies, killing almost a million civilians. This was known as the siege on Leningrad and it lasted nearly 900 days. Starvation, cannibalism, disease, frigid temperatures. Wretched circumstances.This is the story of 2 women. Sofia, who is a violinist, and her granddaughter, Lena. It is their journey of survival. Brutal day and nights. Brave women. Under the oppression of Stalin only to be at the mercy of Hitler. What I enjoyed about this story is it provided a perspective that little is written about. The 2 female characters were strong and I could connect with Sofia. What I didn’t like so much, a couple of editing errors; a love story at the beginning that was juvenile but did mature so I got over that. But, there was a huge gap from 1942 to the end of the war. The struggle I’m sure didn’t stop but the focus of the story was on the 1st year of the siege. There were another 2 years - how did these years differ from the 1st? What happened? Overall, 4.25⭐️I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the current situation in Ukraine. With Putin raging this war against helpless civilians. One would hope that the erroneous decisions made by Hitler in WW2 wouldn’t transpire again.

I need to understand how these people can live in the stifling conditions they do, imprisoned in a culture of communism and political corruption. How their world is grey. The housing, the education, the poverty for the bulk of the population, the weather. The brightness of youth and curiosity quickly squeezed out. Hope and dreams savagely flattened. Their world as they know it. This is a story about 4 teenagers and the friendship they brought to each other’s lives in the 1980’s. The dreams of travelling; of leaving the country and seeing the rest of the world in colour. The hope the country would evolve to be a better place. The joy they found in being together; debating, conversing and having fun as limited as that was with the political suffocation they endured. But life happened and brought tragedy. The grief of loss weighing them down forever. The grief of a country that never really changed. This history carried on the backs of an entire population.The terrain is harsh and extreme. The hardships families faced. The story of these teens whose lives tragically never played out with what we take for granted in the West.The writing is beautiful but heavy.

One in 1991, with Rosie returning to Moscow after her mother defected and searching out her history of her Papa and sister being murdered. The historical one takes place during the Russian revolution; then the Leningrad siege; the gulag and the PTSD that accompanies survivors; a love story.Interweaved are fairytales and porcelain Russian dolls that hold the key to history. Some murky mysteries, a communist culture and a risky romance. BUT, there is at least one mystery left unsolved and for that Loesch, I deduct a star. 4⭐️...more",Notes are private!,2,124,1,"Apr 09, 2023","Apr 14, 2023","Aug 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61261026-the-last-russian-doll

In 1629, this ship set sail to the Dutch East Indies carrying an orphan, Mayken, and her nursemaid Imke. Then tragedy strikes months after their voyage has begun.Fast forward, 1989, Gil who who lost his mother, finds himself on an island to be with his Granddad.

ItValery is a soviet prisoner who has been released from the gulag and placed in “city 40” to serve out the remainder of his sentence as a scientist. It’s 1963.An odd city name, but more suspicious is the dead forest he has driven through. His specialization is in radiation. But much of his empirical data is driven by his moral compass which keeps him dangerously close to voicing his concerns. Which would mean death. Thousands of people who live there are unaware of the extreme amounts of radiation they are exposed to. The Russian motto: see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil or there will be deathly consequences. Paranoia. Those who turn against the Soviet regime are kidnapped for further scientific exposure.An intimate friendship develops between Valery and a KGB officer, Shenkov, which becomes his lifeline. Great characters; an abundance of info on radiation - AND - Albert, the octopus.The realism of this story is what is most disturbing. A threatened nuclear war and what Russia is willing to put their own people through to study the effects and uphold the illusion to the rest of the world they are the most powerful; even at the costs of their own human casualties.

Shameful history that will resound for centuries.And shockingly, it wasn’t until 1990 that Latvia became Soviet Free.

Well, let me tell you: He’s a wild red headed melungeon, whipper snapper of a hillbilly. A young boy with a mind so expansive, how he describes life, is large.Orphaned at 11, Demon’s teenage years are fraught with sadness and hopelessness. Through foster homes, running away and at last finding his grandmother. A life headed to go off the rails, somehow maintained its balance, until it didn’t. As in life, there are tops and bottoms. In Demon’s, the bottom bottoms out with opiates- plundering his chances of making it out of poverty.Demon is a character you will grow attached to and cheer for in his early ages simply for his resilience.

Mexico 1846. The war has begun between Mexico and the US over the Rio Grande boundary. Irish immigrants supporting Americans in stealing land from the Mexicans. But, the Americans degraded them; mistreated them. Many deserted, crossing the raging Rio Grande to fight alongside the Mexicans, raising more than a finger in resisting them and fighting for their own dignity.This isn’t an Irish lullaby or a Mexican fiesta. This is the grit of war, the loss of land and home. The degradation of fighting for a country not yours and suffering for it. I had no idea California & New Mexico at one time was part of Mexico.

Thinking I would do my own self imposed sanction on Russia. But not all Russians are Putin supporters. Sasha is a young girl who dreams. Dreams themselves being a defiant act. She hopes of becoming an actress in post war Russia in Moscow. A dangerous proposition if you live under the oppressive regime. Dreams don’t exist here. Survival does. Dreams are a luxury for the elite. But after finding her uncle’s journal, an artist forced to become a soldier, she knows she must escape. But escape isn’t what we in the western world would think. Characters she portrays enable her to slip into another skin rather than living her own life under the lies and corruption of the regime. Gorokhova delivers a poetic, impactful and authentic story of Sasha, her horrific family history & the brutal world in which she lives. Forbidden Love, disappointment, hopelessness- themes that are “unpatriotic” under the iron curtain.What is happening in Ukraine are the unthinkable horrors that happened decades ago. The Russian people being fed lies by this regime and the proverb: hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Add in believe no evil: Live strong. Keeping the population in a fog of fear by intimidation, ignorance and silence. 5⭐️Interestingly enough, the author herself left Russia and resides in the U.S. now.

I was in France- with little luxury time for reading.Anyone who follows me knows I’ve been gobbling up Ukraine, and Soviet reads. This one takes places when Ukraine was still part of the USSR in 1942. Germany made the bold step to move into Soviet territory in their quest to take over Europe.Mila, is a sharp shooter whose skills make her a Soviet war heroine. But this story is also based on fact and her 309 noted kills. Also known as Lady Death, she was a graduate and historian. But even as that title harbours steel, this is the story of her relationships, single parenting, and the strong female in a time when women were shunned for holding high ranks. And the character development from being a child bride at 15.It’s also about the Soviet culture and how it’s communism is ingrained at an early age. Individualism is not. Everything is done for the motherland.I haven’t read anything by Quinn before so I’m thrilled to know she has a few more out there waiting for me.If you get a chance to read a physical copy, it does include some great photos of her.
