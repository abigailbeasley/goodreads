Willa is in her early twenties and doesn't know what do with her life. So she takes a nannying job with a nice girl -- with a ridiculously pretentious name (Bijou) in the the fanciest apartment in Tribeca and starts to feel like she belongs. Like she might be part of the family. Which she is not. She is the help. She has to pay for her own Mandarin lessons which is ironic and she is half Chinese and cannot speak the language. This is a quiet book. There were places for explosions that did not happen. Willa did not get caught wearing her bosses incredibly fancy dress and she did not have sex with her boss' attractive younger brother. But in the course of her year, she changes.

I also used to always ask myself, why is she only in such sad movies. This book explains a lot. While I don't think this was Polley's intention, I felt such heartbreak, reading about her as a child actress being asked to do insane things. Sexual abuse. And I felt a connection to her, wanting to do things differently, to be a mother. Walking her kids to school. There is something about the voice she lands on when writing, honest, direct, incisive.

I bought it because it was recommended by someone's last book I loved. And it's about a woman who is my age and buys a house and goes on a spiritual journey. I just bought a house and I thought maybe -- not just reading for pleasure -- but maybe this journey would be interesting or even useful to me. But here is the thing. Not all white women of a certain age are the same. So that's good to know. I can never fault an author because I want to go on a different journey. I think it probably even says a lot when a book makes you mad. ...more,Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Sep 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55655108-wayward

It was so wonderful to actually meet the real Porochista in real life and sort of fall in love with the actual person. Reading her memoir, SICK, was a fascinating entry into the actual life woman behind the tweets -- so much of the stories in this book was already familiar in a strange way -- and FB posts and the essays and novels. It felt almost like a privilege, to read her actual story. I am in awe of how honest this book is. And well crafted, jumping through time and place. The sentences. The scene of her car crash coming home from class late one night read like a thriller. This memoir also me angry at so many doctors who caused so much more unnecessary pain. This whole book is page turner, and I read it over the course of a weekend.

The voice of Joanna DeAngelis is so honest, real, vivid, human. She is so filled with love for her daughters, Laney and Anna, and for her dog, Tom, a standard poodle, who is a real character unlike any other dog in fiction. She is also so filled with anger for her ex, for Ned, who is a fool, an idiot, who pays dearly for the poor treatment of a woman he actually loves. Somehow, I liked him anyway. The strange sad romance almost effortlessly created on the page. It was so easy to hate the other woman, Trudi Mink, with her horrible name and Instagramed existence. I loved Joanna's rage. Her honestly. Her sexuality. Her shameless cyber stalking before her death, the way she takes it to a whole other level as a vengeful ghost. You can do this only in fiction, and it seemed like Stephanie Gangi enjoyed herself like crazy when writing this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jul 30, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28220794-the-next

Gould gets it so right: what it feels like to be a certain age, living in New York. How, it is, in fact, possible to fall further than you think. And how friends sometimes fight. Make up. Or don't make up. Gould also wrote the moving text message exchange in the history of literary text messages. I say this in all seriousness -- it is how we live now, after all.The book is a pleasure. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18490619-friendship

I feel like the author knows things about life and this knowledge, it seeps into her fiction. She also writes incredibly beautiful sentences, sentences that I admire.This is a novel about marriage, the day to day, the eating meals, and sharing a home, and overcoming a hard period, like a jail sentence. It is not an ad for marriage. I read this book quickly, like a page turner, with an impending sense of dread, worry what trouble that neighbor would eventually cause. She does. The married couple, though, unwittingly, they cause some pretty big trouble for their neighbor, to. Rough story. The story is framed almost in a thriller bookend; we know the end at the beginning but it still comes as a surprise at the conclusion of the novel.There is a funny thing, sometimes, about being a writer reading novels. There was a moment at the end of the book when I felt, here, this is where the story ends. It is not where Robin Black ended the book. It was interesting moment for me, and I had to put aside my own preference. This book is also about art. The painter and writer wife live in what is there own personal artist colony. Wow, did I feel the pressure of their lives -- which ironically enough allowed them to do what they love. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Aug 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18142427-life-drawing

I am not surprised by the enormous success her novel has received since publication last fall. My blurb:“Prepare yourself: The Almond Tree may very well move you to tears. Michelle Corasanti’s profound and finely crafted debut novel tells the story of one man, Ichmad Hamid, from his humble beginnings as a scared and helpless child in an occupied village through to his inspirational rise to power and influence. This intimate tale of love and loss and awareness shines a greater understanding of the personal toll of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 11, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14929224-the-almond-tree

Wham and then bam and the crispness of the prose. I have loved A.M. Homes for a long time, since when I read the first short story about the married parents in the suburbs who smoke crack when the kids were away. But after the outstanding beginning, this book becomes about Harold Silver's redemption in Westchester and it was long and I wasn't willing to go with all of the twists and turns in the plot or the happy ending that comes only a year after the beginning -- and I love montage like happy endings. I just couldn't believe that those kids with the murdered mother and horrible father could be happy. I couldn't believe that anyone would be happy having someone else's demented old parents move into your home, and I could not believe that many women wanted to have sex with the protagonist. Sometimes, when I don't love a book, I wonder if maybe it is me -- and not the book -- and this might be one of those times. May I be forgiven (oh, that is corny. Sorry.) It's a great title. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,0,not set,not set,"Sep 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13589186-may-we-be-forgiven

In the big moment of tragedy, I couldn't read the pages, they were too awful and I had to skim through them because I couldn't take it. I am a softy. What Jillian Medoff does so well is write about the day to day. Getting her kids to school. Loving them. Worrying about what is right, what is wrong. Medoff is just in the head of her character in such a way that is staggering. And so many Eliot's thoughts triggered emotions about my own life. About being a mother and being a daughter and what it means to be divorced. Or to be uncomfortable in your own skin. This book takes place in Atlanta and a beach house, there are no stunning locations. It somehow registered for me. Ordinary life. How hard it is. How good it is too. The paperback has a picture of a sandcastle on the cover, so I think that makes it a real beach read. I took this book yesterday with me to the beach but I did not read it because I was too busy looking after my daughter and when someone else was watching her, I went for a swim.
