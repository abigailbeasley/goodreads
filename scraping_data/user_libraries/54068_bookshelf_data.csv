He churned out multiple series under different pen names in a variety of genres, including Gothic romances with titles like ""Haunting of Fog Island,"" ""Beware My Love!,"" and ""Secret of the Pale Lover,"" so he was a natural to write a series of tie-ins with ABC's Gothic daytime soap opera, Dark Shadows.This novel follows the framework established by the first six months or so of Dark Shadows, in which Victoria Winters leaves the foundling home in New York where she grew up to work as a governess in the remote mansion Collinwood (called ""Collins House"" in the novel). The members of the Collins clan are the same in the novel as the TV series, except for one major addition -- a violinist cousin named Ernest. (Remember, this was before the most famous Collins became a part of the series, the vampire Barnabas Collins.)Unless you love cheapjack Gothic romances, there's probably no reason to read this novel unless you're a Dark Shadows fan. If you are a Dark Shadows fan, it's a quick, entertaining read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2016","Dec 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18593202-dark-shadows

There were good issues and bad issues before Miller got involved, but the formula was getting stale. Basically, there would always be a soap-opera subplot going on with blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Daredevil's alter ego), or with one of his romantic partners, or with his best friend and law partner Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson. This subplot would string along for several issues, but each individual issue would be dominated by a colorful super-villain. Daredevil would do battle with this villain and crack wise like Spider-Man. That was about it.The first half of this volume only showcases Miller's work as an artist. Roger McKenzie was still writing the series. Miller's first issue as both artist and writer is #168, and with that issue he ret-conned Elektra (the deadly Greek female assassin who is out to avenge her father's death) into Matt Murdock's life. Over the course of the next several issues, Miller created a dense criminal underworld with the Kingpin at its head and the vicious, psychopathic Bullseye as his most dangerous lieutenant. These issues are a joy to read. Plots and subplots are woven together seamlessly, and they have a great sense of griminess and nastiness, which suits the early 1980s NYC setting perfectly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 27, 2014","Apr 28, 2014","Mar 27, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4283754-daredevil-by-frank-miller-klaus-janson-vol-1

It was written by JA good biography makes you feel as if you personally know its subject when you're finished, and that's exactly what this book did. It was written by Jim Bishop, who was Mark Hellinger's copy boy and later his secretary.Hellinger was born in New York in 1903. Much to his father's dismay, who wanted him to follow in his footsteps by practicing law and marrying a nice Jewish girl, Mark's sole ambition in life was to become a writer. He eventually became one of the most widely read newspaper columnists in America, along with his close friend Walter Winchell. Prohibition was Hellinger's time and Broadway was his milieu. He knew everybody, and loved everybody. He wanted everybody to love him, too, but hid it under layers of gruffness and humor. He spent money as fast as he earned it. He was a drinker and a gambler who counted many gangsters among his friends. He dressed like an underworld character and married Gladys Glad, a Ziegfeld Girl and one of the most beautiful blondes in a country full of beautiful blondes.After Prohibition, Hellinger slowly gravitated to Hollywood. When he moved to Los Angeles permanently, he dropped his daily column but kept his full-page Sunday column, and enjoyed a wide readership until his death of coronary thrombosis in 1947 at the age of 44.His work in Hollywood is what he's best remembered for today. At Warner Bros. he worked frequently with director Raoul Walsh, on pictures like The Roaring Twenties (1939), They Drive by Night (1940), and High Sierra (1941). Hellinger really made his mark when he was sole producer. He bought the rights to Ernest Hemingway's short story ""The Killers,"" and turned it into a film. The Killers (1946) was Burt Lancaster's first film. Hellinger ""discovered"" Lancaster, and made another film with him, the prison drama Brute Force (1947), before producing one of the first and most important police procedural films, The Naked City, which was released in 1948. He consider The Naked City his best film, and it's certainly his most personal. In addition to being a mystery, it's a love letter to New York that Hellinger narrated himself. It was the first film to be shot entirely on location (with hidden cameras for the street scenes).This book is mostly episodic anecdotes, and it's a great read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 08, 2013","Dec 15, 2013","Dec 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19296281-the-mark-hellinger-story

While I have some reservations about it, the good stuff overwhelmingly outweighs the bad stuff.By the standards of hard sci-fi, this is an astoundingly well-written novel. Too many sci-fi writers use their characters as a series of mouthpieces to move along the plot and explain the big ideas, but most of the characters in Pushing Ice felt like real people. Reynolds has a keen understanding of individual and group psychology, and most of the conflict in the novel is driven by personality clashes that feel tragically real. However, some of this falls apart toward the end of the novel. For about the first 75% of Pushing Ice I was totally and completely enthralled, and was all set to give the book five stars. However, the final quarter is driven by actions by one character that feel really unbelievable given the situation, and that was when I felt as if Reynolds was moving his characters around like chess pieces. The conclusion feels rushed, too.But overall this was one of the best sci-fi novels I've read recently.

It originally appeared in three parts in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction, in the July, August, and September issues of 1941.In 1958 it was published as a full-length novel, expanded somewhat by Heinlein. I don't know what was added or changed, but it can't have been that much, because it's still a very short novel, despite there being enough plot to fill a 1,000-page epic.The story involves a group of ""families"" who enjoy incredibly long life thanks to selective breeding. When news of their longevity is revealed, the rest of the world goes mad wanting to know their ""secret formula,"" which doesn't exist. So they hijack an interstellar cruiser called New Frontiers and go in search of more hospitable planets. The fact that they find more than one habitable planet and make contact with more than one alien race is why I said there's enough plot to fill a book much, much longer than this one.As it is, it's an enjoyable read, but the descriptions feel sketchy at times, and Heinlein employs more than one deus ex machina to move his characters around.Your enjoyment of this book will probably depend on your enjoyment of Heinlein's wacky ideas.

They started in the early '70s and are still at it.When I was a kid, I listened to my local NPR affiliate and heard parts of the first few ZBS adventure shows about the character Jack Flanders.Moon Over Morocco is the second Jack Flanders adventure. It's similar in some ways to the first, The Fourth Tower of Inverness, but Moon Over Morocco is a more ""grown-up"" adventure. It features transcendent, powerful background sounds that were actually recorded in Morocco by author Paul Bowles. There are heavy references to the movie Casablanca -- the character Kasbah Kelly is a lot like Rick, and Mojo is a lot like Sam. But like every other Jack Flanders adventure I've heard, journeys to other dimensions are a must, and the doppelgangers and head trips come right and left.I listened to the 50 episodes that make up Moon Over Morocco over the course of 10 weeks, one episode per weekday. In total, it's almost 12 hours, but taken in such small doses, it was a mind-altering little part of my day that I really looked forward to.Oh, and it contains plenty of Arabic platitudes like ""The dogs may bark, but the caravan passes on.""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 16, 2012","Nov 23, 2012","Oct 16, 2012",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/1643932.Moon_Over_Morocco

Too many comic book writers seem to assume that people spend as much time on the visuals as they do the dialogue, which leads to some choppy pacing.

(You can check out the shop's website at www.colophonbooks.us) Gridlinked starts out with a bang and I really enjoyed it from the outset. However, I got really bogged down in the middle section of the book and it took me forever to finish. I finally finished it while traveling over the course of the last couple of weeks and remembered what I liked about it in the first place. What I liked about it in the first place was its combination of intensive hard-sci-fi world-building with lots of fast-paced action.What I didn't like so much was the awkward, sometimes impenetrable prose. Here's a typically tortured construction:""That the station was a centrifugal ring station showed that it was old.""Asher also has a way of introducing jargon and made-up technical terms without explaining them first or even making them particularly easy to understand in context. So part of getting bogged down was my own fault. This was not a good book for me to read a couple of pages at a time before going to bed at night. But when I got back into it during vacation I tore through the last third pretty quickly and am looking forward to reading more of Asher's stuff. Gridlinked takes place in a universe dominated by a galactic empire called The Polity, which is guided not by human politicians but by super-advanced AI.Ian Cormac, an agent of The Polity, has been mentally connected to a massive computer network--""gridlinked""--for several years longer than recommended due to his value as an agent. Soon after the novel begins his connection has to be severed because he's becoming indistinguishable from an android.His main human antagonist is a separatist leader named Arian Pelter who wants Cormac dead for personal reasons. Over the course of the novel Pelter is constantly adding ""augs"" to himself, and his physical appearance becomes more inhuman and technologically grotesque as Cormac is learning to be human again. This dichotomy is potentially interesting, but Asher is more interested in world-building and violent action than in philosophizing or going too deeply into the psychology of his characters. For instance, since The Polity is presented as infinitely wise, the separatists are presented as being interested only in chaos for chaos's sake. There are enough separatists that they even have a home world called Cheyne III, but I never had much sense of why they were fighting in the first place. The other big story going on in Gridlinked is about an enormous alien intelligence called ""Dragon"" that is composed of four enormous floating spheres. Dragon is a type of Sphinx, bedeviling Cormac with riddles and half-truths.As I said earlier, Asher's writing is sometimes clunky. He has huge ideas and cool concepts, but occasionally it feels like a Ferrari powered by a two-stroke lawn mower engine.Still, I don't read hard sci-fi for the lyrical prose....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 20, 2012","Dec 20, 2012","Jul 21, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/98046.Gridlinked

I started reading the comics at some point in the '80s, but the issues from the late '70s are probably the first Batman comics I ever saw when I was a pre-literate little kid in the supermarket who was fascinated by the covers.Unlike what a lot of people think, Batman was not the sunny, goofy do-gooder of the '60s TV show until Frank Miller came along and shook things up with The Dark Knight Returns in 1986. I've read random Batman stories from every decade, and while the issues from the '50s and '60s tend to be pretty silly, after Denny O'Neil took over writing the series in the '70s he returned the Dark Knight Detective to his sinister, pulpy roots. This was an era of beautiful Batman art and decent storytelling, and it saw the introduction of a number of memorable adversaries like Man-Bat.Probably the most memorable of all was Ra's al Ghul (and his daughter Talia). This volume collects a bunch of Ra's al Ghul stories. A variety of artists penciled and inked these stories, but Denny O'Neil wrote all of them, so this collection is fairly consistent. Ra's al Ghul is cut from the same cloth as Fu Manchu (who also has a dangerously alluring daughter), but he's less racially specific. His name comes from Arabic, and Ra's does spend a fair amount of time in the desert, but he also seems equally comfortable in the snowy wastelands of the Himalayas.If you're the kind of Batman fan who thinks a story isn't ""dark"" enough unless there's a child prostitution ring or a villain who wears other people's faces, then you might find this volume laughable, but I think it strikes a nice balance between sinister goings-on and a pulpy sense of fun.I'd give this maybe three stars as an ""objective"" judgment, but I tacked on another star for myself, since I love the art, storytelling, and general mood of '70s Batman stories....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,May 2012,"May 31, 2012","May 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/107082.Batman

In brief, a man named George Stroud, who works for an enormous publishing syndicate, cheats on his wife for the umpteenth time ... but this time it's with his boss's girlfriend. The boss, Earl Janoth, murders his mistress for unrelated reasons, and the only witness is George Stroud. Janoth's co-publisher and ""fixer,"" Steve Hagen, convinces Janoth that they need to locate the mysterious witness and get rid of him.The twist is that they put George Stroud in charge of the investigation, so he assembles a team of researchers and sets them to work locating ... him. Stroud doesn't want to come forward as a witness because it will destroy his marriage, but he also doesn't want to succeed in his investigation, for obvious reasons. On the other hand, he can't stall the investigation or screw it up without raising a red flag.The excellent (and excellently handled) concept that drives the novel really hooked me, but I also didn't mind so much the writing style after I realized that it was Fearing's attempt to get us inside the head of George Stroud (several sections of the novel are written from other characters' first-person views, and they tend to be more utilitarian). And even though Stroud is a bit of a pretentious blowhard, some of his observations about the enormous publishing empire for which he works are pretty brilliant:""What we decided in this room, more than a million of our fellow-citizens would read three months from now, and what they read they would accept as final. They might not know they were doing so, they might even briefly dispute our decisions, but still they would follow the reasoning we presented, remember the phrases, the tone of authority, and in the end their crystallized judgments would be ours.""The Big Clock was published in 1946 and made into a movie two years later starring Ray Milland.

(Daredevil's days in San Francisco were mostly slack, and involved ""hippie"" villains like Angar the Screamer, and those stories haven't aged well.) But at least Brown and Isabella moved the action back to New York, and their multi-issue story arc about the Black Widow and Daredevil helping S.H.I.E.L.D. tackle Hydra was fun and exciting, if not particularly brilliant.On the plus side, Gene Colan shows up from time to time, and he's my favorite comic-book artist of all time.

WYou know that game you can play where ""The Karate Kid"" becomes a lot funnier if you just imagine that Mr. Miyagi is stoned the whole time?You don't? Well, now you do.Anyway, I've devised my own little game, and I play it every time I read a Lee Child thriller. I imagine that his hero, Jack Reacher, has Asperger's Syndrome.Before any of you ""psychologists"" out there jump all over me -- no, all the pieces don't fit -- but his obsessive tendencies, his refusal to own any possessions, his rootlessness, and the amount of time he lavishes on noticing small, precise, exact details add up to someone who is very, very different from most everyone else on planet earth.I'm actually not a big fan of DSM classifications, so maybe diagnosing Jack Reacher on the autism scale is a waste of time. Still, his brain does work in a strange and particular way. When someone pulls a gun on him, the reader is not only going to find out that it's a Ruger Speed-Six .357 Magnum, but also that the .357 Magnum was invented in 1935, and that ""magnum"" is Latin for ""big."" When Jack Reacher is riding a subway car, he's not only going to describe the size of the car, the other passengers, and the sounds of the train going through the tunnels and the brakes screeching, he's also going to let the reader know that he's on car number 7622, which is an R142A model, which is the newest on the MTA transit system, and that it was built in Kobe, Japan, by Kawasaki. He's also going to assign his fellow passengers numbers and spend an inordinate amount of time describing to the reader exactly where they are sitting in relation to him.In fact, Reacher spends so much time over the course of the first several chapters describing his exact surroundings on the subway (where he thinks he's spotted a female suicide bomber) that I was surprised when things came to a hasty conclusion and he was off on adventures through New York City and down the eastern seaboard to Washington, D.C.I actually think Lee Child's thrillers work best when he embraces the fact that his protagonist is somewhat odd (although I'm not sure he realizes just how odd he is). They don't work so well when he spends time trying to build romantic relationships for Reacher (as in Tripwire) because they're never believable. At least in Gone Tomorrow, the only sex scene is mercifully brief and in keeping with his character. (""It was all good. Then we passed some kind of a threshold and got into it harder. A short minute later we were completely out of control."" Done.)Of all the Jack Reacher thrillers I've read so far, I'd classify them as either ""not so good"" or ""pretty good,"" and this one falls firmly in the region of ""pretty good."" It frequently approaches ""damned good,"" but not quite often enough for me to bump my rating up from three stars to four stars.Oh, and in my last  of a Reacher thriller -- 61 Hours, the book published right after this one -- I was left with a single burning question. Does the homeless Jack Reacher ever brush his teeth? Well, Gone Tomorrow finally answered my question. Several times in the book he mentions the folding toothbrush he carries with him everywhere. So I can cross that off my list of burning questions....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Dec 20, 2011","Dec 29, 2011","Dec 20, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6601265-gone-tomorrow

The Texas Mounted Rifles, which are a precursor to the Texas Rangers, are making the frontier safe for settlers by warring against the Comanche. Or at least they're trying. They're a small outfit, led by a hard, unbending captain named Barcroft. They're also an uneasy mix of Unionists, Confederate loyalists, and Texans with no interest in fighting in the War Between the States.Cloud is a member of this last group. He dislikes Barcroft, but knows he doesn't have another choice, and figures serving with the Rifles and fighting the Comanches is better than serving in the Confederacy and fighting the Yankees.However, when the Rifles discover a white woman named Easter who was kidnapped by the Comanches as a young girl and forced to take a husband, Barcroft takes her back with them, but forces her to leave her half-Comanche baby behind.This inhuman action sickens Cloud, but there's little he can do.Like all good storytellers, though, Kelton adds layers to Barcroft's character as the novel goes on, and while he never becomes fully likable, he does grow to be sympathetic.Texas Rifles is a bloody novel, but never gratuitous. Kelton writes good dialogue, well-crafted prose, and is able to describe the west lovingly without ever lapsing into Zane Grey-style hysterics.Texas Rifles isn't a great novel, but it's a good one, and the next time I feel like reading a western I'll probably pick up one by Kelton....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 18, 2011","Nov 05, 2011","Sep 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1927570.Texas_Rifles

Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series was the first thing Awhile ago my friend asked me to recommend some good mystery series that take place in New York. Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series was the first thing that popped into my mind. While the series takes place in a fictional city called ""Isola,"" it's New York City through and through. McBain essentially rotated a map of Manhattan, the outer boroughs, Long Island, and New Jersey 90 degrees and renamed everything. If you're familiar with New York, you'll immediately be able to identify each place he's writing about. If you're not, it's not a problem. You'll still enjoy this series if you like mysteries and police procedurals.This is the second book in the series to feature detective Cotton Hawes, and like the last one, there are too many scenes in which he operates on his own, beds many lovely ladies, and gets out of a jam on his own. With the focus on Hawes, it's too much like a James Bond novel or a hard-boiled P.I. story. I like it better when the detectives of the 87th Precinct go through their thankless tasks in pairs or as a group.But that's a minor complaint. Killer's Payoff, which is about a murdered blackmailer, is another solid, fun-to-read entry in the series. The mystery here is a little better than in some of the previous entries, and the police work is still depicted well. One of my favorite things about McBain is his ability to write lines and lines of unattributed dialogue in which there's never any confusion about who's speaking. Picture one of those scenes from a black & white movie in which a couple of tough cops grill a suspect sweating in a cramped interrogation room and you'll get the idea. Here's an example:""I didn't follow nobody any night.""""You followed me and hit me. Why?""""I hit you?

After his book was canceled, he self-published his material. Eventually, Dark Horse comics picked up the series, and The Goon is still going strong.I'd never heard of The Goon until I read a feature in Rue Morgue magazine about the best horror comics.

In the Goon's world, gangsters regularly employ zombies and other creepy-crawlies, which is mostly an excuse for The Goon and his sidekick, Frankie, to run roughshod over all manner of monsters and crack wise while doing it.The Goon is just grotesque fun.

Why? Because I'm a connoisseur of Dick Tracy. Reading them all in a jumble makes them seem too much like a haphazardly plotted comic book, which isn't fair, since Chester Gould designed them to be read in a daily newspaper. Gould was a master of storytelling in this format. He drives the plot forward each day in a fun or shocking manner. The reader never loses sight of the overall story arc, but also never gets bored with constant exposition to explain what's happened already.This collection features one of Dick Tracy's most memorable nemeses, the low-talking, jazz-music-playing, expensive-clothes-wearing hood called ""Mumbles."" Mumbles does not look unlike Robert Mitchum, and has conversations with his henchmen that go like this:""Star tover.""""What did he say?""""Quits aying whadee zay.""""What did he say?""""He said for you to quit saying, 'what did he say?'.""Mumbles is more than just a menacing hood who talks out of the corner of his mouth, he's a sadistic killer unafraid to murder police officers, punch his girlfriend Kiss Andtel in the face, or leave all his men behind to die.Gould brought his right-wing social philosophy to the pages of the funny papers day after day, but he created such a brilliant phantasmagoria that readers of any political stripe could enjoy his violent fantasies, provided they could deal with his cheerful sadism.Of course, there are some weeks in the Dick Tracy strip that are less exciting than others. For every brilliant creation like Mumbles, there's a less-than-brilliant creation like Coffyhead, who drinks a lot of coffee and whose head is shaped like a coffee pot.With the exception of Coffyhead, Dick Tracy's rogues' gallery is pretty great in this volume: Acres O'Riley, who's an essentially good-hearted taxi driver, but whose enormous stature makes her a danger when she's enraged; her boyfriend, the tiny midget forger and hustler named Heels Beals (he wears lift heels in his shoes); Mrs. Volts, the gangster leader of an energy concern; Hypo, a twitchy drug addict, and Shoulders, a smooth-talking man with enormous shoulder pads for smuggling jewels. While Shoulders as a concept sounds kind of silly, his storyline here is really well-done. He's on the lam, hiding out as the husband of a woman who has a young daughter from a previous marriage. There's a sense of menace and unease in the scenes of Shoulders at home, and the story plays out in a suspenseful fashion.Gould also presages the widespread use of security cameras. At the end of this volume, a new storyline is beginning in which the millionaire entrepreneur Diet Smith perfects a ""television burglar alarm"" which is officially known as the Dick Tracy Teleguard, allowing banks, homes, and government buildings to be watched at all times. There's even an option for motion-activation.This is great stuff.

After Parker and his hastily assembled crew of cons break out of jail, they're immediately embroiled in a caper, and the way in to the former armory/current jewel warehouse seemed overly simple. One of the things I love about this series is the way Westlake sets up a seemingly impossible problem for Parker to solve, and then shows how Parker gets into places by breaking down the weak points one at a time.But about halfway through, I realized that this book isn't about clever ways in, it's about clever ways out. It's an escape heist in three parts: first out of prison, then out of a job they're trapped in, then out of a small town.The thing I love best about the Parker books is their attitude. Parker's toughness doesn't come from what he says (although he's always a man of few words), it comes from what he does. There were a bunch of places in the novel where I expected Parker to commit murder to get out of a situation, but instead he got out just using his wits.

Conway and Gerber both come off as frustrated novelists, penning the worst kind of sophomoric drivel.Gene Colan is one of my favorite comics artists, and these issues of Daredevil all look good, but the stories and characterizations are the pits.

The problem with this book is that most of the ""evidence"" Hodel presents isn't circumstantial. It's supposition and conjecture.Circumstantial evidence is when an item belonging to a suspect is found at a crime scene, or an eyewitness can place a suspect in the vicinity of a crime scene around the time the crime took place.In ""Black Dahlia Avenger,"" Hodel presents such ""evidence"" as the fact that a black military-style watch was found at the crime scene (during a second canvassing of the site, much later than the body was first discovered). There's a picture of his father from before the murder wearing a black military-style watch, and then a picture from a few years after the murder where he's wearing a different watch.He also isn't even able to really place his father in L.A. at the time of the murder, but uses ""evidence"" like the fact that his father had art objects shipped to L.A. from China, where he was living in late 1946, as evidence that his father's return to L.A. was imminent. But it's equally possible that he had things shipped to his home in L.A. and DIDN'T return home until many months later.Hodel uses a lot of phrases like ""I strongly believe,"" which might convince people who are unable to think critically, but it doesn't change the fact that they're merely his opinions.Hodel writes extremely well, and the parts of this book that aren't about his theories are actually fascinating. I knew almost nothing about the Black Dahlia murder before this book, and learned a lot about the facts surrounding the case.But when he gets into presenting his case, it's a difficult book to get through, mostly because his reasoning is so faulty and preposterous.He first got an inkling that his father might have killed Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) after finding pictures of Short in his father's personal photo album after his father's death. The problem with these pictures (which are reproduced several times in this book) is that they look absolutely nothing like Elizabeth Short. He claims that he doesn't want to get into a ""pissing contest"" with people who doubt that they're really pictures of her, and that he has ""no doubt"" that it is she. He also claims that people who don't think it's she are Dahlia theorists with their own theory to peddle.I'm not one of those people, and the woman in the photographs looks nothing like Elizabeth Short. They both are young white women with black hair, but that's it.He also links his father to a number of murders of other women in L.A. in the '40s (as well as a presumed accomplice, Fred Sexton), even though the M.O. in those cases doesn't seem to match the Black Dahlia in any way. There was a handsome, well-dressed, dark-haired man about 5'11"" who was linked to these women, which matches his father's description, but it's not exactly a strange or unique description, is it?Of course, none of this means that Dr. George Hodel didn't kill the Black Dahlia, but the same could be said of many people. In fairness, the picture Steve Hodel paints of his father is a grim one. He doesn't sound like a very good or decent person, but after reading this book, I wasn't convinced by any of Hodel's suppositions or theories about his father's secret career as a murderer.Also, Hodel continually falls back on the last resort of all conspiracy theorists. Namely, that he's not able to produce definitive evidence because it's being hidden from him. He accuses the LAPD of a massive cover-up, and of protecting Dr. George Hodel and either hiding or having destroyed critical evidence.He also wrote a follow-up book to this one in which he accuses his father of being the Zodiac killer.Whatever....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Mar 19, 2011","Apr 14, 2011","Mar 21, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/918499.Black_Dahlia_Avenger

Does Jack Reacher ever brush his teeth?Lee Child goes into a lot of detail about how his hulking protagonist drifts around the United States with literally no possessions -- not even a backpack -- and how he buys a new set of clothes every week and throws away the old set. But does he ever brush his teeth? Does he bathe? Does he shave? If he doesn't shave, does he have a beard? He's not described with one.If Child were more vague about Reacher's life on the road, I'd never even consider these things, but he goes into such detail about Reacher's clothing-buying habits that he creates a whole new set of questions.He goes into detail about a lot of things. Sometimes he's almost like someone with Asperger's Syndrome. He describes tire ruts in snowy, icy roads so often in this novel that it's nearly fetishistic.61 Hours has a built-in stopwatch. As Jack Reacher attempts to protect the life of an elderly woman who is to testify against a drug gang, everything leads toward some nebulous event that is going to occur 61 hours after a bus crash lands him in the small town of Bolton, South Dakota, in the middle of subzero weather and a snowstorm. Many chapters end with the line, ""Five minutes to xx in the morning.

Reading this wasn't quite as revelatory as reading Volume 1, but it was still fun to see how little Batman has changed over the years. There are so many fans of the character that everyone has their own opinion about what makes him tick, and which parts of his mythos and back story are essential and which parts should be jettisoned, but like it or not, pretty much everything's here ... Bruce Wayne's life as a playboy, his young ward Dick Grayson (a.k.a. Robin), his friendship with Commissioner Gordon, his relationship with Catwoman, and his archnemesis the Joker.Catwoman also makes her second appearance in this volume (she first appeared in Batman #1, reprinted in the first volume, but she was just known as ""The Cat,"" and wore no special disguise). This volume features a reprint of Batman #3, which contains a story called ""The Batman vs. the Cat-Woman,"" in which she sports a full-face cat mask and wears a dress and high heels. There are also more romantic stirrings, as she kisses Batman to make her escape and later dreams of what it might be like to go on moonlight drive with him. Meanwhile, Batman says ""What a night! A night for romance, eh Robin?"" To which Robin responds, ""Romance? Bah...""This volume also features the first appearance of the original Clayface and more appearances by the Joker.

It's terse, emotionally powerful, and doesn't spend hundreds of pages with tedious ""world building."" You're dropped into the action, much like the protagonist, and all the horror and emotional devastation of war is thrown at you.It's tough to write a book about warfare on alien worlds against bizarre extraterrestrial species and not come off sounding a little silly. The fact that Joe Haldeman makes this book every bit as gripping as a ""real"" war memoir is commendable.In case you haven't read it, it's about the earth going to war with an alien race light years away. Since this involves faster-than-light travel through collapsars, there is a time dilation effect. Every time the book's protagonist, William Mandella, returns to earth, he's only a few years older, but decades and even centuries have passed. This is an obvious metaphor for the dislocation and alienation returning combat veterans often feel when they return to ""familiar"" surroundings, but it's a powerful one.My only complaints about the book are that Mandella's first return to earth involves changes that seem mired in the concerns of the '70s. These sections seem a little dated. Also, the conclusion of the book involves a ridiculous deus ex machina that undercuts much of the power of the narrative.But those are fairly minor complaints in the end. This is not only a powerful story, it's incredibly influential in the world of military sci-fi.

It's one of his ""juveniles,"" which is another way of saying it's rollicking ""golly gee whiz""-style adventure that could have just as well been published in Boy's Life magazine as in hardcover by Scribner's.Three high school seniors on the cusp of graduation get the opportunity of a lifetime when one of their uncles, Dr. Cargraves, a nuclear physicist, is so impressed with their scientifically minded tinkering that he offers to take them with him to the moon for a little expedition.The premise may seem silly, but Heinlein does a good job of making the characters seem serious, and he sticks to accepted science of the mid-'40s when described space flight and rocketry.The trio of 18 year-old boys and Dr. Cargraves establish a base on the moon (an airtight Quonset hut), and claim it for the United Nations. They'll soon discover, however, that a bunch of dirty Nazis -- in hiding since the end of World War II -- have already established a base on the moon, from which they plan to mount atomic attacks against the earth.The climactic action (and the revelation about prehistoric inhabitants of the moon) is probably the silliest section of the book, but overall I really enjoyed Rocket Ship Galileo.

His figure work is brilliant, and Daredevil's body has a great sense of long, lean movement in the action scenes. Colan also did a lot of constructions and layouts that were way ahead of their time. This volume is worth reading for the art alone....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 09, 2010","Jan 27, 2011","Dec 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/596001.Essential_Daredevil_Vol_2

In his introduction to the copy of Foundation that I just read, Isaac Asimov said he was surprised when his series won the Hugo Award for best series of all time in 1966, because he was sure J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings would win. (This didn't make sense to me, since Tolkien's work isn't sci-fi, it's fantasy, but whatever.) The other series that were up for consideration were Robert A. Heinlein's ""future history"" series, Edgar Rice Burroughs's ""Barsoom"" series, and E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's ""Lensman"" series.So when I found a pile of the Lensman books sitting on top of someone's trash while I was out walking the dog, it made sense to grab them.I felt adrift in this narrative for the first 90 pages. I'm not sure how this novel was constructed, but it feels piecemeal. Triplanetary was published in 1948, with revisions by Smith to make it a prequel to the Lensman series, but was originally serialized in Amazing Stories magazine in 1934.The first section of the book gives an overview of the Arisians and Eddorians, two alien super races who are good and evil, respectively. The Wikipedia entry for this book currently says that the Arisians resemble giant human brains, but Smith clearly writes that they are ""distinctly humanoid,"" so maybe that changed over time. The Eddorians are nebulous, shifting creatures, and can assume a variety of human forms.Gharlane of Eddore occupies several nasty humans, including Nero (Wikipedia claims he is Hitler during the section of the narrative that takes place during World War II, but Hitler is never mentioned in Triplanetary).The reason I felt adrift is because the short sections that take place during the fall of Atlantis, the fall of Rome, the Great War, the Second World War, and World War III aren't really connected in any way. Most confusingly, the Atlanteans possess futuristic technology, such as planes and jeeps. The next bit, in Rome, however, is a straightforward story of gladiatorial combat and a slave revolt.It wasn't until the meat of the narrative -- the long story called ""Triplanetary"" -- that I settled in and enjoyed this book in any way.Smith's prose is clunky, but it's vigorous and exciting enough once the reader finds its rhythm. It's also fun to read such an old science fiction book that contains so many elements that would become standard in space opera; tractor beams, view screens (here called ""plates""), force fields (here called ""screens""), faster-than-light space travel (here called ""inertialess flight""), beam weapons (here called ""projectors""), and even a metal planetoid filled with automatons led by a single evil figure (sound familiar, Star Wars fans?).The science and technology are pretty interesting, too, since they're products of their time. For instance, spaceships in Doc Smith's world run on allotropic iron.All the elements of Triplanetary that related to the larger series, such as Arisia and Eddore, felt tacked-on, and left me confused. After finishing this book, I still don't know what a ""lens"" is in Doc Smith's world, or how one might wield it.I plan to read more of the series, not least because I have the whole stack sitting on my shelf at home, but I didn't feel as if this was a great introduction. Many ""prequels"" aren't. But if the next couple of books in the series are this slapdash and vague about the big picture, I can't see making it through the entire thing....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 22, 2010","Feb 07, 2011","Dec 22, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6596033-triplanetary

Sometimes dozens of pages go by without a single descriptive passage. The characters are two-dimensional. Much of the dialogue is expository. The plot is paramount, and the characters and situations merely servants to it.The reason I liked ""Foundation"" more than most dry sci-fi I've read is that it's really well thought-out, and is pretty upfront about its clockwork plotting. In fact, it's the driving force of the narrative. Long ago a genius named Hari Seldon created a system called ""psychohistory,"" which allowed him to chart the basic movements of social, political, religious, and mercantile history to come. Each story in this collection is primarily concerned with gamesmanship, and whether or not the ""proper"" outcome will be effected.Asimov was a really smart, interesting guy, and ""Foundation"" is a great read, even though it doesn't really have any interesting individual characters, and I can barely keep the details of one story straight from another just hours after having finished reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 18, 2010","Dec 22, 2010","Dec 18, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/414853.Foundation

During the course of his mission he discovers three things in Costa Verde that will propel the rest of the narrative; a scar-faced Nazi war criminal named Heinrich von Sachs, an American agent named Sheila who was sent on the same assassination mission as Helm but who was captured, starved, and tortured (rape is implied but never directly stated), and a Soviet-made ICBM that went missing after the Cuban Missile Crisis.The Matt Helm series seems like a direct response to Ian Fleming's James Bond series. Like Bond, Helm is tough, cold, irresistible to women, and has a sentimental streak that he rarely allows to interfere with the completion of his objectives.This novel and several others in the series were made into films in the '60s starring Dean Martin as Helm. I haven't seen any of them, but I get the feeling they were lighthearted spy-movie spoofs along the lines of ""Our Man Flint."" (For instance, in the film version of this novel, the ICBM is changed to a flying saucer.) While Helm's first-person narration is frequently wry and ironic, it's never satirical.

The Biari family, who have been charged with protecting him, attempt to set him up as the patsy for a murder they've committed. And Brian O'Shea, the owner of a casino called ""The Shamrock,"" is running a promotion that could win Lano one million dollars cash.Izzi throws a lot of balls in the air in the first 50 pages, and he does a good job of catching them all by the end.

In the post-war years, For perhaps obvious reasons, Captain America was one of the most popular superheroes who took on the Axis during World War II. In the post-war years, however, his popularity waned. He was brought back for a brief time in the '50s as a HUAC-approved ""Commie smasher,"" but this iteration of the character proved short-lived, and he disappeared again for awhile.When Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and the Wasp found Cap buried in a block of ice in 1964 in ""The Avengers"" #4, it was explained that he had fallen from an experimental drone plane toward the end of WWII and been kept in suspended animation in the North Atlantic, while his young sidekick Bucky had crashed and died. Later, to explain the actions of the '50s Cap, a little creative retroactive continuity was used. While '40s Cap was frozen, a man made insane by the Super Soldier serum took on the mantle, and it was really him smashing all of those Commies.Ed Brubaker has had a lot of fun with Captain America's history during his long and excellent run writing the series. He understands that from the '60s until today, the character of Captain America has mirrored America's own search for its national identity. First and foremost, Captain America is a symbol, and symbols can be appropriated by anyone with an agenda.In the ""Two Americas"" storyline, Bad Cap is back, and a militia group of ""real Americans"" called The Watchdogs have rallied around him. Bucky, who took over the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers was assassinated (Rogers is back, but off doing his own thing now), infiltrates the group, along with Cap's old partner, The Falcon (one of the first mainstream black superheroes of the '70s).The connections with the Tea Party movement are pretty obvious. There's an excellent part of the story in which Bucky poses as a regular guy trucker just in town and Sam (The Falcon) poses as a federal tax collector coming into the bar to squeeze the small business owner for more taxes. Bucky beats Sam up, throws him out, and endears himself to the locals. ""Don't forget your briefcase, Obama!"" one of the locals yells after Bucky throws Sam into the parking lot. Later, when the Watchdogs show up at Sam's hotel room to kidnap him, one of them uses a term for him that's represented--as all comic book curses are--with a bunch of symbols. However, unlike most comic-book curse words, there are six symbols, not four.The first half of the story is stronger than the second, and not just because the second half devolves into a predictable showdown. All the racial specificity that identified the Watchdogs as a particular kind of homegrown terrorist is jettisoned, and there's even a black member of the Watchdogs who guards Sam after he's captured. (It's almost as if Brubaker received an edict from his editor.)Still, Brubaker is a fantastic comic-book storyteller, and his run on Captain America has been one of the best mainstream comic books of the past 10 years. Many ers seem to think his work on the title is slipping, but I think he's still doing a fantastic job. Captain America is a title I look forward to reading every month....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 15, 2010","Sep 25, 2010","Sep 15, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8612832-captain-america

I think he's brimming over with ideas and I like how committed he is to exploring them. I plan to read more of his novels than the three I currently have under my belt, and I look forward to doing so.However, ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" failed to engage me on a basic level. It's not so much a novel as it is a collection of philosophical dialogues. These dialogues usually take the form of Heinlein's idealism and utopian thinking vs. Heinlein's skepticism and questioning of his own utopianism. While this is occasionally interesting, most of the time it's turgid.I can see why this novel had such a huge impact in the '60s. Its protagonist is a human who was raised on Mars, and has all the powers of Martians, such as telekinesis and astral projection. To buy this, you have to believe completely in nurture (as opposed to nature) and believe that the human mind is a powerhouse without limits, and the only reason you can't levitate is because you were conditioned by society to believe that you can't. This concept is extrapolated throughout the novel, breaking down religion, politics, etc.Sexuality is a major theme, too, as Valentine Michael Smith, the ""Man From Mars,"" establishes a ""nest"" (or cult, if you prefer) in which nudism and free love are the most natural ways of expressing personal divinity.My problem with this book is that I didn't buy most of it. Heinlein's vision of the future is hopelessly dated, and his vision of a higher consciousness seems mired in pedestrian contrarianism, wish fulfillment, and simplistic iconoclasm.I didn't hate it, I just wasn't moved by it....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 30, 2010","Dec 18, 2010","Aug 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/350.Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land

His science fiction novel The Hollow Man -- a tragic and moving story about a man who can read minds -- is excellent, too. I read both of them more than 10 years ago, but Simmons has always been on my radar as an author I'd like to read more of.I didn't like Hyperion as much as either Song of Kali or The Hollow Man, but I think a lot of that is because it ends with so many plot threads unresolved. Simmons published a sequel, The Fall of Hyperion, shortly after this one, and I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote the entire thing as one novel, or at least planned a sequel as soon as he finished writing this one.Taken on its own, Hyperion is an involving science fiction novel full of riotous color and wild goings-on. It wears its literary influences on its sleeve. If you didn't know that the title of the novel comes from an epic poem by John Keats about a mythological war between Titans, you will by the end of the novel. Heck, there's even an articifial person (a ""cybrid"") in it named Johnny Keats, who is programmed with AI designed to replicate the mind and experiences of the poet.This was Simmons's first science fiction novel after writing two horror novels, and at times it seems as if he threw about a dozen different ideas into the story because he couldn't wait to use all of them. The structure of the book owes a debt to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Boccaccio's Decameron. Seven people -- a priest, a soldier, a poet, a pilot, a scholar, a detective, and a politician -- go on a pilgrimage to see a terrifying monster called The Shrike. On the way, they share their stories. This book has many layers ... perhaps more than it needs. Many of the pilgrims' stories are actually someone else's story, and the role of the person telling the tale is revealed only towards the end. In other cases, they are present throughout, but their role is tangential. Simmons deals with interstellar war, time travel, religion, colonialism, environmentalism, cyberspace, poetry, architecture, and more themes that I can't immediately recall. This everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach means that the novel is rarely boring, but I often missed having a stronger focal point....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 31, 2010","Aug 28, 2010","Jul 31, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77566.Hyperion

I enjoyed it, but there are many ways in which it hasn't aAlfred Bester's The Demolished Man was the first book to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel. I enjoyed it, but there are many ways in which it hasn't aged well. Bester's vision of a 24th-century earth in which a significant portion of the population can read minds is interesting, but not fully realized. There are three levels of mind readers, or ""peepers."" The third level are employed as security guards, beat cops, etc. They can read minds, but only the surface thoughts. If one were to sit at a bar and think, ""I'm going to go home and kill my wife,"" they'd catch you. Second-level peepers can see much deeper, and first-level peepers can literally alter the reality of others' minds.So when industrialist Ben Reich decides he must kill his business rival, Craye D'Courtney, he becomes the first human in a long, long time to successfully commit a premeditated murder. His plans are clever, up to a point. He employs a first-level peeper to run interference for him, and he gets a woman who works for him to compose what is literally the most catchy and annoying jingle song of all time so he can sing it in his head whenever he's near a peeper, so they won't really know what he's thinking.The bulk of the novel is concerned with the cat and mouse game between Reich and police prefect Lincoln Powell, a first-level peeper. Most of this was enjoyable, despite Bester's sometimes irritating prose. He writes in a subjective, telegraphic style that was popular in the '50s, but that doesn't always work for science fiction, in which more things have to be described and explained to keep the reader engaged than in regular fiction. Bester writes in a loose, jazzy style, but there are too many wild things going on his imagined future that need to be more fully explicated for them to work. People in the book use slang like, ""Don't warp your orbit, Mac,"" (this from a ""jumper"" cab driver) and characters have names like ""Wyg&,"" ""@tkins,"" and ""1/4maine,"" but I'm not sure what stylistic tics like that ultimately add to the narrative.The book's dated qualities can be part of the fun, depending on your tastes. Bester describes how New York's Pennsylvania Station, for reasons lost in the mists of time, was destroyed in the ""late XXth century."" This turned out to be prescient, but that's purely accidental. Most of Bester's future world is half baked. The social values are those of the pre-Mad Men era, and you can take a rocket to Venus from Idlewild (maybe they changed the name back in the XXIInd century when they discovered JFK was really a robot)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 18, 2010","Jul 31, 2010","Jul 19, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8601308-the-demolished-man

Since ""nerd"" has slowly been drained of most of its negative connotations and become a synonym for ""obsessive and knowledgeable"" (e.g., ""Ask my friend about that band, he's a total music nerd""), we need a new word to describe a particular kind of person. He thought of this word while watching The Matrix, as he was wondering what kind of person thinks good guys wearing dark glasses and leather gunfighting bad guys in suits is cool. Borfs ... that's who.Borfs are internet tough guys who love ""cool"" violence and can only relate to a female character in a movie or comic book if she's wearing black leather high-heeled boots and carrying an Uzi. A borf has never gotten into a fight on the street, but is confident he can kick anyone's ass because he studies karate and does a lot of no-contact sparring. Borfs also have no sense of humor. Sure, they may laugh at homophobic jokes, but they have absolutely zero sense of humor about their black belt in karate, their polarized Oakleys, their gym bag with a Chinese dragon on it, the literary merits of Frank Miller, or their collection of ninja throwing stars.Garth Ennis's series The Boys seems tailor-made for borfs. The titular ""boys"" are a small band of ass-kickers who are a self-appointed watchdog agency who keep tabs on superheroes. This isn't a bad setup, but Ennis has proven that the more freedom he has (for instance, when The Punisher became a MAX title instead of a Marvel Knights title), the worse he is. He never met an exploding head or hamster up the ass that he didn't like. And the problem with Ennis is that his writing is never quite good enough or funny enough to be as hateful as it is. The Boys is chock-full of bloody violence and sexual shaming of women and homosexuals, and I felt dirty after reading it.As far as satires of superheroes go, The Boys is as sophisticated a piece of iconoclasm as a schoolboy's crude drawing of Superman sodomizing Wonder Woman. In Ennis's world, superheroes are portrayed as venal, homicidal, useless at saving people, and sexually deviant to a man. The problem with this is it isn't specific to superheroes. Ennis's conceit is that they act like heroes but are really rapists and bullies in private, but he hasn't thought it out beyond depictions of violent orgies. This is a ""critique"" that could just as easily have been applied to police officers, schoolteachers, professional athletes, or community theater actors, and it would have about as much resonance.Worst of all, the protagonists are nearly as nasty and unlikable as the villains. The leader of the Boys, Billy Butcher, is a Yank-hating Brit who wears all black, including a leather coat and the requisite Doc Martens. (See definition of ""borf"" above.) There's also nothing interesting and clever about the way they take down superheroes. There's a magic potion they take that makes them just as strong as superheroes, so they can kill them with their bare hands. Borfs, of course, will take umbrage at my description of this substance as a ""magic potion,"" and will be happy to explain its pseudoscientific properties. But you know what, borfs? It's still a magic potion, and it's fucking stupid....more",Notes are private!,1,76,1,not set,"Jun 11, 2010","Jun 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3337107-the-boys-volume-1

Most irritating of all, it's not irredeemably bad, it just needs a good editor. Who is Lee Child's editor? Does he even have one?For instance:""Are you Jack Reacher?"" the guy asked for the third time.Reacher set his bottle on the table and shook his head.""No,"" he lied.We, the readers, are fully aware this man is Reacher, because we've been told so at least a dozen times in the past three pages. ""He lied"" is unnecessary and stupid. It would have had more impact had Child simply written ""No,"" he said.""""Who wants him?"" Reacher asked.""My client,"" Costello said. ""Lady called Mrs. Jacob.""Reacher sipped water. The name meant nothing to him. Jacob? Never heard of any such person.The line ""Jacob? Never heard of any such person,"" should be deleted from the page, burned, and flushed down the toilet.A few pages later, Reacher enjoys a ""steak that hung off both sides of the plate at once.""Is there any way for a steak to hang off both sides of a plate not at once? Are these two, irritating little words there to ensure we know that this isn't one of those steaks that hangs off both sides of the plate, but not at the same time, because it has legs and walks back and forth?I could go on and on, but I won't. Tough guy characters need tough-guy prose. To properly craft terse, tough-guy prose, Child needs a good editor. He doesn't have one.--update--OK, I finished. Of the first three novels about Jack Reacher, this was far and away my least favorite. Besides the poorly edited, hackneyed prose, the story takes forever to get going. The first two Reacher books both have slam-bang openings that carry the reader through some of the more boring bits, but this one doesn't, which makes all the repeated verbs and interminably long descriptions of people doing things harder to get through. The first 200 pages could have been edited down to 75, and pages 200-400 could have been edited down to 100. The climactic 150 pages are pretty good, but it takes too long to get there. The first two Reacher books weren't great, but they weren't boring. Unfortunately this one is. It could have been a tight 325-page thriller, but it's a bloated 550-page snoozer.

It's decent, but all the pseudoscientific twaddle and talk of parallel universes eventually overwhelmed me. Simone Bianchi's art in this volume is beautiful. Each panel looks like the cover of a sci fi or fantasy novel. Unfortunately, there's very little sense of movement or flow from panel to panel, so the action is sometimes confusing.The ""ghost box"" of the title refers to cubes used to open tunnels between different worlds in the multiverse. The more they are used, however, the more they degrade space and time. In this story arc, the X-Men face the possibility of a massive mutant invasion from a parallel universe, and their quest to stop it takes them from San Francisco to China, and eventually to crazed mutant engineer Forge's stronghold in Wundagore Mountain.The story isn't as confusing as it could have been, and there's lots of enjoyably ridiulous dialogue, such as when Dr. Henry McCoy (The Beast) says, ""I'm imagining a world already shredded by intense ghost box usage.""In addition to the main story arc from Astonishing X-Men #25-#30, this volume reprints the two-issue limited series ""Ghost Boxes,"" which explores several parallel universes inhabited by the X-Men. The first issue, in which the X-Men's world has not developed digital technology, and everything is a bizarre variation on the Victorian era, with dirgibles and black & white two-way video monitors set in gigantic, old-fashioned radio cabinets, is steampunk lunacy at its finest, and was probably my favorite part of the book. The second issue of ""Ghost Boxes,"" however, is a barrage of tragedy. The first story is about Scott Summers (Cyclops) committing suicide, and the second story is about Hisako (Armor) pushing Logan (Wolverine) around in a wheelchair as they wander a post-apocalyptic landscape with a doddering, senile Hank McCoy.

Woolrich was a fine plotter, but his characters were strangely flat.Fright, which Woolrich originally published in 1950 under the name George Hopley, takes place during the Great War (1914-1918), for no apparent reason. The war is never mentioned, and all of the anachronisms seem shoehorned into the narrative. Woolrich even writes things like ""as was the fashion at the time"" after some of them.The prose was my biggest problem with Fright. It reads like exactly what it is, the product of an alcoholic recluse. The descriptive passages are long, sloppy messes in which any adjective that might fit the bill seems thrown in, never to be edited or re-thought.The plot, on the other hand, was grim and nightmarish. Despite the cloddish writing, Fright retains its power to shock and horrify.

Bucky Barnes, his old partner from World War II, thought deceased but actually kept in suspended animation by the Soviets except when they needed him for black ops and assassinations, which he performed under hypnosis, is all better now and has taken on the role of Captain America with a new uniform that's sort of like the old uniform, but shinier. Bucky is teamed up with Steve's old partner from the '70s, The Falcon, who was one of Marvel's first black superheroes. And Cap's old girlfriend Sharon Carter and The Black Widow (a.k.a. Natalia Romanova) are both key players.The loony collection of supervillains is ultimately a more interesting bunch. The nutjob who so idolized Captain American in the '50s that he had plastic surgery to look just like Steve Rogers shows up (that was all retconned by Stan Lee when he decided the real Bucky died in World War II and the real Cap was frozen in a block of ice, since Captain America's HUAC-inspired work hunting down Commies was distasteful to the '60s sensibility). This fake Captain America, who is manipulated by The Red Skull, Dr. Zola, and Doctor Faustus, squares off against Bucky, which makes for an exciting few pages, but doesn't really deliver a payoff.The story arc in this collection concludes the story of The Red Skull (who is in the body of an evil CEO who mostly wears a rubber Red Skull mask in his private time) manipulating American politics through a charismatic third-party puppet candidate. Each issue is well-paced and exciting, but overall I thought there were a lot of opportunities for political satire that were missed. And the resolution to this potentially fascinating story feels too rushed. Also, I thought it was a bold choice to give Bucky, the new Captain America, a pistol and a knife in addition to the famous shield, but nothing comes of it. In the six issues in this collection, he never draws either. Bucky is even drawn in a way that makes him look more like Steve Rogers than he ever did before, which makes the whole thing feel more inconsequential than maybe it should be.Overall, though, I really enjoyed reading this, and I like Ed Brubaker's writing....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2009","Nov 08, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826467-the-death-of-captain-america-vol-3

The fact that the stories are better the less The Punisher is in them should tell you something.

He's almost completely a product of the '70s, and was never on my radar.This mini-series from last year did little to change my feelings about Captain Marvel. For the most part, I found it uninteresting and plodding. Apparently Captain Marvel, whose real name is ""Mar-Vell,"" is a member of the alien race the ""Kree."" He died of cancer and was buried on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. In this mini-series, there's an accident in the negative zone, and Captain Marvel travels in time from before he was dead to after he was dead, to the present day. Or something. His return seems to have a profound impact on the people of earth. All of New York City recognizes him instantly. They must all be Marvel Comics fans over the age of 45. Personally, if Captain Marvel landed in Manhattan my first thought would be, ""Who is that guy? He sure does look like a Mod Hair Ken doll.""If the Kree-Skrull War of the early '70s was a deeply meaningful event for you, you might enjoy this book. I, on the other hand, find Skrulls idiotic and so far am not really enjoying Marvel's whole ""Secret Invasion"" event....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2009","Oct 27, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3355238-secret-invasion

It's not.This volume collects the five-issue story arc, ""Logan Dies."" Written by Marc Guggenheim and drawn by Howard Chaykin (who has a weird, blocky style that I've always liked), ""Logan Dies"" creates a largely unnecessary and basically silly premise. Since he was ""killed"" in World War I, Logan/Wolverine has always gone to the same place every time his indestructible, fast-healing body has sustained so much destruction that he is technically dead; another plane of existence in which he does battle against the angel of death, who is called ""Lazaer."" They fight, Logan wins, Logan comes back to life, none the wiser. In this story, however, he loses the will to engage in yet another mystical battle against Lazaer, and he and Doctor Strange wander around in Purgatory, while the details of Logan's life and death cycle are filled in. The story gets a little meatier once Wolverine re-enters the real world. Apparently he was once killed (""for real,"" whatever that means in the world of comics) and brought back to life by The Hand, who are Marvel's all-purpose group of ninjas, and now they, or people involved with them, are behind the plot to kill him.

With any comic book character, it's not enough that a story be well written, it also has to complement the protagonist. Tony Stark as Iron Man is essentially the American military-industrial complex incarnate. So the technothriller aspects of this story (a bioweapon that will kill 97.5% of humanity if released) and the political intrigue meld perfectly with all the superhero action. Iron Man emerged from Marvel's Civil War event as an unlikeable megalomaniac, albeit one who recognizes some of his flaws. One reason the ""Haunted"" arc is so great is that it doesn't try to ""fix"" this aspect of his character. For the first half of the story, Stark becomes more and more unhinged, and stops taking his armor off for weeks at a time, alarming S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, since he is now their director. Forced to wear a power-dampening ankle bracelet by a psychiatric order, Stark goes off the reservation and gets the job done with a variety of his older suits, none of which are as powerful as he is used to.

Most of the tales of Asgard that made up that thick volume were fairly faithful retellings of the old legends. There was even a diagram of Yggdrasil and the nine worlds of the Scandinavian cosmology. I never kept up with Thor as a character in Marvel comics, but he has a place in my heart.This volume, which collects the first six issues of the new run of Thor that started last year under the direction of writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Olivier Coipel, is light on action and heavy on mysticism, at least for the first several issues. Thor returns from the void in his human form of Dr. Donald Blake, contemplates the meaning of gods and men, recreates Asgard somewhere in Oklahoma, and sets out to find the rest of the Aesir, who are unwittingly trapped in human form. He finds Heimdall, the guardian of Asgard's bridge, in a New Orleans ravaged by Hurricane Katrina, finds the warriors three (Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun) working with Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) in Africa as security personnel in a refugee camp, finds Balder trapped in the guise of The Destroyer, and accidentally frees a female version of Loki, whom it turns out is in cahoots with Doctor Doom (who appears in only one panel). The last issue in this collection takes place back in Oklahoma, where the new residents of Asgard are having a profound effect on their American neighbors. One man who was with his son when they met the enormous Hogun on the road says, ""Since then, Steve's been holed up all day reading about Norse gods. Don't know what they'll make of that at Sunday School.""These issues are almost all build-up, but the art is good and they're enjoyable to read.

The technological aspects sometimes seem to be made up by the author on the spot, and function as it suits the narrative. Surprises are essential in a narrative like this, but when literally anything can happen, it dampens the suspense. I really liked the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, but I felt as if she never had to face any hard choices. The story lets her off the hook too many times. Katniss is a great character, and I wanted to see what she would do when faced with an impossible situation, but due to various contrivances, I never got to see that happen. On the other hand, her relationship with the male protagonist, Peeta, is very well done. Her conflicted feelings are perfectly believable, and there is no neat conclusion, which is great. In fact, all of Katniss's emotional relationships in The Hunger Games are nuanced and moving.

He does what he does extremely well. Whether or not he's a great writer period, I'm not sure. He's a whiz at dialogue and characterization, and his books are hard to put down, but a lot of that is because you know something horrible is going to happen, so becoming disengaged from the narrative is about as easy as not looking at that glass falling through the air that you just knocked off the counter.I liked The Lost. It's not Ketchum's best book, but I might recommend it to someone who doesn't wish to be subjected to the nonstop barrage of horror and inhumanity that occupy his novels like The Girl Next Door and Off Season.Also, if you're already familiar with the murders committed by Charles Schmid in the 1960s that inspired this novel, you might feel OK skipping this one. The antagonist of The Lost, a charming sociopath named Ray Pye, has a number of bizarre attributes that I originally thought were brilliant characterization on the part of Ketchum, but it turns out they're taken directly from the crime files on Schmid, who, like Pye, emulated Elvis Presley, dyed his hair black, wore pancake makeup and eyeliner, drew a beauty mark on his cheek, stuffed his cowboy boots with crushed cans to make himself taller than his natural 5 foot 3 inches, and had a coterie of younger hangers-on. There are even details from Schmid's real life that seem to add little to Pye's character, coming up only once or twice and for seemingly little reason, such as the fact that he was on his high school gymnastics team. Also, the late '60s milieu of the novel seems forced onto the narrative, which generally felt contemporaneous.Unlike The Girl Next Door, which had a lot to say about inhumanity on a global scale, the ""message"" of The Lost--about the post-Summer of Love loss of innocence--seemed forced, but it was still a fine suspense novel with believable dialogue and three-dimensional characters. I was thoroughly engrossed until the last 10 or 15 pages, which felt unnecessary and tacked-on. Part of this could be due to the fact that halfway through reading the book I watched the 2006 film adaptation, which, while not perfect, knows at exactly which moment the story should end....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 08, 2009","Oct 13, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/179742.The_Lost

While I was there I visited the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum, which is the former home of the late SolomonI was just down in Delray Beach, Florida. While I was there I visited the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum, which is the former home of the late Solomon D. Spady, the most prominent African American educator and community leader in the city from the '20s through the '50s. They were showing an exhibit of a group of Florida landscape painters known as ""the Highwaymen,"" whom I'd never heard of.I liked the show, so I bought this book, and read it over the course of the next few days. The Highwaymen were a group of young African American painters (25 men and one woman) in and around Ft. Pierce who produced approximately 50,000 to 200,000 landscape paintings from the '50s through the '70s. The name ""Highwaymen"" wasn't given to them until 1994, when art aficionado Jim Fitch coined the term. While potentially pejorative because of the association with highway robbery, the name is appropriate, since the artists drove up and down Florida's coast to sell their paintings, which they produced quickly, in great numbers, and primarily to make money. They got their start when a young, self-taught black artist named Harold Newton was taken under the wing of a successful white Florida landscape artist named A.E. ""Beanie"" Backus. Other young black painters from Ft. Pierce followed in Newton's footsteps, most notably Alfred Hair, whose dream was to be a millionaire by the time he was 35. Although he fell short of his goal (he was murdered at the age of 29), Hair did fulfill his dream of owning a Cadillac and supporting his wife and children with the money he made selling his paintings, most of which he produced in less than an hour each. Hair is fondly remembered by most of the people interviewed for the book as a charismatic and inspiring figure. The Highwaymen often painted in groups, and encouraged one another. While their art is the type one might see hanging in bank lobbies, over sofas in middle-income homes, and in motel rooms, appreciation for it has grown in recent years. Their paintings sold for around $50 when the oils were still drying, around $5 at garage sales in the '80s, and for more than $1,000 today, now that collectors have taken an interest in their work.Monroe's book is really wonderful. It's not overloaded with text or portentous analyses of their work. Monroe doesn't try to inflate their importance as artists. He places their work in its cultural context (he calls it ""vernacular art"") and talks about the many things that make it special. The bulk of the book is taken up by reproductions of Highwaymen art. There are 59 plates that showcase work by most of the artists identified as ""Highwaymen,"" with a focus on the work of Newton and Hair. One of the interesting things about the Highwaymen is that they worked from memory and imagination. They didn't spend all day on-site, attempting to perfectly recreate the scene before them. They used brushes, palette knives, and fingers to quickly (and with the least amount of paint necessary) create vividly colored impressions of the Florida wilderness they'd grown up in. Their art has no visible political context--humans and buildings rarely appear in Highwaymen art (which is probably why the Highwaymen were able to find so many buyers for their art, as well as sell to white businesses and individuals in a volatile and desegregating South without any reports of violence or animosity), What their art does do, however, is invite the viewer to participate in a shared experience of wonder. Their depictions of Florida's natural beauty, its volatile coastal weather, and its unearthly sunsets and tricks of light are frequently stunning....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 31, 2009","May 29, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1374665.The_Highwaymen

Like a lot of mystery novels, by the time I got to the end, I couldn't help thinking that it would have been more interesting if the plot had focused on the killer(s) instead of the elaborate puzzle that leads to the conclusion.Speaking of puzzles, Patrick Quentin (sometimes Quentin Patrick or just ""Q. Patrick"") was a pen name under which various combinations of four different people (Hugh Callingham Wheeler, Mary Louise White Aswell, Richard Wilson Webb, and Martha Mott Kelly) wrote a series of mysteries starting in 1931. Many of them were part of the ""puzzle"" series that featured the detective Peter Duluth (e.g., Puzzle for Fiends, Puzzle for Wantons, Puzzle for Fools, Puzzle for Players).The Grindle Mystery, which was written by Webb and Aswell, doesn't have a strong detective as its main character, which could be one of the reasons I didn't really like it, or it could just be that I prefer the hard-boiled noir stories of the 1930s to the elaborately constructed whodunits of Quentin, John Dickson Carr, Agatha Christie, and their ilk. What I did like about The Grindle Mystery, however, was its thick atmosphere and its gruesome goings-on. Most of the murders in this book are committed by dragging people behind a car, and no one seems to be safe from the whoever is doing the killing; the victims include a little girl, a kitten, an old man, a dog, and a marmoset.

Dresser wrote the Dividend on Death is the first mystery Davis Dresser wrote about tough, redheaded, Miami-based private investigator Michael Shayne. Dresser wrote the novel under the pseudonym ""Brett Halliday,"" and he would go on to write 49 more novels about Shayne before other authors stepped in to write 27 more, all under the house name ""Brett Halliday"" (the last novel about Shayne was published in 1976). Shayne also appeared in hundreds of short stories, as well as several films, a TV series, and a radio series.Despite that, Shayne hasn't left much of a mark in pop culture. It's safe to say that many present-day fans of Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, Mike Hammer, and their ilk haven't even heard of him, let alone read any Brett Halliday novels.Since Shayne's reputation (if he even has one) is that of ""the generic P.I.,"" I found Dividend on Death a pleasant surprise. Its plot is farfetched and Dresser uses an average of two adverbs per sentence, most of them unnecessary, but it's a fun read. It seems to be influenced by The Maltese Falcon, especially in its use of a heavy gangland figure named Gordon whom Shayne meets in a hotel room (in much the same fashion Sam Spade meets Casper Gutman). Like Gutman, Gordon employs a pint-sized gunman and has a beautiful ""daughter."" Gordon enlists Shayne to track down a possibly priceless artifact. Not content to crib from just one mystery, however, Dresser folds this plot into another one about a hysterical (and beautiful) rich girl who's being tormented by her live-in psychiatrist, who--it should go without saying--is up to no good.This is a decent, quick read for hard-boiled mystery fans.

The Enforcer has never been my favorite Dirty Harry movie (it's a tie between the first two), but it's competent entertainment, and the denouement, in which Inspector Harry ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan and his partner, Inspector Kate Moore, save the mayor of San Francisco from a bunch of militant punks who are holding him hostage on the island of Alcatraz, is as good a way to end the picture as any other.When written in book form, however, its ridiculousness becomes much more apparent. Harry, armed with a six-shot .44 Magnum, and Kate, armed with a service revolver, go up against four men, each of whom is armed with a fully automatic AR-15. This would be fine if some sort of stealth were involved, but Harry stages a frontal assault on the island. He doesn't even have much a plan. According to Wesley Morgan, the credited writer for this novelization, he looked at maps of the island while in the fireboat that dropped him off.Novelizations are a disposable medium, but very often they're not nearly as bad as they could be, and the writers who made a buck writing them gussy up the action so that characters have internal lives and motivations not implicit in the film version. And very often the writers take pains to stage action scenes that actually make more sense than the versions that made it to the screen. Not so with Morgan. He's content to recite the action in roughly the same way a child will who's seen a film and is describing its action verbatim to classmates. Also like a child, Morgan pads his book report. The first page and a half of the last chapter, which immediately follow the scene in which Harry finds out where the mayor is being held, grind the action to a screeching halt with a brief history of Alcatraz island. Did you know that the Spanish discovered the island in 1775, and named it Isla de los Alcatraces, which means ""Island of the Pelicans""? Or that in the '70s, Indian activists occupied the island? Yeah, so did I. I took the tour when I was in San Francisco. Now stop wasting my time and get to the scene where Dirty Harry blows up the last bad guy with a LAW rocket....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 20, 2009","Mar 20, 2009",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3157163-the-enforcer

Too often I find the plot and characters merely window dressing, and the central driving force of the plot a mystery or ""puzzle"" that is largely an intellectual exercise for the reader. I prefer crime fiction in which there is no real mystery, and instead of being a puzzle to be solved, the plot is a labyrinth in which characters struggle to reach the end.Margaret Millar's How Like an Angel was a great reminder that any genre can be good when it is done well. Nearly every page of this book presents questions that the reader can't help but try to answer, but the characters, writing style, and story were all still immensely satisfying. Also, the way the mystery unravels was especially well done, I thought. There is no single ""a-ha"" moment in which a detective reveals the killer. Rather, the solution to the mystery unfolds in a natural, satisfying fashion. Depending on the reader, the solution might present itself on the first page of the last chapter or the last page of the last chapter (assuming they haven't worked it out sooner).Millar is a great mystery writer.

It is not the first detective novel, and Hammett's protagoniDashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon is probably the first great hard-boiled P.I. novel. It is not the first detective novel, and Hammett's protagonist, Sam Spade, has his literary progenitors (e.g., C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, Nick Carter, Hercule Poirot), but the ""hard-boiled P.I."" formula that became so popular in the '30s and '40s (and remains popular today) is perfectly realized in this novel.Originally serialized in five parts in Black Mask magazine from September 1929 to January 1930, The Maltese Falcon is the story of San Francisco detective Sam Spade, his loyal secretary Effie Perine, his ill-fated partner Miles Archer, his friend on the police force Det. Sgt. Tom Polhaus, his nemesis on the police force Lt. Dundy, his hotel detective friend Luke, Archer's trampy wife Iva, femme fatale Brigid O'Shaugnessy, criminal kingpin Casper Gutman, pint-sized tough guy Wilmer, effeminate (i.e., gay as the day is long) gunman Joel Cairo, and various other miscreants and lowlifes. The plot of the novel, as well as the character of Spade and his relationship to the other characters in the novel, form a template for hard-boiled P.I. fiction that countless writers copied and continue to copy (whether they realize it or not) with varying success. That's not to discount the hundreds of great characters that followed Spade (e.g., Philip Marlowe, Michael Shayne, Mike Hammer, Lew Archer). A formula only survives if it works, and there's nothing wrong with a good formula, but the influence of The Maltese Falcon looms over literally every hard-boiled P.I. novel written since.The hard-boiled P.I. genre is a uniquely American style, or at least it started out that way. The detectives in Black Mask survived by their wits, their fists, and their connections. They weren't necessarily able to tell everything about a person or a situation based on minute details that others missed, but they were able to see a case to the end with their perseverance and mental and physical toughness. The people who wrote for Black Mask magazine were freeing themselves not only from the bonds of British-style mysteries (e.g., cerebral, polite, ornate language, a focus on detection), they were also freeing themselves from the parochialism of 19th-century literary styles in general.There are passages in The Maltese Falcon in which it seems as if Hammett is rediscovering and reclaiming not only the English language but the very nature of descriptive writing. Descriptions of Sam Spade being awakened by the telephone and then getting dressed seem as if they have been written by an alien observing the human race for the first time:""A switch clicked and a white bowl hung on three gilded chains from the ceiling's center filled the room with light. Spade, bare-footed in green and white checked pajamas, sat on the side of the bed.""""Spade's thick fingers made a cigarette with deliberate care, sifting a measured quantity of tan flakes down into curved paper, spreading the flakes so that they lay equal at the ends with a slight depression in the middle, thumbs rolling the paper's inner edge down and up under the outer edge as forefingers pressed it over, thumbs and fingers sliding to the paper cylinder's ends to hold it even while tongue licked the flap, left forefinger and thumb pinching their end while right forefinger and thumb smoothed the damp seam, right forefinger and thumb twisting their end and lifting the other to Spade's mouth.""""He scratched the back of his neck and began to dress. He put on a thin white union-suit, grey socks, black garters, and dark brown shoes. When he had fastened his shoes he picked up the telephone, called Graystone 4500, and ordered a taxicab. He put on a green-striped white shirt, a soft white collar, a green necktie, the grey suit he had worn that day, a loose tweed overcoat, and a dark grey hat. The street-door-bell rang as he stuffed tobacco, keys, and money into his pockets.""The reader is not spared a single, quotidian detail of Spade's cigarette-rolling or dressing ritual. On the other hand, the reader can only assume that Spade has emotions or an interior life.The exhaustive detail is something that has gone out of favor with hard-boiled crime writers. Elmore Leonard or Donald E. Westlake (R.I.P.) might simply have written, ""Spade got out of bed, rolled a cigarette, and called for a cab. He got dressed and left his apartment."" But for its time, Hammett's writing stands in polar opposition to the Romantic, 19th-century (both English and American) style of storytelling, in which emotion, thought, and the inner lives of characters was emphasized, and what a character was wearing or doing with his or her hands might not even be mentioned.If you like mysteries, crime fiction, and detective fiction, and have never read The Maltese Falcon, read it. It took me a long time to finally getting around to reading the copy I've had since high school. Part of the reason was because I was already familiar not only with the plot (through John Huston's 1941 film version) but with the template that Hammett created. But it stands on its own as a great and unique reading experience....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jan 31, 2009","Jan 12, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51068.The_Maltese_Falcon

Most of the better-known DC Comics characters make an appearance, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, and in sometimes interesting ways. For instance, Batman, whose real name is unknown, is depicted as a little boy whose dissident parents were murdered by the K.G.B. for printing anti-Superman literature, and who grows up to fight the Soviet state (and Superman) instead of crime in Gotham City. Lois Lane and Perry White, on the other hand, still live in Metropolis and work for The Daily Planet. Lex Luthor's role is still as an American megalomaniac, so his decades-long battle with Superman is a reflection of the Cold War (including Luthor's creation of Bizarro to fight the Russian Superman). Many, many other characters from Superman's universe show up, including Lana Lang (the little girl on the collective farm in The Ukraine whom Superman remembers fondly), Oliver Queen (but only as a reporter for The Daily Planet, not as Green Arrow), Brainiac, Ma Kent (childless and widowed), Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, etc. A few important real-life people appear, too, most notably John F. Kennedy and Josef Stalin.I liked Red Son, and would recommend it to anyone who likes Superman and the DC Comics universe, but I found it more ""clever"" than anything else. Superman has never been one of my favorite comic-book characters. He's too perfect and all-powerful to ever be very interesting.

Trapped in a horror film. Directed by John Woo."" After reading The City Destroyer, I think that's a great description. The Spider is a contemporary of iconic '30s pulp superheroes and vigilantes like Doc Savage and The Shadow, there are a lot of macabre undertones and a pervading sense of doom, and the frequent gunplay defies both logic and physics.If I were specifically pitching The City Destroyer to Hollywood, I'd say, ""Richard Wentworth, a.k.a. 'The Spider,' is a 1930s version of Jack Bauer from 24, except that he operates independently and is also a master of disguise."" The villain in The City Destroyer, ""The Master,"" has created a ""steel eater"" that can bring down even the mightiest skyscraper, as well as ocean liners, trains, automobiles, firearms, and bank vaults. This novel takes place in New York, and a lot of scenes are difficult to read in the 21st century without thinking back to September 11, 2001.

Needless to say, The Spider goes after The Master with the kind of ruthless determination any pulp superhero would when faced with villainy that thinks nothing of murdering thousands to make a profit.Norvell Page, who wrote more Spider novels than anyone else did under the name ""Grant Stockbridge,"" is a master of action and atmosphere, if not internal consistency.

Here's a representative descriptive passage:At the sound of the explosion, the playing stopped as three pairs of eyes turned as one toward the house. In another minute they were inside. It only took one more minute for the screams to be heard. The quiet neighborhood was no more.Forget, for a moment, the clumsy use of the passive voice in the first sentence, and focus instead on the bizarre description of three people as ""three pairs of eyes."" Not only is this unnecessary, it leads to the possibility of unintentional humor in the second sentence--""In another minute they were inside""--since one can interpret this as six disembodied eyes floating into the house. And the final sentence is terrible. Not only is it an unnecessary addition to the paragraph, it doesn't make logical sense. The quiet of the neighborhood may be disturbed, but the neighborhood itself still exists. Saying that ""The quiet neighborhood was no more"" makes it sounds as if the neighborhood has been incinerated by a hydrogen bomb.Baldacci's dialogue is bad, too. Here's an example:""Jack, do you have any idea who's behind all this?""Jack shook his head, a small groan escaping his lips. ""I've got a bunch of loose threads sliding around in my head but none of them have added up to spit so far. I'm hoping that status will change. Soon.""If there is any English-speaking person in the world who speaks that way while under duress, I have yet to meet them.And here's one final example of exactly what I don't like about Baldacci's prose:She still stood there several minutes after he left. A series of emotions competed for space across her face, none, in the end, winning out.The unintentional rhyming of ""space"" with ""face"" is distracting. Also, Baldacci uses a lot of words to essentially tell the reader nothing. A character seems to experience a number of emotions--none of which are specifically described--before eventually experiencing none. Is that the idea Baldacci wishes to convey? Does he even know what idea he wishes to convey about his characters or the situations in which they find themselves most of the time? It didn't seem to me as if he did.If you've seen ps for the film version of Absolute Power or read the flap copy, you know what it's about. I suppose it could be an enjoyable potboiler if you're able to turn off the critical part of your mind that notices clumsy writing and consume the story in the fashion one consumes an entire bag of chips in one sitting, but for me, the writing was so bad it was distracting.

Hard-boiled P.I. fiction is what turned me on to crime fiction as a young reader, and this book offers all the enjoyment of Mickey Spillane's books without all of the racism, sexism, over-the-top violence, and contrived character motivation that was Spillane's stock in trade. (I like the Mike Hammer novels, but they're pretty ridiculous.)The Gutter and the Grave (originally published as I'm Cannon -- For Hire) is the story of a washed-up, divorced, alcoholic private detective named Matt Cordell who lives in the Bowery in Manhattan, panhandling, people-watching, and drinking his life away (this was the '50s, when homeless men still wore suits and hats). An old friend finds him one day and asks for a favor. Cordell is soon embroiled in a plot in which everyone's story contradicts someone else's.

It's easy to imagine that some people talked this way in 1958.This was the only full-length novel about Cordell that Hunter wrote, which is a shame; he would have made a great series character. Hunter introduced Cordell in a short story called ""Die Hard,"" which was published under Hunter's own name in the first issue of Manhunt Detective Story Monthly in January 1953. It was followed by five more stories in Manhunt; ""Dead Men Don't Dream"" in the March 1953 issue, ""Now Die in It,"" in May 1953, ""Good and Dead,"" in July 1953, ""The Death of Me,"" in September 1953, and ""Deadlier Than the Mail"" in February 1954.

The prose is on the level of decent (but not great) YA fiction, but it's still an enjoyable walk down memory lane for any horror fans who grew up in the '80s.For whatever reason, 1987 was a really good year for retroactive novelizations of the two most popular horror franchises in the United States. This book was published to coincide with the release of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Neither of the first two Elm Street films had been novelized, however, so I guess New Line or St. Martin's Press or whoever decided to have Jeffrey Cooper novelize the first two while he was at it.

This plays an important role in marking territory and giving sexual signs. It can be used to advantage in baiting snares.""Now, this probably says something about my own temperament and the movies I like to watch, but at no point when reading the SAS Survival Handbook was I as panicked and terrified as I was when reading Max Brooks's The Zombie Survival Guide.

My main problem with this book, which I liked overall, is in the ""recorded attacks"" section. Sequenced chronologically, many of these ""recorded attacks"" are well-told and scary, but for the most part they're clumsy political satire. Using zombies as metaphors for societal collapse, injustice, etc. has been a big part of the genre since Night of the Living Dead came out in the '60s. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

The premise is, frankly, ridiculous, and its plot is nothing but doom and gloom. So why did I love it so much? Simply because it was completely convincing, engrossing, and terrifying. I don't think I have ever found myself squirming as much while reading as I was for this book's last 20 pages or so.I think The Ruins works as well as it does because of Smith's writing and characterizations. There are a lot of negative s of this book on this site. The most common complaints are that the characters were unlikable, that there were no lofty themes or messages in the story, and that the nature of the threat the characters face in the Mayan ruins where most of the book takes place was impossible to take seriously.I didn't find the characters at all unlikable. They infuriated and saddened me consistently, because their flaws were all either ones I see in myself or in other people and am powerless to change, but I never found them unlikable. They are drawn so well, in fact, that they really seemed like real people to me. And real people in peril are the worst kind of people. If you've ever wondered what your significant other or best friend would do in a situation of extreme peril with you and found yourself feeling sick and worried, then this novel will probably twist your guts up. And terrify you.No big themes? Again, I liked this. If there were, it would have blunted the terror. This is a story of a few people in the midst of a crisis over the course of a few days. They don't have the luxury of reflection, and neither does the reader. This book might not teach you anything, but its immediacy is chilling.As far as the nature of the threat that faces them in the ruins, I can't disagree. There are a number of reasons why it's incredibly silly. But at the same time, in the context of the story, it's really not. I, for one, found it disturbing for a number of reasons.If you're able to read The Ruins and tell yourself, ""This could never happen,"" then you'll probably hate it. But if you're able to give yourself over to the situation and see yourself in the novel's characters, you will feel a creepy and pervading sense of doom....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,not set,"Aug 22, 2008","Aug 12, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1150339.The_Ruins

With the tacit agreement of a single CIA operative in Saigon, Capt. Mack Gerber gives Fetterman permission to slip over the border to assassinate the Chinese officer. Needless to say, things don't go entirely according to plan, and once back in Vietnam, things go from bad to worse, with the CIA disowning the operation, which leads to a military court martial. (Reading this book after the 2004 presidential election, it's hard not to think of the ""swift boating"" of John Kerry, and the controversy surrounding statements he made about being in Cambodia during Christmas 1968, but that's neither here nor there.)The back cover copy of all the books in the Vietnam: Ground Zero series claim that ""Eric Helm is the pen name of two Vietnam veterans, men who were there and who now tell it like it was."" Actually, my understanding has always been that Helm is a pen name for pretty much just one person; Kevin Randle.

Child is an incredibly popular thrillLee Child's Killing Floor took me a really long time to read, mostly because it just never captured my interest. Child is an incredibly popular thriller writer, so I'm sure there are a lot of readers who've consumed this entire book in two or three sittings. I am not one of them, however. I read a few pages at a time, on my way to or from work, and never found myself wanting to tear through it, the way I do when a thriller really captures my interest.Killing Floor opens well, with Jack Reacher, a big, tough, 36-year-old ex-military policeman who is now drifting around the country, eating breakfast in a diner in a small town in Georgia. With no explanation, police officers storm the diner and arrest Reacher. This is a great opening, but the momentum just didn't continue for me. I was pretty much just reading to get to the end.I think my biggest problem was the character of Reacher. Creating a protagonist who's ridiculously tough is always tricky. It's easy to devolve into parody, and it's hard to make him believable. Reacher, for the most part, is believable, but there are too many points in the book where he overexplains himself, which didn't work for me. For instance, as he's approaching one of his antagonists during a brutal fight, there's suddenly a long paragraph explaining how, in a book or movie, he would have squared off against him, man to man, but since this is real life, he's just going to go for the kill right away. Not only does this stop the action dead in its tracks, but it reminded me that I was reading a book, and that Reacher is a fictional character. Maybe it was supposed to be hard-boiled, but for me, it was just the opposite. What would have been really cool was if Reacher had just gone ahead and iced the dude without any preamble. Maybe Child didn't trust his readers to see how hardcore the action was, but if a writer has to explain something like that, it never works. It's called ""showing"" versus ""telling."" If Child can't just show the reader how tough Reacher is, then he's failed.I didn't hate Killing Floor, and I may read more of Child's books, but while reading it I just kept thinking that I would probably be enjoying it more if it were a two-hour movie starring Stone Cold Steve Austin than a 400-page novel with hackneyed writing.

Earl Swagger was introduced in Black Light, which had parallel narratives, one about Bob Lee in the present day and the other about Earl in the '50s. I liked Earl as a character in Black Light. He seemed simultaneously more likeable than Bob Lee and more flawed.Hot Springs takes place nearly a decade before Earl Swagger's scenes in Black Light did, a year after World War II. Swagger is haunted by the horrors of the Battle of Iwo Jima, but at the same time he seems unwilling to settle down and try to build a life for himself and his pregnant wife. Instead of taking on relatively safe work and taking care of his family, Swagger agrees to train a group of young men to kick down doors and raid casinos and brothels in the town of Hot Springs, Arkansas. Not only does Swagger lead these raids instead of staying in the rear and acting as an advisor, he does so without the bulletproof vests he makes his boys wear. He denies having a death wish, or any kind of guilt about surviving Iwo Jima when so many of his men did not, but the evidence seems to imply otherwise.I liked Hot Springs, but I didn't feel as if it delved enough into Swagger's character. Hunter seems more interested in playing around with introducing as many real, historical figures as he can. (Harry S. Truman is in the first chapter, pinning a medal on Swagger's chest, Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel is a major character, Mickey Rooney shows up at one point, shooting craps in one of Hot Springs's casinos, etc.) All these little details are fun, but add little to the main narrative thrust, at least in my opinion, and I found them more distracting than anything else. Also, the basic arc of the narrative seemed overly similar to the arcs in Hunter's novels about Bob Lee. And a number of elements seemed really similar to elements in the Bob Lee novels. For instance, in one of the climactic shootouts, I found myself thinking, ""Really, Mr. Hunter? Tracer rounds, again?""Overall, though, I did like Hot Springs, and would recommend it to anyone who likes Hunter's novels, but not necessarily to someone who said to me, ""I've never read any of Stephen Hunter's novels.

The storytelling, however, often leaves something to be desired, and too many issues follow exactly the same dramatic arc.In the 1970s, Marvel Comics introduced a number of black superheroes, such as The Falcon, Blade, Black Panther, and Brother Voodoo. Luke Cage, a.k.a. ""Power Man,"" was perhaps the most obvious attempt to capitalize on the burgeoning blaxploitation wave in Hollywood. Created by a pair of white guys (Archie Goodwin and John Romita), Cage first appeared in Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1 eleven months after Shaft first appeared in theaters. Like John Shaft, who himself was created by a white writer, Luke Cage was a big, imposing black man who worked as a detective and general helper of the downtrodden. His powers were prosaic--super strength and indestructible skin--so the better stories in this volume are driven by gritty storylines and colorful Harlem villains with names like Cottonmouth, Diamondback, Señor Suerte, and Black Mariah, not universe-altering superheroics. The less-exciting stories are cookie cutter plots that could have featured any Marvel hero. (Interestingly, like Shaft, Luke Cage did not spend 24 hours a day in Harlem. Shaft's office was uptown, but he laid his head in Greenwich Village. Cage's adventures often took him to Harlem, but his office/home was above a grindhouse movie theater in Times Square.)This volume collects the first 27 issues of Luke Cage's adventures, published from 1972 to 1975.

ActuThis was Chester Himes's second novel to feature his two tougher-than-leather Harlem police detectives, Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones. Actually, ""tougher than leather"" doesn't quite do this duo justice. Coffin Ed and Grave Digger are tougher than a leather bag full of nails, frozen in a block of ice, wrapped in another leather bag, and studded full of nails. If that sounds over-the-top, well, Himes meant these characters to be just that. His Harlem detective novels were written while he was living in France, on commission for his publisher, and Himes clearly had a lot of fun playing around with stereotypes. The Real Cool Killers and For Love of Imabelle (which was republished under the title A Rage in Harlem) are larger-than-life depictions of African American life in the '50s and '60s in Harlem. But there's a lot of truth in them, too. I love the way Himes is able to lampoon white folks' assumptions about black culture by having his black characters act the way the white characters in a given scene expect them to, ratchet up their buffoonery a few notches, and leave you laughing not only at their antics, but also at the white characters' idiocy for taking what they're seeing at face value. While his style is manic, violent, and wild, he's still a deeply human storyteller. I love his style of writing and his way of telling stories.I didn't like The Real Cool Killers quite as much as I liked For Love of Imabelle, largely because my favorite character from that novel was murdered halfway through it, and no one in Himes's second novel quite has that character's charisma, humor, or entertaining mean streak.

With the help of one of his classmates, Angelina ""Max"" Maximillian, Zack stows aboard the enormous spaceship his grandfather has secretly built. Together with thousands of people from all over the world, they set off to establish a colony on the moon.This seems like a good book for readers aged 9-12, especially those who are getting interested in sci-fi. Coming to it as an adult reader, however, I didn't find a lot to engage me. I enjoyed the setup, and was delighted by a logic problem in chapter 10 involving three light bulbs whose solution was simple but elegant. After the point in the book where Zack and Max board the spaceship, however, I couldn't help but ask a lot of questions. First of all, how did so many people from all over the globe get involved with Grandfather Goodspeed's mission without a single person on earth who was not involved with the mission catching on? Certainly the media would be interested in a group of people who planned to establish a colony on the moon, wouldn't they? And how did the evil Dr. Machvel secretly turn half of Grandfather Goodspeed's crew against Goodspeed without any of the ""good guys"" getting wise to what was going on? These are probably not things children will worry about once they get caught up in all the intergalactic derring-do of the narrative, but as an adult, the situations and conflicts just didn't ring true to me. And the names of some of the characters are just silly. (Machvel's first name is Ian. Get it? Machvel, Ian? Machiavellian?) Also, the lack of many narrative surprises was something of a detriment for me. As soon as Dr. Machvel is introduced to the reader, he is described as ""olive-skinned"" with ""a pointed black beard"" and a ""low, steady voice that was almost a hiss."" Grandfather Goodspeed's right-hand man, Commander Chase, on the other hand, is described as ""broad-shouldered"" with a ""cleft chin jutting from his face."" The fact that Machvel is evil and scheming and that Chase is stalwart and true should come as a surprise to absolutely no one who learned to tell the good guys from the bad guys by watching Republic serials from the 1930s. (So much for teaching children that you can't tell a person’s character from their appearance. Oh well. At least Machvel isn't an opium-smoking Chinese man with really long fingernails.) The characters in this book are generally two-dimensional, but Machvel is probably the most egregious example. (His physical loathsomeness isn't even consistent; when he reappears toward the end of the book, he is hunched over and using a cane to walk. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't remember that detail from earlier in the book.)The pacing was sometimes a problem for me. It only seemed as if the protagonists were in danger when Mahoney wanted them to be. For instance, Zack, Max, and their friend Sanjay had plenty of time to play around with enormous construction/combat machines called “Mechs” in a simulation room, and the danger Machvel poses only rears its head again when Zack and his friends realize that maybe they should start trying to ferret out traitors onboard. On a positive note, however, the Mechs are some of Mahoney’s coolest creations, and I had fun reading about them.Grandfather Goodspeed is potentially the most interesting character, but most of the time he seems more like a writer’s creation than an actual character. For instance, his ""bumbling"" provides most of the book's humor, but his unerring genius provides the book with its basic plot. How are these two sides of his personality reconciled? They're not. And maybe they're not supposed to be, but for the most part I thought it made him a more unbelievable creation than a nuanced character. For instance, down on earth he consistently blows up his laboratory in classic goofy mad scientist fashion, but is still able to supervise construction of an enormous spaceship that can take thousands of people from the earth to the moon, and that seems technologically a century or two ahead of its time, and that features so many unnecessary bells and whistles I was surprised that it was ever able to actually take off. Grandfather Goodspeed's private quarters feature such byzantine accoutrements as sheer black tiles, two curved stairways, black leather couches that levitate above the floor, and a solid gold statue.The ostentation of the spaceship really hits its apex in the ""great hall,"" which is described in a way that seems more like hagiography than it does sci-fi:The wall at this end was decorated like an altar. A series of wide stairs led from the floor, covered in blue and purple rags edged with gold. Towering, stone statues of the titan Atlas rose up on either side of the back wall, his muscles straining from the vast globe he carried on his back. In between these statues was a stained glass window that stretched from the floor to the ceiling and glowed with golden light. Unlike other stained glass windows Zack had seen on Earth, this one was composed entirely of frosted white glass and edged in a golden frame. The glass formed the figure of a mostly bald man in spectacles holding a cube in one hand which radiated brilliant light. Zack realized in shock that the man was his grandfather.Hubris, anyone? If this were a Greek myth (especially one about the dangers of flying too close to the sun), those gigantic stone statues might make the spacecraft too heavy to take off in the first place, but instead, it's just a bit of Ayn Rand-style glorification of the individual without any regard for reality. I know that the Onyx Sun supposedly provides nearly limitless power with zero emissions or byproducts, but honestly, this is more ""magic"" than it is ""science.""Maybe I'm being too hard on The Incredible Origins of the Onyx Sun. Like I said, readers aged 9-12 will probably enjoy it. But it always seems like a bit of a cop-out to say this. After all, the very best literature for children and young adults can really be enjoyed by anyone of any age. When reading young-adult fiction I want to be reminded of the wonder of being a kid, not have my pedantic adult personality constantly needled and find myself saying on every page, ""What? That's ridiculous. That goes against all science and logic.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2008","May 05, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2627131-the-incredible-origins-of-the-onyx-sun

Reading this book is like standing next to him at a cocktail party, listening to one hilarious and fascinating anecdote after another, unable to get a word in edgewise but not caring one bit.Step Right Up!: I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America is divided into roughly three parts. The first is all about his early life in the theater, before he became a filmmaker. There's a nearly unbelievable, wonderful story in this section about how he secretly trashed his own theater a few days before opening night, drawing graffiti to make it look as if Nazi sympathizers in the U.S. were against him, guaranteeing a load of free publicity for himself. The second part is all about his life in Hollywood in the '50s and '60s. This section will be the most familiar to readers who already know all about his classic thrillers from this period, as well as the gimmicks he came up with to promote them. (For instance, to promote his 1959 film The Tingler, starring Vincent Price, he wired theater seats to joybuzz patrons' spines while a silhouette of the centipede-like ""Tingler"" crawled over the screen and Price giddily intoned, ""The Tingler is loose in the theater! Scream! Scream for your lives!"") The third part is all about working with Roman Polanski on Rosemary's Baby, which Castle produced, since the studio wouldn't let him direct it himself due to his reputation as a schlock filmmaker.I'm a huge fan of William Castle's films, especially The Tingler, Homicidal, Strait Jacket, and Mr. Sardonicus. It's a shame more of his films aren't available on DVD. He made a picture early in his career, for instance, starring Robert Mitchum, called When Strangers Marry that I would love to see. It's also a real shame that this book is no longer in print.

Also, the dialogue is straight out of a bad studio picture from the '40s, and was probably dated the minute MacDonald committed it to paper in 1964.

Hate-Kill-Repeat, by British slasher movie fan and first-time novelist Jason Arnopp (whose previous books include a biography of the band Slipknot), is the third Friday the 13th novel published by Black Flame, but it's the first I’ve read. I checked out a number of s on Amazon.com, and Hate-Kill-Repeat seems to be one of the more positively received of the Friday the 13th novels. The only reason for this that I can see is that die-hard Friday the 13th fans appreciate Arnopp's devotion to the series and his attempt to tie this book into the canonical history of the series (Hate-Kill-Repeat takes place immediately after the events of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and ends by setting up the events of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday ... I guess Arnopp didn’t care for Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan).I, on the other hand, found this book a real chore to get through for several reasons. First and foremost, at more than 400 pages it's far too long to sustain interest given its rather limited subject matter. I really don't think it should take longer than a couple of hours to read a Friday the 13th novel, so 200 pages should be the maximum allowable length. I find most of the movies in the series modestly entertaining, largely because they're over in an hour and a half. If they took days to get through like this book did, no one would go near them.Since all of Black Flame's Friday the 13th novels are roughly this length, I assume it's a requirement they have for their authors. So should we let Arnopp off the hook? Well, no. Given the size of the novel he had to produce he really should have focused on creating at least a few characters who were three-dimensional enough to involve the reader. Also, there's never any sense of suspense or dread at any point. In short, nothing that I normally look for in a horror novel. One could argue that Arnopp was merely following the conventions of the Friday the 13th films by introducing one character after another, only to have them killed by Jason, but with 400 pages to play around with, why not at least try to do something else? Or at least create a sense of terror instead of mind-numbing boredom after the first few kills? The only ""something else"" that this novel contains is a husband and wife pair of moral-majority serial killers who believe Jason shares their raison d'être, but they're a pretty uninteresting creation, and ultimately don't add much to this novel.Another thing that really ruined this book for me was the fact that Arnopp clearly knows nothing about the United States (which is where this novel takes place), and didn't take any time to research the country beyond, perhaps, watching American slasher movies, or even step outside of himself and consider ""Does this make sense in the context in which I am writing?""For instance, an American businessman character in the novel thinks to himself how ""American hotels"" usually have no thirteenth floor. Why does this ring so false? Because the character is an American. He'd think of ""American hotels"" merely as ""hotels,"" wouldn't he?There are inaccuracies on nearly every page. Cocaine is not a ""Class A"" drug in the United States, it's a ""Schedule II"" drug. Someone in the sheriff's department wouldn't be resentful that the man who is currently sheriff ""leapfrogged ahead of him"" to get the position, since in the United States, sheriff is nearly always an elected position. Sure, he could be resentful if he lost an election to a younger, less experienced person, but that's not how Arnopp chose to describe it. This would be an easy fix if Arnopp had a good editor, but clearly he did not.Arnopp's ignorance of the United States is probably most irritating, however, in the chapters that feature his group of redneck characters who take to the woods for a fun weekend of drinking beer and getting killed by Jason. The average American redneck wouldn't know what a ""fortnight"" or the ""bonnet"" of his car was if a gun was to his head, and he most certainly would not brag about how the British SAS kill people; he'd brag about US Special Forces or something similar. Seriously, even someone who's never set foot in the United States should realize this. I'm sure there are a number of things about life in the U.K. that I don't know about, but were I to write a cheap horror novel that took place in, oh, let’s say, Croydon, I most certainly would not have the characters putting their beer in the ""trunk"" of their car or calling their mates their ""friends."" And I would definitely have one of my British friends read over my manuscript for things that didn't seem right to them.Arnopp!

The first 12 issues of the new Marvel MAX series were really lame, and completely abandoned the humor and clever plotting of Ennis's work on The Punisher for Marvel's regular line, instead focusing solely on violence and torture. Mother Russia was great, however. It wasn't at all humorous, and stuck with its depiction of Frank Castle as a cold-blooded murderer, but put him in a suspenseful and interesting situation. Also, while I know they're completely implausible, I've still always been a sucker for scenes in which someone is able to defeat an unbeatable opponent simply because they get righteously angry enough; the scene like that in Mother Russia, in which Castle flashes back to his daughter dying in Central Park in front of him, is one of the best I've ever seen, and actually made me cry.Up Is Down and Black Is White was also pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as Mother Russia.

UnThe French newspaper La Croix said of Donald Goines that he ""...dives into the hellish world of the ghetto dear to Chester Himes, minus the humor."" Unlike most of the paternalistic, misguided, and subtly racist ""international raves"" from French publications that are printed in every Holloway House edition of Goines's novels, this is actually a pretty good description of his writing, and gets to the heart of both what I like and don't like about his novels. Like Himes, Goines wrote rough-hewn, nightmarish narratives about pimps, pushers, and killers in timeless black American ghetto settings. (I say ""timeless"" because there's very little specificity in Goines's writing. Aside from a few things like model years of cars, his narratives could really take place at any point between 1945 and 1990.) Unlike Himes, however, Goines has absolutely no sense of humor, irony, or compassion for his characters. All of this might go down easier if I had the sense that it was deliberate, but it's hard to feel that way, since Goines was clearly not fully in control of his narratives or his subject matter. Every single sentence he wrote could have been improved upon. When reading his books I get a strong sense that he wrote single drafts that he never revisited after he pushed off for the rest of the day. There are points in Never Die Alone in which something happens ... and then the opposite thing happens in the next chapter. If Goines had an editor, then he or she wasn't a very good one. On the plus side, however, Goines's novels are raw and nihilistic in ways that very few books are, and that alone makes them worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,Mar 2008,"Feb 29, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38054.Never_Die_Alone

I like the basic concept of DMZ, and will probably continue to read more of it, even though I wasn't crazy about the first volume (which comprises the first five issues of the DC/Vertigo series).DMZ takes place in Manhattan in a near future in which Middle America (a.k.a. ""The Free States"") has declared war on the rest of the country (a.k.a. ""The United States of America"") and pushed east all the way through to New Jersey. Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island remain part of the U.S., while Manhattan (a.k.a. ""the DMZ"") is filled with American troops, ""insurgents,"" and civilians. This is potentially really interesting, but the writer, Brian Wood, gives the reader absolutely no background on this ""second civil war,"" or what led up to it. All we know is that it's been going on for about five years. While the idea may have been to leave the reader as much in the dark as the book's main character--callow photo intern Matty Roth--ultimately I found this really frustrating, and it only served to keep me at arm's length from the story. Also, since Wood's depiction of war is fairly grade-school (soldiers in the book actually use the term ""Sarge"") I wasn't convinced that this obfuscation was deliberate. Rather, I felt that Wood really didn't have any good conception of what his second civil war was about, but just used it as a convenient excuse to turn Manhattan into a war zone. (There are vague hints that the ""Free States"" are a collection of militias rebelling against the current doctrine of pre-emptive war, but the idea that homegrown militias would be able to take over the majority of the United States seems like pure hokum.)There are plenty of allusions in DMZ--to the current war in Iraq, to post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, to any number of ongoing bloody civil wars--but to what end? Wood doesn't seem to have much to say beyond the obvious: bombings kill and maim indiscriminately; war can strip people of their humanity; even during war humanity and goodness can sometimes prevail. This is all pretty basic stuff, and it would go down easier if the characters and situations were more interesting. The world he and artist Riccardo Burchielli have created looks great, but it's peopled with two-dimensional characters who spout sophomoric dialogue.

Sure, the titles are the same, and the movie was supposedly ""based on the novel by Brian Garfield,"" but trust me, they have nothing to do with each other. Not a single plot point from the novel found its way into the film. Not even the characters' names are the same.Brian Garfield wrote this after the film version of his novel Death Wish was released, and while it's not a novelization of Death Wish 2 or anything, at times it sort of feels that way. By which I mean, there is almost no reason for this book to exist, except that the novel Death Wish was adapted into a popular film, and Garfield clearly felt the need to capitalize on it. (Just to be clear, though, this book was published in 1975, years before any of the original film's sequels were released.)Death Wish the film ended with the main character moving to Chicago. The book did not. However, Garfield chose to pick up where the film left off by moving Paul Benjamin to Chicago. Right off the bat this is sort of strange, since a major theme in the first novel was Benjamin's love of New York, despite what it had become in the '70s, and his refusal to quit the city of his birth. Also, Death Sentence could really take place in any large city. Except for street names, a few buildings, and constant mentions of ""the Loop,"" there is nothing particularly ""Chicago"" about this tale, at least that I could discern. Also, one thing that I thought worked really well in Death Wish were all the minute, quotidian details of Benjamin's professional life as an accountant, especially since they contrasted so strongly with his nighttime hobby of killing junkies, thieves, and muggers with a .32 revolver. As juxtapositions go, it's nothing spectacular, but it worked, I thought. In Death Sentence, however, this aspect has been largely jettisoned.* For the most part, this book is concerned with Benjamin's activities as a vigilante, his growing romantic relationship with a female attorney who works for the D.A.'s office, and the possible existence of another vigilante on the streets of Chicago; someone who was inspired by Benjamin's ""crusade.""Death Sentence also features an aged professor of law named Harry Chisum, through whom Garfield frequently commits the unpardonable sin of authorial intrusion. Chisum has a lot to say about law and order, but most of his ideas are pretty half-baked and simplistic.In fact, the whole novel is pretty half-baked. It's OK to raise questions about crime that may have no answers, but doing so in the form of a pulp novel that has flat, uninteresting characters and plodding action is really just a big waste of time. After reading Death Wish and Death Sentence I really had no idea what Garfield was trying to say about crime, revenge, and vigilantism, and frankly, didn't really care.*One detail that the original film changed that I thought worked really well was Benjamin's/Kersey's profession; from C.P.A. to architect. The idea of someone who's intrinsically connected to the character of a city--especially one who designs the large public housing projects that often breed crime--taking his revenge on the populace of a city for their criminal acts is potentially really interesting. There are points in Death Sentence where it seems as if Garfield is hinting at this, particularly when he describes the architecture of the ghettoes in which Benjamin stalks his prey, but it never really comes to anything, since Benjamin is an accountant, as he was in the first novel....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 25, 2008","Jan 17, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1900072.Death_Sentence

This four-issue series totally blew me away. It got to the heart of everything I've always loved about Batman, while giving equal time to Commissioner Gordon (still a lieutenant in Year One). Gordon has always been one of my favorite supporting characters in Batman's world, and I think he rarely gets his due, so it was nice to read a story that focused almost as much on him as it did on Bruce Wayne. Frank Miller's storytelling is lean and mean, and avoids the excesses that he frequently indulges in, and never falls into the trap of rote, by-the-numbers plotting that so many origin stories do. The art, by David Mazzucchelli, is gritty and impressionistic without being deliberately abstract or confusing. (Mazzucchelli also wrote an afterword for this volume in the form of a comic strip that is one of the best and wittiest appreciations of Batman's history that I've ever read.)...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Dec 07, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59980.Batman

My maThere's a lot to like about Shogun, and it definitely held my interest throughout, but ultimately I didn't quite like it enough to recommend it. My main problem with it is the end; or rather, its lack of an ending. Given the situation, plot, and characters that James Clavell created over the course of the first 1150 pages, I think he really needed another 1000+ pages to wrap everything up satisfactorily. Instead, the climactic battle that everything in the book was leading up to--as well as the fates of all the major characters--are contemplated and foreseen in the mind of one character over the course of the final two pages, then the outcome of the battle and its 40,000 dead are described in a single paragraph, followed by the death of a major character in another single paragraph. Bang. The End. That's it.Shogun takes place in 1600, and its protagonist John Blackthorne, the English pilot of a Dutch trading ship, is inspired by William Adams, who was the first Englishman to reach Japan. While there, Adams advised the real-life Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and built Western-style sailing ships for him. Clavell's fictional version of Tokugawa is named Toranaga, and most of the novel is concerned with him jockeying for position in the midst of nationwide chaos and strife. Toranaga sees a potential gold mine in Blackthorne, who has knowledge of not only Western ocean vessels, but also Western methods of waging war, both on land and on sea.Clavell excels at plotting and character development, and most of the novel consists of scenes involving just two or three characters. There's a lot of political intrigue, betrayal, and subterfuge in Shogun, and most of it is moved forward by either conversation or internal monologue. Despite the book's length, it's rarely boring. The development of the main character from an unwashed European who sees the Japanese as fanatical, unfeeling, bloodthirsty savages to a samurai and hatamoto in the service of Toranaga who speaks halting Japanese and deeply respects their culture is handled well, and provides much of the book's interest. This is, however, just one more reason why I wished the book was twice as long. I wanted to continue to see Blackthorne's development; to see if he stayed in Japan or not, to see him possibly become fluent in the language, and to see his development continue.I know it's usually praise to say a book ""could be twice as long,"" but that type of praise usually comes in the form of ""I loved it, and I wished it would never end."" In the case of Shogun, however, I was looking forward to its end by at least page 1100, since I'm not crazy about books that are really, really long. I would gladly, however, have read another thousand pages, or maybe Shogun, Part II or whatever, just to have a sense of completion. Shogun is a book with a beginning, a very long middle, and a page and a half of epilogue. I think it's OK to leave things hanging in a novella or a short story, but with more than 1000 pages to tell a story, an author really needs to create a satisfying arc.

Download Sticks from [www.zbs.org] and you'll find out. It's an adaptation of Karl Edward Wagner's short story of the same name. This radio-play adaptation isn't very faithful to its source material (all the Cthulhu Mythos stuff has been jettisoned in favor of more traditional shocks), but that doesn't really matter, because the main reason to listen to this is for the phenomenally recorded three-dimensional sound, which--when listened to with headphones in the dark--will send chills up your spine like nothing else. This tape also contains two adaptations of stories by the Cherokee science fiction/horror writer Craig Strete. Both were pretty disturbing and strange.

Sir Seymour explains to Jack the coincidence of identical major scientific discoveries being made in two separate locations on the planet at the same time. This is known as the ""Ah-Ha!"" phenomenon. Sir Seymour's theory is that there is some outside power that allows humanity to make great leaps forward, and all he wants Jack to do is to travel to the forbidden City of Ah-Ha and steal one of the ah-has. Which one? Oh, only the grand unified field theory of matter and energy.Equipped with a dervish robe, Jack Flanders travels to the mountains of New Mexico like Carlos Castaneda in search of Don Juan, and with the help of the ""Indian"" mystic Chief Wampum (the joke is that he's really an Indian from India, not an American Indian), Jack travels to another dimension.The Ah-Ha Phenomenon doesn't contain the gorgeous, recorded-on-location soundscapes of Moon Over Morocco, and it's not as wild and all-over-the-place as The Fourth Tower of Inverness, but it's a lot of fun, and a great place to start if you'd like to discover the magic of the Jack Flanders adventures and only want to spend an hour....more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,not setnot set,Jan 1994not set,"Oct 01, 2007",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/1953426.The_Ah_Ha_Phenomena

The acting is hammy, the plot is all over the place (with very few plot threads ever actually being tied up or even explored for longer than five or 10 minutes), and often the whole thing just seems like a convenient forum for the producers to occasionally replay the recorded lectures of Ram Dass. Not to mention the fact that it was written by a crazy hippy who also plays the part of an Indian mystic with the worst fake Indian accent you will ever hear. But still, it really captured my imagination when I was 10 or 11 and first heard various episodes on NPR (my mom let me listen to it even though she hated it).

The writing in this volume is slightly better than it was in Body Count, but it’s still not great, and there are still bits of action that I find unconscionable in the context of supposedly realistic military fiction (like Capt. Gerber running between two of the enemy and then dropping to one knee so that they shoot each other), but in general the authors keep things relatively plausible.

This seems like sort of an odd choice, since Point of Impact and Dirty White Boys originally had nothing to do with each other, but in general Black Light works, though it didn't blow me away. The first half of the narrative is split between 1996 and 1955, as Swagger and a young writer work to uncover the truth behind the murder of Bob Lee's father, Earl Swagger, a state trooper who was supposedly murdered by a paroled convict named Jimmy Pye. (The aforementioned young writer, Russ Pewtie, is the son of Bud Pewtie, the state trooper from Dirty White Boys who hunted down and eventually killed the escaped convict Lamar Pye, Jimmy Pye's son). The second half focuses exclusively on the present day, as Bob Lee and Russ race to uncover a massive conspiracy while being hunted by a variety of trained killers.I enjoyed Black Light well enough, but I couldn't help feeling as if it was probably more fun for Hunter to write than it was for me to read.

H. Russell is polemical and extremely didactic, but worth reading, especially if you want to know whThis collection of studies and essays by Diana E. H. Russell is polemical and extremely didactic, but worth reading, especially if you want to know why radical feminists oppose pornography. My main problem with the book is that too much of the material is by Russell herself, even though she is probably the least interesting writer featured in it. Her chapters on causation, which form the centerpiece of the collection, are based on surveys she performed of studies that attempted to link pornography to rape. These sections are presented as incontrovertible evidence that the consumption of pornography is a major contributing factor to rape, but they rely too heavily on cherry-picked data and anecdotal evidence. Maybe it's just because I distrust sociology and find most of its applications to real-world problems misguided and utopian, but I find Andrea Dworkin's polemics much more compelling and convincing than Russell's soft pseudoscience, even though Dworkin relies on no ""data"" but her own fiery opinions.Proof of causation and media's relationship to violence and sexual assault is always going to be a contentious and sticky subject, so I can understand why Russell devoted so much space to attempting to prove her points. I still think, however, that she wasted an opportunity to include more writers in the collection. Some of the more interesting essays, like one about the depiction of black women's bodies in pornography by Patricia Hill Collins, are only a few pages long, and could have been greatly expanded.One thing I think this volume does very well, however, is poke holes in the theory that pornography is merely ""cathartic."" There's little question in my mind after reading this book that violent and misogynistic pornography degrades both the people involved in it and those who view it. The notion that it is a ""harmless outlet for male aggression"" is ludicrous. After all, does the idea of men watching videos of women being abused instead of doing it in real life really seem like the best possible solution to the problem of sexual violence?On the other hand, I found many of the conclusions drawn in the book depressingly literal. Two chapters by two different authors are devoted to Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, which both writers regard as misogynistic snuff pornography. While this may, on some level, be true, it never seems to occur to either of them that the novel may also be a critique and satire of materialism and male privilege.What I was ultimately reminded of while reading this book was the Women's Christian Temperance Union's opposition to alcohol, both in terms of its vehemence and its quixotic doggedness....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2007,"May 18, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/621320.Making_Violence_Sexy

I picked it up again last year and made it about two thirds of the way through. I picked it up again last month and finally finished it. I really loved this book, and I think it may be McCarthy's best (at least among the ones I've read--I still haven't read The Road or Suttree). I usually read his novels from beginning to end pretty quickly, but this one confounded me for awhile. I think the major reason it took me so long to get through Blood Meridian is its constant stomach-churning violence, including wholesale massacres, scalpings, infanticide, rape, dismemberment, and cannibalism. Major sections of this book are harder to read than UN reports on civil war and genocide. I'm not the only person to feel this way. Harold Bloom, who called Blood Meridian the strongest and most memorable novel by a living American writer, admitted that it took him several attempts to finish reading it on account of the violence. Not being Harold Bloom, however, I also found the density and weight of the book's prose hard to penetrate. I don't think it's overwritten or wordy, but it's extremely layered and demands very close attention. Anyway, now that I've finally read the whole thing, I'm really looking forward to reading it again someday. Despite the overwhelming violence, Blood Meridian is beautiful and surreal, and probably the best ""western"" ever written.

There are a lot of reasons why I hate it. I find Kerouac's attitude toward the world pathetically limited and paternalistic. In On the Road he actually muses about how much he wishes that he could have been born ""a Negro in the antebellum South,"" living a simple life free from worry, and does so seemingly without any sense of irony. On every page, the book is about how Kerouac (a young, white, middle-class, solipsistic alcoholic) feels, and nothing more. But that's only one reason I hate this book. The main reason I hate it is because, for me, reading Kerouac's prose is almost physically painful. I love the ramblings of self-centered drunks when they're self-deprecating, ironic, and/or funny, but Kerouac was none of these things. He was a pretentious, self-important bore who produced some of the most painfully bad and inconsequential prose of the 20th century.

While I didn't expect to agree with it, I expected to at least gain some kind of empathetic understanding of the author's point of view. It turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong. While I can understand why certain groups of people hate certain other groups of people, or why extremist groups entertain utopian fantasies of redrawn borders and wholesale deportation of everyone who's not exactly like them, after reading The Turner Diaries, I found myself scratching my head and wondering who, exactly, would ever read this book from cover to cover and feel that its worldview was one to which they'd like to subscribe. Its vision is so nihilistic, violent, and bleak that it borders on the cartoonish (it starts with killing blacks, Jews, and white ""race traitors"" in the streets, and ends with nuclear destruction of 75% of planet earth--which is depicted as a positive outcome). It depicts a world devoid of happiness and love, even for its white protagonists, who are emotionless robots. Not to mention the fact that the writing is ludicrously bad.
