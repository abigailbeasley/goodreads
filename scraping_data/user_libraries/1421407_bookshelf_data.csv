The unnamed prA very small, quiet book whose little fragments of relationship--unexpected moments of intimacy-gather power and create a subtle whole. The unnamed protagonist is a French to English translator at the High Court in The Hague, where she translates in cases of the most heinous violence, war crimes and ethnic cleansing--and captures the strange but resonant emotion of simultaneous translation, in which the translator comes to focus entirely on the words rather than the meaning of the whole. A useful but unnerving unconscious tool for divorcing the person from the momentousness of the subject matter, and, it is implied, the lens through which we view the world.She has been brought up, she tells us, in a number of different places, her parents frequently relocating--she has spent the most time in the United States and the voice is American, yet her mother lives in Singapore and in a Chinese restaurant in the Hague, a waitress speaks hopefully to her in Mandarin, is disappointed when she doesn't speak it. Her cosmopolitanism isn't held out as a virtue, in fact, we come to understand there's a yearning for place, for belonging, which is first expressed with a visit to her friend Jana, who has bought an apartment in a somewhat dangerous area of town, and is trying to convince her to move there as well. How owning an apartment--real estate--changes a person in some hidden but important way. She develops a relationship with a Dutch man whose wife has recently left him and moved to Lisbon--but is unsure about what it is, their intimacy is still tenuous... She moves along with him and with Jana too, in a system of clues. She is assigned to translate for a ""former president"" accused of horrific violence--and questions the resulting sense of intimacy as she's whispering in his ear the testimony of his crimes. An antique bookseller is assaulted in Jana's neighborhood and she develops an obsession with the case, that he cannot remember anything about it, and eventually meets him--but each 'relationship' is highly tenuous, based more on interiority than on communication with the other. The quietude and interiority reminds me of Brookner's novels--very European and implicit... It's a two day read at most, but so subtle... now that I've finished I want to immediately go back through it and reassess what I've read. It ends with a nod to Joyce, which made me laugh, because I can't imagine anything less Joycean--passionate and maximalist and word drunk and overt--than this novel. Maybe it's the character's decision to accept a relationship and a place that allows this nod. I can't imagine it's accidental....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 05, 2024","Apr 06, 2024","Apr 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55918474-intimacies

Its primary interest for me was the contrast between the tone of the writing--clinical, a completely rational non-romantic observation of the delirium of her passion. It seems to be written almost out of puzzlement, an examination of mundane details of such a romantic obsession--Ernaux is like a scientist of her own emotions. It was a wonderful reminder of that most evanescent of powerful feelings--sexual obsession, so easily forgotten once it's over. The waiting. The impatience with everything that is not the lover. The choosing of just what clothing to wear. The games one plays with fate--if so and so happens, then he will call. The treasured objects he handled--the bathrobe, a glass she didn't wash. The overpowering awareness that the lover, except for their physicality, is a complete stranger. The nature of time when one is in that kind of rapturous, anxious state.

This is probably the third time I've read On the Road--I had to send the audiobook back to the library--now waiting for renewal... so 'interrupted.'  This is probably the third time I've read On the Road--and each time, it's been a completely different book.The first time I read it as a young teenager completely infatuated with the freedom and the footloose life of Sal Paradise and his friends, the click of it, the tight circle of friends, the landscapes, as I yearned to be so free and syncopated, learning how to catch rides on freight trains and let myself be swept along by a good-looking madman like Dean Moriarty--the roaring trips across America, living the beat life--though feeling even then somewhat uneasy with the faceless women of the book, I was more enamored than analytical about it. It was the glorious theme of the times and one didn't dig too deeply into it. I was going to live in a book like this, a life like this, in my own way.The second time I was in my twenties, a college girl, hyperaware of its disregard for its women and its blindness to women's exclusion from such freedom in the world. Sure, I knew women who had gone on the road like Kerouac and crew, but their willingness to endure sexual depredations and occasional violence as a matter of course was beyond my tolerance level. It just made me sad to read about the boys' grand adventures when the only women were ""somebody's girlfriend"" ""the gorgeous girls of so and so"" and mostly dumped and lied to or used for financial support. It got in the way of my love--because, having been out in the world a bit, I knew there was no place in that adventure for me.Now that I am many years older than anybody in the book--older than Kerouac ever got to be--I am so enjoying it. I'm still nobody in it, but it's easy to accept now, and just enjoy the book as I would enjoy any window into a distant culture--and especially reveling in Kerouac's rolling prose. Having it read aloud reinforces the great sound of it. The guy was not ironic, he was not a hater, he embraced everyone and everything, and the book has a specific music which anybody who loves American prose written to an American beat will find contagiously great. He was known as the Great Memory, and any writer would envy the texture and detail he captured. I've also been reading around in The Dharma Bums once the library snatched my On the Road away, and it's not nearly the fun of On The Road--because the former is fueled--literally driven--by Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassidy) and there's a beat to it, a musical beat. Dharma Bums I like for the nature writing, also Big Sur, nobody writes a landscape that's more alive than Kerouac. But the embrace and fun and friendships of On The Road are still alive, free of the ponderous and barely digested Buddhism of Dharma Bums--though you have to grit your teeth once in a while, like finding little stones in your rice, at the occasional retrograde viewpoint or language. Worth it worth it worth it. Reading On the Road alongside Jack's Book, an Oral Biography by Barry Gifford, added to my enjoyment, to understand the actual events behind the novelized memoir which is Kerouac's grand project, as well as learn more specifically about the writer's artistic development....more",Notes are private!,10,23,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Apr 05, 2024","Mar 12, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70401.On_the_Road

A series of short essays, just 46 pageThis charming little book came to me as a gift from a friend, a rare book collector, who knew I would adore it. A series of short essays, just 46 pages in all, plus photographs by Nico Jesse, illustrating the very people and places mentioned in the essays--exploring the lives, work and opinions of the modern Parisienne circa 1958 (as opposed to the mythic ""La Parisienne"" of the 19th Century, made famous in literature and drama by the likes of Balzac et al). It opens like this: ""Women of Paris: not La Parisienne The two things are by no means the same.The Parisienne was a myth, an idea, an essence. The women of Paris exist, diverse, individual and picturesque. The writers invented the Parisienne... For Henri Becque... she represented the feminine element in a menage a trois... For Balzac, she mingled an air of candor with an enchanting falsity."" The focus on the difference between the provincial and the exquisite, sophisticated Parisienne. But the Parisienne of 1958 comes from anywhere, it's her presence in the city that changes her. And Maurois wants to know and describe the real women of Paris he sees every day. The contemporary reader might smile a bit at the hubris of a man saying, ""she is--"" but he does interview the women, he is actually interested in learning who they are rather than making assumptions about them, and that respect and genuine curiosity is what marks this little book.I was reading The Years by Annie Ernaux when I received this, and the bleed of that time period was perfect. I started listening to Juliette Greco and absorbing the unique flavor of those times in Paris, the postwar poverty still in evidence, women themselves seeking to define themselves in society, their relationship to work, to marriage and family.The fact that the book is divided by profession is an interesting one, because it portrays the women, married and single, as very much living in the outer world. Its divisions tell you much about Maurois' interests and perception of the city's character: StudentsArtists and modelsFashion and its acolytes (a terrific section on 'Bettina' who works as a PR woman for one of the fashion houses--not the romance of fashion but fashion as workplace)The women of the market--working class women selling their goods, from butchers in Les Halles to florists... such a sense of the citySaint-Germain-des-Pres ""the existentialist cellars"" and the rise of Juliette GrecoThe concierges of Paris--my favorite section. The women who keep an eye on everything that goes on in the building, like one-women Greek Choruses.Paris ballerina, and other dancersThe Comedie Francais--originally the only stages where actual women could act.Working Women--including secretaries, typists and factory workers.The thing I noticed most, in all categories, is the pragmatism of the 1958 Parisienne. Kind of shocking to read about young women especially, at an age when one would expect a romantic approach to life, explaining how much things cost, evaluating a marriage prospect based on the man's earnings. Perhaps because of the hardships of war, the bare realities of life are taken straight on. How brave these women seem, to look life straight in the eye and say, if that's how the world is, then that's the world I'm dealing with....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 05, 2024","Apr 06, 2024","Feb 05, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/86196073-women-of-paris
