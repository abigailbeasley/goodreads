This is a time compressed family drama where you are drawn into a tight family circle and then, with great dismay, watch it shatter. Each sister has the strength to make choices that will help them to live the life they choose but the repercussions for themselves and the rest of the family ultimately become unbearable - they are family and need each other. It was also difficult to watch William’s actions as it seemed almost destined to create the same childhood trauma that he experienced. The ripple effect of individual decisions, outward and downward (generationally) has a devastating effect on every family member, and these events propel you through this novel.I liked the multiple viewpoints around which this novel was structured.

Baumgartner is in his early 70’s and has realised that he will probably never have another long term relationship and that while he grieved for his wife (who died unexpectedly early) he has not seized the opportunity to honour her memory. This realisation spurs him to make changes in his life and reflect on the depth of this relationship from its inception. A slow paced, quiet story but a lovely one....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 30, 2024","Feb 04, 2024","Jan 30, 2024",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/201927426-baumgartner

This is a thought provoking debut and Yu has really delved into what it means to be a second generation immigrant, to belong and not to belong to a country you have been born and raised in. Her character is also trying to understand how she fits into a literary world that is predominantly white and how we can view writers that came before us without cancelling everything that doesn’t fit our contemporary sensibility. While these are serious subjects there is also humour in how she exposes and explores her attempts to understand herself and the actions of others.I lived in Malaysia for a couple of years in my early 30’s and I have a deep affection for it.

ColeWhile this is a novel it often felt like nonfiction because it is so heavily blended with facts about art, history, music, literature and cinema. Cole is making a point that many of the ‘things’ we revere in our museums, galleries and theatres represent the cost of colonialism, war and theft. Reminders are everywhere and while there is some acknowledgment and reparations much more needs to be done.There were some powerful quotes in this book and a long list of paintings, movies, literature and music to check out. I needed (Wanted) to keep a list. I have not been to any of the galleries referred to and was unfamiliar with much of what was mentioned. About two thirds of the way through there is a chapter of polyphonic voiced vignettes of people who live, or have lived, part of their lives in Lagos. At first I was confused about what was going to happen but began to feel I had arrived in a busy unknown city, wondering what everyone was doing and how they lived. There are also switches between first and second person that cleverly draw the reader into the story.This is definitely not a book for anyone that is looking for a straightforward plot driven story. It is extremely thought provoking and meditative, the writing is considered and beautiful.“He wants to take in what is useful from the world not in order to plunder it but in order to live.”“But when a man’s existential satisfaction depends on not knowing something he very much will find a way to not know it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Dec 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/91937531-tremor

Like rays of light he bounces off things in dark spaces, illuminating moments, events and people. Sometimes the light only creates shadows so he describes what is in that darkness, or imagines it through the use of historical text (relying on other narrators). Using the indigenous idea of a fourth time dimension (he acknowledges this in his text) he pulls and tugs on the past, present and future and creates a story that weaves in and out of his life. This must have taken a great deal of courage to write, it simultaneously acknowledges the smallness and greatness of each human life. How lucky we are and how we should find moments to be grateful.

For me the connection between characters, the way they spoke and acted toward each other, did not feel realistic or just lacked subtlety. For example, Zoe’s initial reaction to Sophie felt overly dramatic ,particularly in the way she discussed her with Nick. Also, a number of characters (who were extremely interesting) - Melanie, Travis, Zoe’s children, McAlester’s daughter, the Reverend- seemed to be important but were then dropped from the story without resolution.

Nell’s growing understanding of her grandfathers treatment of women and the confusion of the public perception of him, placed on a literary pedestal, also felt real.

As she reminisces about her own miscalculations in life she also perceives her own mother’s life through the mirage that is childhood, making her mother appear saintly and courageous. We are vaguely made aware that the cloistered women in this story have retreated (or found cause) because they have found themselves lacking in someway or they prefer to not deal with life beyond an essential existence.The mouse plague creates the perfect atmosphere of dread and collapse in our environment, that is unfortunately a real phenomenon.

Collis clearly depicts the humanity, suffering and the strength of family relationships that underpin his life and ultimately lead to an unexpected conclusion....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 04, 2023","Jul 09, 2023","Jul 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36377599-dancing-home

This series of essays explores hKim take you on a fascinating wander through the spectacular Australian outback where she has spent much of her life. This series of essays explores how her experience of the land, the people who inhabit it and those who attempt to provide services, management and governance within it have shaped it. We glimpse into her thinking on why white an black people have struggled to shape a relationship that can effectively balance managing themselves and this delicate ecosystem. As Kim says this balance is fraught with problems of guilt, misunderstanding, miscommunication, family obligation and isolation. “It’s here that I have been inducted into the rigours of two-way thinking, and taught how to let contradictions play through each other instead of trying to resolve them. …. I have learnt that too rigorous an attachment to outcomes disenfranchises the Aboriginal participants, and that the most important discoveries are often the things you aren’t looking for. I have learnt that serendipity is essential to success of a project, and that knowing how to leave space for serendipity is a skill that can only be learned through long experience.” Her primary employment (interest?) is in “imaginative mapping “ of indigenous lands. Working with local Aboriginal people she collates and maps information on plant and animal resources, bush medicine, country types, water resources and any cultural information that the local people wish to include. She maps local language and knowledge in a way that is helping to preserve connection and maintain knowledge.These essays are a glimpse into a life lived walking a delicate balance observing and participating in a place and culture that continues to be poorly understood but much discussed and judged.

A story is always about the particular events that a narratorI particularly liked the structure of this book, the way the major plot events unfolded. A story is always about the particular events that a narrator or protagonist reveals and this is what we then use to base our emotions and understanding. As an author, like our narrator (Lucie) or a film producer/director (like her deceased husband Patrick) they choose to only reveal particular details about themselves. In the first half of this story we begin with the terrible accident and then Lucie flashes us back and forth in time sharing her current trauma, her childhood and the love story that she shared with her husband. There is a discomforting buildup of concern during the first half, the reader knows there is another version of this story. The second half of the book reveals this and dread and confusion lurk in each unfolding moment. Patrick and Lucie are interesting and complex- not fully good or bad - problematic. Occasionally our narrator (author) got a bit long winded in explaining something- I think this could have happened less. I was also not sure that all the events revealed in the story were necessary or added to the plot. While the trip to Australia could have been crucial for revealing the narrator’s past, reconnecting with her family or providing future support it felt quite isolated from the rest of the story.

I guess it’s post pandemic enough for me to fully appreciate this novel. I was fascinated by the way this weaved the story of Neffy’s relationship with an octopus - using journal entries and ‘revisits’ into past memories. The octopuses human ‘like’ qualities were cleverly worked into this story and worked well to exam the idea of what it means to capture and cage a sentient being. Under what circumstances can a person experience similar trauma ? I also liked the exploration of the lengths that people will go to for others but simultaneously how selfish they can be. Definitely a lot to think about.

While it is autobiographical it does not require any prior knowledge or really any particular interest in the writer. It captures a life, that like many, (including my own) comes from a very middle class, ordinary background and yet somehow she turns this into a fleshed out book via a collection of images. I like how she doesn’t remember every detail of the photo and sometimes she can’t recall the people but yet she does retain a sense of the time and place around these moments.

The narrator, who is interpreting the words written by the enchantress, has a wry sense of humour as each generation ultimately meets its demise.

This story presents a thoughtful glimpse at the lives of mixed racial children, victims of the Vietnam War and its aftermath. I believe this book blends a number of situations based on some real life stories the author has encountered. The stories are complex in that while many of these children were loved by at least one parent they were often abandoned. The attempts to reunite these children with their families has become more accessible over the years with increasing technology like DNA testing. While this provides hope for some it also presents many difficulties including complex trauma, unobtainable expectations and grief.Perhaps writing this as a novel has meant that some of these experiences have had to be simplified (and there are very unlikely coincidences) in order to create a narrative arc but overall it is a successful and enlightening story....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 22, 2023","Apr 27, 2023","Feb 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/128150641-dust-child

One of those books where you keep thinking you can see where it’s going and what’s happening but it’s like you’re walking through fog getting glimpses of something that are surely trees but turn out to be shadows. There are also evocative descriptions and imagery that create a powerful sense of place and tip into the realm of speculative fiction. Sometimes not knowing exactly what is happening in a plot can be annoying but Serpell uses this as a powerful narrative crafting tool to hone in on the premise of the story - a child is presumed dead but the body is missing. Serpell has thrown the reader into the same situation as the characters— what is really happening? , is memory reliable? , how do you move on when you have no closure? The change in narrator, later in the story, throws the reader again. The voice of Wayne is texturally so different and his story is compelling. At this stage I was just hoping to not have some fantastical Hollywood ending to the story. Thankfully it does not.Imagining how people live on with missing family is such a compelling premise and this novel explores many of the possible traumatic implications.

Ultimately we are not that different (our trajectory- like a meteor remains similar) and chance events and pure luck see us live out our lives with the gradual dwindling of family and friends.

A short emotive examination of how we hold, warp and intensify the memory of different events during our lives. How do those events, however terrible, solidify and make us become the people we are? Ernaux revisits and probes one particular period of her life (the transition from child to adult) and attempts to understand how this reverberated through her life. Even awful memories can end up having positive impacts and sometimes our brain can hide the full extent of a traumatic event.

A story that focuses on the forced occupation of indigenous land and its consequences for Aboriginal people (in particular) around Gundagai and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. The story begins with the flood of Gundagai and the heroic actions of the indigenous men who risked their lives to rescue white settlers -this is based on true events - and was the part I was most interested in. The lack of recognition and appreciation is astonishing but not surprising given how the indigenous people were treated at this time.The themes of connection with land and family in this novel only focuses on a few characters and I felt many remained unchanged by the events of this novel and showed no evolution through the story - both by the settlers and the indigenous. While I understand the ‘fixed’ mindset of many settlers, particularly with regards to the treatment of Aboriginal people, this meant there was really no unexpected events or development in the plot. This story is interesting for those that don’t know much about the way white settlement occupied and forced traditional owners from their land and Heiss does a lovely job of including indigenous language in her novel.

A book set at the end of WWI, during the influenza epidemic and in a Northern Ireland hospital- specifically a maternity ward for influenza3.5 stars. A book set at the end of WWI, during the influenza epidemic and in a Northern Ireland hospital- specifically a maternity ward for influenza patients is, as one would expect, a very sad story. This is a 1st person narrative viewed by a nurse working in this ward. At the beginning I did not particularly enjoy the detailed descriptions of equipment, procedures and work/living conditions. It felt like I was just getting a history lesson- and an unpleasant lesson it is. Gradually as I listened to the story (a well narrated audio book) I overcame this and began to think that maybe this slightly clinical detachment might be the only way to survive the horrific loss of life from influenza and childbirth (a compounded disaster).Then throw in the abuse from the church and shell shocked war veterans and remaining at arms length was definitely a benefit. There is still a very real feeling of empathy that the reader develops for the narrator and a number of significant characters so overall I finished with the feeling that while I had been fed a lot of facts I had also absorbed a sense of place and time dosed with some compassion and kindness for those that struggled against church and State in the hope of a better future....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 23, 2022","Oct 28, 2022","Oct 23, 2022",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/52853976-the-pull-of-the-stars

It is many, many years since I read David Copperfield so I was not caught up in any sort of comparison which, I felt, made me able to be fully invested in this novel.The depth and breadth of her characters is rich and I think she provides a valuable glimpse into a place that has been derided, neglected and ridiculed. Her story is more empathetic than sympathetic which I think allows the reader to understand how people can end up in tragic circumstances rather than just feeling sorry for them.As a coming of age novel I felt I was comparing this more with Shuggie Bain (than David Copperfield) and for this reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 4. I think Shuggie Bain added touches of humour that made that story slightly easier to engage with, especially when you know that there is going to be so much darkness. It is also overly long and does feel a bit repetitive in terms of themes and end events.As for the creators and distributors of addictive prescription medications I hope they are eventually called to account.

It is definitely a slow searing novel that dealt with issues that were probably extremely difficult to voice at the time when it was written. Domestic violence, alcoholism, patriarchy and religious and social responsibility make for a grim and bleak story.

McEwan cleverly lulls us with the familiarity of world events but then overlays a life that feels discombobulated. If this was a story about a woman it would possibly evoke quite different emotions- grooming a child for sex and desertion of spouse and child are all too familiar themes for women characters. I like how this made me think about how people might respond. Roland certainly suffered enormously and the repercussions were lifelong but what would be the implications of different choices and what (and who) might he have missed.“When he asked himself if he wished none of it had happened he did not have a ready answer. That was the nature of harm.”This quote had me thinking about cancel culture…“The larger subject was the ruthlessness of artists. Do we forgive or ignore their single-mindedness or cruelty in the service of their art? And are we more tolerant the greater the art?”I also felt that a lifetime of writing has allowed McEwan to experience every possible reaction and  to his work and perhaps this was his opportunity to respond. (I know it’s fiction- there’s a lot about that too!)“Also, when a writer has been around long enough people begin to get tired. Even if she does something different every time. They say, she’s doing something different again!”This is a thought provoking novel that asks questions and explores how and why people make choices which are as varied as the individual circumstances of each person’s life.

I didn’t however feel that I really understood why they were all so enamoured with Julian , their professor. While Richard does repeatedly mention this fascination I didn’t really see it in the actions or descriptions of their relationships. Julian felt more like a fuzzy unknown character.

The first half was a powerful, emotional imagining of growing up in a tumultuous occupied Africa. Two storylines are used to trace a young orphaned man called Hamza who voluntarily joins the Germans as a schutztruppe (local soldier). Clearly they were just trained as fodder for war and were treated ruthlessly by their German officers. Hamza quickly realises his error. This was a fascinating (awful and violent) part of the book. The second storyline originally traces another young man, Ilyas, but quickly moves onto a story about his sister, Afiys. Afiya is orphaned and treated badly until her brother locates her and takes her to safety. The second half of the book brings these two storylines together but just didn’t have the same impact. Through years of war and occupation and subsequent and resulting) financial impacts the peoples lives ebb and flow between poverty and some comfort. The end of the novel felt more like a summary than an immersion in this period. Maybe the book actually needed another 100 pages or the first half needed to be edited to something shorter....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 22, 2022","Apr 28, 2022","Apr 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52744975-afterlives

The esoteric nature of this book nearly made me lose faith that I would understand what was (and had happened ) to Vera. The last 1/3 of the novel was brilliant- Vera’s story and the unimaginable choice she felt compelled to make, followed by her guilt that this secret was so destructive she couldn’t tell Nina.

It is a visceral cacophony and assault on all the senses. This novel spans genres, time, settings and POV in an elaborate sinewy way. Like the reoccurring vipers (a note of caution for people with a phobia of snakes) the story twists in and around on itself in ever decreasing circles (there’s a reticulated python analogy for you too!).Kupersmith brings Vietnam into sharp focus. Her descriptions of historical events and locations are recreated through smell, taste and sound in a way that was totally immersive. I could vividly remember visiting some of these places despite it being more than 25 years since I visited Vietnam.Examining generational trauma, coercion, corruption, racism, abuse,colonisation (and nearly every vileness you can imagine) the author seeks to create a story that imagines how a person can reinvent themselves in a new body. It’s a lot to deal with and the magical realism allows the revenge to be palatable in what would otherwise be a depressing and (unfortunately) familiar story.The style of this book reminds me a lot of The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki - that may give you some indication of what it is like.

I enjoyed the settings in this novel, particularly descriptions of Ile de Clair, what a magical sounding place. This story has a very complex plot that relies heavily on coincidences and this may have ultimately resulted in compromises in other areas. The vocabulary felt contrived and artificial and the reveals where a bit forced. Ultimately it was enjoyable to imagine the idyllic island but in no way did this feel like a possible scenario. The characters were interesting but did not respond to events in a way that felt realistic.

I’ve never read a Thomas Mann novel and yet I was glued to the page. This is a family that pushed the boundaries in so many directions.While the character of Mann talks about how he writes long convoluted sentences that hint and suggest Toibin writes with a style that conveys atmosphere and meaning with smooth easy to read narration. This is not to say this is simplistic, there is thoughtful analysis of the complex situation Mann was placed in - his heritage and love of German art, music and culture versus his despair at the blind acceptance of Hitler and his regime of terror. Mann often seemed to be caught in situations where he would be condemned regardless of his actions.

The complexity of how families dealt with (or actually didn’t) being on different sides of such a divisive topic was something that had not occurred to me. I was also surprised at how much racism and pro-slavery sentiment existed in the Union States - this probably explains (to me) a lot more about why progress for equality has been so slow.I have just read this novel back to back with Horse by Geraldine Brooks. I think Brooks managed to deal with racism and slavery (plus more) in a more successful and succinct manner. I felt Booth could have been pruned a little more without compromising this wonderful story. I think it was successful to portray the family from the point-of-view of the sisters as they were depicted as being more attached to family than the political issues and were both more constant and reliable witnesses of the events. Also there is probably less factual information about either of them which allowed Fowler freedom to explore their lives using fiction.I can’t see this as a Booker winner but it was certainly a worthwhile read....more,Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 17, 2022","Aug 29, 2022","Oct 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58451307-booth

The first third, about Emma, seemed like a small but desperately sad (and not unfamiliar in novels) domestic drama. In the middle third Doyle turns a sweeping lens on the characters around Emma and using a before and after narration technique we begin to see a darker story emerge. The final third again changes focus, looking at bigger world issues and how they impact upon the characters (and us all). In the closing stages we are drawn back to the heart of the matter. What can never be undone and the question of how to go on is all that remains.

There is also a lot of humour in these stories ( I laughed allowed at the names of streets and people), however the story of Lyle does take a very dark turn. This dark turn made me think of Richard Flanagan’s novel, The Living Sea of Waking Dreams. The themes of racism, colour and religion are explored in the past and a potential future. As Lyle and his wife, Chanel, suggest should immigrants obliterate their past in order to assimilate? What are the dangers? Ultimately I felt bot Lyle’s and Lily’s stories presented many questions about identity and the importance it plays in accepting and understanding who we are.

This novel provides a unique perspective of Germany during the rise of the Nazi party. Living as a banned writer in Germany must have been a nerve wracking existence if you chose to continue criticism of the regime. This novel is written in a style that captures both the frenetic and increasingly absurd behaviour of those who try to elevate their political position and those who try to hide information that will cause them difficulties. The writing is darkly humorous but also conveys a serious dose of fear.

While there are small moments of happiness it is overwhelming sad. It is a powerful examination of trauma, domestic violence and dementia. The magical realism style works successfully to make this readable and my only criticism is that the multiple narrators (even though they are one person) means that there is quite a bit of repetition of events that slows the plot considerably in the first half of the novel.

Ultimately it does end with hope and possibility for repair of Cyprus and its people. This type of internal war must be so devastating- imagine war with your neighbours, colleagues, friends. This story also strongly reminds us of the inter generational impact that follows unspeakable events. The use of the fig tree as a narrator provides opportunity to act as a witness for events and crimes that would otherwise be unresolved.

Richard Powers skilfully dives deeply into the human condition and our desire for answers and labels - I didn’t disappoint him :) As a species we feel the need to understand everything, and in this novel the inner mind proves as unknowable as the outer reaches of the universe. Meanwhile our home planet is on a trajectory that requires immediate attention and Robin (our narrator, Theo’s son) is desperate to bring this to the forefront of public attention. At first Power’s leads you to assume (well I felt he did) that Robin is neuro diverse ( ...has autism, on the spectrum? ) and a simple conclusion, that his father refuses to accept, would be to medicate him. Slowly it becomes apparent that his behaviour is not quite so simple and also reflects serious trauma.Is the treatment that Theo chooses to pursue more ethical? I loved the planets that Theo imagines for his son. They are as diverse as the human race and again a question... how do we judge the success or value of life on another planet OR another human?

Through KrishThis novel is a metaphysical journey that coincides with Krishan’s physical train trip to attend the funeral of his grandmother’s carer. Through Krishan’s thoughts and memories Arudpragasam explores the inaccessibility of human minds with particular focus on the impact of trauma and ageing on a persons ability to live with and within their own mind.“…but people also carried deeper, more clandestine trajectories inside their bodies, their origins often unknown or accidental, their modes of operation invisible to the eye, trajectories which were sometimes strong enough to push people in certain directions despite everything that took place on the surface of their lives.”The writing toward the beginning of this novel, when Krishan describes his grandmothers deterioration as she ages and her desperate struggle to maintain dignity and autonomy, felt so real and accurate. It is difficult/sad to watch and live with ageing family members and this was captured perfectly.Another recurring theme was the importance of our eyes; the window to our souls, the sights once seen that cannot be erased and the awful scene of eye gouging and blinding.

Imagine having an adult child that has committed a serious crime. What is your responsibility, guilt or reaction? Lohrey examines this trauma with delicate and thoughtful care. Erica is struggling to maintain her present because she can’t see what the future will hold for her and her son. She seems completely undone by his actions.The other characters similarly seem to be living with past trauma. Erica’s labyrinth is a tangible anchor to the earth and the present for all of them.This book gives you an odd feeling of familiarity while simultaneously you are struck by what you don’t know. The setting is very Australian...coastal...near Sydney... but the exact location feels deliberately unknowable and disorientating. The characters are living in the present but there are glimpses of their past that leave you wanting more.In some respects this reminded me of The Museum of Modern Love by Heather Rose.

Her ability to describe events and people with humour, and her use of unconventional metaphors and similes keeps you entertained - it is the way she writes as much as the events themselves that propel the narrative. I must say, it may not have been such a rollicking story if it did not include so much alcohol so probably a good thing they are Catholics!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 17, 2021","May 24, 2021","Apr 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32861287-priestdaddy

In comes a catholic priest, Father David, who is an outsider and facing his own crisis about his life choices - you can feel that his world is about to implode. Despite his unacceptable actions and his somewhat pompous behaviour I still felt some empathy for him because he was able to acknowledge his wrongs.

The descriptions of the lighthouse, ocean and the light keepers that live in these Isolated inhospitable locations is beautifully imagined. I also felt the changing perspectives and point-of-views for each character were collated in a clever and varied way that helped to immerse the reader in this story. The choice to only include one side of many of the conversations was superb as it felt like this story was circling those people directly involved in the disappearance of the three men.

Sometimes I find it difficult to begin audio books with multiple timelines and characters and this was no exception… perhaps one of the plot lines about the longevity and preservation of physical texts should have forewarned me!

Eventually, as the timelines progress, the payoff to understand the connections between characters commenced and this was probably what spurred me to not give up.

Their ability to accept absence of evidence as evidence of absence. “This book explores the infinite capacity of the human brain to embrace, manipulate and mould beliefs and ideas. When people have a sense of purpose and justification for their beliefs this helps them to make sense of the world. Every person needs to believe in something in order to rationalise the world around them. Sometimes this means people move to a place where their beliefs transition from providing ‘safety’ (as described by James Baldwin) , familiarity, comfort and sanity to a place of control, isolation and narrow mindedness.Krasnostein thoughtfully meanders through a number of lives examining how people arrive at their beliefs, why they choose to hold them and the impact this has on them as individuals and a community.The choice of Krasnostien’s subjects may have been influenced by her own living arrangements (that sounds a bit weird- I mean living in Australia and USA) but she has still managed to cover a broad range of topics that are melded together in an interesting and accessible way....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 05, 2021","Apr 13, 2021","Apr 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55668659-the-believer

This book covered a lot of ground and many issues which I think may have been detrimental to my overall enjoyment. There were characters and events I wanted to know more about (like Paddy’s grandfather) and details that really didn’t add value for me (like learning about Ragner’s life and family.) While Paddy became an increasingly unlikable and weak character I actually saw this as good writing because it was provoking an emotion in the reader. I think Evie was the less interesting character as she didn’t really change or develop in a convincing way - she just kind of petered out.There was some lovely descriptions of scenery but on occasion the descriptions of the relationship between Evie and Paddy felt a bit overdone and saccharine. I mostly enjoyed the descriptions of how Canberra was constructed and grew through its architecture and landscape.

Woollett has really challenged the reader by creating an extremely problematic and mostly unlikeable victim (yes ... the world is not black and white so that’s skilful) and while I would not victim blame she is also a persecutor of other characters in this story. This book should possibly also come with some warnings as it contains rape, incest, eating disorders and self harm. I also have my reservations about basing this on a real story given the unpleasant portrayal of the numerous characters who perpetuate domestic violence in a small community. This doesn’t have the benefit of geographical or generational distance of Beautiful Revolutionary (her previous novel).

Her summer is fuelled by a seemingly self destructive tendency despite her own awareness of the cost of her behaviour. Watts looks back into the past through explorers like Oxley - have we always sought what is imagined - like an inland sea? Through a hot Sydney summer, where there is a sense of foreboding, climate change sparks an increased threat of fires and alcohol fuels violence. The abduction and murder that Watts repeatedly refers to was an event that shocked and caught national media attention in Australia and drove home the fear that we are all vulnerable to such violence.

I loved the description of gossamer spiders webs that are netted across Evie’s yard and can only be seen in a certain light.

The characters in this novel are holed up in a ‘past it’s best’ holiday park on the edge of a Scottish loch and it’s pouring with rain - this is their summer holiday, and there is not much to do. Stuck inside in small technology free cabins the atmosphere is at times tense but mostly miserable. Individually the characters are despairing, angry, unsure and lonely. There are some funny moments in this book as minds wander, it all felt very real.

Maria the 4th daughter of a local widow is ‘given’ to another woman, Bonaria, to raise. She still lives in the same community as her birth mother and three older sisters (she’s the discard) and is expected to just accept this situation. They refer to these children (because apparently this is not an uncommon practice) as a ‘child of the soul’. This however is not the central controversial theme.

Also I really didn’t like Hadley but assumed she was going to provide some profound impact to the plot which justify her behaviour and presence and in the end I found her contribution a bit underwhelming.I can appreciate that many people will be happy just to go along with this epic portrayal but it didn’t quite gel for me....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 29, 2022","Jun 14, 2022","Dec 31, 2020",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/60010808-great-circle

I found this a really disturbing read and I don’t think it needed to make me feel uncomfortable in the way it did to achieve a conversation about abuse. The first half of the book, about Lawrence’s childhood, was powerful and engaging. Lawrence, as the first person narrator and protagonist, allowed me to develop a sense of who he was and what a thoughtful young person he was becoming. While he suffered horrific abuse the writing still drew me in and I felt it would be a powerful book. Unfortunately the second half of the book seemed to circle and repeat endlessly while not moving forward. While I understand that this trauma would have lifetime implications I didn’t think this would include him showing no intellectual growth (he was extremely bright). I accepted his choice for isolation and the physical changes that occurred to him. However despite being inside his head and thoughts his internal monologue revealed little. I also didn’t find the theme of art engaging. I just felt like I was reading an endless list of artists and their artwork without really understanding their connection to Lawrence or the moment he was mentioning them. The trajectory of Lawrence’s life took on such a disturbing path in the second half of the novel and his choices for pursuing secrecy with other young people repulsed me which also meant I lost all empathy for his character. While I accept that stories do not need a happy resolution this felt soulless.. The best moment in this novel was when the brothers climbed the mountain. The descriptions were lovely and the rising tension was crystal clear at this moment. By the way can anyone explain why he ended up hating his brother so much?I’m sorry for the harsh  because I really liked Laguna’s previous novels...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 27, 2021","May 03, 2021","Nov 18, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54269635-infinite-splendours

As Mili and her family attempt to make do and compromise they are continually thwarted by an agenda to drive them out. This is a very sad book with small moments of happiness. Simpson has created an image of a town that will smother every opportunity for happiness with bigotry, racism and lies. Sadly, It felt very real.You can feel the earth (or that crocodile like creature that lives within it) rising up to fight back. It reminded me of the character of Dead Papa Toothwort from Max Porter’s book, Lanny. The trajectory of Paddy’s life seems doomed despite the love of his family. The characters of this novel, both good and bad, are well written and Simpson has captured small nuances that bring them to life. I loved the images of departed loved ones looking down on their family and working together to support them from afar. It showed the connections that exist across generation and place.My only small criticism is that the mayor becomes the representation of evil in Darnmoor. This feel like an overused trope.

A history that pits her British ancestors, as beneficiaries of imperial theft and privileges, against her black Jamaican ancestors. She weaves a tale that is confronting in examining the cost of white privilege and how it became ingrained in every facet of British life, even for those who themselves struggled with a life of poverty.It is also her reckoning with a difficult family life and childhood and the prejudices placed on her parent’s marriage. As a ‘brown’ child stigma and pressures were placed on herself and her mother while her father faced continual resistance in his attempts to achieve recognition of his place in British society ( as a war veteran and citizen) and employment commensurate with his ability. “ From the depths of her melancholia my mother would summon Beatrice (-her mother) into her kitchen as if recruiting an ally in her battle to forge a perfect daughter. But the daughter Iris yearned for was not meant to be a writer who strayed beyond the tales she received: I was not meant to be curious; I was not meant to burrow beneath their plots; and I was not meant to undermine their narrative foundations, disrupting their silences, excavating what had been so assiduously hidden,” This book has some brilliant and insightful writing on colonialism and the ‘power’ of empire.  “British political, social and economic generosity was understood to have been embodied first in the abolition of the slave trade and, second, in the unstinting imperial labour to bring civilization and enlightenment to a third of the globe. This selfless mission was undermined when the empire came home. Boatloads of coloured immigrants, who had the nerve to think they were British, betrayed the spirit and practices of English liberalism. Having landed on the shores of a kind-hearted and generous-spirited Island, they just didn’t know how to behave like decent English people.”There were a couple of chapters I didn’t find quite so compelling- the descriptions of double entry accounting (for obvious reasons!). I also found the recount of Carby’s Jamaican family a bit difficult to follow. It wasn’t as fleshed out (probably due to lack of available evidence) and I got confused with all the different family names and connections. It became a bit ‘list like’ rather than a narrative.I can’t remember where I saw a recommendation for this book - perhaps on a list by Bernadine Evaristo?

It’s a city I have visited a number of times over the past thirty years and it always offers something wonderful and unexpected. The reader does need to work for this story. Each new chapter throws you with time shifts and characters that are revisited, woven and interconnected in the space that exists between recurring floods and political upheveals. This city is very much alive. As Sudbanthad says it’s “the messy business of the living and breathing.”There is sadness in the loss of home, family, opportunity and relationships and, in the birds that call Krungthep home in its very early days but are seen returning in the imagined future. It’s a place that pulls people home and speaks to them from distant lands. Sammy is a character running away but never escaping and Née is a character finding peace.

This invasion was viewed from the perspective of both the invaders and the invaded creating a rich tapestry of perspectives, motives and emotions. However it was the impact of patriarchy on all of the characters that kept drawing my attention. Kidane, Hirut, Ettore, Aster, Fucelli and even Emperor Haile Selassie all responded and reflected on their patrilineal relationships as a driving force in their need to seek power, control others, produce offspring and seek some sort of compensation for the ‘damage’ or failure of their own ability to live up to expectations placed upon them. The damage and havoc of this system reverberates through the generations.This year’s Booker Prize will be a tough choice with so many big powerful stories....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Aug 14, 2020","Aug 25, 2020","Aug 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43726511-the-shadow-king

While many events flow through the story of Esme’s life there was nothing unexpected that made me sit up and wonder where this was going. I felt Esme was a predictable character (as were the majority of minor characters). There were a lot of very nice people with the odd ‘villain ‘ and this left me looking for a bit of excitement.

I found the first half, about Llewellyn’s father, the most interesting but her own story, that developed later in the book, was overly focused on her connection to ‘rich and famous people’ (name dropping). The MS part of her story was tacked on and didn’t offer much insight (other than the obvious) and I just felt it went nowhere. She mentioned she was estranged from her father but it seemed more like she didn’t (or wasn’t allowed) to visit him rather than a falling out. And what actually happened to her mother? I’ve read a number of the 2020 Stella Prize shortlisted novels and I really don’t think it is in the same league.

It has a cast of warm, slightly bizarre characters who will take you on a wild and somewhat illegal romp through 1960’s south Brooklyn. Imagine an elderly drunk man known as Sportscoat who talks to his deceased wife, shoots a young drug dealer and then doesn’t remember the incident! The shooting triggers a feud amongst the local mafia groups who are vying for control of the neighbourhood. As they scramble for control a central message emerges “A person who trusts can be trusted”. The local community are resilient, funny, sad and savvy as they negotiate looking after each other and saving their home. The sad part of this story is the inevitability of drugs infiltrating the community, destroying the lives of its youth and the corruption of those with power.

I’m super glad that the character of Tyll, that was based on a folklore from a time preceding this story, did not pursue his legendary status as a prankster of scatalogical jokes!The humour and quirkiness of this novel reminds me a lot of Patrick deWitt.While each new section of the story takes a little time to settle into they are deftly woven together.

A second scientist, his work colleague and a former student of the ‘rogue’ scientist, has been sent to get answers about her colleague’s death and determine the progress of the research project.

Perhaps living during a real pandemic makes me question why the people in this novel aren’t really discussing what has happened, who is to blame, and what will happen next?The stilted style of sentence structure also wore me down a little. What I did like was imagining how all the animals might actually sound and the cacophony of noise that would surround us if they really could communicate.

Thank you Better Reading for my Advance Proof.Evie Wyld has created a sweep of vivid flawed women struggling to battle through the disappointment of disrespectful and violent relationships. Despite living hundreds of years apart they all become victims, under different circumstances, of men. This is a reminder that physical violence and psychological abuse continue to happen and this book explores the many ways it is perpetrated on women.The use of bass rock as a connector for the stories provided a dramatic unsettling backdrop for the unfolding events. I also liked the slightly speculative feel created by ghosts of women past and the camaraderie of women helping each other. My favourite scene was ‘the beach picnic’ - this was a gothic and frightening moment with superb tension.I liked the different time periods and I’m generally okay with shifting time frames but I would have preferred a better marker or indicator as I found the Roman numerals confusing.

He has befriended their son, Bukhosi, who has disappeared in mysterious circumstances and he is now plying Abednego with alcohol and drugs in order to get him to talk about his family hi-story and preying on Agnes’s desperation to find her son.

Of having to stare into a face and be faced with the truth of your own face.”This is a complex and powerful story. It did take me awhile to sink into but then there was no turning back.

This story was written in 1925 and it’s strength lies in the author’s personal experience during this interwar time period in Far Eastern Europe, his childhood and military career having occurred there. This time period is a turbulent mix of nations regrouping and asserting themselves after WW1 and this is combined with internal upheaval in Russia. While I’m sure I missed subtle (and possibly not so subtle) ironic stabs I enjoyed Gerhardie’s fictional Belgian family caught up in the midst of these events. Definitely not a Russian family saga!While some parts of this story rolled along with quirky humour and observations (Where did the 1000 missing fur hats ever end up going?) other parts felt a bit repetitive. This story is narrated by the self absorbed young Georges and his sexism and some racist comments may grate a little on contemporary readers but it is probably a genuine reflection of the time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 27, 2019","Dec 03, 2019","Nov 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/750476.The_Polyglots

After recently reading ‘Dark Emu’ by Bill Pascoe I feel that ‘The Yield’ may have been influenced by this. Winch has created a composite fictional place that explores similar content to Pascoe’s research (but in a fictional unique way) about indigenous farming methods, social interactions and lifestyle. This felt like a strong overlap (but maybe I only noticed it because I have read Dark Emu so recently). Another novel with similar themes was Melissa Lukashenko’s ‘Too Much Lip’ which I really enjoyed for its humour and matter of factness.

Set in Oman, through a period of tumultuous change, during the 19th and 20th century this book explores the impact of religion, slavery, gun trafficking, war, invasion and modernisation on the extended family of Abdallah. The changes faced by each generation brings new challenges as Oman and it’s people are forced to adapt - some better than others. This family saga has two perspectives in alternating chapters and has lots of time shifts. This did make it tricky to follow and I would have been lost without the family tree at the front of the book. Abdallah narrates in the first person and reflects on his life through one strand and the alternating chapter in the third person moves between all of the extended family, basically moving forward from the arranged wedding of Mayya and Abdallah.This was a great introduction to Oman and provided interesting insights into a country and people that are clearly proud of their identity but struggle to retain it under the pressure of globalisation and external influences.

As the town declines and the residents become increasingly desperate to find value in the place they call home a dark purpose is alluded to and unseen bureaucrats pull strings beyond their control. The multiple perspectives and multiple timelines are reasonably common in recent literature but I’m not sure I’ve seen the use of the first person ‘we’ before. While I did get a bit confused by some of these shifts, and perhaps there were a few too many, I think viewing the events as a townsfolk perspective was very clever and worked well. The cephalopod as creature that can morph and camouflage with its surroundings was a brilliant metaphor for how people can also disguise their intentions and modify their behaviour. The characters in this novel were multi layered and deceptive in much the same way.The visual and olfactory images created in this novel linger on as a dire warning.

While some characters are extremely unlikeable she still finds small moments that create empathy and connections for the reader.

This story had an intriguing premise ‘why did Evelyn Hugo choose Monique to write her memoir?’ Seemingly she is plucked from obscurity but the reader is clearly made aware that the reason will be revealed. Unfortunately, while the reason was well crafted, by the time I got to the reveal I had not built a relationship with Monique and therefore did not feel a great deal of empathy. The story is all Hugo and really the snippets of Monique don’t build her story.Hugo is also a narcissistic, manipulative character and while I understand that she was compelled to make difficult and unpleasant personal choices to hide her sexuality I didn’t like the way she manipulated other people. She was driven by the desire for money, fame and the glamour lifestyle. I didn’t feel sympathy when her life repeatedly disintegrated - in fact I cared less each time. This does however all shows the power of Taylor Jenkins Reid in writing and creating a unique character. I just wish she had some redeeming qualities. I am also now very interested in how realistically this depicts the real life of Hollywood movie stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 24, 2021","Jul 04, 2021","Jun 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo

A German man who studies beards (yes male facial hair) discovers his wife is having an affair and decides to teach her a lesson by traveling to Japan on a sort of pilgrimage following the steps of a 500 years deceased Japanese poet. When he arrived in Tokyo he comes across a young Japanese man intent on committing suicide and decides that this man needs his help and guidance. This becomes a strange relationship as both men really don’t understand each other and converse in limited English. There is a strange humour to their journey as they search for a ‘dignified’ location for a suicide and a poetically inspired landscape for contemplation, the Pine Islands.

This book contains some beautiful prose and some striking glimpses into the domestic life of Edemariam’s grandmother, Yetemegnu, her life encompassed the 20th century (and all its turbulence) in Ethiopia.My prior knowledge of Ethiopia, its geography, history and people was limited to a vague awareness of coups, civil wars, drought and famine. This book has given me a much greater understanding of alternative perspectives. A country with an abundance of produce, deeply rooted Christian beliefs entwined with myths and the spirit world and a strong sense of family pride.While I could picture the daily vistas and could, to some extent, follow the broad brushstrokes of her history I struggled to understand the unfolding political events and the interactions she had with the religious and political figures with whom she met. The oblique (illusory) descriptions of these events made it hard to follow what was actually happening. The time line was also very general and sometimes I felt like it wasn’t chronological or was backtracking to an earlier event.Yetemegnu developed from a young vulnerable girl into a woman; she fought to provide for and protect her children despite her illiteracy and lack of position in a male dominated society. I felt confused about her relationship with her husband, who was clearly abusive and controlling, but for whom she risked a great deal to seek support and obtain his release from prison. About half way through I nearly gave up. Unfamiliar names, dates and events were a little jumbled in my mind but I persevered and found the second half (where the author’s parents enter the story as adults) a lot easier to follow.

There are many biographies that delve into the experience of living and finding a new life (or sense of purpose) by spending time abroad but I do feel that Heaslip has managed to delve a little deeper than just ‘a coming of age/ finding romance story. While she does write about these facets of her life I believe her ability to communicate an understanding of Czech culture and history is what I found most interesting. This autobiography provides a glimpse of Prague and it’s people reintegrating with the ‘Western world’ after many years of enforced separation due to political ideology. While many of us have been led (through our Western education) to believe that there was nothing good to come from Communism Tanya Heaslip was confronted with a different reality. Many people were accepting and even happy with their life under communist rule and actually found the transition to democracy a frightening prospect, or at least one that might degrade their strong sense of family and community.I’ve recently read PRAGUE SPRING By Simon Mawer (a fantastic novel set during the 1968 uprising) and I found this useful complementary reading for this novel.I’m not sure I needed quite so many references to Kafka....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 17, 2019","Mar 23, 2019","Mar 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43969025-alice-to-prague

This reference to Charlie, the father, may have been a little over used but it is apt and also beautifully represented on the cover art. I didn’t settle into this book easily. The first few chapters felt a bit overworked with description and metaphors (almost like some teen/YA novel) but after this point I slowly became hooked. The tension was skilfully ramped up and the use of description was used more discretely to emphasise this. The time shifts also worked well in this novel as they demonstrated the impact that the family ‘secret’ had on each family member in the ensuing decades. They all chose to bury their thoughts and not discuss what they suspected or knew about their father and as a reader I was turning over every clue to predict the ending too....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 09, 2019","Mar 13, 2019","Mar 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39675739-bluebottle

Pascoe repeats that we need to move on from past disagreements and labeling of whether Aboriginal people fit the Western view of civilisation because all of our livelihoods now depend on forging a way ahead together. “No peoples of the world in any era of their history wanted oppression, discomfort or inconsequence. The desire for food, shelter and purpose are universal; therefore, systems that provided citizens with as much of those three physical and psychological necessities must be considered successful and, furthermore, the survival of such systems over time can only have been wrought by the will of the people.”Clearly we can not return to the past but Pascoe has presented many examples of land management that could provide benefits to our stressed and degraded landscapes. It’s about thinking in a new way. On occasions Pascoe becomes emotive in his writing but he is able to present a great deal of primary evidence, that has been previously disregarded or overlooked, to support his analysis. Even in his valid condemnation of the attitude and behaviour of some early explorers he has managed to salvage some beneficial evidence from their own first hand accounts. This is definitely a book that should be compulsory reading for Australians and I’m pleased he has written a children’s version as this viewpoint was never included in my formal education....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 08, 2019","Sep 14, 2019","Feb 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21401526-dark-emu

A heartfelt biography that alternates between the time of Nazi occupied Holland and the present day. It is portrayed through the eyes of Lientje, a young Jewish girl, who was (mostly) hidden in plain sight during the occupation when she was sent to live with a non Jewish family. The author has a direct connection to Lientje and spent a lot of time interviewing her during the writing and research of this book and he also includes chapters about these conversations to provide clarity. He has compassionately tried to reconstruct her story through the lens of a naive child. There are blanks in this story due to memory loss, which is no doubt due to post traumatic stress, and although van Es doesn’t use the term ‘survivor guilt’ this is the expression I would use to describe the impact the occupation had on her life. While some Dutch people did shelter Jewish citizens it appears it was sometimes out of a sense of religious or philosophical duty rather than the true bond of family love and protection. Being removed from culture, family and everything familiar must have been a huge trauma to bear. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 26, 2019","Mar 09, 2019","Jan 07, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41000784-the-cut-out-girl

They became slightly more fleshed out by the end of the novel but I needed them earlier as they were the deliverers of the backstories of the women of Paris during the occupation. The relationship between Hannah and Tariq was also not one I could believe. The stories of the young women of Paris were fascinating. What to do when you are caught in the middle of the war as a civilian? What are the rules? Faulks delved into these questions skilfully and provided conflicting scenarios.The subway provided a great grounding connection for the time shift between the past and present. It also invoked an element of magical realism with a supporting cast of Victor Hugo and a couple of women (that Tariq followed and who could not really be placed in time).

The stories we tell to our family become a shared history of happiness and sorrow. It’s what helps us make meaning in our lives and explain who we are. This book crafts a family that feels alive and honest. I think this story was difficult to sink into at the beginning because the esoteric nature of the boys conversations was a bit impenetrable. Once I got to about 1/4 I was hooked but the early scenes didn’t work for me as a beginning for this story. If Clay’s running had been introduced later (when it actually comes into the plot) it would have made more sense. It’s ok to develop a readers understanding slowly but this beginning was just confusing. Maybe as the writer knows the entire story it is difficult because they are never reading again for the first time. I may have given this 4 stars with a different start.This book has such a big heart and the mule is a standout....more,Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 02, 2021","Oct 08, 2021","Oct 19, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39217968-bridge-of-clay

How can two young people who clearly love and understand each other so intrinsically be so lacking in belief or trust about the reality of their relationship. The apparent simplicity of the writing baffles me as the story is deeply nuanced and the relationship complex. This is not as edgy as Conversations With Friends but I enjoyed it so much more because I was emotionally invested with both the protagonists. I felt Rooney captured the self doubt and behaviour of young adults with clarity and compassion. Their ‘tumultuous’ lives are contrasted cleverly by scenes of simple domesticity and It’s all so ‘normal’. The sadness associated with their miscommunication and timing reminded me of the feeling I got reading Atonement and On Chesil Beach.

I’m not surprised it has been short listed for The ManBooker prize, it has a big story to tell. It’s set in Northern Ireland during the 1970’s but it could be many civil wars. This novel shows what happens when individual power disguises itself as part of a societal cause. This has 1984 undertones but also could be a precursor to how we might arrive at a patriarchal society like that which occurs in The Handmaids Tale. There is dark humour in the ridiculousness and warped sense of patriotism and righteousness that results in ‘normal ‘ murder appearing shocking and appalling and where ‘reading while walking’ is subversive.I felt like I was wading in knee deep water while reading this book.

Despite being a novel Ben Doherty provides a powerful and adroitly written insight into a minority population. The Naga people face hardship in the form of discrimination, poverty and embedded diseases such as HIV yet they are also proud of their heritage and are extremely loyal. This novel skilfully balances fact with fable to create a story that is about love and survival. In a world where we increasingly receive news from social media I think this story also exemplifies the need for embedded journalists. Doherty’s time in South Asia and his understanding of the background events that underlie the rifts and dislocation of minority groups has allowed him to craft a story that celebrates the value of human diversity and the need to preserve and value it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 21, 2018","Nov 26, 2018","Sep 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40034861-nagaland

The atmosphere of dread seeps relentlessly from the canals and rivers at the centre of this story. Interestingly this is another 2018 ManBooker longlisted novel that explores a child-mother relationship (Warlight is the other that I’ve read).

She wanted to convey the terribleness of the situation in Cambodia but also preserve and recognise the dignity of its people. She has achieved this and more.This book is much more than a story of the Pol Pot era. It is about having the courage, resilience and love to rebuild communities and a sense of place. How do you seek to rebuild trust in a shattered country? So much of what she writes about is how to get people to become communities again as a necessary foundation for moving forward.This is a beautifully written memoir that raises people above circumstances. She quotes her friend Thim ‘Move in the direction you believe. Never be hopeless. There is a door where you don’t expect it.’...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 12, 2018","Jul 20, 2018","Jul 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29845465-writing-for-raksmey

With great skill Murnane is able to describe his thinking and then share these moments that are very much like synapses in the human brain. They are the moments where you leap in another direction. His fascination with coloured glass in all its forms, and how it appears differently depending on which side you look at it from or who is looking at it, is a thoughtful analogy to explain how our world view and memories are shaped.

This is a desperate and tragic story about the impact of inherited guilt. The pressure, both internal and external on this family is immense and builds steadily in this pressure cooker of a town. Cub’s mother is severely depressed and almost catatonic, her father is struggling to hold the family together and her elder brother Cassie responds as you would expect from a disenfranchised teenager.What I loved about this novel was the narration by Cub, the young daughter. She is a realistic narrator, she is inquisitive but naive, she watches what happens but doesn’t tell us what it means, she doesn’t ‘just’ put the pieces together. She’s simply a young girl who loves her family and doesn’t want to see any of them hurting. This was skilfully done!At about the 3/4 point of this novel I was racing through the pages as revelations were made and expectations of a big event became clear but I think that it went off the boil a little before the climax.

Absolutely loved the sense of place and thought Arnott described Tasmania beautifully. I also really enjoyed the elements of magical realism as they helped create an atmosphere of a mystical ancient world. Unfortunately I think Arnott then tried to put in too many backstories and sidelines which diluted the focus of this novel.

I listened to this as an audio book and it was brilliantly read in voice that could well, in my mind now, be Garner’s.

If the protagonist is trying to write a history of a town (unnamed - central west New South Wales) that no one knows the history of and there are no known written records - does it really have a history?The dead-pan pathos and humour of this narrative when combined with the increasingly bizarre speculative fiction had me hooked. While nothing happens in this town (apart from excessive drinking and quite a bit of brawling) I really wanted to find out where the labyrinth was going to end. A bus driver who drives an endless looping of town without passengers, a radio station with no listeners and a pub with no customers (but yes everyone drinks) and don’t get me started on all those cassette tapes. I guess I know where blank cassettes ended up when people stopped buying them.This is definitely a slightly bonkers read but it also does make some powerful points about how generic our country towns have become with the growth of large chain stores and how many have (and continue) to disappear into obscurity. They only really exist for the people that live in them and those people can fear what they don’t know. I also think there was quite a bit to be said about how we worry about all the small issues and around us the world is facing much bigger issues that will effect the entire planet. It might actually be that we are all actually disappearing into a big hole of nothing.The final 1/3 of the book was not quite as gripping. The humour was no longer there and the grim reality of the underbelly of most of our big cities was probably a lot more familiar.Bran Presser has raved about how underrated (or perhaps under the radar ) this book has been and I definitely agree it is pretty special.

Stylistically it is very interesting and I enjoyed the journey (apart from the discussions of baseball for which I have no knowledge or interest). The first part of the book hooked me early with the strange magical quality of events contrasted with the mundane daily things like buying a Mister Softee. I found the first section a disturbing relationship and abuse of power. The CALLER ID BLOCKED message made me cringe with discomfort every time I read it. The second story, while also describing being a victim of power, examined this in a very different way but ended with me feeling the character was moving towards gaining control.Ultimately I think this book gave me more value from the journey than the ending.

Even as Tara becomes an educated ‘free thinking’ woman she is still ensnared and guilt ridden in her emotions and belief that she has created the dishonesty and falsehoods. She describes the process of freeing herself as needing ‘to construct my own mind’. Even by the end of this book there is a strong sense that she craves affirmation and inclusion in her family despite the abuse and lack of support she receives. When people question why victims remain silent long after abuse has occurred this provides some explanation.

I enjoyed the perspective of Sam, as a child without voice, as it added a lot of complexity to the plot but also focused on how difficult it would be to accept a sudden dramatic change in ability. I’ve done this road trip a number of times and it felt very realistic. Viewing an adults mental health collapse, through the eyes of children, was disturbing and suspenseful but also included many moments of compassion. A slightly icky unresolved fear at the end so you are still left with some wondering.

I liked the premise of this novel however in execution it felt like an unbalanced story. The past, recalling Sara’s life as an Australian war bride to a US serviceman, was interesting but petered into a rather predictable tale. The story of her granddaughter Hannah, journeying with her grandmother on her return to Australia, had potential but really didn’t go anywhere and her character just didn’t seem to evolve or show direction. Probably best described as a light holiday read as the issues it set out to tackle were a bit superficially dealt with in the end and didn’t really challenge my thinking.Thanks to Goodreads and Allen&Unwin for my copy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 18, 2018","Feb 21, 2018","Jan 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36544055-the-passengers

I was intrigued by the premise of four girls (all named Guenivere) sent to a convent, as wards, until they turned 18. The back stories were compelling and the loss of childhood a tragedy. It seems there were a lot of victims of dire circumstances during this time and another layer of grief for the dead, missing, and unknown comatose soldiers whom the nuns cared for. The audio did drag and I was happier with reading it myself but it is still a very slow story and I think I could have done with a bit less repetition.

I have mixed feelings about this book so I’ve ended up middle of the road with my finThanks to Goodreads and Allen & Unwin for my copy of this novel. I have mixed feelings about this book so I’ve ended up middle of the road with my final rating. I think the setting and time were captured well and the cast of characters were broad and generally engaging. The descriptions of daily life, the public events, political disagreements and social society of Sydney were fascinating and enjoyable to read about.My two major difficulties were the character of the young Isobel and the handling of the indigenous issues. I didn’t find the depth of Isobel’s perceptions and moralising as a young child realistic. I just can’t imagine a young child with limited exposure of the world thinking about things so deeply. From about half way through the novel I was much more convinced by her behaviour and the growth of her character but I struggled through her early years. The handling of indigenous issues is tricky and I am not sure how successful many writers are at not viewing these issues through a lens of modern opinion and sensibility. I appreciate that Leatherdale was trying to overcome this by providing two opposing stories of the Major’s expeditions but then this also feels a bit contrived. It’s like our heroine could not be a strong and righteous character if she didn’t come out and condemn her father’s actions because of what we now know about the treatment of indigenous people. Overall I would recommend this if you like a neatly tied up Australian historical novel and it would be a good book club choice....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 02, 2018","Feb 11, 2018","Dec 08, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36544005-the-opal-dragonfly

I don’t know much about T.S. Eliot’s writing but about half way through the book I googled some background on him and listened to his poem ‘The Love Song of Alfred Prufrock’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLNsP... It was a revelation as I heard Anthony Hopkins read lines like “Time yet for a hundred indecisions...” - I saw the cleverness of a poem embedded in a novel. Emily is a procrastinator and paralysed by indecision which ultimately leads to her predicament in the novel. Steven Carroll is obviously passionate about T.S. Eliot and has captured a little of the essence of him in his own writing. However you certainly don’t need to be familiar with Eliot to appreciate this book. I have never read a book by Steven Carroll before but will certainly be revisiting him.This novel also reminded me a little of Mothering Sunday by Graham Swift as it captures a moment reflected upon and a love that is destined to be unfulfilled.It is much gentler but with a similar feel....more,Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 09, 2017","Dec 12, 2017","Dec 05, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35284503-a-new-england-affair

This book just keeps giving and giving and wow the final plot twist was a cracker. It did take me awhile to adjust to the writing style and language but I became totally hooked. The characters are intense and multilayered and the descriptions are sharp and humorous:“Tertia’s mother said, “She spoils every dinner party she attends.” Fond and proud. Crushing a billowing blue sofa, Lady Drage now became a creature too heavy for its elements, a cormorant on the waves.”The three sisters, Dora, Caro and Grace, arrive in London together, shortly after the Second World War. The timing of their arrival, and the 30 subsequent years the novel covers, sees the struggle against patriarchy, class division and the establishment begin to crumble but yet still impact their lives and relationships. Each sister makes decisions that see their future paths and happiness diverge.The men in this book are also fascinating- and not generally in a good way. How I loathed Christian and his abhorrent mealy mouthed comments.

The premise and plot of the story are good but at times the characters became a bit black and white and two dimensional, in particular the character of Bridget. She needed a few more flaws and to show more development. I was also a little disbelieving of how rapidly Mark’s domestic skills improved and although his character said he was out of touch with the world it didn’t really feel like it.The location for this story was great and there was certainly a build up in tension as the plot evolved and thankfully I didn’t find the ending entirely predictable.

Thanks to Allen & Unwin and Goodreads for my copy. Definitely a light holiday read. While the premise of this story and the dual narrative, by two women, is a good idea the characters did not really come to life. I would prefer to develop my understanding of them by listening to them speak and witnessing their actions rather than being told how they felt and relying on somewhat stereotyped descriptions. I also think the ending petered out without a strong resolution for either character.

Each Archie was a fascinating person and a truely developed character in his own right. Unfortunately I do feel that Auster really tried to cram to much into this story and that tipped me a little over the edge. The endless lists of books read, movies visited and unrelated events felt like an attempt to show how well read etc Auster is.

The premise of the story is an interesting choice if this is intended as a YA novel. The parts narrated by Steffi, a year 9 secondary student, who is bullied and has feelings of not quite fitting in are typical of this genre but the voice of Alvar, a nursing home patient whom Steffi befriends, really felt a bit odd for a YA novel. As an adult I really liked Alvar's story of his adolescence in Stockholm during WW11 but I didn't feel much connection with Steffi's character ( even though I could empathise with her predicament). I'm not particularly musical so a bit of the detail about the playing of jazz probably also went over my head. I also felt the translation was at times a bit stilted and I wonder how the lines of lyrics were translated (if they were).

The plot is inconsistent and unbelievable and the characters are annoying, selfish and shallow. I disliked how the author jumped between characters to show point of view, particularly when their personalities could not be consistently sustained. I would have preferred to maintain a single quality character point of view. Laura was completely unbelievable in what she did and did not know about the world around her and I did not think her behaviour reflected that of a young person who had spent so much time with extremely limited company, education and exposure to news.

Thanks to Scribe and Goodreads for my copy of A Beautiful Young Wife. Although this novel (novella?) appears to be a simple recount it tackles a number of relationship themes; ageing, children, trust and the effect of time. Edward, the protagonist, finds himself spiralling out of control and making choices that in turn lead to further repercussions. He does not seem to be able to alter his trajectory but his awareness does grow as he reflects on his childhood and past. This story certainly provokes and Wieringa does a good job of not overpowering the readers responses with his own commentary or opinion. The translation was easy to read and well structured.

It provided a fascinating and tactile history of Tasmania (Van Dieman's Land) brought to life by vivid description of landscape and carefully drawn character portraits. If I could wish for one thing it would be the addition of a character list/map as there were so many important people connected in numerous ways and I found it difficult to keep track of who some of them were. This was apparent from the first few pages, which I found a bit overwhelming with detail. I really wanted to understand and keep track of all the players, it was like an intricate spiders web being woven.

They seemed to be either evil and abhorrent or generous and kind to a fault. It is not until we meet Gunther that I felt we had embraced a character who seemed realistic and had some depth. Many of the descriptions were quite stereotyped and therefore did not leave much to the imagination. The other issue I struggled with in this book was how the author finished many chapters or scenes with a sentence or paragraph that eluded to what would happen next in the story.

While I don’t agree with all of Garner’s arguments I certainly don’t feel she should have been demonised in the way she was when this book was first released. Yes she inserted her own opinions and personal reflections into her examination of the events but I also believe she made this entirely clear. I don’t see how she was ever going to use this as a ‘money grabbing’ exercise off the back of someone else’s pain as not many books in Australia really make that kind of money. She genuinely cares about the topic, and I can’t imagine anyone would put themselves through the abuse and resistance she received otherwise. How we educate our children and our own behaviour are all within our power and Garner has used her power to write and exam issues in a way that is both readable and engaging. If a lot of men have read this book (and this is mentioned in the epilogue) I don’t necessarily see this as a problem indicating support but rather an opportunity to make them stop and think about their behaviour.I was at university around the time the events in this book were written and it was a completely different experience. It was modern, without colleges and none of the history of traditional formalities and behaviours that are perpetuated in the institutions of this book. At the time I felt I may have been missing out but now I can reflect that maybe I was the lucky one....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 24, 2020","Nov 26, 2020","May 26, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/53333067-the-first-stone

I felt that the childhood chapters were engaging to begin with but meandered without direction after a couple of major incidents in Jayne's life. The contemporary chapters, following Jayne's life, also started with great promise and I was looking forward to a journey delving into Aboriginal artefacts, their removal and return however this didn't really evolve either. There seemed to be a greater focus on what Jayne was eating and her cycling than on her research and passion for Australian history.
