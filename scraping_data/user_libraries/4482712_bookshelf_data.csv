</div></td>",,,"Survival of the Richest        (The Trust Fund Duet, #1)","Warren, Skye*",,,B07BHG8FYF,unknown,3.91,"4,161","Jun 12, 2018","Jun 12, 2018",really liked it,1 of 5 stars2 of 5 stars3 of 5 stars4 of 5 stars5 of 5 starsadd to shelves,"This was the first time I read one of Skye’s novels, and if I’m being completely honest Survival of the Richest isn’t normally the type of read I seekThis was the first time I read one of Skye’s novels, and if I’m being completely honest Survival of the Richest isn’t normally the type of read I seek out. But there’s never anything wrong with pushing past comfort zones and usual routines, and this novel delivered from the first chapter.Survival of the Richest centers on Harper St. Claire, a girl emotionally older than her years and on the verge of transforming into a woman. Initially, I wondered if her teenage voice was too mature for the character in the story, but my concerns soon faded. Harper’s life could easily be compared to a prime-time soap – family wealth, high society, and over the top drama. She bounces between the households of her divorced parents and endures a revolving door of subsequent step-mothers, step-fathers, and step-siblings. By the time she is introduced to current step-mother, Louise, and step-brother Christopher Bardot, her policy regarding their new relationship is deeply rooted – “I don’t want to mess with them. They’ll be gone next year.”In this case, Harper is only partly correct. While Louise quickly fades from her father’s world, Christopher holds on. Over the course of several years, a long-distance friendship and bond builds between the two former step-siblings, but despite Harper’s growing attraction and greatest wishes where Christopher is concerned, they are kept apart by one obstacle after another. Christopher comes from humble beginnings and his ambition and his acumen for business drive him to become a self-made millionaire, earning the respect of Harper’s father. From the first time me meets Harper, Christopher is compelled to protect her at all costs and when Harper’s father burdens him with a life-altering responsibility, the job at hand threatens their chances at a future together.But just when things couldn’t seem any more complicated, Harper is introduced to Christopher’s business partner, Sutton Mayfair. In looks and personality, Sutton is everything that Christopher is not. Despite pining after Christopher for years, Harper notices and appreciates the differences between the two men, and Sutton is immediately attracted to her. He sees things in Harper that she wishes Christopher could acknowledge. What quickly develops is an intense love triangle that made Survival of the Richest unputdownable. I was desperate for Harper to choose the man who was best for her. I bounced back and forth between Christopher and Sutton, wondering if there was one clear choice over another and even questioning at times if she should walk away from both men altogether. I won’t lie, the ending of this book snuck up on me quickly and left me hungry for more. Thankfully, a sequel is on the way at the end of the summer, which gives me plenty of time to theorize how the story of Harper, Christopher, and Sutton will ultimately play itself out. It’s clear that some of the secondary characters in this book likely have novels of their own, but Survival of the Richest is easily read as a stand alone novel. The chemistry between Harper and her love interests runs the spectrum of loving and intimate to primal and possessive. If you’re in the mood for a passionate read with a fair dose of angst, Survival of the Richest is great choice.Merged :This was the first time I read one of Skye’s novels, and if I’m being completely honest Survival of the Richest isn’t normally the type of read I seek out.

Over the years, I’ve enjoyed her ability to develop strong and complex characters and to create supernatural worlds with her enviable imagination. She’s made me laugh out loud with her wicked sense of humor and brought me to actual tears with raw and vulnerable emotion. Most importantly Nancee’s novels remind us all to seek out and embrace hope, even within the midst of deep suffering.If paranormal isn’t your go-to romance genre, please don’t let that keep you from this book. While the magical aspects of the plot add both suspense and intrigue to the story, it is the relationship triangle between Skylar, Jed and Caleb that demands your attention and will compel you to turn the pages until the very end. By writing What the Trees Know, Nancee has taken everything she’s learned as a writer and seamlessly weaved all of her admirable strengths into one superb tale.

But, in the wake of our new and unexpected reality, I found both my focus and interest in reading to be lacking. Sad to say, I’ve read nowhere near that number this year, but I’ve been determined to get things back on track for 2021. When the chance came along for me to read Freya Barker’s “Edge of Tomorrow” ahead of its release date, I didn’t hesitate to reserve my copy. Freya has been one of my automatic one-click authors for a couple of years now and she has yet to fail me.Freya has a true talent for romantic suspense, and “Edge of Tomorrow” is a great example of her ability to pen entertaining and thrilling books. I always enjoy the suspense of unfolding mysteries at the center of her novels. Her plots are always well-paced, with tensions that build to a fever pitch, and well-written action sequences. I also love that Freya prominently features a compelling and diverse set of characters, including Native American leading men, Hispanic professionals, and in the case of this book, an African-American heroine and a rough and tumble middle-aged mechanic with a caring heart. Readers looking for diversity in their fiction will be pleased with the complexity of these well-crafted individuals. I’m thrilled to give “Edge of Tomorrow” 5 stars, and happily recommend everything Freya Barker has available to offer. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 06, 2020","Sep 22, 2020","Sep 06, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/54803950-edge-of-tomorrow

As a result, there are a number of well- known authors that have lingered on my TBRI love books, but often lack the time to read as many as I’d like. As a result, there are a number of well- known authors that have lingered on my TBR list. When the opportunity to read “Then You Happened” landed in my inbox a few weeks ago, I decided it was finally time to get acquainted with K Bromberg. In this sense, she is a new-to-me author, and this standalone contemporary romance proved to be a good inaugural read.This is the story of Tatum Knox, a widow hell bent on proving to the world (or at least the small town of Lone Star, Texas) that she can manage her struggling ranch all on her own, and Jack Sutton, her newly hired ranch manager hell bent on helping Tatum save her land and livelihood. After battling one bitter disappointment in life after another, Tatum trusts no one but herself, even when she is in desperate need of a helping hand. Although Jack and Tatum butt heads from the beginning, he is fascinated by her “wild”. With each turn of the page, my interest grew as Jack effortlessly adapted his horse whisperer skills to rein in Tatum’s fiery temper. That isn’t to say that she doesn’t get on Jack’s last nerve from time to time. These two spend the first third of the novel arguing back and forth quite a bit, and I have to admit I struggled with this. To me, it seemed like these two had the same fight several times over, and after a while it proved difficult to hold my attention. It was only once Tatum and Jack found their way past the arguments that the story really opened up and drew me in. My favorite moments in his book happened when Tatum’s defenses finally come down with Jack. There were moments that I swooned. Moments when I laughed out loud. Moments when my eyes welled up with tears. Tatum is a determined, fierce fighter and Jack’s quiet ruggedness and protective nature was a perfect complement to her.I could list several 5 star moments in Then You Happened, but I could also list just as many 3 star ones. Overall, I’m glad I stuck with this book. By the end of the novel, I was invested in Tatum and Jack’s story and was glad to have spent a few days in their world.

But I’ve always known I would go on to read the remaining installments because I’ve enjoyed spending time with the residents of the small Alabama town that serves as the setting. Nancee has taken great care creating a multitude of complex and interesting characters that I connect with.“The Realization of Grayson Deschanelle” is the final story to be set in Pine Bluff, and the reader is treated to a hero who is decidedly not from this neck of the woods. Grayson Deschanelle is a world famous French fashion photographer with family ties by marriage in Alabama. One of his step-relatives is Lissy Carlton, who was just a teenager when the two were introduced. Naturally, she develops a crush on the sophisticated European man, who is also well into his thirties.Fast forward five years, and Lissy is now a twenty year old while Grayson is about to turn forty. Both have been going through a difficult time and both decide to seek refuge far away from everyone else. When they simultaneously arrive at a family cabin to lick their individual wounds, the two find unexpected solace in each other’s company. Lissy’s long-standing crush on Grayson is alive and well, and now he discovers his own growing attraction to the spirited young woman. Despite their age difference and life experience, there is a special chemistry between Grayson and Lissy. Grayson is respectful of Lissy and provides her the freedom to be herself. He enjoys spending time with her and he cares about her well-being. Lissy brings Grayson joy and excitement, but he’s also concerned. Believing he’s too old to be a suitable match for Lissy, Grayson worries how she’ll be treated by others should their affair be publicly revealed. Lissy isn’t so concerned about his age. Instead, she’s worried about losing the happiness he brings her once they both return to their separate lives. At the cabin, Grayson and Lissy succumb to temptation, committing to nothing more than a fling. Reading what happens once their rendezvous is over proves to be a real page turner and a fitting finale. Five stars for a complete and heartfelt series, full of inspiring, memorable characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 25, 2019","Dec 28, 2019","Dec 25, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/46137285-the-realization-of-grayson-deschanelle

As a result, there are a number of well known authors that I have yet to discover. When the opportunity to read “Come Back For Me” landed in my inbox a few weeks ago, I decided it was finally time to get acquainted with Corinne Michaels. In this sense, she is a new-to-me author, and wow! What an incredible first impression she has made on me with this first book in the Arrowood Brothers series.Connor is the youngest of four Arrowood brothers, and the one who seemingly draws the short straw after their estranged father dies. The brothers have inherited the family farm and will take turns living on and working the neglected land to bring it back to life. Having recently been discharged from the Navy, Connor is the first brother to arrive back home. Almost immediately upon his return, he runs into the nameless and broken woman who stole his heart eight years earlier.Life has not been kind to Ellie. In the years since she spent one passionate night with Connor, she has simply been trying to survive from one day to the next. Her story is heartbreaking and suspenseful. She believes she is weak and without a friend in the world. Convinced she can rely on no one but herself, she’s been keeping her head low and planning her escape. Then, just as Ellie’s situation enters its bleakest period, Connor’s reappearance offers her a small spark of hope.What unfolds in the pages of “Come Back For Me” is one of the best love stories I’ve read in years. With moments both beautiful and malevolent, this is a novel about second chances, small towns, and family ties. I loved the twists, turns, and incredible range of emotions they all put me through. Corinne’s writing is flawless and already has me longing to see this story onscreen.While it may take me some time to work my way through Corinne’s catalog of novels, there is no doubt I will be keeping up with the subsequent books in this series as they are released over the rest of 2020. I really cannot wait to see what else is in store for the Arrowood brothers and their family legacy.

Until then, I hadn’t read a wide range of romantic suspense books that spotlighted first responders, but Freya has a real gift for writing them. This latest release is another fantastic addition to her ever growing catalog of entertaining and thrilling books.“Tracking Tahlula” is Freya’s third book set within the “Police and Fire: Operation Alpha” Fan-Fiction world. As a Twilight FF alum, I’ve been ticked to see that Freya has written several stories using one of more of Susan Stoker’s characters, and with the enthusiastic support of Stoker herself. And although I’m personally unfamiliar with Stoker’s works, I’ve enjoyed the tie-ins to her work. In this book, we’re treated to the brilliant combo of Stoker’s characters - Pen, Moose, and their pet miniature donkey, Smokey. They’re a trio you won’t soon forget!For me, there are several refreshing elements when it comes to reading Freya Barker’s novels. I always enjoy the suspense of unfolding mysteries at the center of her novels. Her plots are always well-paced, with tensions that build to a fever pitch, and well-written action sequences. I also love that Freya prominently features a compelling and diverse set of characters, including Native American heroes, Hispanic professionals, and in the case of Tahlula Rae, a highly successful African-American romance author. Readers looking for diversity in their fiction will be pleased with the complexity of these well-crafted individuals. Additionally, Freya’s characters are mature adults – often in their forties. Given the combined stressors of navigating demanding careers along with unresolved personal issues, it’s refreshing to watch how these wiser characters deal with the strife hurled at them. I’m thrilled to give “Tracking Tahlula” 5 stars, and am already eager to see what Freya publishes next!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 15, 2019","Oct 19, 2019","Oct 15, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52187888-tracking-tahlula

I’ve been a devotedIf you’ve followed me for any length of time on social media, you already know that Sylvain Reynard is one of my favorite authors. I’ve been a devoted reader of SR’s since 2010 and my love for Prof. Gabriel O. Emerson knows no bounds. When it comes to book boyfriends, no one comes close to The Professor. So when it was announced that “Gabriel’s Promise” would be published, my excitement went into overdrive.The fourth book in this series picks up right where “Gabriel’s Redemption” left off. As a reminder, “Redemption” is a story in which The Professor seemingly has it all. But even as Gabriel and Julia navigate through their newlywed bliss, Gabriel remains convinced that his happiness is destined to be short-lived, that it could be ripped away at any moment. When his infant daughter, Clare, is born and placed in his arms for the first time at the conclusion of book three, we get a glimpse of how blessed Gabriel’s life will become by fatherhood.“Gabriel’s Promise” takes this glimpse and fully immerses us in those first precious days and weeks of new parenthood. Gabriel’s love for Clare is limitless and it’s a joy to read. The Professor dotes on his Principessa as only he can, and I took it all in with a big smile. Seeing Gabriel achieve true happiness has been a long time in the making. He is an amazing dad. Naturally, there are some complications that arise for the Emersons during this time. What’s interesting to read is how Gabriel chooses to deal with his obstacles in “Promise” compared to the earlier books.My only word of caution would be for those who haven’t yet read “The Florentine Series” or “The Man In The Black Suit.” There are elements from those books that have found their way into “Gabriel’s Promise” and might cause some mild confusion. That’s not to say that you need to read those books before diving into this one. Just be aware that some dots won’t be fully connected with this novel, and that you may want to move on to those other stories afterward.“Gabriel’s Promise” is my first read of 2020, and as usual, SR sets the storytelling bar high for my subsequent reads this year. I’m giving this novel five stars for it’s heart, humor, sexiness, and the mere existence of the dazzling Prof. Gabriel O. Emerson. (If you thought Gabriel was hot before, just wait until you spot him strolling through the Harvard campus with Clare in a fancy Swedish baby carrier.)...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43566934-gabriel-s-promise

This installment specifically focuses on Melody Mitchell, an award winning songwriter living in New York City. Her professional success is a contradiction to her personal life. Years earlier, Melody fled her small town home and her first love after suffering disgrace as a teenager. She’s managed to avoid reconnecting with her past ever since until her the sudden, tragic death of her cousin.When Melody returns home to attend the funeral, she is shocked to discover that she has been named guardian of her cousin’s infant daughter. Unable to duck in and duck right back out, she must remain in town until the matter is resolved. It doesn’t take long before she bumps into Dr. Brody Myers, the local pediatrician and Melody’s ex-boyfriend. On the surface it might appear that Brody has moved on from Melody, but he has never forgotten her, and he has remained an eligible bachelor.It doesn’t take long for sparks to fly again after Melody and Brody are reunited. Once the two move past the initial awkwardness, they fall back into their old friendship. But there are complications on both sides. Having already vowed never to marry and fully expecting to return to New York City, Melody struggles with her emotions and finally facing the consequences of her unresolved past. Meanwhile, Brody struggles with opening his heart back up to Melody, worried that she’ll only break it all over again. This dynamic between Melody and Brody is a perfect showcase of Sydney Logan’s skill as a storyteller. Within the pages of this book, I was caught up in the sweetness of the second chance romance. I admired Melody for her maturity when she was blindsided with the prospect of unexpected motherhood. I respected Brody not only for his professionalism as a doctor, but also for his empathy. Rather than holding on to heartbreak and anger, Brody understands Melody’s predicament and offers his support. But overall, I was moved by the theme of unconditional love that rose to the surface in the wake of an unthinkable tragedy. No Time For Lullabies is an unputdownable novel that runs the full spectrum of emotion and one that I enthusiastically recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 05, 2019","Jan 06, 2019","Jan 05, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43267173-no-time-for-lullabies

I’d always heard good things about her and her novels, so when I was offered a chance to read an ARC of King Me, I said yes without hesitation.As a stand alone novel, it turns out the King Me is a great place to dive into Season’s catalog. The story centers on Delaney Mills, a graduate student desperate to escape her tragic past in Chicago. She relocates to New Orleans, throwing herself into the research deep end of her thesis focus – modern day Voodoo. Her guide on this supernatural journey is Valentine King, a local whose family roots are firmly planted in the mysterious religion.Delaney is the quintessential Yankee. She’s a loner, she’s always overdressed for the Louisiana heat, and casual country music references go right over her head. So it comes as no surprise when she must rely on King to introduce her into the close knit community of VooDoo spiritual leaders. Delany’s goal is to publish a dissertation about the importance of the subculture of VooDoo in modern day New Orleans. Instead, Delaney and King find themselves swept up into a decades old mystery surrounding a local fringe group known as the Bondye Saints. The more they dig into the seedy activities of the group, the closer they become.For me, there were several refreshing elements to King Me. True to the New Orleans setting, several of the characters are African American, including the hero Valentine King. Readers looking for diversity in their fictional characters will be pleased with King’s intelligence and commitment to his family, his heritage, and to his new friend, Delaney. Delaney is a strong and complex female lead. She spends much of this novel haunted by her past, reluctant to share her secrets with anyone while wholly determined to unearth the secrets of the VooDoo community she is studying. And finally, there is the city of New Orleans as the setting. Its neighborhoods and residents are described in extraordinary detail within the page of King Me, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the story.In addition to King Me, Season Vining has published 4 other novels with another one on the way. If you’re looking for a new author to invest in and especially one that adds a bit of supernatural suspense into your reads, I happily recommend her....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 27, 2018","Jan 05, 2019","Dec 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43190887-king-me

Last year, she introduced me to interim Chief of Police, Keith Blackfoot, in Cabin 12. So, when I was offered a chance to read his story in Burning for Autumn, I said yes without hesitation. He’s a perfect hero for this novel and I was easily won over by his intelligence, good looks, passion, and sense of humor.He meets his match in Autumn McCoy, a gifted physician who has dedicated her career to treating burn victims. Autumn and Keith are both single and content to focus on their careers. Even so, when they meet casually at a local hangout, there is an instant attraction. Autumn finds Keith dark and brooding yet smooth. Keith finds her sexy and feisty yet confusing. Her body language and demeanor communicate that she doesn’t want anyone getting too close. Naturally, that only deepens the mystery for a skilled detective. After a shared drink and some brief flirting, the two part without much to show for it. But fate intervenes, when mutual friends bring them back together for a dinner date and the two give in to their desire. The budding romance is disrupted, however, when a serial arsonist terrorizes the community and targets Autumn in the process. Keith is consumed by the case both professionally and personally, determined to capture a dangerous criminal before the unthinkable occurs.Burning for Autumn is part of the Police and Fire: Operation Alpha Fan-Fiction world. As a Twilight FF alum, I was tickled to see that Freya wrote this story using one or more of Susan Stoker’s characters, and with the enthusiastic support of Stoker herself. And although I’m personally unfamiliar with Stoker’s works, I had no trouble being swept away by the story. For me, there are several refreshing elements when it comes to reading Freya Barker’s novels. I love that Freya prominently features a compelling and diverse set of characters, including a Native American hero and Hispanic professionals. Readers looking for diversity in their fiction will be pleased with the complexity of these well-crafted individuals. Additionally, Keith and Autumn are mature adults – both in their forties. Given the combined stressors of their respective careers along with unresolved personal issues, it’s refreshing to watch how these wiser characters deal with the strife hurled at them. I also enjoyed the suspense of the unfolding mystery at the center of this novel. The plot was well-paced, the tension built to a fever pitch, and the action was well written, resulting in my first 5 star read of 2019. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 09, 2018","Dec 23, 2018","Dec 09, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/42791491-burning-for-autumn

So, I when I discover an author who presents comedy organically and effortlessly, I’ll add them to my favorites list. Last year, Miranda Elaine published her debut novel, Fixing Her, and when the book landed on my kindle radar, it brimmed with potential for a great summer read. By the time I finished, I’d laughed out loud several times, fanned myself more than once, nervously chewed on a fingernail or two and shed more than a few tears. Miranda Elaine has a true talent for making the reader feel everything her characters are going through, and so I was truly excited when she followed up her spectacular debut with Fixing Him.This novel centers on a young, free-spirited woman named Montana. Raised by parents who live a nomadic lifestyle, she’s grown up with a wealth of experiences. When her grandfather passes away, Montana’s fortune expands when she inherits his home in the wealthy community of Lakeside. Having just graduated from college, Montana decides to spend her summer fixing up the house, with her pet mini pig, Kermie, in tow. A socialite’s existence has never been her ambition, so her intentions are to sell the property once the remodel is complete and begin her life elsewhere.When Montana enlists the services of Kade Construction, Sam is selected as the foreman on the remodeling project. He’s hard-working and loyal, both in his profession and in his personal life. He’s an established man in his thirties, living a bachelor’s life, but his time and attention are mostly spent looking after others – his clients, his friends, and especially his father who has been battling health issues. What little free time Sam has, he spends working on his own modest home, hopeful he can convince his ailing father to eventually move in with him. When Montana and Sam meet face to face, there is an instant attraction. From the beginning, the flirting between the two is off the charts, but both are hesitant to act on their impulses. Montana knows her time in Lakeside is limited, and Sam is wary of seducing a much younger woman who is also a client. But the temptation proves impossible to resist. So, Montana and Sam reach a compromise. They decide to indulge themselves for the summer with the understanding that there are no strings attached. When the project is complete, their time will be up.As I mentioned at the beginning of my , Miranda Elaine has that special ability to make a reader experience a wide range of emotions. She excels in creating fully-realized characters you can’t help but fall in love with. Sam and Montana are a perfect duo – caring, smart, funny, and sexy as hell. When the inevitable complications of their friends with benefits agreement kicked in, it was refreshing to read how these two uniquely navigated their emotions and insecurities. Even Montana’s pet pig shines in this book. Kermie is the ultimate scene stealer, so much so that I informed my husband I’m now considering getting my own mini pig!Fixing Him was the perfect follow up from this author, and I’m eagerly awaiting the release of Miranda Elaine’s next book in this series. Five enthusiastic stars from me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 28, 2018","Nov 28, 2018","Nov 28, 2018",,,view (with text),/book/show/40770600-fixing-him

With Fraud, I was treated to a psychological thriller which on its own is enough to show a wide range of storytelling by the author.This is the story of Natalia Gomez, a young woman who seemingly has it all. She’s married and a mom, living near her family in Florida. Although times have been a bit rough financially, she’s always believed that her relationship with her husband, Mark, has been a solid one. Until one day, it isn’t. When Mark returns home after visiting his family in California, something dramatic has changed. He distances himself from both his wife and child. Natalia is in a state of understandable upset and confusion when she crosses paths with her best friend’s cousin, Hayes Taylor.Hayes is eye candy distraction supreme. He’s from the UK, recently discharged from the British Navy, and now studying in New York City. He considerably younger than Natalia, unattached, and shares Natalia’s love of the water. While getting to know one another better at a beach outing, a forbidden attraction quickly develops between the two. This initially had me on edge, but it is also clear early on that both characters refrain from acting upon their primal impulses. The rest of the book takes place not over a period of days, weeks, or months, but over a span of years. We watch as Hayes and Natalia float in and out of each other’s lives. Both are committed to pursuing their own dreams, even so the two often wonder about how the other is doing. As Natalia’s marriage continues to deteriorate, the reader is left to wonder how long she and Hayes can withhold their mutual affection. To reveal much more about the plot would reveal spoilers that are best left unshared.For me, there were several surprises within the pages of Fraud. The second half of the book took many surprising twists and turns, and while some of my suspicions were confirmed there were several more that I didn’t see coming at all. Even though I was initially wary of Hayes and the toll his presence could take on Natalia, I stuck with the novel and was ultimately glad when I saw what fate had in store for everyone.

The story of star-crossed lovers, Adam and Livingston, drew me right in and I was intrigued to read more. After receiving a small glimpse of the second book, In Her Space, I was especially curious about the course Adam’s life would take.Beneath His Stars is the story of Adam Nova and Livingston Montgomery, two young people from two different worlds connected by a bridge. Adam lives in Madison, a place overrun with “homelessness, prostitution, and drugs” while Liv resides on an island just off the coast in the town of Saint Ashley, where life is more than comfortable. It is privileged. As they fall for one another, both Liv and Adam are aware of the odds. Both are intelligent and thoughtful characters, vowing that no one and nothing will interfere with their love. It is them against the world, and the world is full of characters who are determined to break them apart.Adam’s greatest enemy, the local sheriff, and Liv’s stepmother have teamed up to separate the young couple with devastating results. The two are driven apart for a decade, with Adam spending several years in prison and Liv shipped away to finish school. When their early attempts to reunite are also thwarted, Liv and Adam move on with their lives, each believing that the other has spurned their love.But even so, the magnetic pull between these two is undeniable. After college, Liv has returned to work at the planetarium that was such an important influence in Adam’s life. Rather than moving back to her luxurious childhood home, she chooses to live in Madison, sharing a modest apartment with Adam’s former best friend, Raven. Meanwhile, Adam has spent the past decade making a success of himself. When he returns home, hellbent on seeking revenge, he deliberately moves into one of the biggest homes on the elite island of Saint Ashley. Adam is hardworking, and determined to confront those who did their best to ruin his life. Consumed by guilt for what happened to Adam, Liv now concentrates her efforts on helping others in Madison overcome their socioeconomic obstacles.It is inevitable that Adam and Liv will cross paths, and when they do, neither is sure how best to move forward. There is an abundance of awkward tension as these two are consumed by the lingering hold of first love. Liv is now less of a dreamer and more of a realist, trying her best to keep Adam at arm’s length. Adam quickly recognizes Liv’s instincts to retreat from him, but he is tenacious. What remains to be seen is if Adam and Liv can recapture the magic of their youth and rediscover their love for one another.In Her Space is a worthy conclusion to Adam and Livingston’s story. While I ultimately felt that more of my heart was invested in the first book of this duet, the second installment offered a compelling storyline. Adam and Liv have been through so much together, and through so much apart, that they couldn’t automatically fall back into each other’s arms. There was no returning to the wide eyed wonder of Beneath His Stars, but the author did a great job of bringing these two wounded souls back together. They have evolved into independent adults, each with their own goals and philosophies, so it was impossible not to ask “what if” these two hadn’t been ripped apart in their youth. However, I did finish this series with a sense of true satisfaction for Adam and Liv.

The Darkest Corners is every bit the psychological thriller the title implies, but rest assured there is also a fair dose of romance to balance out the angst. The story centers around Maxwell Grant, a fading star of the art world, whose life and work has been forever altered by the tragic death of his wife. He has spent years trying to eke out his life one day at a time, and begrudgingly agrees to teach a night school art class. Having closed himself off from the world, Max struggles to make a real connection with his new students. He’s tempted to walk away from it all, but hangs on for the sake of his young daughter, Poppy, who has been deprived of a normal childhood. When Poppy makes a fast friend in art student, Harriet Harper, Max can’t help but notice the warm and considerate woman.One night, Harriet leaves her journal behind in the classroom and Max is lured by the temptation to take it home. When he reads the pages, he learns the woman’s deepest secrets. Max finds himself distracted from the woes of his own life by becoming obsessed with Harriet’s troubled past. Desperate to connect with another soul and determined to find out all he can about his new friend, Max inadvertently draws the wrong kind of attention to himself, Harriet, and Poppy.The mystery and story arc of The Darkest Corners is well-constructed and written, with many surprising twists and turns. I quickly found myself drawn into Max and Harriet’s stories. Although the novel contains plenty of dark moments, I was constantly filled with the hope that Max would find the happiness that had eluded him.I admired many aspects of this story.

Whenever Liv needs to put physical distance between herself and the demands of high society, she seeks refuge in an empty field that lies on the other side of the bridge - a spot that has a strong emotional attachment to her. Here, she spends many evenings remembering better times as she stares up at starlit skies.During one of these evenings, she is discovered in the field by a group of boys, including Adam. He begins a secret admirer type courtship with her by leaving notes inside a Coke bottle, pointing out different stars and constellations above and guiding her stargazing.

So when the chance came along to read the Wild Duet, I couldn’t resist the temptation.In this case Wild refers to the main character, Wylder Buchanan, a young woman in her 20’s who is up and coming in the industry side of show business. When the series begins, she has recently broken up with her boyfriend after discovering he has cheated on her multiple times. Due to circumstances beyond her control in her love life, she’s remained a virgin. But she’s decided the time has finally come to change her status. When she confesses her thoughts to her best friend, Kerri, who secures them both an invitation to one of Hollywood’s most exclusive clubs, a place where Wylder is guaranteed to lose her virginity. Wylder’s scheme plays out to perfection when she meets a gorgeous and anonymous man at the club. Their attraction is immediate and irresistible. Within moments of setting eyes on one another, they disappear into a private room for the rest of the night. The next day, Wylder returns to her usual life although thoughts of her night with mysterious man are never far away. When she is sent on a work errand she unexpectedly comes face to face with one of Hollywood’s most famous directors and realizes he is the stranger from the club. Once their mutual anonymities are stripped away, Wylder and Jamie Donovan confess that one night wasn’t enough for either of them. The two embark on a passionate affair, one that poses far more risk for her career than his. When the Hollywood rumor mill goes into overdrive, Wylder is also forced to acknowledge how easily Jamie could break her heart. She must learn to navigate the emotional roller coaster of love in the spotlight, while also struggling to find her own professional footing. The author has a background in television and film herself, so the Hollywood setting of this novel comes across as authentic, which lends a deeper interest to a compelling if unconventional love story. The first book of a duet ends on a doozy of a cliffhanger, so you’ll want to have to have the second book handy right away. I had to wait several weeks to see how Wylder and Jamie’s story concluded, and I tore through the second book in practically one sitting. Both novels are sexy and unputdownable. My one critique is that I ultimately didn’t see the need to split this story into a duet. Both installments are short and flow as one complete story. It’s possible that my rating would have been upped by a star if this had been a standalone novel, but this is a minor irk in an otherwise fantastic read....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 07, 2018","Oct 07, 2018","Oct 05, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41711100-wilder

But there’s never anything wrong with pushing past comfort zones and usual routines, and the first novel delivered from the first chapter.The first book of this duet centers on Harper St. Claire, a girl emotionally older than her years and on the verge of transforming into a woman. Initially, I wondered if her teenage voice was too mature for the character in the story, but my concerns soon faded. Harper’s life could easily be compared to a prime-time soap – family wealth, high society, and over the top drama. She bounces between the households of her divorced parents and endures a revolving door of subsequent step-mothers, step-fathers, and step-siblings. By the time she is introduced to current step-mother, Louise, and step-brother Christopher Bardot, her policy regarding their new relationship is deeply rooted – “I don’t want to mess with them. They’ll be gone next year.”In this case, Harper is only partly correct. While Louise quickly fades from her father’s world, Christopher holds on. Over the course of several years, a long-distance friendship and bond builds between the two former step-siblings, but despite Harper’s growing attraction and greatest wishes where Christopher is concerned, they are kept apart by one obstacle after another. Christopher comes from humble beginnings and his ambition and his acumen for business drive him to become a self-made millionaire, earning the respect of Harper’s father. From the first time me meets Harper, Christopher is compelled to protect her at all costs and when Harper’s father burdens him with a life-altering responsibility, the job at hand threatens their chances at a future together.But just when things couldn’t seem any more complicated, Harper is introduced to Christopher’s business partner, Sutton Mayfair. In looks and personality, Sutton is everything that Christopher is not. Despite pining after Christopher for years, Harper notices and appreciates the differences between the two men, and Sutton is immediately attracted to her. He sees things in Harper that she wishes Christopher could acknowledge. What quickly develops is an intense love triangle that made Survival of the Richest unputdownable. I was desperate for Harper to choose the man who was best for her. I bounced back and forth between Christopher and Sutton, wondering if there was one clear choice over another and even questioning at times if she should walk away from both men altogether. I won’t lie, the ending of the first book snuck up on me quickly and left me hungry for more. I had some time to theorize how the story of Harper, Christopher, and Sutton would play itself out. The chemistry between Harper and her love interests runs the spectrum of loving and intimate to primal and possessive. The Evolution of Man picks up not long after the end of Book 1. Passions between Harper, Christopher, and Sutton haven’t abated, but have definitely skewed darker. Harper has now focused her attentions on the restoration of an abandoned library and taking care of her mother, who is losing her battle with cancer. Christopher and Sutton have also apparently moved on, but it soon becomes clear that these three can’t leave one another alone for long. They are angry, hurt, obsessed, and in denial of it all. The trio inevitably finds their way back into each other’s company and when they do, the chemistry explodes. I wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t say I was hoping for something more from this second installment after such a great set up during the first book. Page wise, it wasn’t much shorter than the first, but I just didn’t experience the same level of tension as I had during Survival of the Richest. Perhaps the overall story could have benefitted from an additional story arc in this book. Perhaps not. Maybe I’d built up the possibilities for a sequel too large in my imagination. It just felt as though there was a missing piece to the continuation, although I can’t quite put my finger on what that piece is. It’s entirely possible these two books will read perfectly when they are enjoyed one right after the other. Ultimately, I didn’t feel as though the story was fully resolved, which makes me wonder if more installments will be forthcoming. Regardless, I did fly through this book and am going to rate it with the same 4 stars as the first novel. Warren’s narrative voice stands out from many of the other books I’ve read this year. Harper, Christopher, and Sutton are fascinating characters to read and if you’re in the mood for a passionate read with a fair dose of angst, the Survival of the Richest series is a great choice....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 27, 2018","Sep 29, 2018","Sep 27, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40491353-the-evolution-of-man

HSince reading “The Contract” a couple of years ago, it’s been a real joy to witness Melanie Moreland’s success in the realm of Contemporary Romance. Her stand alone books have always been enjoyable reads, so when I heard Melanie was publishing the “Vested Interest” trilogy I got a little giddy.I expected Maddox to be the perfect conclusion for Melanie’s trilogy, and in many ways, it is. When the author announced she would be publishing Reid’s story, I was excited for the chance to visit this corporate universe for a fourth time. Fans of “The Contract” should also be happy to receive another special appearance by Richard in this latest installment.Reid was a secondary character during the first 3 books. In many ways, the BAM men saw him as a kid with a genius level talent with computers. With his casual dress, messy office, and unconventional work hours it could be easy to dismiss him as a goofball. But whenever Bentley, Aiden or Maddox found themselves in trouble and had no one else to turn to for help, they quickly learned that Reid was the one they could all count on to save the day. Over the course of the series, Reid proved his worth and his loyalty to the BAM boys time and again.As a latecomer to the overall group, Reid has always functioned more like a satellite, his life always a bit of a mystery. Like the BAM boys, Reid grew up under a challenging set of circumstances, but unlike them he didn’t have anyone in his life to consistently bond with. Alone and adrift for much of his life, Reid fell into a life of crime and landed himself behind bars. It was only when Aiden decided to take a chance on him during a job interview that Reid’s life finally took a turn for the better.Now that he’s found a source of stability, he’s able to turn his attention away from matters of survival. This is when Richard’s former assistant, Becca, appears on the scene. Reid is immediately smitten with the dark-haired beauty with a warm, yet bashful, personality. He wants to date her, but he doesn’t have a clue how to proceed because he’s still a virgin. Instead, he spends his time making a Project B list, hoping it will help him figure out how to make Becca fall in love with him. When he accidentally e-mails his list to Bentley, Aiden, and Maddox, the BAM boys decide to nudge Reid into action.What follows is an emotional journey for Reid, Becca, and the reader. There is plenty to love about this novel. Scenes run the full spectrum from the laugh-out-loud hilarious, to the sweet and romantic, to the heart wrenchingly tragic. Through the course of the book, Reid comes to terms with the adversities of his past and how much he will allow them to impact his future. With each turn of the page, we watch as Reid transforms from a lost boy into a confidant man, ready and willing to fight for what he wants. The love story of Reid and Becca is as enjoyable to read as the previous installments of the Vested Interest series, but I also believe that this book, more than others, is also a story about the unconditional love of family. Bentley, Aiden, Maddox, and Reid were not born as brothers, but they found one another despite the odds and they know how fortunate they have been as a result. Word from Melanie is that more books from this series are in the works, and I will eagerly one-click them all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 09, 2018","Sep 12, 2018","Sep 09, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/40600876-reid

Although, I’ve been purchasing the books of the Shakespeare Sisters series, I hadn’t settled down long enough to read the first two installments. But when Absent in the Spring was released earlier this year, there was just something about the third book that begged me to pause and give it my full attention. I love it so much that when By Virtue Fall was set for release, I didn’t hesitate to seek this novel out immediately.This book focuses on the story of Juliet Shakespeare, the second eldest of the 4 Shakespeare sisters. Having married an American after a whirlwind university romance, Juliet has been living in Maryland for the past seven years. When the book begins, Juliet is running her own florist shop, raising her five-year old daughter, Poppy, and carefully extricating herself from a broken marriage. When Juliet is called to Poppy’s prestigious school to discuss an altercation with another student, she meets Ryan Sutherland, the father of the other child involved in the incident. Ryan has recently returned to Maryland to enroll his son, Charlie, in school. Having roamed the world as a freelance photographer, Ryan is looking to establish a small bit of stability for his young child, although his hometown of Shaw Haven is intended as a temporary residence.Despite their rocky introduction, Poppy and Charlie become fast friends, and their friendship strengthens when they realize they live next door to one another. As single parents, Juliet and Ryan often find their paths crossing, and the more time they spend together a mutual attraction grows. They are both artistic, they both understand the high society pressures of life in Shaw Haven, and they both have an appreciation of the world beyond the small harbor town’s boundaries. Juliet and Ryan are a perfect match in so many ways, but Juliet’s soon-to-be-ex-husband does his best to thwart her evolving independence and blossoming romance with Ryan.Although this is the final book in the series, it can be easily read as a stand alone and Carrie Elks fills in other essential details of the bigger picture effortlessly. I never felt confused or left scrambling to piece together information I may have missed in the earlier books. I am a true and solid fan of this series. Since finishing By Virtue Fall, I’ve also read the second book, A Winter’s Tale, and am eager to read the very first novel, Summer’s Lease. These books are heavy with romance and the unconditional love of sisterhood, and there is no doubt that The Shakespeare Sisters will be one of my favorite reads of 2018. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 12, 2018","Sep 16, 2018","Sep 07, 2018",,,view (with text),/book/show/40500101-by-virtue-fall

So when the chance came along to read Wild, I couldn’t resist the temptation.In this case Wild refers to the main character, Wylder Buchanan, a young woman in her 20’s who is up and coming in the industry side of show business. When the book begins, she has recently broken up with her boyfriend after discovering he has cheated on her multiple times. Due to circumstances beyond her control in het love life, she’s remained a virgin. But she’s decided the time has finally come to change her status. When she confesses her thoughts to her best friend, Kerri secures them both an invitation to one of Hollywood’s most exclusive clubs, a place where Wylder is guaranteed to lose her virginity. Wylder’s scheme plays out to perfection when she meets a gorgeous and anonymous man at the club. Their attraction is immediate and irresistible. Within moments of setting eyes on one another, they disappear into a private room for the rest of the night. The next day, Wylder returns to her usual life although thoughts of her night with the mysterious man are never far away. When she is sent on a work errand she unexpectedly comes face to face with one of Hollywood’s most famous directors and realizes he is the stranger from the club. Once their mutual anonymities are stripped away, Wylder and Jamie Donovan confess that one night wasn’t enough for either of them. The two embark on a passionate affair, one that poses far more risk for her career than his. The author has a background in television and film herself, so the Hollywood setting of this novel comes across as authentic, which lends a deeper interest to a compelling if unconventional love story. Wild is the first book of a duet, and does end on a doozy of a cliffhanger, but try not to let this discourage you from one-clicking this read. Book 2 is scheduled for release in just a few weeks and I for one am dying to see how Wyler and Jamie’s story will conclude.

At the time I knew I’d go on to pick up other installments because it was clear that Nancee Cain had created several interesting residents of the small Alabama town that serves as the setting. She has cleverly set up a multitude of story possibilities and when I read the premise of The Redirection of Damien Sinclair, I was intrigued.The story begins in an Atlanta courtroom, where divorce attorney Damien Sinclair has just won another case. His victory is short lived, however, when the disgruntled ex-husband viciously attacks him. The near fatal injury sidelines Damien, both physically and mentally. On New Year’s Eve, his childhood best friend, Harley Taylor, pays a surprise visit at his hospital bedside. When Damien is released from the hospital a short time later, Harley surprises him yet again by showing up uninvited at his doorstep and announcing that she has arrived to take care of him during his recovery.Damien bristles at the intrusion, and Harley has a magical way of touching his every nerve while also endearing herself to him. He begrudgingly allows her to stay with him, albeit with conditions. The two are long-time friends, but polar opposites. They are attracted to one another, but also frustrate the hell out of each other. The long-buried complications of their history quickly resurface and the sexual tension that ensues is nothing less than romantic comedy gold. These two can argue, and their hysterical squabbles immediately reminded me of Jamie and Claire Fraser. Damien and Harley are full of passion and it bubbles up in the most extraordinary moments. I laughed aloud several times while reading this book, but there is much more than great humor to The Redirection of Damien Sinclair. Harley and Damien are a fascinating pair – intelligent and artistic, sarcastic and kind, caring and sexy. They are perfect for each other, and watching them both come to this realization is an adventure well worth taking.I’ve read many of Nancee Cain’s book over several years, and without question this is my favorite so far. The story unfolded organically, without any forced emotions or manipulations. I truly believe that the author has found her calling in penning romantic comedy, and I hope she’ll offer more novels like this in the future.

Before picking up this book, I’d taken a bit of a reading break and was looking for something to pull me back into the mode. I’ll admit up front that I was taking a risk with this story because I haven’t read a lot of sports romances. But there was just something about the hockey player on the cover that captured my attention. And by the end of the first chapter I knew I’d chosen the right book.This is the story of Flynn and Myles, who grew up together in Canada. As a child, Myles was born into a broken home and was eventually taken in by Flynn’s family. Myles, Flynn and her brother, Oliver, grew up together as a tight circle of friends. When the two boys are drafted to become professional hockey players, Flynn and Myles are on the verge of falling in love with each other. But the close knit group is torn apart in an instant by tragedy.While Myles and Oliver remain good friends and hockey teammates, Flynn goes out on her own to pursue a career as a lawyer. Seven years later, Flynn finds herself living in Chicago where the two men have also ended up playing for the Blackhawks. Flynn has continued to keep a bit of a distance, but when she discovers her fiancé has been cheating on her, she moves in with Oliver. And Oliver just happens to live next door to Myles. When Flynn and Myles are finally reunited, they are both forced to acknowledge their long-held attraction is still thriving.The trio has done their best to move forward with their lives, but as individuals they have each run from the shared tragedy of their youth. As they learn how to be friends again, and Flynn and Myles realize how strong their feelings remain for each other, they must all come to terms with their loss and embrace what they want most from life going forward. Despite the tragic backdrop of Big Stick, there are plenty of light hearted and romantic moments to level out the plot. I was immediately drawn in by the authors writing style and character development. From the get go, I was invested in this story and had a difficult time putting the book down once I reached the halfway mark. I simply kept turning the pages as my hopes increased. I truly wanted a happy ending for everyone. Big Stick offers up a wide variety of emotions. It was written intelligently, and with a lot of heart. RC Stephens has picked up a new fan in me and I look forward to reading more of her books soon.

I’ve always heard good things about her and her novels, so when I was offered a chance to read an ARC of Cabin 12, I said yes without hesitation.Cabin 12 in the second book in the Rock Point series, but can be easily read as a stand-alone. This is the story of Bella Gomez, a paramedic attempting to rebuild her personal and professional life after being unwittingly drawn into a criminal scandal in New Mexico. She’s moved to Durango to surround herself with family and to reestablish her career. While her new assignment as a paramedic is going well, she is constantly challenged by her well-meaning relatives who still insist on treating her as the baby of the family.When Bella is introduced to Jasper Greene, an FBI agent supervised by Bella’s older brother, sparks fly. At first, the two get on one another’s nerves but when Jasper decides there’s more to Bella than meets the eye, he becomes interested in knowing her better. As his attraction for Bella grows, her brother asks Jasper to help look after her for several weeks while he’s out of town. The circumstances couldn’t be better for Bella and Jasper’s budding romance, except that a cop killer is terrorizing their city and Bella often finds herself at the center of the trouble.For me, there were several refreshing elements to Cabin 12. I loved that the heroine was Hispanic and that her family was prominently featured in the supporting cast. Readers looking for diversity in their fictional characters will be pleased with Bella’s strong personality and devotion to her family, despite her struggles to assert her independence. Additionally, Bella and Jasper are mature adults – she in her 30’s and he in his 40’s. Given the combined stressors of their respective careers along with unresolved personal issues from Bella’s recent past, it was refreshing to watch how these wiser characters dealt with the strife hurled at them. I also enjoyed the suspense of the unfolding mystery at the center of this novel. The plot was well-paced, the tension built to a fever pitch, and the action was well written. Cabin 12 is a great introduction to the writings of Freya Barker. I’m definitely going back to read Keeping 6, the first book in the Rock Point series, and won’t be surprised if I become a devoted fan of the author. If you’re looking for a refreshing and dynamic change in the world of romance, I enthusiastically recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 22, 2018","Aug 26, 2018","Aug 22, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/40821498-cabin-12

Having spent much of the past decade immersed in one vampire fiction after another, Connection offered a refreshing opportunity to settle down with a good, old-fashioned ghost story. This book is the story of Olivia. We are introduced to her when she is a grade school aged girl, just as she realizes that she can see and interact with spirits. She quickly understands that the ability is unique to her, forcing her to straddle the world of the living and the dead all on her own. There are frustrating limitations with her ghostly interactions that ultimately drive her to avoid or ignore one spirit after another. Her ignorance and fear of ghosts is compounded just before her high school graduation when she realizes that the frenzied phantoms she’s surrounded by often steal from the recently deceased.After several years of failing to find her place and purpose in life, Olivia decides to change her way of thinking. She moves to New York City, a metropolis absolutely teeming with ghosts. She rooms with another woman in Astoria, Queens and enrolls in NYU. During her daily commute into Manhattan on the N train, Olivia meets the man who will change the rest of her life. She learns his name is Patrick and that he was murdered on the subway twenty years earlier. He’s been trapped on the train ever since and happily embraces the opportunity to connect with another soul. Intrigued by the ghost’s charming personality, Olivia sets her lifelong aversions aside and befriends him. As her affection for Patrick grows, Olivia’s tentative hold on reality begins to loosen.In addition to the intriguing plot and strong character development, I was drawn into this novel by the lyrical narrative and the vivid depiction of early 1980’s New York City. Connection is one of those rare books that elicits multiple emotions from the reader. The author has struck that perfect balance of humor, romance, suspense, and wonder. At its core, this story illustrates just how spectacular the human experience can be. There are plenty of spoilers within the pages, none of which I want to share in a , but I will say there are few books that bring tears to my eyes. Connection had me openly crying several times as I read it. It is a leading contender for my favorite read of 2018, and easily earns a 5 star rating from me....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 11, 2018","Sep 11, 2018","Jul 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40904279-connection

I’m just days away from my next visit to Manhattan and, knowing that Liv Morris calls New York City home, I couldn’t resist a sexy novel set in the Big Apple.This is the story of Contessa Holly, a young southern belle and recent college graduate who has set her sights on a career in the publishing industry. Tessa leaves Alabama with an ambitious plan to secure a job in just 7 days so that her best friend, Maggie, can join her in the city that never sleeps. Within hours of arriving in NYC, Tessa catches the eye of an older, gorgeous man in the hotel bar. The two flirt across the room from each other without uttering a single word before he’s called away by another woman. (grumbles)The following morning, after a series of dreadful events, Tessa unwittingly finds herself standing inside the beautiful businessman’s office. Her mysterious admirer is none other than Barclay Hammond, CEO of Hammond Press, the publishing house on the top of Tessa’s dream job list. Barclay has recently taken charge of his ailing father’s publishing empire and is determined to grow the family legacy. With no wife and children of his own to support, all of Barclay’s devotion is focused on his career. When Tessa’s unconventional arrival in his office inspires him to make amends with one of his most important authors, he recruits the young woman to secure the publishing house’s future.From the moment Tessa and Barclay first set eyes on one another, the sizzle between the two is undeniable, and on the surface the two are well matched. Barclay is an established man in his thirties, and Tessa’s fresh outlook and youthful energy bring a much needed spark to his life. Tessa’s feminine and signature pink accents are a perfect complement to Barclay’s masculine and rich, dark suits. But there are plenty of complications for these two to overcome, including an annoying non-fraternization policy at Hammond Press, Barclay’s reluctance to jump back into the dating pool, and the significant matter of Tessa’s virginity. Bossy Nights is a stand alone novel well worth your time. I’ve read many of Liv’s stories over the years and this was by far my favorite to date. In particular, I admired Tessa’s determination and independence in pursuing her biggest dream. I’m confident readers will enjoy this sophisticated love story set within the fast paced and book world, along with Barclay’s smoldering passion for Tessa. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 21, 2018","Jul 26, 2018","Jul 21, 2018",,,view (with text),/book/show/34038337-bossy-nights

I read the book quickly, over the course of a weekend, and found many aspects of this enemies-to-friends romance enchanting.This is the story of Hannah, a strong and accomplished woman. Although she was born into a family with means, Hannah wants to do more with her wealth than pursue a life of leisure. She is the founder of the RISE Foundation whose mission is to empower girls to do everything they can to live their best lives. But rather than hire others to manage her philanthropic endeavors, Hannah is also the executive director, in the trenches every day, and leading the charge. Having extracted herself from a lackluster marriage and successfully launched her dream career, Hannah appears to have it all. The only thorn in her side is Roarke Baldwin, her ex-husband’s divorce attorney. Much to Hannah’s annoyance, Roarke has a frequent tendency of popping up in Hannah’s social circles. She always greets him with a sarcastic remark or two which his arrogance is more than capable of absorbing. The more unflappable Roarke appears to be, the more flustered Hannah becomes. When she finds herself in a last minute quandary that puts the foundation’s gala fundraiser in danger of being canceled, Roarke seizes the opportunity to save the day.Roarke’s innovative solution places Hannah in closer personal contact with the arrogant attorney, but as she begins to spend more time with him, Hannah’s defenses begin to lower. The ultimate questions are whether she can forgive him for dragging her through an acrimonious divorce and if she can ever trust her heart with another man.Happy Hour is a great conclusion of the Charity Case series. Hannah and Roarke are both driven and elegant characters. He is a sharp dressed, silver haired, sharp, and aggressive professional, and a perfect complement to Hannah. Despite their stormy introduction, he may very well be the one man who can restore her faith in love and passion.If you’re looking for a sexy, whirlwind romance featuring mature characters, then I gladly recommend Happy Hour to you. I enjoyed the story from the beginning and only found myself investing more of my heart with each turn of the page.

Whenever she publishes a new book, I know I’m in for a great story. She’s one of the authors I can easily recommend without having ped her latest novel ahead of time. Filthy Lies was exactly what I’ve come to expect from Raine Miller – a sexy romance, written with precision and another pair of fully developed characters that I can’t help but connect with. I often rate my 5 star reads based on how absorbed I become within the story. Filthy Lies rises to the level of one of my favorite reads of 2018 simply because I had trouble putting it down. This second installment in the Blackstone Dynasty centers on Winter Blackstone, a young woman born into great wealth but determined to use her fortune to make lives better for those in crisis. She’s pursued a career in social work with dreams of opening her own private shelter. She yearns to work within her own set of bylaws, exercising her own discretion to award assistance to those most deserving. Winter is single and content on focusing on her studies and work, but also battles with her strong attraction to James Blakney, friend and attorney of her older brother, Caleb. Winter fell in love with James when she was just 15 years old. Being 8 years older than Winter, James has always been that unattainable man. Now, that Winter is in her mid-twenties and living in the apartment underneath him, James is within closer reach than ever. Even so, James has avoided settling down with anyone since he was left at the altar five years ago. Only when his father makes an outrageous demand of James, does he begin to consider the possibilities of his future prospects and the woman who immediately rises to top of his mind is Winter Blackstone.One of the strengths between Winter and James is the foundation of friendship these two have built over the better part of a decade. Having known each other since childhood, they are comfortable and supportive of one another. But their admiration and respect have also served as an obstacle of sorts. James, in particular, is wary of drawing Winter into a shadier side of his personality, but when they both finally let their guards down enough to reveal their mutual desires, the pull is instantaneous and irresistible. When the sexual chemistry between Winter and James finally ignites, Filthy Lies becomes an explosive read. If you haven’t had the opportunity to read Raine Miller before, Filthy Lies is a really good place to begin. Don’t let the “Blackstone Dynasty II” frighten you away from what is an enthralling stand alone love story set within a family of outstanding characters.

HSince reading “The Contract” a couple of years ago, it’s been a real joy to witness Melanie Moreland’s success in the realm of Contemporary Romance. Her stand alone books have always been enjoyable reads, so when I heard Melanie was publishing a trilogy I got a little giddy.Maddox is the third novel in the “Vested Interest” series, and easily the steamiest installment. Having gotten to know Maddox in the first and second books, I’d learned enough about him to want to learn more, and I wasn’t disappointed. Set in the awesome city of Toronto, this new series follows three men who met at university. Long-time friends and business partners, Bentley, Aiden, and Maddox have taken their considerable talents and grown a multi-million-dollar empire from the ground up. Maddox is the numbers guy – a man who finds peace of mind from control and order over his world.Like Bentley and Aiden, Maddox grew up under a challenging set of circumstances. The lives of all three men only took a turn for the better when they were introduced. Working closely together, the trio have formed a brotherly bond and Maddox is the one who keeps their growing empire on an even keel. While Bentley is the visionary and Aiden is the protector, Maddox is the logical one that keeps their numerous projects on task and on budget. At this point in the series, Maddox is always a bit on the sidelines as Bentley and Emmy plan their wedding, and Aiden and Cami settle into their newlywed routine. Also left sitting on the sidelines is Dee, Cami’s older sister. Over time, Maddox and Dee keep finding themselves paired off by default in social situations. Although the chemistry between the two is soon off the charts, neither are interested in pursuing life-altering relationships. Dee in particular, has sworn off romance altogether, convinced that allowing herself to fall in love will also force her to sacrifice her sense of self.From the onset, it’s clear that Maddox and Dee are perfect for one another. They are a perfect match in style, intellect, ambition, and passion. What is a pleasant surprise, however, is how these two tightly controlled individuals surrender to their desires with one another behind closed doors. As Maddox and Dee lower their inhibitions around each other, the real (and tantalizing) question is whether or not they will stray from their self-imposed rule of no falling in love. In this case, the “will they or won’t they” question has absolutely nothing to do with sex and everything to do with allowing love to override logic.I expected Maddox to be the perfect conclusion for Melanie’s trilogy, and in many ways, it is. If you’re looking for a new and sexy world to invest in, I highly recommend the “Vested Interest” series. Fans of “The Contract” will receive a special appearance by Richard in this third installment. It was also a most welcome surprise to this reader when Melanie announced that a fourth book will soon be published.

I didn’t know the author beforehand, so I went in to this read completely blind. I’ve read a fair amount of second chance romances during 2018, and this one brimmed with potential for a great summer read.This is the story of Asher Kade and Temperance Price. Back in high school, bashful Temperance had a crush on popular athlete Asher. As teens, they noticed each other but neither made a bold move. Asher was focused on graduating and getting out of town as soon as possible, while Temperance was several years younger and not confident someone as spectacular as Asher would give her a chance. Ten years later, Temperance is still living in their hometown. She’s a single mother with a precocious daughter named Ellie. She has little time for a social life, focusing all her time and devotion on building a good life for Ellie. When Asher Kade unexpectedly moves back home to take over his father’s construction business, Temperance’s school girl crush returns with a vengeance. He’s sexier than ever, and this time Asher is keen to play along. He flirts without shame, yet always treats Temperance with respect and genuine interest.Even so, Temperance is scared to pursue a relationship with him. When her best friend intercedes and finds a way to draw Asher over to Temperance’s house for some repair work, her guard finally begins to drop. The physical chemistry between these old high school acquaintances is smoldering and as they spend more time with each other, it becomes more difficult to resist temptation.At the beginning of this book, I was convinced I was reading a classic romantic comedy, but as the story progressed, I realized there was so much more to the plot. Asher is a swoon worthy book boyfriend – caring, smart, funny, and sexy as hell. His budding friendship with Temperance and her daughter are a treat to read, and by the end of the book I was experiencing every range of emotion. Both Asher and Temperance have endured private difficulties and as their newfound love draws them closer, these difficulties fuse together in ways that strike right at the center of the reader’s heart.By the time I finished Fixing Her I’d laughed out loud several times, fanned myself more than once, nervously chewed on a fingernail or two and shed more than a few tears.

Since divorcing her husband five years ago, Chelsea has found professional success working at the RISE Foundation. Despite the heartbreak she’s endured, she’s still looking for her Mr. Right, albeit without much luck. When her boss sends her on a work errand to the tax attorney’s office, she suddenly comes face to face with her past. Dean Bennett has grown up a bit since Chelsea was married to him, and unfortunately for her, he’s also grown more attractive. Despite his matured looks and new career as an attorney, Chelsea is wary of Dean and his sudden reappearance in her life. As it turns out, Dean’s divorce from Chelsea was the wake-up call he needed to straighten up his act. He’s spent years turning his life around, hoping to become the man Chelsea deserves. And now that he’s ready to win her back, Dean’s pursuit of her is unrelenting. Even while the former couple can quickly fall back into their sexy banter, Dean knows he cannot simply seduce Chelsea in order to win back her heart and her trust. Dean will do anything it takes to show her that a tiger can changes his stripes.Afternoon Delight is a great continuation of the Charity Case series.

Hazel is looking for a way to get back on her feet after the collapse of her second marriage. She’s working part-time as a bartender and trying to survive on her meager earnings. She’s lost, not enjoying the life she’s living, but also helpless to change her circumstances.Then one morning, as she’s walking to the convenience store, she hears a pitiful cry from a large culvert. Realizing she has found a dog in distress, she makes an impulsive decision. Hazel has no means to care for the animal, but she cannot leave him to suffer alone. After prying the dog from a tangle of barbed wire, she carries him to a nearby, but deserted veterinarian’s office. She waits patiently for the animal doctor to arrive and when he does, a gruff man well into his seventies is her only chance to save the dog’s life. After begging and promising to work off the bill around the veterinarian’s office, he reluctantly agrees to treat the injured dog.There is a saying that when one door closes, another one opens. When Hazel steps through the doorway of the veterinary clinic with the malnourished puppy in her arms, her life is forever changed. Hazel takes a leap of faith in her decision to keep the dog, and when Dr. Peele names her new pet Atticus, his life also takes an unexpected turn. Everything that unfolds for Hazel and Dr. Peele over the next few years is a direct result of Atticus’ appearance in their lives.This story is uniquely told through two POV’s – that of Hazel and that of Atticus – and both make a lasting impact on the reader that follows this inspirational journey. The author takes great care in introducing and building all the relationships in this novel, and then weaves them together with beautiful intricacy. Atticus is a book anyone can, and absolutely should, read. It is a brilliant story of compassion, redemption, and unconditional love.

HSince reading “The Contract” a couple of years ago, it’s been a real joy to witness Melanie Moreland’s success in the realm of Contemporary Romance. Her stand alone books have always been enjoyable reads, so when I heard Melanie was publishing a trilogy I got a little giddy.Aiden is the second novel in the “Vested Interest” series, and what a follow up to Book 1. Having met, Aiden in the first installment, I’d learned enough about him to want to learn more, and I wasn’t disappointed. Set in the awesome city of Toronto, this new series follows three men who met at university. Long-time friends and business partners, Bentley, Aiden, and Maddox have taken their considerable talents and grown a multi-million-dollar empire from the ground up. Aiden is in charge of security – a natural fit given his massive physical presence and his ability to respond quickly to unpredictable situations.Aiden’s life hasn’t been a happy one, only taking a turn for the better when he meets Bentley and Maddox. Working closely together, the trio have formed a brotherly bond and Aiden is protective of this adopted family. Having decided he is too damaged personally to be anyone’s significant other, he pours all his love and energy into his work. When Bentley meets his girlfriend in Book 1, Aiden is introduced to her roommate, Cami. The attraction between the two is instantaneous, and they quickly pursue a “friends with benefits” arrangement. Aiden is clear with Cami from the beginning - their passionate encounters will never lead to a relationship. Regardless, the longer they carry on, the more complicated the situation becomes between them.Cami fascinates Aiden in ways he’s never expected, and she has the patience, and hope to believe that Aiden can commit to something more meaningful and long-term with her. Cami is that independent female character we all can’t seem to get enough of. She is loving, smart, charismatic, and strong. Even so, Aiden’s continued resistance toward a blossoming relationship between them is no easy course for Cami to navigate. The tension that builds as these two decide just how their future will play out is suspenseful and exciting.Aiden is the perfect continuation for Melanie’s trilogy. If you’re looking for a new and sexy world to invest in, I highly recommend the “Vested Interest” series. From what I’ve already glimpsed in the first and second books, Maddox can give Bentley and Aiden a run for their money, and the upcoming final installment telling his story is a solid and highly-anticipated addition to my TBR list this year....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,May 2018,"May 09, 2018","May 01, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/37748931-aiden

When sixteen-year-old Michael Sinclair defends Abby from her bully of a step-brother, she is forever haunted by an unrequited love for her knight in shining armor. Years later, when Abby breaks off her engagement from a man she feels pressured to marry, she finds herself on her own for the first time in her life. When Michael seeks her out to offer her a job as his personal assistant, her instincts tell her to run the other way, but she finds herself unable to resist the temptation.Michael is a successful philanthropist, running his own foundation and sharing his fortune with those who need it more than he does. But even so, he has a reputation as a womanizing playboy and once he sets his sights on pursuing Abby, she must decide whether she will be consumed by his attraction or if she will tame him and make him hers forever.As a reader, I resisted Michael Sinclair for much of this book. While he is a good man at heart, I found his treatment of Abby baffling for most of the story. It was only when Michael whisked Abby away from their hometown of London for a getaway to his beach home in Costa Rica that he finally began to gain my admiration. Michael’s tropical paradise second home is his favorite place on earth, and when he shared this piece of his heart and soul with Abby, the man she’d always fantasized about was finally revealed.Tame is the third book in the Mad Love Story series but is easily read as a stand alone novel. The chemistry between Abby and Michael is strong and the unresolved sexual tension between these two is intense. For me, the love story ultimately paid off, but my patience with Michael wavered a time or three along the way. He is a supreme alpha British male, who has no compunctions about pushing his love interest to the edge of heartbreak more than once.

Although, I’ve been purchasing the books of the Shakespeare Sisters series, I hadn’t settled down long enough to read the first two installments. But when Absent in the Spring was released, there was just something about the book that begged me to pause and give it my full attention.This book focuses on the story of Lucy Shakespeare, the eldest of the 4 Shakespeare sisters. As the first born daughter in a family without a mother, Lucy has spent her much of her life assuming a maternal role and the responsibilities that accompany it. As a result, she maintains tight control over her life and has thrived in her career as a lawyer.When her legal services are retained by an American to represent his interests in a contentious inheritance case, she finally meets her match in Lachlan MacLeish. He is a successful businessman, making his own mark on the corporate world even as he follows in the professional footsteps of his Scottish father, a man he’s been distanced from his entire life. When Lachlan inherits the Lairdship of Glencarraig from his father’s estate, he finds himself fighting for his birthright in court.Lachlan is that perfect type of man for me. He’s intelligent, looks magnificent in a suit, has a fun-loving and romantic streak, and fights for the family and the woman he loves with determination and passion. As Lucy spends more time with her newest client, she finds her self-control slipping whenever they’re together. The two soon begin a passionate love affair that is nothing less than pure magic. The connection between Lucy and Lachlan is palpable and swept me away into one of those perfect reads that I didn’t want to end.Although this is Book 3 in the series, it can be easily read as a stand alone and Carrie Elks fills in other essential details of the bigger picture effortlessly. I never felt confused or left scrambling to piece together information I may have missed in the earlier books. I am a true and solid fan of this series and am eager to read the rest.

Sydney is a master of sweet romance, an author that can captivate this middle-aged wife and mom with a love story set in high school between two teens. Sydney’s talent at immersing the reader right back into the highs and lows of adolescence is effortless.Between the Raindrops is the story of seventeen-year-old Scout Ramsey. Scout should be enjoying her high school years, but she knows little of normal family life.

I read the book quickly, over the course of a weekend, and found many aspects of this second-chance romance irresistible.This is the story of Victoria, a woman who is rebuilding her life after the end of her marriage. She has moved back from the west coast with her daughter to look after her ailing mother in Chicago. As Victoria strives to settle into her new reality her path crosses with Reed Warner, the best man from her wedding. Reed is a successful lawyer, making a name for himself with the District Attorney’s office. He is good-looking, charming, and a doting Big Brother mentor for a child in need. But he was also once her ex-husband’s best friend, and Victoria is wary of his sudden reappearance in her life. When the duo continually run into one another during the elementary school morning drop-off, banter is exchanged, chemistry builds, and soon Victoria’s defenses against Reed begin to weaken. Reed has many obstacles to overcome in Victoria’s eyes, but he has the determination and the patience to court this cautious woman with perfection.Manic Monday is a great introduction to the writings of Piper Rayne. I found myself crushing on Reed fairly soon after his introduction to Victoria and was quickly rooting for him to win her love. When he picks her up for a dinner date, I was swooning over the image of him driving her through the streets of Chicago …“Is it okay if we head out of the city?” he asks.“Sure.”“So, your mom’s good if I fly you to Paris for the weekend?” His face is serious. No raised eyebrows or sarcastic tone.“No, and you aren’t.”He reaches over and squeezes my knee. “I’m kidding. I want to impress you, but I’m not that guy from Pretty Woman.”Embarrassment hits me hard and I immediately lose all my spunk. Of course, he wouldn’t want to go to the trouble of doing anything like that for me. What a ridiculous thought.“He only took her from L.A. to San Fran and operas aren’t my thing.”He chuckles, shifting the stick around and then slowly eases away from the curb.“Damn him.

When I received the opportunity to read this novel, I went in blind but eager. I do enjoy a good Hollywood actor romance from time to time, and the fish-out-of-water premise intrigued me.This Time Around is the first book in the Love in the Heartland series, and is the story of Cooper Hawke and Rebecca Splendid, two people in the midst of heartbreak and left wondering how the rest of their lives will unfold. Rebecca is mourning the sudden death of her husband. She makes her living on her own farm, sheltering herself from the rest of the world by consuming her days with the land and the livestock. Cooper is one of Hollywood’s hottest actors whose ugly divorce is playing out in the media as the latest celebrity scandal. Looking to escape the public glare of the spotlight, Cooper’s agent offers a unique opportunity to hide out on his niece’s ranch in Kansas. She can use the extra help and he will be far away from the prying paparazzi.

Now that SaSS has entered its fourth year, the organizers have expanded their horizons by publishing an anthology of stories, contributed by authors appearing at this summer’s signing in Norfolk, Virginia.Proceeds from The Sirens of SaSS will benefit VETSports.org. This charity aims to set the standard for how to improve the physical, mental, and emotional health of veterans through sports, physical activity, and community involvement. Using sports as a catalyst, the organization brings thousands of veterans together and provides them with continuous opportunities to reintegrate into their communities through community service, events, and partnership. This anthology includes a moving foreword by Hazel James, a stirring poem by Julie Mishler, and 16 novellas. The book is dedicated to “all the beautiful and strong daughters, sisters, and mothers …” and all stories feature heroines who are strong, feisty, and alluring. All could be characterized as Sirens, gorgeous beings who lure their heroes in with their irresistible femininity. But unlike the characters of Greek mythology, the women featured in these stories do not destroy the men they attract. They challenge their lovers as they also nurture them.Different readers prefer different types of stories, and there is a wide variety of them in this anthology. In the course of reading this novel, I discovered new writers and read new works from my favorite authors. Standouts to me included The Siren’s Assistant by Amy Marie, Rekindle by Ann Mayburn, The Client by Jennifer L.

After all, what’s better than donating to a worthy cause while also indulging in one of life’s greatest joys?

The Prologue sets up the book so perfectly, I won’t even try …“Somewhere, in the dead of night, in a small, sleepy town, surrounded by the sea, two things happened almost simultaneously.Two things that would seal the fate of two unassuming strangers.A crime was committed, and a woman went into labor.As the stone carving of the town’s beloved memorial was crushed in anger, the perpetrator reducing it to nothing but rubble and the woman cried out for her husband in the middle of the night, two strangers, though worlds apart, had no idea their lives were about to change.For better … for worse … forever.And wasn’t that the way with this crazy little thing we called love?”Aiden is a successful sculptor. Originally from London, he now makes his home in New York City, As the book opens, he has just been delivered with devastating personal news. Reeling from shock, he next receives a call for help to replace a vandalized memorial sculpture in the remote beach town of Orcacoke, North Carolina. Aiden doesn’t hesitate to flee the city and put some distance between him and his predicament.Millie McIntyre is an ambitious career woman, working her way up in the fashion world. She walks into work one morning expecting a promotion, only to be publicly humiliated and resign by lunchtime. With nothing to occupy her time, she decides to take a trip to her hometown in the Outer Banks. Millie’s sister has given birth slightly ahead of schedule, and so Millie agrees to help out with the family’s bed and breakfast inn. Her first assignment is to pick up a VIP guest at the local airport and bring him to the B&B where he will stay while he works on replacing the town’s iconic centerpiece.Upon their introduction, both Aiden and Millie are not in the best of moods but make an impulsive decision to have a drink together, which leads to more drinks, which leads to the morning after when Aiden has bared his soul to a captivating woman and Millie wakes up in his bed, not remembering an iota of it.From here, Aiden and Millie are unsure how to proceed. They like one another a great deal, but neither has intentions of remaining in North Carolina for long. They both have secrets they’d rather keep to themselves, but they also can’t resist the attraction that builds between them. Eventually, they are unable to resist temptation, convinced they can enjoy their island romance and then return to the rest of their lives without complications. And as we all know, the road to hell is paved with best intentions …The Lies I’ve Told is a great introduction to the writings of J.L. Berg. I connected with Aiden and Millie, cheered for them, and shed a tear or two as reality eventually closed in around them. The cozy setting of Ocracoke Island is full of well-developed and interesting characters. As soon as I finish writing this , I’ll be adding Book 1 in the By the Bay series (The Choices I’ve Made) to my Kindle. Having now read Book 2 (The Scars I Bare) and Book 3, there are no doubts it will be an enjoyable journey. If you’re a fan of heart-warming, beachside romances and are looking for a new series to immerse yourself in, I happily recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 03, 2018","Jun 05, 2018","Feb 26, 2018",,,view (with text),/book/show/38771402-the-lies-i-ve-told

Earlier this year, I read ‘The Other OneI’m familiar with the author team of Jiffy Kate, mainly thanks to my involvement with Enchanted Publications. Earlier this year, I read ‘The Other One’ while traveling cross-country and was won over by the southern charm of the authors and the sweetness of the novel. So, when I had the opportunity to read their new release, I eagerly said yes. Watch and See was not the novel I was expecting from Jiffy Kate. In one simple sentence, this was the sexiest book I’d read in some time. I devoured this story, reading it in practically one sitting. I found myself sucked in by the first page and I was sad to reach the end. Watch and See is one of those books I wished would just keep on going. And going. And going.The plot centers on Harper Evans, a young woman who is just barely making ends meet. She has put her life on hold to offer moral support to her mother, who is battling drug addiction and has checked into a rehabilitation center. In order to be close to her mom, Harper rents a small apartment above a Chinese restaurant, where she discovers an abandoned pair of binoculars. With little money to spend and even less to keep her occupied while she spends her nights alone, Harper decides to take in the view of her city surroundings through the old pair of lenses. When Harper discovers the gorgeous man living in a nearby apartment, having sex with different women in front of his own window, her new hobby turns into an erotic obsession. When Harper can’t stop thinking about the mysterious and passionate stranger, she attempts to convert her deepest fantasy into a full-fledged reality.This is the point where Watch and See could have traveled down a predictable path, but instead the book is respectful of both its characters and the audience observing them. The story takes an enthralling turn that had me experiencing every possible emotion – excitement, shame, happiness, anger, love, and sadness. This is the perfect novel if you’re in the mood for something a bit taboo – think of Rear Window, with more sex and less murder. And please trust me when I say you’ll never look at a pair of sweat pants in quite the same way again. Without a doubt, Watch and See is a strong contender for my Top Read of 2018.

Dean meets Cora after a harrowing ferryboat disaster. He is hospitalized for a serious injury and she is assigned to be one of his nurses. Dean falls hard for Cora during his recovery but is saddened to learn that she is married and a mother. When he is discharged from the hospital, they both move forward with their lives.Several years later, after Cora’s marriage ends, she moves with her daughter to a small fishing village on the outer banks of North Carolina. She accepts a job at the local doctor’s office and is reunited with Dean. He turns out to be more than a local, he’s also the doctor’s best friend.As Cora and Dean struggle with their own private battles, they find glimmers of happiness whenever their paths cross. The second time around, the two pick up almost where they left off and build a friendship brimming with warmth and admiration. With a bit of distance from their personal obstacles, Dean and Cora find the ability to begin their individual healing processes with the support of one another. The more they heal together, the deeper into love they fall.‘The Scars I Bare’ is a great introduction to the writings of J.L. Berg. I connected with Dean and Cora as well as Lizzie, Cora’s adorable and highly intelligent six-year-old daughter. The cozy setting of Ocracoke Island is full of well-developed and interesting characters.

So, when I heard she was As both an author and a psychologist, Jennifer Lane offers a unique perspective on the characters she creates in her novels. So, when I heard she was publishing a suspense story, I sought out a copy right away.Twin Sacrifice is the story of two brothers, Matthew, and Justin, who endure a tragic childhood. When their parents are killed in a fire, the twins are brought up in the foster care of their father’s boss, Jefferson King. Although the community reveres King, the brothers are often witness to the darker side of the man who has taken charge of their upbringing. When the long-term circumstances of their involvement with King unwittingly hurl them into the seedy world of weapons manufacturing and terrorism, the twins must confront a dark family secret.Having battled mental illness for years, Justin is seemingly driven to the breaking point when he is accused of a serious crime. Although Matthew is a psychologist, he feels helpless when Justin becomes suicidal. Desperate to save the only family he has left, Matthew comes up with a drastic plan. The love and loyalty between the two brothers is strong, ultimately driving the plot of Twin Sacrifice and setting up a thrilling battle of wills between the two main characters.This novel is a not a romance and it contains plenty of dark moments. Reading the dedication at the beginning of the book will give the reader an idea of what to expect, and I would encourage anyone who might be on the fence to look there first before venturing further. For those who like psychological thrillers and intrigue, there is plenty to be found in Twin Sacrifice. I admired many aspects of this story. All of the characters were richly drawn and complex. I also appreciated the intelligence and common sense possessed by Matthew’s long-time girlfriend, Kate. The cast of secondary characters add an intriguing weight to the novel and enrich the overall plot by giving the reader hope that all those seeking redemption will ultimately find it. Twin Sacrifice is a great 4.5 star read for those who enjoy suspense.

HSince reading “The Contract” a couple of years ago, it’s been a real joy to witness Melanie Moreland’s success in the realm of Contemporary Romance. Her stand alone books have always been enjoyable reads, so when I heard Melanie was publishing a trilogy I got a little giddy.Bentley is the first book in the “Vested Interest” series, and what a lovely way to begin. I’ve always had a weakness for book boyfriends in suits, and Bentley Ridge is just my type. Set in the awesome city of Toronto, this new series follows three men who met at university. Long-time friends and business partners, Bentley, Aiden, and Maddox have taken their considerable talents and grown a multi-million-dollar empire from the ground up. Bentley is the leader of the trio – a natural who balances the responsibility of their corporate empire on his capable shoulders. Bentley’s work is his life, until he detours into a coffee shop on his way to a meeting, trips over a worn rucksack, and is introduced to Emmy. Several years younger than Bentley, Emmy is a student making ends meet on a student income. She is free-spirited, artistic, snarky, charming, and kind. Bentley’s attraction for Emmy flares almost immediately, reigniting his sense of fun.She gives Bentley homemade scones, and he reciprocates by placing his silk tie around her neck – a sweet exchange that gives him a thrill and cements Bentley as a swoon worthy book boyfriend. It is just one sampling of many wonderful moments between this most unlikely couple. The dynamic between Bentley and Emmy is sizzling and had me enthralled from beginning to end.Bentley is the perfect first installment for Melanie’s trilogy. If you’re looking for a new and sexy world to invest in, I highly recommend the “Vested Interest” series.

Dunbar and her books for a while now, I have to admit After Care is the first novel of hers that I’ve had the opportunity to read. Simply put, I found the premise of this second chance love story irresistible.After Care is the story of Edie Williams, a woman whose 20-year marriage ended at around the same time she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Having come through the most challenging time of her life, Edie and her children have decided to celebrate her remission with a Hawaiian vacation. And this is where Edie’s life takes yet another unexpected turn. While relaxing at the pool, Edie meets Tommy Carrigan. He is similar in age to Edie and, as manager of the famous rock band Collision, he is the epitome of the sexy silver fox. Tommy is barrel-chested, gruffly voiced, thickly armed, and covered with salt-and-pepper facial scruff. Within hours of their introduction, an intense attraction ignites between the two.Unable to resist one another throughout the tropical vacation, Edie and Tommy convince themselves that they are enjoying a fling. But as the return to real life looms larger and larger, the two discover they’re not quite ready to let each other go even as they’re both determined to return to the lives and routines they’re deeply rooted within. Falling in love with Tommy was not anything Edie was planning on but having embraced a new appreciation for that precious thing called life, Edie finds herself willing to toss old fears and insecurities aside to pursue new happiness. What’s left to be seen is if Edie and Tommy have the determination and the patience to work through the hurdles of maintaining a long-distance relationship. After Care is a great introduction to the writings of L.B. Dunbar. I really enjoyed Edie and Tommy’s story and came away with a fondness for the author as well as a new appreciation for the Darlin’ endearment. This is a romance featuring characters in their forties – individuals with a wealth of experiences, regrets, undying dreams, and a deeper understanding of what it takes to be happy.

Any time I read one of Beck’s books, I have a giddy reaction to locations I know well. Worst Case is no exception, and I delighted in the familiar setting of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. If you haven’t been to this beautiful resort town, you’ll just have to take my word for it. Beck describes it all elegantly – the geography, the atmosphere, and the residents – so much so that I felt a bit homesick for my former stomping grounds.But even setting this aside, I found myself blown away by this novel within the first few chapters. Beck is an award winning author and it shows here. Worst Case centers on ViVi, a teenage girl forced to pack up, move to another state, and immerse herself into a new high school just 26 days shy of graduation. And that's just the beginning of the story!On her first day of school, ViVi meets Win, and the two quickly realize they’re cut from the same cloth. Their friendship is instantaneous, but even so they both have family secrets they are compelled to keep private. ViVi and Win’s friendship and blossoming love is a joy to read. Both characters are intelligent, funny, caring and fully realized. You can’t help but cheer for these two, and hope that their fleeting time together in Coeur d’Alene evolves into something more permanent. Worst Case is a fantastic YA romance, and one I’d happily recommend for my husband, my 12-year old daughter, and absolutely all my book loving friends.

Having met and spoken wThis is the third book of Nancee’s that I’ve read, but the first of her stories that wasn’t set within the supernatural genre. Having met and spoken with the author numerous times, I can attest to her true southern charm, and the first book of the Pine Bluff series does an excellent job of immersing the reader into the rural life of Alabama, so much so that I was yearning to take her book and sit out on the porch with a cool glass of lemonade.I enjoyed the sassy banter between Dylan and Jennifer, as well as the fast wit amongst all the characters. There is great chemistry between Dylan and Jennifer, especially when they are far away from the prying eyes of Jennifer’s church congregation and Dylan’s entourage and paparazzi stalkers. Even if the characters are dealing with some larger than life dilemmas, there is plenty of heart to offset the extraordinary circumstances.There are still things I would have liked to learn about both Dylan and Jennifer’s backstories – things I felt would have connected me more to them, but overall I enjoyed The Resurrection of Dylan McAthie. Once I crossed the halfway point of the book, I found it harder to set the story aside and I finished the book much quicker than I started it.I’ll definitely return to Pine Bluff to see what happens to some its other interesting residents. There are a multitude of possibilities with this series, and I’d happily recommend this book to those who enjoy celebrity, sweet, and southern romances. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jan 2018,"Jan 10, 2018","Oct 22, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/34856637-the-resurrection-of-dylan-mcathie

Over the years, I’ve become invested in the literary worlds created by SR. I immerse myself in the settings with wanderlust. I’m challenged to learn more about art, literature, and religion. I fall in love with the most amazing fictional men (both human and supernatural). And I always get to do so over the course of a trilogy. This is how we roll.So, I’ll admit that I began reading this book with a bit of childish hesitation. There was never a question if this novel would be good. I simply wondered if one book about Nicholas Cassirer and Acacia Santos would be enough to satisfy me. What became obvious within a few chapters is that SR’s writing has a hit a new level of intensity with “The Man in the Black Suit”. There is a compelling boldness to Nicholas and Acacia. He is noble, but mysterious and seeking justice. She is tough, but compassionate and seeking peace. They are each cunning in their own way, but neither are motivated by vice. Even so, they must each decide what lengths they will go to achieve their deepest desires. And the ultimate question is whether these decisions will bring Nicholas and Acacia closer together, or drive them apart forever.SR has always been an exceptional storyteller, but as a long-time reader I also recognize that the author has done something new with this novel. Rest assured, all the elements we admire about SR’s books can be found in this story, but various boundaries have also been pushed and it made for a thrilling read. There is an abundance of everything in this novel – intelligence, culture, humor, political and spiritual intrigue, suspense, romance and, yes, great sex. Would I love to read more about Acacia and Nicholas? Of course. Was I ultimately satisfied by The Man in the Black Suit? Oh yes.Undoubtedly, one of my favorite reads of the year, and one of my favorite Sylvain Reynard books to date....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 11, 2017",Jan 2018,"Feb 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34329454-the-man-in-the-black-suit

Simply stated, I was thrilled to cozy up with Caleb Blackstone.Filthy Rich is the first book in Miller’s new Blackstone Dynasty and centers on Caleb, a successful American executive who devotes his career to the family business after the passing of his father. This branch of the Blackstone family hails from Massachusetts, with Caleb basing his home in Boston. He’s led the typical billionaire bachelor lifestyle, including international travel and international women. Now that’s in his thirties, he seems to be reaching the point when casual sex just isn’t enough to satisfy his longings. Brooke is a younger woman, British born but a resident of the U.S. since her teens. She’s endured a fair amount of tragedy in her short life, but has returned to Massachusetts to help care for her ill aunt and determined to make it on her own in the world. She works two jobs to make ends meet and this is how her path crosses Caleb’s.“I’d worked my way through the room, as I had been taught by my dad – by the best to ever work a roomful of potential deals – when I decided I’d accomplished what I’d set out to do tonight. It was time for me to go. After setting my glass down on an empty table, I started for the door … until I saw her.Just like that. She appeared in my line of sight and I couldn’t take my eyes off her.The beautiful girl from this morning at the Starbucks on Hereford Street.I knew it was her because how could anyone forget those sexy boots? Her blonde hair wasn’t down like it had been this morning, though. She’d pulled it back into a sleek ponytail … but she was serving at this event? I’d seen her go into that design studio next to Starbucks. She probably had two jobs. Industrious … beautiful … sexy.I quickly returned for my half-empty glass and snatched it up from the table. I suddenly felt like an appetizer or two.”The main thing I’ve enjoyed about reading the Blackstone men is their undeniable passion for the women they love. They are quick to decide when they’ve found love and they’re confident in how to pursue those they want most. I can’t help but find them to be spectacular men with good hearts and good (albeit intense) natures. Sure, they have loads of wealth and know exactly what to do with it, but as a reader I never feel they use their money or their power to control their partners. This makes the Blackstone men absolutely swoonworthy in all aspects and Caleb and Brooke’s story was a most welcome addition to the family dynasty.I’m waiting eagerly for the next installment. 5 amazing stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 26, 2016","Nov 27, 2016","Nov 26, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29965909-filthy-rich

I’ve always hearAlthough Rochelle and I have run in the same online circles for years now, I have to admit this is the first time I’ve read her work. I’ve always heard wonderful things about her writing and I’m just sorry it took me this long to sit down with one of her stories.Heavenly Bodies is a coming of age novel, focusing on a girl named Isla. At the beginning of the book, Isla is about to begin her senior year of high school and everything is going her way – she’s happy and successful at her school, she’s finally dating the boy of her dreams and she is excited about the year to come. Unfortunately, her grandfather falls ill. So just as the school year is about to begin, Isla’s mother makes the difficult decision to move to St. Croix with Isla and her younger brother in order to help Isla’s grandfather recover from a stroke. This decision uproots Isla from her secure adolescence and transports her to a tropical island where she only has some acquaintances and limited familiarity. It’s not an ideal situation, but Isla decides to make the best of things.When she begins the year at a new school and is placed into a required swimming class, Isla is forced to face her lifelong fear of water. She admits to her teacher that she cannot swim and is soon partnered up with Rigel. He’s not only one of the cutest boys at Isla’s new school, but he’s also the captain of the high school swim team and an athlete with true Olympic potential.***“Giving me a dubious look, he proceeds, bending so that he’s got one hand on my back and the other grazing behind my knee. I think I might die, right here, in this pool. And not from drowning. He tries to urge me back, but my body resists, flat out refusing to do what I want it to.“Relax,” he says, his voice quiet and close. “Lie back.”“I can’t – “ I start to say, but he’s already trying again, attempting to scoop me into his arms which sounds a lot more romantic that it actually is. Panicking, I smack him in the face. He quickly puts me back on my feet.“Oh God, I’m so sorry!” I cry, mortified.Grimacing, he wipes the water from his face and regards me. “You know I have you, right? I won’t let you go under.”“I know.”“So…”“So, I’m just not used to all of this.”“Is this a can’t swim thing, or an afraid to swim thing?” he asks.“Both, I guess.”His eyes track over me. “Did something happen to you?”“Just drop it, Rigel. I’ll try again.”“Nah.” He shakes his head. “You almost took my eye out.”If there’s anyone I should share my issues with at this point, it’s him. I can see he’s getting frustrated. Taking a deep breath, I say, “I almost drowned when I was a kid.”“That sucks.” He takes a deep breath, too. “But you need to get over it.”***It’s rare for me to read fiction set within high school, but I do appreciate when an author is able to capture that setting so perfectly. Rochelle’s characters read like real teenagers, with all their wonder, confusion, zest for life and willingness to take on the world without worrying too much about the consequences.When this exceptional character development is accompanied by Rochelle’s eloquent description of life on St. Croix, something magical happens. I truly felt myself transported to the Caribbean paradise as though I was enjoying my own bit of vacation. Overall, I really enjoyed Isla and Rigel’s friendship as it blossomed into something special and extraordinary. Heavenly Bodies is a charming teen romance and a novel I’d feel comfortable letting my daughter read should she ever express an interest in a good love story. It also made me a fan of Rochelle’s and I can’t wait to see what she does next.5 fabulous stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"not setNov 22, 2016","Nov 27, 2016Nov 26, 2016","Nov 22, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33035622-heavenly-bodies

But as in real life, circumstances are not black and white. Things aren’t as simple as they might appear and the reader is soon rooting for Skye Douglas and Caleb Lynch to find their happily ever after - together.Without giving away spoilers, I appreciate how this novel handles the rocky terrain of Caleb’s engagement to another woman while he falls deeply into love with Skye. It’s important to note that he is not the cheating type of man and that Skye is not the type of woman to seduce and tempt Caleb away from his fiancé. No one in this novel is a villain, and that more than anything else really drew me into the story. Sydney’s characters are not blind to their predicaments, and some of the best scenes in this story come from the interactions between Caleb and Skye in these uncertain moments:“Do you want to call me?”“I do. Very much.”She shakes her head. “One minute you’re terrified and the next you’re asking for my number. You’re very confusing, Caleb.”“I know. I’m going to get my shit together. I promise.”I just made her a promise that I don’t know I can keep. But I can’t let her leave tonight without having some way to reach her.Skye studies my face before sighing softly. “Give me your phone.”I offer her my cell. She quickly adds her number to my contacts before handing it back. Glancing down at the screen, I can’t help but smile when I see her name on it.“But Caleb?”“Yeah?”“Don’t call unless you mean it.”The tone of her voice is unmistakable. Soft but firm. Hopeful but cautious.Don’t play hot and cold with me.Don’t be an asshole.I wish I could promise I won’t be, but the truth is, I already am.This is the sixth novel of Sydney’s that I’ve read, and once again she effectively delivers a love story that is both sexy and heartwarming. Sydney has the wonderful ability of writing books that are expressive and family-centered while still instilling that critical component of romance between her lead characters. I can always visualize her books as movies that would be perfectly at home on the Hallmark Channel. Sydney’s writing never fails to pull at my emotions and I found myself smiling and crying several times throughout “Listen to Your Heart”. 5 wonderful and warm stars from me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 21, 2016","Nov 17, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32496477-listen-to-your-heart

As a reader, I love to learn an author’s stoThis is the first book I’ve read by Jami Denise and I always enjoy tucking myself away with a new author. As a reader, I love to learn an author’s storytelling strengths and the premise of the book told me I was in for a different type of read. Tiny Threads is the story of Jenna and Royal, a couple who met as teenagers and married extremely young. Despite the odds, their marriage has endured and they have made a stable and loving home for themselves and their children. After many years together, however, Jenna and Royal have hit a rough patch and find trouble connecting with one another. The core of the novel explores how this married couple deals with the strain of their stale relationship.As the main characters of the story, Jenna and Royal are drawn so realistically that I often felt I could be reading about any couple I’ve known. Royal, in particular, is complex. He’s one of the most authentic fictional men I’ve read in recent times. It’s easy to see why Jenna loves him the way she does. He’s clearly a devoted father whenever he interacts with their children, and he often surprises Jenna with sweet and sexy moments. Royal is a passionate man, but in subdued ways that only Jenna can recognize after many years of marriage. But it’s also easy to see why Royal frustrates the hell out of Jenna, too. He is only human, after all, and makes some mistakes that complicate an already stressful dynamic between the couple.“Once I had myself calmed down, I opened the door and found my husband waiting outside. He shoved me back in the bathroom and shut and locked the door behind him. Without a word, he lifted my small frame, sat me on the counter and kissed the breath out of me. His lips were soft but firm, and as soon as his tongue slid over my bottom lip, I moaned in pleasure.Maybe it was the adrenaline, but I couldn’t push him away. I loved the way his hands moved over my hips, urgent and needy. It’d been a while since he’d touched me that way, like he meant it. This wasn’t a drunk tumble or an attempt to be normal. This was want. Need.As our kiss deepened, my anger waned. Just as I pushed my fingers through his hair and turned my head to kiss him harder, the sound of my son squealing in the other room burst our bubble.“Don’t be mad, Jenna,” he whispered against my lips. “I didn’t mean to piss you off. I wasn’t thinking.”I sighed and leaned my head against his chest. “I don’t like you hanging out with her. Don’t you get it?”He let out a long breath and kissed the top of my head. “I do. She just needs someone to talk to sometimes. I feel bad for her.”It was like everything I said went in one ear and out the other. I’d pretty much demanded he stop talking to her, and he was going to do it anyway.Again, I was furious.I pushed away from him, swung the door open roughly, and stormed into the other room.”Tiny Threads is book one in the Snapdragon Series and although this story isn’t a cliffhanger, I was left wondering how Jenna and Royal would fare after this novel ended. Tiny Threads wasn’t always an easy read, but I was sucked into the story nevertheless, reading the entire book in just one day. I came to care about not just Jenna and Royal, but about their children, their parents and their friends. Each character I met in this book was unique and fully-formed and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next with this ensemble.In the end, I bounced between giving this book a 4 or 5 star rating. I’ve ultimately settled on 5 stars due to the effective emotional draw and the authenticity of these characters. Perhaps this book won’t be for every reader, but I found it to be a compelling, serious love story....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 21, 2016","Nov 21, 2016","Oct 23, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31521725-tiny-threads

In this book, the reader is submerged into both the 19th Century and tSimilar to Rumer's debut novel, What the Clocks Know features two time periods. In this book, the reader is submerged into both the 19th Century and the present day. Moving back and forth between contemporary times and the distant past can be a tricky task for an author, but this is one of Rumer's real strengths. She is able to provide a distinctive voice to each era, allowing the characters to act and react appropriately to the circumstances of the world in which they reside.Just in case you find the prospect of immersing yourself in 19th Century Victorian London a daunting prospect, let me offer a reassurance. Although the setting and characters of this time play an important role in the novel, the majority of the story takes place in modern day London.The novel primarily follows a young American woman named Margot as she navigates through that time of life referred to as the quarter-life crisis. Margot is experiencing a severe bout of restlessness, frustrated by a lack of direction and commitment in both her career and her relationship with her long-distance boyfriend.Eager to make a fresh start, she ends her romance and seizes the opportunity to study in London. She moves in with Rand, a Brit and former work colleague of hers from Chicago. The chemistry between the two flatmates is evident from the moment he picks her up at the airport.****Margot dropped her eyes and bit her lip with a nervous giggle as she gripped her suitcase handle tighter. Her steps faltered, but on locking eyes on Rand’s again, she felt a chord in her stomach pull her toward him as fast as those suitcase wheels would roll.“’Allo, guvna!”“Greetings and salutations, miss,” he said with a graceful bow. Rand had always been a gentleman. With no prompting, he’d stated his plans to meet Margot at Heathrow as though a matter of course and not the generous, out-of-the-way favor it really was.Her nerves melted away at his familiar lean frame and dancing eyes. He’d always had that good humored magnetism about him, yet he was even more handsome than she remembered. His full, wavy chestnut hair had grown out, and he looked dashing in a well-tailored purple dress shirt and the striped multicolor socks that peeked from beneath his fitted trouser legs – a look few corn-fed Chicago dudes could pull off. And there was no contest against his smile. It wasn’t the bleached white and capped American grin of false promises, but a slightly tea-stained and asymmetrical one that seemed to earnestly believe in keeping calm and carrying on.Once she set her bags down, Margot beamed at him with arms outspread. “It’s been so long! I could hug the dickens out of ya!”“The Charles Dickens, mind. You’re in London now, Yankee.” He grinned. “And you damn well shall hug me.”Margot could have stood in the welcome comfort of his arms for ages, feeling silly for her nerves just moments ago, but she made herself break away.****As the days and weeks go by, Rand and Margot enjoy a growing fondness for one another but it's not completely carefree. Rand already has a girlfriend named Gwen and Margot finds herself surrounded by strange occurrences and coincidences from the moment she arrives at Rand's flat. Puzzled and perhaps a bit unnerved by her discoveries in London, she quickly finds herself distracted from her studies and slides into a state of depression.Her erratic behavior catches the attention of Rand, whose sensitivities to her mental state are enhanced by his own experiences with tragedy. The two struggle to maintain their growing friendship, but what is evident throughout the story is the genuine tenderness and concern between Margot and Rand.As the story deepens and the reader experiences more flashbacks to 19th Century London, parallels between the two eras emerge and a larger mystery begins to form. The more Margot tries to make sense of what is happening to her, the more she feels her grip on reality loosen. Even so, she finds support and comfort from those she chooses to bring into her confidence. Although she often feels alone in her situation and her friends may not comprehend what she is going through, they (and Rand in particular) do their best to help Margot through her troubles.What the Clocks Know is a paranormal story well told. I found it to be intelligent, suspenseful and just the right amount of sexy. There are plenty of surprise twists and turns with the plot from beginning to end, and I'm always pleased when an author can craft a story that keeps me guessing all the way through.In contrast to Seven for a Secret, this novel is a darker tale with a slower burn, but nevertheless it made for an excellent read. I am more than happy to recommend What the Clocks Know to fans of the paranormal genre....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jan 2016,"Mar 24, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29368003-what-the-clocks-know

This is a book I’ve thought about a lot over the months, knowing my  would be wholly focused on William York. After reading The Prince and The Raven, I had hopes that The Shadow would be pivotal in helping me to figure out the mysterious Prince of Florence once and for all. When I read The Prince, William’s visits to Santa Maria Novella and the Spanish Chapel stood out in my memory as a great opportunity to study his true character, and I found myself replaying that scene over and over as I went on to read The Raven. Looking back at my e-book, many of the quotes I highlighted in The Raven were William’s. He said many things that struck a particular personal nerve with me, and many of them made me feel sad. Despite his claims to the contrary, there is much more to William than vengeance and darkness, and this left me speculating about him even more. Throughout the Florentine Series, I’ve treated William’s vampirism in the same way that I look at Raven’s injured leg. It’s an important part of his character and one that shouldn’t be ignored, but it’s also only one aspect of a complex personality. In The Shadow, we do finally learn some details about William’s life as a human and how he was turned into a vampire. And while these revelations did provide additional answers about the core of his character, I still wondered (and worried) about the eventual outcome for him and his Cassita. As a character, William has evolved dramatically in the course of three novels. During The Shadow, it is clear that William’s love for Raven is restoring his long-lost humanity, but it is also clear that things that are usually well within The Prince’s control have gotten away from him. He wants to protect both Raven and his beloved city of Florence and in the process exposes both to grave danger. The arrival of Father Kavanaugh in Italy was a particular standout to me. The interactions and reactions of Raven, William and the priest were exceptional, and the dynamics between the three characters in this part of the series were truly captivating. SR has hit his supernatural stride with The Shadow, and I was not one bit disappointed.As the upcoming release for the final book in The Florentine Series draws near, I’ve considered several possibilities for the ending of William and Raven’s story. How will the Roman, the Curia, and the Consilium in Florence ultimately deal with these unconventional lovers? A number of scenarios have presented themselves within my imagination, and this is the true magic of SR’s storytelling. Many theories are swirling, but until The Roman is released I won’t know which one, if any, will come to fruition....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 18, 2015","Dec 20, 2015","Jul 18, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25504865-the-shadow

The two meet in childhood, and their strong bond to one another forms almost immediately. They spend as much of their free time together as possible and quickly achieve an intimacy that even children recognize as a once in a lifetime kind of event.“From the moment we happened upon the treehouse, it became our sanctuary, our pirate ship, our castle, our hideaway, our place. We visited it every day after school.Trace and I shared all our secrets lying on the floor of our treehouse, from the juicy to the mundane, I relished the chance to share my day’s stories with her, and most afternoons I couldn’t get up that ladder fast enough. She’d perch her chin on her hands and smile up at me, awaiting whatever news I wanted to tell. I knew she already accepted my secrets before I even opened my mouth. Her presence draped me in an overwhelming sense of comfort.”Theirs is the kind of affection we tend to label as Puppy Love, and in our universe it is normally viewed as something endearing and sweet. Unfortunately, Piren and Trace do not live in the same world as us.In their society, children are assigned Partners by those in authority and are committed to their eventual spouses at the age of six. From a very young age, children are taught that no one but their assigned partner can be their best friend and they must adhere to a strict set of social rules until they are old enough to marry.They date no one but their partner and cannot kiss until age sixteen.They must begin living together at eighteen, but cannot have sex before marriage takes place at twenty-four.And they must never have more than two children.These are just the basic rules; and you can bet there are plenty of other restrictions in place. Any violation of the rules results in Banishment from everyone and everything they know.Despite the serious consequences at stake, Piren and Trace manage to find ways to keep and grow their friendship while still adhering to their societal expectations. However, this leads to near constant complications that begin in childhood, continue through adolescence and seep into adulthood.As I read this story, it was obvious that even a best case scenario for Piren and Trace would not be free of conflict and anguish. I found myself growing increasingly concerned for their eventual outcomes with each turn of the page. Missing Pieces is a tension rich story, yet despite the logical probabilities that consume Piren and Trace, both characters stubbornly cling to the hope that they will find a way through their tribulations together.As a result of their defiance, there isn’t much that comes easily to Piren and Trace. The author, Meredith Tate, doesn’t shy away from allowing her characters to be damaged, and this kind of fearlessness in writing is a trait I have come to admire. It can be difficult to put your characters through hell, subjecting them to their worst nightmares come true; but we all know that nothing worthwhile in life is ever easy to secure.Don’t allow the youth of these characters to steer you away from giving this book a try. Piren and Trace may be young, but their lives are full of raw intensity. These characters shouldn’t be required to become wholly focused on adulthood responsibilities, but because they are their story is a mature and cautionary tale.You will experience a wide range of emotions while reading Missing Pieces and I give tremendous credit to Meredith Tate for striking the perfect balance between all of them.This is a 5 star read that I highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 08, 2015","Mar 24, 2015","Mar 08, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/24903132-missing-pieces

Having already read another one of Beck Anderson’s novels, I was confident I would be treated to a good story in Fix You. I’m happy to report that was exactly the case.Both Fix You and The Jeweler feature heroines who are dealing with loss and grief, which can be a difficult emotion to write about. It can be easy to over-dramatize the emotions associated with deep loss, just as easily as it can be to underwhelm a reader with a character’s apparent lack of feeling while mourning a loved one. Just as when one writes about love, there is a fine balance to be maintained when addressing the delicate subject of death and grief. Beck Anderson has proven to me, not just once but twice, that she can convey these complicated emotions organically with her characters and I greatly admire this skill of hers.When Kelly Reynolds loses her husband at the beginning of Fix You, the reader is taken along on her journey to mourn and to move on with life so that she can remain an involved and caring mother for their two children. In the process of recovery, Kelly finds herself on vacation with her sons and her parents in California. One morning she goes out for a jog and ends up running into one of the world’s most sought after movie stars. One brief introduction to Andy Pettigrew, the famous actor, leads to another brief interlude and soon Kelly finds herself easing into a most unlikely new friendship.“Remember when you were first learning to drive?” I take another deep breath. I’m not sure if I’ve been breathing in any reliable way since we crossed the condo’s threshold.“Yeah, I do, actually. Everything was a giant ordeal. My dad took me out in our neighborhood. I sneezed and ran the car up on Mr. Hattingfield’s yard. Took out his mailbox.”“I haven’t been very social lately – except with people I know. Heck, since the boys were born, I haven’t been super social at all. Okay, I wasn’t ever amazingly social to begin with.”“But your point?” I think he’s kind of grinning. At me. He could be close to laughing.“I have one. Stop smiling. You’re not helping. The point is, I’m back at the aware-of-every-little-part-of-a-social-interaction stage. Like beginner driving, when you check the mirrors, and you have to think, Turn on the blinker. That’s the stage I’m in. I don’t even know where to look. Do I look right at you the whole time we talk? Do I look you right in the eye?”I stop to breathe for a second. He turns the mug all the way around by the handle before he responds, his eyes on the tea bag. “You’re fine. You need to breathe, and you need to not tap the spoon on the table. Other than that, I find you pretty socially capable. I might even venture to say charming.”“Where do I look?” This has devolved into a social etiquette class offered by a movie star to a woman whose mind has completely left her in her moment of need.“You can always look at me.” He looks up from the mug, right into my eyes.I agree. I think I could look at him for a nice long while.Naturally, Andrew (as he prefers to be called) prefers to keep his personal life as private as possible, and given the situation Kelly is currently working through her mindset is in a similar place. The two enjoy a budding but secret friendship, and when Andrew makes an unexpected visit to Kelly’s hometown of Boise, he soon finds that her quiet lifestyle is exactly the kind of life he dreams to call his own. The two spend limited time with one another but quickly come to rely on each other for a much needed change of pace from their individual normal routines.Content in their bubble of distraction, Kelly and Andrew easily find ways to avoid sharing some of their deeper personal struggles with one another, but as their affection for one another begins to grow hiding these issues becomes more and more difficult. Both Kelly and Andrew are in mentally fragile places and Fix You soon transforms into a dramatic love story as a result.I’ve enjoyed reading Beck Anderson’s books recently and it is easy to see why Fix You was picked up by Gallery Books for a re-release. Beck is a skilled storyteller and she navigates her characters quite naturally through some very extraordinary circumstances. As a reader, I experienced a wide variety of emotions while immersed in the story and practically read this book through in a single day, after finding it nearly impossible to set down.For those of you who enjoy a good Hollywood novel or a story about finding love a second time around, I highly recommend Fix You. I happily rate it 4.5 stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 20, 2015","Feb 21, 2015","Feb 20, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24644842-fix-you

For me, there was a familiarity with The Jeweler that was particularly endearing. The story is set in Boise, IdI’ll make one statement right upfront. For me, there was a familiarity with The Jeweler that was particularly endearing. The story is set in Boise, Idaho, which is a place that many of my family and friends call home. We travel there for family events every once in a while and so I recognized many of the settings used in this novel (the scene at the Record Exchange was a particular favorite). There’s even a mention of an Oregon coast town that I know well and it really helped me connect on a deeper level with the book. It was as though I was reading about people I already knew.The synopsis above does a stellar job of explaining the overall plot, so I won’t bother to recap the summary here. I’d rather spend my limited  space highlighting the one big note I made about The Jeweler as I read it. There’s a unique spin on this romantic tale that I don’t often come across in such stories. Ready?While this is a narrative written in third person, and explores the perspectives of Ginger and Fender, I found that much of the romantic story unfolded from the male point of view.“Fender looked back on his “wasted youth” and didn’t feel regret; he just felt sorry for his dad. Oh, to have a son who excelled in mediocrity, with a side of troublemaking. This was yet another reason to never have children; they might inherit his juvenile delinquency. And another reason not to get married. But Fender was constantly reminded why he despised marriage, regardless. Every time he’d craft a delicate setting with a pale, clear diamond, and it went on the hand of a crass, selfish gold digger, or some cheating, sweaty lout gave a necklace of blood red rubies to his unsuspecting, hard-working wife, Fender remembered how he felt about the sacred institution.”Not only does the reader become well-accustomed with Fender’s thoughts and feelings about romance in general and Ginger in particular, but many of the story conflicts and solutions are largely driven by the male influences in Fender’s life. Fender’s best friend, Sam, is the epitome of the Pacific Northwest bachelor. He lives a quiet, unassuming life and enjoys smoking, Carhartt coveralls and beer. He’s perfectly content and could truly care less if people can’t deal with his choices. But he’s also warm and loyal and willing to help Fender figure out his dilemma with Ginger. He pushes Fender to stray outside his romantic comfort zones, and stays right by his side through thick and thin.Another source of male guidance and support is Fender’s father. Not only has he looked after Fender emotionally, he has also provided his only child with an established jewelry business for financial security. Having grown up without a mother and with no other siblings, Fender’s experiences with women are largely limited. Until his life intersects with Ginger’s under a set of tragic circumstances, Fender has kept his interactions with women casual, seemingly as Sam and his father sit on the sidelines waiting for Fender to discover something or someone special.Pop’s questioning gray eyes were still trained on Fender, and his sparse mustache twitched with curiosity. “Tell me, Sonny. What’d you do today?”“Nothing.” The day had been humiliating enough. He didn’t want his dad to know on top of it all.“Jerry, he was in fine form.” Sam sat across the table from them, out of Fender’s striking distance.Fender tilted his head and shot his most withering look at Sam. “I went skiing.”“No, no, it’s better than that. We went after this girl, and Fender learned how to ski all over again. He also tried to use two old ladies as bowling pins.” Sam’s shoulders were shaking again.As per usual, Pop focused on the woman in the conversation. “Fender went after a girl? Really? Does this mean little Sandy didn’t make you swear off women forever?”Sam brightened. “I’d almost forgotten about Sandy. Isn’t she the one that wrote I HATE YOU with weed killer on your front lawn?” Sam sat back and stretched his arms out on the top of the booth, relaxed and apparently prepared for a stroll down Fender’s memory lane of exes.“As The Jeweler unfolds, we see that even Ginger tends to rely on the support and advice of these two gents; and as a captivated reader I was glad to see her do so. For these reasons, this novel was an enchanting and refreshing read for me. I’ve become a true fan of Beck Anderson as a result, and I’m hoping that she’ll be willing to meet up with me in downtown Boise the next time I happen to pop into town for a visit. The author has that special ability to infuse both tragedy and humor into a novel without skewing to extremes with either. Not only is this novel filled with characters I swear I already know, it tells a story that is as realistic and fragile as it is courageous and surreal. Just like life.An enthusiastic four star read from me!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 26, 2015",Feb 2015,"Jan 26, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/23015771-the-jeweler

Admittedly, this was a bit of a risk but I’m happy to say that the book can easily be read as a stand alone novel. And perhaps the even better news is that I now plan to backtrack and read the others in this series.The easy description of this novel is to call it a zombie story, but it is a zombie story with what I considered to be a unique angle. The main character of the book is a young woman named Soren Mitchell. Born in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, Soren is a living, breathing, conscious human who happens to possess many of the physical traits of a zombie. While her zombie-like appearance and her tendency to enjoy extremely rare meat make it difficult for other humans to trust her (most humans initially are inclined to kill her at first sight), these traits also make it possible for Soren to come into direct contact with zombies (also referred to as Deads) without danger of being attacked.At the beginning of Love Starts With Z, we learn that Soren has left the colony of humans she was born into and raised by to live with a different colony. The purpose in doing so is to assist researchers in their quest to develop a cure for the deadly zombie outbreak that constantly threatens to wipe out the dwindling human race. In this new colony, Soren is treated more like a Dead than a human. She is forced to adhere to a strict series of rules developed to protect humans, but at the cost of dehumanizing Soren. Despite the inhumane treatment, Soren endures in ultimate hopes that her personal sacrifice will benefit mankind.Amidst this chaos, a young man named Kaegan Langford finds himself at Soren’s colony. Once he’s made aware of her existence, Kaegan becomes infatuated by Soren. What begins as intense curiosity in Soren soon develops into something much more substantial. Kaegan finds her treatment by others in her colony cruel and is soon inclined to become a defender of the mysterious young woman.Anger coursed his veins, red and blinding until all he could think about was wrapping his fingers around Colten’s throat. Closing his eyes, he counted to ten, and then ground out, “If you call her a zombie again, your nose will match Mark’s.”“Geez, man. You’re so touchy now.”“He’s got it bad,” Ben said.Bad? Nah. He’d liked girls before. It had been a few years since he’d had any kind of steady relationship with one, but bad? So he thought about her more than was maybe healthy. And he worried about her wellbeing. And when people insulted her, he wanted to kill them slowly. Okay, so maybe he did have it worse than he ever had before, but it was Soren. She was different. Not just the way she looked, which enamored him more every time he saw her, but she was kind. Not polite-kind to trick people into liking her, but she was someone who honestly cared about the feelings of others. And she did what she thought was right no matter what anyone else thought of her. She was respectable, beautiful—this gorgeous warrior who had consumed him, mind and body, without any effort at all. And when she fought? She was an artist.“Hello,” Colten said, waving his hand in Kaegan’s face.Irritated, he swatted it away and ducked a low hanging branch.Soon, a friendship begins to grow between Kaegan and Soren and the two allies quickly find themselves caught up in circumstances that accelerate both the depth of their connection and their respect for one another.While I’m pretty open to reading books of all kinds, I do have to admit that I’ve never sought out zombie stories. What I enjoyed about Love Starts With Z was that while the zombie outbreak is an integral part of the overall plot, this novel is really more about how humans can sometimes be more frightening than the numerous Deads wandering aimlessly in search of brains. The unusual dynamic that develops between Soren and Kaegan made for a compelling read, and ultimately I found their eventual outcome uncertain due to the unconventionality of their relationship.The action scenes were well-written, the various characters were numerous and interesting, and the emotional scenes were captivating. There were great moments of suspense and swoon, and I’d happily recommend the Dead Rapture series to anyone looking to read something a bit outside the usual realms of the typical romance novel....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 15, 2015","Jan 26, 2015","Jan 15, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24325289-love-starts-with-z

I agreed to receive an ARC in exchange for an honest  and I’ve been mulling over my thoughts on this book for a couple of weeks now.The story begins with Erin Proctor, a successful and single career woman who has just relocated from California to North Carolina. She does so not only to pursue a promising job opportunity, but also to put some distance between herself and her mother and sister (who have always depended on Erin to be the responsible one). Having secretly possessed a curiosity about the taboo world of BDSM, Erin now finds an opportunity to indulge her interests in a town full of strangers. After being invited by an acquaintance to a *demonstration*, Erin is introduced to Walt Easton at the event.The attraction between Erin and Walt is sparked almost immediately, but not in the overtly sexual way I would have expected. Erin and Walt genuinely like one another and their friendship forms in a quiet, even sweet way. By day, Walt is a responsible and unassuming Park Ranger, but he’s also been an *ahem* active Dominant for most of his adult life. Erin know this and is intrigued by him…He was recalling last night. I knew it, in another atypical flash of human-focused intuition. Felt it, really, as a plume of heat rolled down my neck.I cleared my throat. “Thank you for inviting me. I’m sure it’s unusual, asking someone to your workplace who’s from…well, you know—there?”He glanced away, turning the brim of his hat through his hand, then gestured toward me.“I’m glad you came.”The timbre of his voice never changed, but the volume softened appreciably. Before I could stifle the thought, I wondered what his voice would sound like in the morning, across from me in my bed, or in my ear as his thick thighs rode between mine, behind me as he grasped my hair and drove into me again and again.Warmth quite unlike anything I’d known spread, from that first shimmer across my neck, to my shoulders, and sparked a fuse traveling straight down my spine.His mouth twitched slightly, then spread into a disarmingly sweet smile as his eyebrows lifted. A small rumbling chuckle escaped his chest, and then Walt the Park Ranger with matching floggers shocked the hell out of me. His eyes darted toward the parking lot, he looked down, and the tips of his ears flushed.“I think it’s just us,” he said, still looking away, and put his ranger’s hat on. “Want to get goin’?”“Yes, of course.” I bristled inwardly at the sound of my own voice: too efficient, mechanical, harsh.As we walked across the wooden bridge at the trail’s head, I settled into a pace a little slower than his. Practically, his legs were much longer and he would constantly trip over me if I lead. Letting him lead made sense.An added benefit was a better view of the movement of his legs against his dark olive green pants, and the round, muscular backside that rippled in differing defined landscapes with each step. His pale green ranger’s shirt stretched across his broad back as his arms swung, revealing even more refined muscles. They strained slightly against the short sleeves before continuing on to tanned forearms, scattered with brown hair.I pushed a damp strand of hair from my neck. Only May and it’s this humid?On the other side of the spectrum, Walt is a man who has sworn off relationships in favor of play. When he is introduced to Erin, he immediately knows that she is new to the scene; but he also senses there is a deeper yearning brewing within her. Something more than the mere exploration of her deepest sexual fantasies. Walt intuits (correctly) that Erin wants to experiment as a submissive and he offers her careful guidance as she delves more and more into a lifestyle she knows precious little about. What I found welcoming about Walt was his concern for Erin’s well-being. He is not an alpha man simply looking to take advantage of a naive woman. Walt values and respects Erin and strives to nurture her burgeoning sexuality.“So how long have you been in…um, known Cla—clover?”“How long have I known Claire or how long have I been in the lifestyle?” He took a long drink from his water bottle. “Or how long have I been kinky?”“I don’t know.” His directness pinned me down, with no easy route to a more comfortable means of discovering everything I wanted to know about him. I wanted to hear his version of this thing—a lifestyle, maybe—he shared with Claire. And I did want to know, not only because I should if what felt like our mutual attraction became something more, but because of him. Already, I liked him. I wanted to know Walt’s story. Maybe all of them.“Kinky. How long?”Glancing over at me with a wry half-smile, he laughed softly. “Straight to the point, huh?”I shrugged, pulled at a stray peanut and bit into it. “I suppose. I wonder about things, though.”“About?”“About people. I’m curious about how people figure things out. Not just with—” I gestured toward the forest, like it was where I’d find the perfect example of the parts of BDSM I always was curious about. “That. Being into that.”“Hey, Erin,” he said, tipping his shoulder toward mine like a conspirator. “If you have a hard time saying it, you might want to reconsider giving it a try.”As I read Closer and Closer, I was completely won over by Erin and Walt. Their relationship may not be defined by convention, but it is wholly real. It is emotional and complex, intelligent and sensual. And while all my attention in this  is focused on them, this book also contains a fabulous ensemble cast of characters, each as well-developed and captivating as the two leads. This novel is the first in the new Enclave series by author Jenna Barton, and I’ve been given a few clues by the author as to what comes next.I’ve thought a lot about this story (and definitely about Walt) over the past few weeks and I’ll be on pins and needles waiting for the forthcoming books! I’ve been spoiled lately with several 5 star reads, and I’ll happily add this story to that list....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 08, 2015","Jan 15, 2015","Jan 08, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24324729-closer-and-closer

I read The Prince in a single evening and found it an intriguing introduction to the underworld of Florence, Italy.Much of the vampyre lore I observed in The Prince was not unfamiliar, but I did enjoy how SR put a special twist on some of the usual rules. The moment when the Prince visits Santa Maria Novella and the Spanish Chapel stands out in my memory as a great opportunity to study his true character, and I found myself replaying that scene over and over as I went on read The Raven. In the novella, The Prince witnesses a private moment between Gabriel and Julia Emerson that stays with him and begins to influence his choices during The Raven. I find the complexity of his character absorbing. The Prince’s vampirism is a trait that cannot be ignored, but I see it as merely one aspect of a very complicated individual.While it was comforting and familiar to read more about the Emersons in The Prince, I was also delighted to be introduced to a new ensemble. Aoibhe is a particular standout, nearly stealing every scene she appears in. She is a fascinating character and, truthfully speaking, I’d love to see a novella that focuses on her. She is cunning and ambitious and I think she has a deeper hold on The Prince than he’s willing to admit to anyone, even himself.  For those who may be nervous about venturing into the paranormal world created in The Florentine Series, I can say with confidence that there is still plenty of romance within the new saga; and I think SR’s exploration on the themes of justice and mercy have made for a compelling read. Fans of Sylvain Reynard are in for one hell of a ride. SR has created a brilliant, supernatural universe in the underworld of Florence.

Although both are told simultaneously and are set in the same city of Chicago, they take place 75 years apart from one another. One story takes place during the Roaring 20’s and is centered around Lon and Eva. Lon is a man who is attempting to discover his own place in the world, away from the societal expectations of his upbringing.“Staring down at the floor as he strode deeper down the corridor, Lon lost his focus in observation of the intricate design, step after colorfully tiled step – until his wingtips stubbed against a marble lip rising about an inch from the floor. He looked up to meet the life-sized stone likeness of a courtier wooing a fair maiden above a fountain. The couple was white as purity and forever frozen mere inches from embrace.“The thrill of the chase,” Lon murmured. “The only thrill there is.”Lon isn’t looking for love, but finds it anyhow when he attends a party and meets Eva, a young and intelligent woman who immediately captures his eye.“There was no doubt about it: she was exquisite.

Absence was only making things foggier so far.”Kate’s desire to establish some personal distance from Dexter provides some potential complication when she notices a good looking stranger in her new building – a man she soon begins to speculate is her next door neighbor.“Suddenly shy and anxious about what might happen next, she turned to press her palm against the wall behind her. It felt warm, a soothing contrast to her room that had just turned so cold. She imagined Hot Neighbor sitting there with his hand against the wall, too, directly opposite her. What if he’d noticed her before and wanted to get her attention? Maybe seen her around sometime, even if just out his window, and then followed the sound of her footsteps and door slams to trace her to this unit? Kind of stalkerish, but awfully flattering, Kate thought. After all, she was doing the same thing with him.”The historical love story is dramatic and dark, while the modern contemporary tale is lighter and humorous. At first glance it might be tempting to think there is too much story within one novel, but Rumer Haven balances it all so well. Both love stories are compelling, intelligent and heart-warming. Haven’s narrative is both poetic and endearing and I quickly found myself admiring the effort and devotion that went into writing this story. There were moments in Seven For A Secret when I laughed out loud, shed a few tears and held my breath while I read.This novel hit all the right spots emotionally for me, and I highly recommend it. Typically, I’m stingy in doling out 5 star ratings. I only do when I know that a book has made a lasting impression on me and when I know that others will feel the same way once they’ve given the story their time and attention.Seven For A Secret receives an enthusiastic 5 star rating from me!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 09, 2014","Dec 27, 2014","Aug 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22700275-seven-for-a-secret

I first read one of her books last summer, and since During the past year, I’ve had the opportunity to familiarize myself with Sydney Logan’s novels. I first read one of her books last summer, and since then I’ve found myself drawn to her stories again and again.Soldier On is the fourth book I’ve read by Sydney, and it is my favorite to date. My husband asked about the book and Sydney’s style of writing as I was preparing to draft this , and it didn’t take me long to use the adjectives “sweet” and “wholesome” to describe this romance, although there is much more to Sydney’s writing than that.Sydney resides in East Tennessee and usually sets her stories in small town settings. Having spoken with her recently, I know it’s important to her that the rural communities in her stories are populated by “good-hearted, friendly people who are educated, well-read, and truly love living in the country.” As someone with roots in a rural community myself, I truly appreciate Sydney’s depictions of small town life, but there are many themes and situations which can be universally understood and enjoyed no matter where you call home.At the beginning of Soldier On, college student Stephanie James reluctantly finds herself at a New Year’s Eve frat house costume party. She’s a serious student, focused on achieving her academic dreams, and uninterested in her university’s social scene. Seeking solace and peace, Stephanie wanders off to find a quiet corner to hide away in.“Bravely, I try a few of the rooms, but all are locked except for a set of open double doors at the end of the hallway.Curious, I step inside, and I’m instantly mesmerized.Frat houses have libraries?This one does, complete with ceiling-high bookshelves. Laptops line one wall, and a giant multimedia screen is attached to the other. While all of it is impressive, nothing excites my book-loving heart more than to see the library ladder.Secretly, I’ve always wanted to climb one – the tall ladders that roll from one end of the shelves to the other. Ironically enough, library ladders always remind me of Beauty and the Beast. Or the love scene in Atonement.One of those movies is G-rated. The other most definitely is not.”And (as tends to happen in great romance novels) Stephanie is soon joined in the library by a handsome stranger dressed as a soldier. They speak ever so briefly, an instant attraction brewing between them as the New Year quickly approaches…“Before I can ask why he noticed me, shouts erupt from downstairs.“Ten, nine, eight…”“Do you have someone to kiss at midnight?” he asks.I simply shake my head. He steps closer, pinning me between his body and the bookshelf.“You do now.”Horns blare below, but I barely notice because in the next second, his mouth covers mine. His lips are featherlight and sweet, causing warmth to spread through my veins and settle itself in my heart. I sigh, causing my lips to part slightly, allowing him to deepen the kiss.”As the story progresses and Stephanie and her new friend, Brandon, get to know one another, both find that their careful planning for the future never took falling in love with someone into account. Brandon is as serious about his future as Stephanie, but he becomes concerned when he realizes their individual aspirations and beliefs strongly contradict one another.Soldier On is a carefully crafted love story, featuring two fully-developed lead characters who deeply care about one another, but who are also challenged by their family circumstances and the unstoppable onset of adulthood. Stephanie and Brandon are faced with important decisions that could not only alter their individual plans but could also challenge their long-held perceptions of their place within their families.Sydney Logan manages to handle this fragile love story with a wonderful mixture of warmth, humor, consideration and passion. On it’s first day of release, Soldier On became an Amazon best seller, and within a few days was featured in USA Today as one of this week’s new romance release highlights. So, clearly I’m not alone in my high opinion of this story.Whether you’ve read one of Sydney Logan’s novels or not, I highly recommend that you pick up Soldier On. It’s a great summer read and enthusiastically earns four stars from me!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 23, 2014","May 27, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20828066-soldier-on

Many of my trusted online friends had been talking up the story on twitter before theI first heard about the Starlight Trilogy through word of mouth. Many of my trusted online friends had been talking up the story on twitter before the release of the first book in 2013, so I downloaded the book onto my kindle as soon as it was available.And then I was promptly consumed by real life. *frowns*After a very hectic time, I gladly welcomed a long holiday weekend. I decided to spend some of my time off by enjoying a bit of leisure reading. I began Starlight early one morning, figuring I’d read a few chapters before moving on with my day.Well, as it turns out, I rarely moved from my favorite reading perch for hours. Once I was drawn in by the Prologue, there was no going back. Over the course of the afternoon, I found it nearly impossible to put my kindle down, and by the evening I had finished the story.I spent the next year eagerly awaiting the release of the second book, Starbright, and my expectations for a worthy sequel were quickly met. In writing this series, Alexandra Richland has demonstrated great skill as a storyteller. The romance between Aidan and Beth builds slowly during the course of the first book, but their love story is genuine and profound. Starbright builds upon the fragile foundation of this couple’s relationship as the two young lovers develop their physical intimacy.“Please don’t go yet.”Aidan’s tenacity vanished. He turned around. The look in Beth’s eyes showed she wanted him here as much as he didn’t want to leave. He approached her slowly and discovered she was no longer shaking. He touched a tender hand to her cheek. She was no longer cold.Aidan bathed in her vanilla scent, which was extra potent from the rain. Her lips were just an impulse away, but he wasn’t about to be reckless with her. Not with Beth. Not his fragile little dove.“You’re so beautiful.” The compliment slipped from his lips in a reverent whisper.Aidan dipped his head and swept his arms around her waist. Beth closed her eyes in silent offering. Ever so slowly, he brought their lips together, his hands traveling down her side to her hips.Beth whimpered and returned the kiss, weaving her fingers into his damp hair, tugging, swirling, and scratching. Aidan took that as a green light to go further. With a gentle nudge, his tongue entered her mouth.”Beyond the tantalizing attraction these two feel toward one another, Starbright offers much more to the reader. The backdrop of the movie studio is incredible in its detail and is filled with fascinating secondary characters, some of whom are completely fictional and some of whom are amongst the biggest stars in the history of cinema. Chief among these characters is Starlight Studios head, Luther Mertz, who views any connection between the rebellious Aidan and the demure Beth as a detriment to his carefully managed empire.“…he withdrew a magazine from the top drawer of his desk and slid it toward her. The publication was opened to a specific article, which he positioned so she could look at it right-side up.“Explain this photo of you and Aidan Evans in Santa Barbara.”The blood drained from Beth’s face. She gripped the armrests and rose from her chair, peering over the desk at the publication. It was an issue of Life magazine. The largest photograph was the group shot of her, Aidan, and their friends taken after the race. The other photographs were of Aidan and his Porsche. Surely the group photograph wasn’t the source of her boss’s anger?Mr. Mertz slapped his hand down on the magazine and dragged it toward him. “Why were you at Mr. Evans’ race? He is no good for your image, and a racetrack is not a place you should be visiting under any circumstances.”Beth sat back down in her chair. It was crucial to handle the situation calmly. Mr. Mertz had no proof that she and Aidan were in a relationship.”It is clear that the author has a deep respect and knowledge for 1950’s Hollywood. As such, a reader can be swept up into the fantastic life of movie-making while still feeling that the novel offers a realistic portrayal of both the era and the larger-than-life circumstances that took place in the entertainment capital of the world.The cast of secondary characters are rich in both complexity and amusement, and the bustling activity of life behind the gates of Starlight Studios is glamorous and enthralling. If you are looking for a carefully crafted and well-written love story, I highly recommend reading Starlight and Starbright. The conclusion of this trilogy, Stardust, is expected to release during 2015, and I know I’ll be one of the first in line to buy a copy....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 27, 2014","Jun 16, 2014","May 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20744881-starbright

He’s looking down at the busy streets of Midtown. I can only see his strong profile but from what I can tell, he’s deep in thought. His strong arms are crossed over his chest and his back is tense. Worry flutters in my chest, and I feel the sudden urge to go to him and comfort him, to ease his mind of whatever is bothering him. Instead, I fight it. I force my eyes away from Mr. Miller’s tense body and go back to work.He’s not my boyfriend; he’s my boss.”The heroine of the story is Katherine Slav, a gorgeous young woman, who is never in want of male attention. Her comfortable life is turned upside down when she stubbornly refuses to follow in her father’s professional footsteps and is served with an ultimatum: End her frivolous partying and focus on a career in neurosurgery or else find her own way in the world.Katherine opts for the latter, but manages to land on her feet quickly when she secures work as an Executive Assistant for the CEO of Miller Financial. She desperately needs the job in order to make ends meet, but she is quickly fascinated by her attractive boss; a boss who appears to be doing his best to resist her irresistible charm. Katherine and Eric attempt their best to settle into a professional relationship, but their instant physical chemistry is almost impossible to deny from the moment they meet and emotions run high whenever Mr. Miller requires Katherine’s presence at after-hours functions.“He lifts his head and notices me, but then his gaze falls on Patrick. His eyebrows furrow for a moment before he rises, then leans his head closer to mine.“I didn’t know you were going to bring a date,” he whispers. The air escaping his mouth tickles my ear, sending goose bumps down the rest of my body.I bring my lips to his ear and say, “It wasn’t planned. Sort of a last minute thing.”He smells so intoxicating, pure male, fresh soap and a faint trace of cologne. His heady scent makes me want to spend the rest of the night glued to his neck. I inhale deeply then force myself to lean back and face him. His striking face is not giving anything away, but in his eyes I see the fury rising like blue flames in an inferno.”Both Katherine and Eric have complicated personal lives, which lends more emotion to their growing sexual tension, and the result makes for an enjoyable read. Emerald Eyes is the debut novel from N. Michaels. This author is new to publishing fiction, but someone I believe shows good instincts as a writer. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the occasional technical glitches in the narrative, but none were severe enough to distract me from the overall enjoyment of the story. I’ve actually read two versions of Emerald Eyes within the last year and was quite pleased when I was just as caught up in my second read of the book as I was during the first. The characters in Emerald Eyes are well-developed and the story is well-paced. N. Michaels has done a great job of drawing the reader in to the emotions necessary to hold interest in the plot. There were moments of great tension – sexual and otherwise; and I always appreciate a good cliffhanger. Emerald Eyes ends on a startling note, and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to Eric and Katherine in the upcoming sequel, Onyx Heart....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 28, 2014","Apr 15, 2014","Mar 28, 2014",,,view (with text),/book/show/22572207-emerald-eyes

We’re consumed with dinner plans, wrapping presents, preparing our homes for guests and running from one social engagement to another. By the end of the holiday season, most of us are more than ready to leave it all behind and move on to making our New Year’s Resolutions, many of which I’m guessing involve making the holidays more simple going forward. Yet somehow, we find ourselves repeating the cycle year after year.Justin Banks finds himself in this mode when his mission is interrupted by a man on the street.“Do you hear drums?”I turn and find myself face-to-face with a man. Homeless, I assume from his appearance. He’s dressed in a tattered coat and looks desperately in need of a bath. I try not to cringe as he tugs on my designer suit.“The drums,” he says again, his voice forceful. “Do you hear them?”Although Justin is inclined to ignore the request, the man is so insistent that he relents and pauses to listen. He is surprised when he realizes that the homeless man is right. Somewhere nearby the sound of drums can be heard.“Intrigued, I step away from the old man and walk slowly toward the alley. Each step brings me closer to the beat, until finally, I see a little boy, nestled in the corner. His only light comes from a lantern, and a snare drum rests in his lap. The drum is scarred and the strap is frayed, but it’s obviously his most prized possession. Probably his only possession. Does he live here? In this filthy alley? And where are his parents? “Shall I play for you?” His voice is just a whisper. His clothes are dirty and ragged, and the faded blue jacket he wears is about three sizes too big. “I heard you playing,” I tell him, keeping my voice soft and light. The last thing I want to do is scare the kid. “You’re very good. Are you alone?” He nods. “Where are your parents?” His face contorts in pain, and my stomach lurches. He can’t be more than five years old. Maybe six. “Shall I play for you?” he asks again. A little stronger this time. A little more determined. Because I don’t know what else to do, I nod. The covered alleyway has thankfully kept most of the snow away, so I find a flattened section of shredded cardboard and sit down. I don’t think about the fact that I’m probably ruining my thousand-dollar suit. I just sit and listen.The boy’s sticks pound the head of the drum.Rum pum pum pum.Rum pum pum pum.Each rhythmic thump pierces my soul, and when he comes to the end of his song, I reach inside my jacket for my wallet.“No, sir,” he says softly. “I don't need your money.”To reveal much more than this would likely ruin what I promise is an uplifting and heartwarming reading experience, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. I gave this story a five star rating on my Goodreads page without hesitation. I knew at once I’d found a worthy gift for my friends and family this holiday season. The Little Drummer Boy is a moving and compassionate piece which perfectly captures how hope, love and compassion can change not only the recipient’s life but the benefactor’s as well.I highly recommend that you take the time to read this and then pass it along to others as a gift. Many thanks to Sydney Logan for writing and sharing this holiday short.

It was a book I adored for several reasons. Among them were thLast summer, I read and ed Daisy Prescott’s debut novel, Geoducks Are For Lovers. It was a book I adored for several reasons. Among them were the two main characters, Maggie and Gil, and their sweet love story. I also enjoyed the ensemble cast of friends visiting Maggie at her home on Whidbey Island, Washington. The group of college friends enjoyed a rare weekend in each other’s company, recalling good times spent together and creating new memories to carry their friendships further into the future. I loved the great care Daisy took in constructing this group of characters and bringing them all to life.So when I heard she was working on a follow-up story, I was eager to see what was next. And this is where the author surprised me.Daisy took a calculated risk with Ready to Fall when she chose to focus the story on just one of the ensemble characters featured in her first book. It is now winter on Whidbey and nearly everyone has returned to their lives away from the island. The only one left is John Day, Maggie’s neighbor, who always has and always will call the island his home. I sat down to read Ready to Fall, knowing I would miss Maggie and Gil’s love story, and I wondered just how much I would be able to connect with John.My concerns were quickly put to rest.Not only has Daisy brilliantly crafted and evolved John Day’s life story, she also introduces another set of new and interesting characters for him to interact with. Some have known John Day all his life, but one, Diane Watson, is a newcomer to Whidbey Island who rents Maggie’s house for the winter and captures John’s attention from the moment they meet. The chemistry between John and Diane is clear from the beginning, but the two are recovering from romances gone awry and agree to be friends who “date without dating.”As the winter transitions into spring and their friendship blossoms, they learn more about one another’s lives. It becomes more difficult for John to dismiss the idea of being romantically involved with Diane. The only question is whether or not they are both ready to renege on their pact.“What?” She played innocent. “I was talking about boats. You said you had a small boat.”“My boat is just the right size and gets the job done.”Her eyes wandered up and down my frame before settling back on my face. “I’ve no doubt. When will I get to see this boat?”“We’re still talking about fishing, right?”“Of course.”I didn’t believe her.She set down her food and stretched out on the blanket. I played with a piece of grass as I rested my elbows on my knees and looked down at her. With her eyes closed and her hair loose from her ponytail, her typical guarded sadness disappeared. Left was her natural beauty, the softness of her cheeks, dark lashes against light skin, rose-colored lips parted and welcoming. She should be kissed. Kissed thoroughly.Our brief kiss from Port Townsend flashed through my memory. I hadn’t given her an opportunity to respond. As strong as the urge was to give her another opportunity, I hesitated. Today wasn’t the day.Dark eyes met mine. I’d been caught staring.“What are you thinking about?” she asked, shielding her eyes from the sun to look at me.On the surface, John Day appears to be your typical lumberjack next door. He loves his home on the island and enjoys being a bachelor, but as his relationship with Diane deepens, the complexities of John’s life rise to the surface and they make for a fascinating read. Make no mistake, I thought the sun rose and set on sexy Gil Morrow in Geoducks Are For Lovers, but I have been utterly swept away by John Day in Ready to Fall. As such I enthusiastically give this story a five star rating and encourage you to put this book on your list of Must Reads immediately.Daisy Prescott graciously provided me with an ARC of Ready to Fall in exchange for an honest . It was the first book I read after finishing Gabriel’s Redemption by Sylvain Reynard, and take it from a longtime fan girl of The Professor, it was a lovely way to move forward.The novel’s release date is set for December 17 and I encourage you to visit Daisy’s website to keep up with the latest news on its availability.http://daisyprescott.com/Enjoy and Take Care,Jenn...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 27, 2013","Nov 29, 2013","Nov 27, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/18823134-ready-to-fall

So, I won’t even try to comment much on the art or the literature or the history that I I know there are things in The Raven that passed me right by. So, I won’t even try to comment much on the art or the literature or the history that I know is deeply interwoven into this novel. I do appreciate and admire this aspect of Sylvain Reynard’s writing, but I’ll also have to rely on others to point out the more subtle references and tones.What I have always been drawn to as a reader is the development of fictional characters. It is rewarding when a character is drawn with such convincing humanity and SR truly excels at this. Just as with Gabriel and Julia, there are things about William and Raven that I connected with, not the least of which is the role disability plays in their love story. As someone who is married to a physically disabled person, I think the author got it right, and I appreciate the care and complexity with which SR addressed the issue.Raven has doubts about William’s ability to accept her disability, and there are simple moments (like William asking Raven to dance) that expose her insecurities and fears. But these same moments also allow William the opportunity to show Raven how her physical limitations are not necessarily impenetrable barriers. Not surprisingly, these were among my favorite moments in the story as they hit very close to home for me.I’ve heard people mention that they can hate William at moments and are frightened of him in general. But I must be a bit of an oddball because this hasn’t been my reaction at all. Maybe I’m desensitized after reading other vampire fiction, but then again maybe I’m just looking at William’s vampirism in the same way I look at Raven’s injured leg. It’s an important part of his character and one that shouldn’t be ignored, but it’s also only one aspect of a complex personality. Granted, I’ve only been allowed to glimpse a few moments of William’s very long life. I’m sure there are things he has done that would I find appalling. I was perplexed by his irrational rage at the Emersons (don’t mess with my favorite Professor) and I’m sure there are more bewildering moments like these to be revealed. But as a whole, I don’t sense that William is motivated to commit evil for evil’s sake. Nothing in this world is ever quite that simple and I admire that SR’s writing reflects this reality, even in the pages of fiction.Although brief, I enjoyed the exchanges between William and Raven regarding faith. I’ll confess that comments made by both William and Raven perhaps resonate with me better than discussions held between Gabriel and Julia. As the trilogy unfolds, I’ll be interested to see how these ideas of justice and mercy and faith all play out for these characters. For the time being, I’m holding out hope for them both, but I do have considerable worries for their precarious situation.Many of the quotes that I highlighted were William’s. He said many things that struck a particular personal nerve with me, and many of them made me feel sad. I could offer up a multitude of them here and speculate on their potential deeper meanings, but I think I’ll refrain from that conversation for the time being. This new series is fantastic. I think it may even have the potential to outdo the Inferno series and anyone who is familiar with my devotion for Professor Emerson has to know that isn’t something I would say lightly.

We were introduced when she was looking for someone to heI should begin this  by mentioning that I first met Liv Morris online three years ago. We were introduced when she was looking for someone to help edit a story she was writing. I heard Liv’s call and volunteered my services. I spent the better part of a year working with her on the story and was happy to see her writing receive a warm reception. Although we have since moved on to other projects, I have always thought highly of Liv and am grateful for the time we spent working together as we honed our writing skills. I was pleasantly surprised when Liv began publishing new stories and eagerly downloaded Adam’s Apple as soon as it became available. I was intrigued by the inclusion of Tantra into the plot and knowing how well Liv excels at writing sexual tension, I was not disappointed.Morris’ novel takes place in New York City and begins with the end of a particularly bad day at the office for Adam Kingsley. The young billionaire has suffered an upsetting personal and professional loss and decides to vent his frustration by seeking out some female companionship while attending an evening fundraiser. When he encounters a breathtaking and mysterious beauty named Kathyrn, his world is almost immediately turned upside down. It has never been in Adam’s nature to want to know much about his dates, but he is utterly captivated by Kathryn and cannot stop thinking about her.What is it about this woman’s beauty and expressions that make me feel uneasy? I stretch out my hand to her, but her hands remain solidly on her hips.Well damn, this is interesting. There isn’t a single wrinkle or line on her face, but the way she looks at me is intriguing, a confidence only acquired with time and experience. Everything about her fascinates me, and her sudden appearance on the social scene bewilders me. But most importantly right now, her body has totally aroused mine. This combination almost never happens with the women I meet at these things, so I start to speak.“I’d like to introduce myself, I’m Adam Kings–”She laughs before I can finish my name.One reason why Adam is captivated by Kathryn is because, unlike nearly every other woman he encounters, she appears immune to his charms. Kathryn rebuffs Adam’s usual advances and yet she doesn’t completely discourage him from pursuing her. In his quest to find out more about her, Adam recruits some help.I’m anxious to know what Peters has learned about her. Details are what I’m looking for. I wipe my sweaty hands across my trousers, stopping as I realized that for the second time in less than twenty-four hours, just the thought of Kathryn Delcour has made me sweat.What Adam hears, however, only fuels his attraction for the beautiful socialite.“…It’s all in the report. Ms. Delcour is a certified Tantra teacher. According to her company’s website, she left a successful practice as a psychologist in Paris after experiencing the…” Peters pauses to read from the papers in his hand, “Freedom, sensuality, and healing power of Tantra…”Adam becomes curious about the practice of Tantra and what Kathryn is capable of teaching him. Sensing that Adam has genuine interest in her and her beliefs, Kathryn consents to a lesson.I push the door open the remaining way and gasp. Kathryn comes into my view. She’s kneeling on the large cushion in the middle of the room. Breathtakingly beautiful.Her pose is one of pure submission. Kneeling as she faces me with her sweet ass resting on the heels of her feet. Her delicate hands, the ones I want touching me, are placed flat above her knees as her body leans forward.I’m still absorbing the scene in front of me. Kathryn is waiting for me while the flickering light casts shadows across her skin and hair.“Come join me, Kingsley.” Kathryn curls her lips into a sexy smile,and with a gesturing motion of her hand she invites me to join her. At this moment, I’m powerless and will do whatever this beautiful woman kneeling before me wants.The magnetic pull I’ve felt since I met her last night draws me to her. I’m powerless against its force. Walking across the rug-covered floor, I arrive at the pillow she’s gracefully kneeling on. Without another thought, I bend my knees and reflect her pose. Willingly, I submit.As the story progresses, we watch as Adam begins to alter his usual routines in favor of getting to know Kathryn better. We also become wrapped up in an unfolding mystery that threatens to harm Adam, his company and his colleagues, and especially his blossoming relationship with Kathryn.Make no mistake, Adam Kingsley is a flawed individual and there are things about his character at the beginning of this novel that are unappealing; yet I couldn’t help but think he just needed the right kind of woman to tame his unruly ways. Kathryn Delcour certainly does not disappoint in this regard. She is strong, self-assured and smart. The chemistry between the two is smoldering and fully ignites as the story progresses. If you’re looking to check out of reality for an afternoon and curl up with a sexy read, I think you’ll be happy with this selection.Adam’s Apple receives 4 out of 5 stars from me, and I’m glad to say that it’s just the first book in a series. I’m really looking forward to seeing what more Adam can learn from Kathryn in regards to the sensual art of Tantra. There is little doubt that he’ll also learn about himself in the process....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 11, 2013","Aug 24, 2013","Jul 29, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18189155-adam-s-apple

This novel was releaseI was honored when Sydney Logan contacted me to ask if I would be interested in reading an ARC of her new book, Mountain Charm. This novel was released just two days ago and is the second book in her Appalachian Heart Collection series. If you haven’t read the first book (entitled Lessons Learned) don’t let this stop you from picking up Mountain Charm. Although the two stories share a similar geographic setting, they are completely unrelated tales and can be read as stand-alone books. Just a few hours before I sat down to write this , I was discussing books with a friend of mine. We were speaking in general terms, trying to learn what types of books we each prefer to read. I ended up telling her I’ll read a variety of genres. As long as there is a good plot and engaging characters, I’m almost always willing to go along for the ride. Mountain Charm is one of those stories that doesn’t fit a typical mold. It is primarily a romance set within the Appalachia region, but it also includes an element of the supernatural. Although this supernatural element is a component of the plot, the story itself doesn’t focus entirely on it.Logan’s novel begins in the small mountain town of Maple Ridge where Angelina Clark has just turned twenty-one years old. She is shadowed by the prospect that a love spell cast on her thirteenth birthday is due to take full effect. In the seven years since she made her wish to find her true love in her twenty-first year, Angelina has experienced the double blows of the devastating loss of her father and the serious illness of her mother. Discouraged by the lack of magic in her life to keep her parents alive and well, Angelina has lost faith in her family’s legendary legacy. Yet, when a handsome Nashville based reporter named Dylan Thomas shows up on her doorstep to research her family’s ties to Appalachian witchcraft, Angelina can’t help but wonder about the timing of his appearance. Feeling uncertain about her belief in magic, she attempts to keep her distance from Dylan and initially refuses to cooperate with his requests to research her and her family.However, there is no denying that from the moment Angelina and Dylan first meet he experiences an intense attraction toward her. “They didn’t say a word throughout most of the meal, but more than once, he caught himself watching her. Everything about her fascinated him, and it had nothing to do with the fact that she was supposedly a witch. It was the subtle things. Like the passion in her eyes when she was angry, or the shape of her ass in those jeans.“You look a little dazed,” Angelina muttered.I am.“And you’re staring.”Dylan cleared his throat. “Sorry.”As Angelina’s feelings grow stronger for Dylan, she begins to fear that his obvious attraction to her isn’t all that it appears to be. In the back of her mind, she is concerned that his interest is merely a result of the love spell and not truly because of her.Trying to determine if you’re falling in the love for the first time is difficult enough, but Angelina’s situation is complicated by the frightening reality of her mother’s battle with cancer.“Rest didn’t come easy. Angelina lay in bed for hours, tossing and turning. Her thoughts were jumbled and scared as she contemplated the possibility of a life without her mom. It was in her nature to be a cynic. Humans were imperfect, religion was complicated, and magic was complex, so the concept of faith was a tough one for Angelina. While she had inherited most of her mother’s traits, Celia’s unwavering sense of calm was the one quality her daughter failed to possess. Angelina would gladly trade her big blue eyes and mystical wisdom for an ounce of her mom’s serenity.”Dylan’s work is cut out for him. He has fallen in love with a young woman who has endured more than her fair share of hardship. She is unsure in her faith and she is uncertain if his love is genuine. A quick-tempered individual himself, Dylan must learn to exercise more patience in order to gain Angelina’s trust.“I love you,” he whispered, letting his lips linger against her cheek.Angelina wanted to say it back, but the words hung in her throat, suffocating her. Dylan placed his hands on each side of her face, forcing her to look into his eyes.“Don’t say it, Angelina. Not tonight.”Her eyes flashed with confusion. “You don’t want me to say it?”“Oh, I want you to say it. I just want you to mean it. I want you to be sure. I don’t want there to be an ounce of fear or doubt in your heart when you say those words to me.”I’m afraid I can’t say much more about Mountain Charm than this, but I hope I’ve enticed you enough to give it a read. If you’ve read Sydney Logan’s first book, Lessons Learned, you know she writes with a great deal of heart. Where Lessons Learned is a dramatic story that deals with complex contemporary issues, Mountain Charm is more light-hearted in nature. While there are some serious moments that occur, I would define this as one of those good summertime reads – a story that is romantic and magical and one that I found more emotionally compelling the further along it went....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 22, 2013","Jun 28, 2013","Jun 22, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17731644-mountain-charm

Having enjoyed one ofI was honored when Alexandra Richland contacted me to ask if I would be interested in reading an ARC of her new book, Frontline. Having enjoyed one of her previous novels (Starlight) at the beginning of the summer, I was more than ready to read something new from this author. This book was released just yesterday and is a separate body of work from Starlight, so if you haven’t read Richland’s previous stories don’t let this stop you from picking up Frontline. I’ll state upfront that I found it to be a fascinating read. I sat down with it one Saturday morning and quickly became swept into the story. Before I knew it, the whole day had drifted by and I was at the end of the book. It was practically impossible to set down.Frontline begins during a night shift at Manhattan General Hospital where Sara Peters is navigating the first year of her nursing job. Having moved to New York City from the West Coast, she is not only building a new career but a brand new life. Sara’s focus has been on her work, but her carefully managed world is thrown into chaos when Trenton Merrick wanders into the ER with a head injury. Sara is tasked with getting Mr. Merrick settled in the exam room and although she initially finds Trenton arrogant, she also cannot deny she feels a physical attraction toward him.“I sweep my eyes across the room in search of Mr. Money Bags. He sits in a chair in the corner, swiping his thumb over his cell phone screen. A bloodstained gauze is taped to his forehead.Mr. Merrick looks up as I approach. I inhale sharply when I meet his vibrant blue eyes, inviting his dark, spicy scent into my lungs.“Hello,” he says.I survey all of him at once: mussed brown hair, fancy suit, shined shoes. My throat seizes so I can’t speak while my mouth hangs wide open. He holds me spellbound until a shrill cry from a child in the waiting room reminds me of the hysterical mother and her sick infant still waiting to be seen.“Mr. Merrick.” I square my shoulders. “Right this way, sir.”He holds my stare and makes no move to follow me. I swallow the lump in my throat.“Mr. Merrick,” I say, louder this time. “The doctor will see you now.”The corners of his mouth lift into a smirk. My heart launches into a frantic pace, as though I’ve received a shock from a defibrillator.“Thank you, Miss . . .” His eyes roam to my breasts. “Peters.”I blush, realizing he was only reading my identification badge.You’re an idiot, Sara.Mr. Merrick looks like Mr. GQ, while I’m modeling the latest in frumpy nurse fashion. I curse myself for buying my scrubs two sizes too big just because they were on clearance.Shaking my head, I try to refocus on the task at hand. Mr. Merrick looks amused by my hesitation. I assume he receives this kind of reaction from all women and thrives off of it.And I thought Dr. Shore’s ego was massive.I gesture for him to follow me. “Sir, if you please.”Mr. Merrick stands and buttons his suit jacket. He’s tall, around six feet, and his build is strong and lean. I try and pinpoint what it is about him that has me scrambling to put a coherent sentence together. My answer comes easily, even though I’ve had only one serious romantic relationship in all of my twenty-two years, which was short-lived and mediocre at best.Trenton Merrick exudes pure sex: chiseled features, bedroom eyes, delicious smirk. Everything about him screams confidence and sexual prowess. Even more, it seems effortless.His stare intensifies. The heat rolling off of my body is enough to warm a Manhattan winter night. After a glance at his blood-soaked bandage, I escort him across the waiting room, attempting to ignore my heart’s erratic flutter.”After seeing Mr. Merrick to the exam room and leaving to return to her regular duties, Sara is quickly surprised when Trenton personally requests her to oversee his care. At the insistence of the hospital administrator (who is greedy for good publicity and a generous donation for the facility), Sara returns to the exam room. What she encounters when she is reunited with him is beyond her wildest imagination.“Mr. Merrick approaches me from the other side of the room with a graceful and purposeful prowl. I cast my gaze to the floor, wringing my hands in front of me, trembling from his closeness. I don’t need to look at him to know his eyes are smoldering. Sparks course through my body, igniting a deep yearning.Time passes. My heart palpitates, my breaths deepen, the mere awareness of him in my personal space affecting me as though his hands were all over me.When I finally lift my head, the first thing I see is that smirk.Then Mr. Merrick dips his head, his expression softens, and the gap between our lips vanishes.”Their kiss escalates into a passionate moment, but once Sara manages to separate herself from Trenton’s embrace she attempts to treat him. As she questions the billionaire about how he was hurt, Sara quickly realizes that the story she’s being told doesn’t match up with the type of injury she is encountering. Still recovering from their first physical encounter and reluctant to push her VIP patient for the truth at the risk of angering him and losing her job in the process, she keeps her thoughts to herself. By doing so, however, Sara inadvertently sets into motion a mystery that unfolds over the course of the novel.You may have noticed the synopsis is brief, and after having read the novel I’d say there is good reason for this. Frontline is an intense read, not only because of the incredible sexual energy between Trenton and Sara but because of the mysterious nature of the billionaire at the center of the story. While Sara spontaneously pursues her attraction to Trenton Merrick, she begins to understand that learning about the real man and his life will be a challenge unlike any other she has faced.To say much more than this would begin to reveal spoilers (something I loathe to do in s), but rest assured there are few books that can command my attention the way Frontline has. As such it earns a 5 star rating from me and I hope to speak with some of you about it online as soon as you’ve had the chance to read it.Who is Trenton Merrick?You’ll just have to read that one for yourselves (and then come find me)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 16, 2013","Jul 20, 2013","Jun 16, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16909152-frontline

Many of my trusted online friends had been talking up the book on twitter before its release at tI first heard about Starlight through word of mouth. Many of my trusted online friends had been talking up the book on twitter before its release at the end of April, so I downloaded the book onto my kindle as soon as it was available.And then I was promptly consumed by real life. *frowns*After a very hectic May, I gladly welcomed the Memorial Day holiday weekend. I decided to spend some of my time off by enjoying a bit of leisure reading. I began Starlight early one morning, figuring I’d read a few chapters before moving on with my day.Well, as it turns out, I rarely moved from my favorite reading perch for hours. Once I was drawn in by the Prologue, there was no going back. Over the course of the afternoon, I found it nearly impossible to put my kindle down, and by the evening I had finished the story.Now I’m eagerly awaiting the release of the second and third books in this new trilogy.The title of this book refers to Starlight Studios, one of the world’s top movie studios in the golden age of Hollywood. The story is set in the autumn of 1952 and begins when one of the industry’s up and coming leading men, Aidan Evans, has just arrived in Hollywood to begin filming a movie. Aidan is a Method actor and feels more at ease on a New York City theater stage or within the walls of the Actor’s Studio than he does moving about the world of contract actors occupying California soundstages.Although Aidan has achieved success in his career, he is personally consumed by his tragic past. He accepts a high-profile movie role, but immediately has regrets about doing so.“While he considered himself an actor, his was not a shallow existence pursued by vanity and greed. He chased art and solitude, an outlet for his pain and guilt, and though highly unattainable for someone like him, redemption.Exhaling the remaining smoke from his lungs, he pitched his cigarette into the vacant pool and looked to the inky sky, bathed in dim light and disenchantment. Predictions had already been made that he was marked for success. Whether he was also marked for happiness was another question entirely.”While Aidan is nervously preparing to film his first motion picture, a young woman named Marie Bates has also just arrived in Hollywood. Her dreams are much simpler – she wants to attend college and become a teacher. To make ends meet, she takes a job at Schwab’s Pharmacy. The drugstore happens to be the place of Hollywood legend; a location patronized almost daily by famous actors and movie moguls, and where it is rumored that Lana Turner was discovered.Unlike the majority of her co-workers, Marie has no aspirations of becoming a star, yet she is handed the opportunity of a lifetime when she’s approached by a Starlight Studios executive. He recognizes that special quality in Marie and talks her into a filming a screen test. Before she knows it, Marie has been offered an actor’s contract and becomes a professional actress. While Aidan has spent years studying and perfecting his craft, Marie (now renamed Elizabeth Sutton by the studio) is working on pictures and learning everything as she goes.Inevitably, these two cross paths at Starlight Studios. He is considered an outsider and a rebel while she is the quintessential girl next door. Naturally, the two actors are immediately fascinated with one another.“There was something incredibly sexual and poetic about his face – irresistible, sensual, and tactile. He had fragile, sensitive features, yet his brooding expression conveyed virility, capability, and strength; unadulterated male attributes that Beth found incredibly attractive.”*****“While the physical attraction Aidan felt toward Beth was palpable, it was the way she awakened his mind that affected him the most. Life held a purpose now and his future seemed full of promise and worth. He was relieved her personality matched her beauty.”Beyond the tantalizing attraction these two feel toward one another, Starlight offers much more to the reader. The backdrop of the movie studio is incredible in its detail and is filled with fascinating secondary characters, some of whom are completely fictional and some of whom are amongst the biggest stars in the history of cinema. It is clear that Alexandra Richland has a deep respect and knowledge for 1950’s Hollywood. As such, a reader can be swept up into the fantastic life of movie-making while still feeling that the novel offers a realistic portrayal of both the era and the larger-than-life circumstances that took place in the entertainment capital of the world.The romance between Aidan and Beth builds slowly, but is genuine and profound. The cast of secondary characters are rich in both complexity and amusement, and the bustling activity of life behind the gates of Starlight Studios is glamorous and enthralling. If you are looking for a carefully crafted and well-written love story, I highly recommend Starlight.Once I finished reading the story, I did something I’ve never done before. I approached Alexandra and requested an interview to accompany my . If you haven’t already, please take a few moments to read it – she offers some great details about the world she’s created and hints at what will be taking place during the upcoming sequels....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 26, 2013","May 30, 2013","Apr 24, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17640539-starlight

We were introduced when she read and ed a storyI should begin this  by mentioning that I first met Daisy Prescott online three years ago. We were introduced when she read and ed a story written by my husband and in the years since we’ve become friends. I’ve enjoyed discussing several stories and authors with her and I’ve also read stories she’s edited for mutual author friends. I’ve always thought highly of Daisy. She’s kind, intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor; so when I heard she was going to publish a book of her own, I was genuinely thrilled for her.My favorite kinds of stories are ones with well-developed and smart characters. I love to lose myself in novels whose characters possess distinct personalities and interact effortlessly with the other players within the narrative. In a nutshell, I love ensemble casts. They allow me to become more emotionally invested in a novel as each character offers a unique perspective and insight about their counterparts and the overall plot.Geoducks Are For Lovers is one such story. It is full of heart, humor and heat and is one of the few novels I’ve given a five star rating during 2013.Prescott’s novel takes place in the Pacific Northwest setting of Whidbey Island. After the loss of her parents and her marriage, Maggie Marrion has retreated to the sanctuary of a family-owned cabin where she has settled into a quiet routine. Making her living as a food blogger, she works from home and enjoys the companionship of her dog, Biscuit, and her friendly neighbor, John Day.As her twentieth college reunion approaches, Maggie decides to host a pre-reunion weekend with her closest university friends. As friends often do, they appear when you need them the most and with compassion and hilarity, they let call it like they see it.Distracted by the image of a giant pile of cheese, she ignores Selah’s point.“All I’m saying, and I’m saying this with love, is I don’t want to watch you hide your life away on the beach. Live more, laugh more.”“You sound like a greeting card.”“Shoot me now. I can give you this whole speech again sans the treacle if you want.”“Nah, it’s okay. I get the point. No hiding, get laid.”“In a nutshell, yes. Ding ding ding…we have a winner.” Selah fakes enthusiasm.“With the discussion of my non-existent sex life over, how about we go pick blackberries?”“Will said berries be turned into delicious carbs? Cause if no one is going to get laid this weekend, we might as well eat all the carbs.”Maggie’s friend, Selah, goes a bit further than just offering advice about Maggie’s non-existent love life. She also brings along their old friend, Gil Morrow, to Maggie’s home. Gil is someone Maggie hasn’t spent any quality time with since her college days. Two decades earlier, the two were friends with a close connection but circumstances and a complication referred to as the “French Incident” put distance between them. When Maggie and Gil reunite, it quickly becomes clear the chemistry between them still exists.“Gil brushes past her and drops Selah’s bags in the den. “This is cozy. I didn’t notice a TV in the living room and thought you became one of those anti-TV recluse types for a minute.” He teases her.“Lord no! I’m addicted to horrible, embarrassing television. I like to hide my shame from company,” Maggie explains.“So, this is where you watch porn?” Gil gestures around.He’s flirting with her. Or at least she thinks he is. Two can play at this.“No, silly. I watch my porn online in my bedroom like most people.” She winks at him.Apparently momentarily stunned by the thought of her watching porn in her bedroom, in her bed, Gil takes a few seconds to react. She chuckles that she stunned him into silence. His shocked expression pleases her.“Your room is upstairs next to Quinn’s. Ryan arrives Saturday, so you’re in the room with the two twin beds. Hope you don’t mind.”Maggie walks up the stairs with Gil following behind her. She swears she senses his eyes on her but she’s afraid to look back. Instead, she adds a little extra swing in case he’s looking.”And so the get-together commences…During the course of the weekend more of Maggie’s friends arrive at the cabin. Undergoing different stations in their lives, the story becomes enriched with their unique life experiences. As a result, the more Maggie hears from her friends, the more she begins to wonder about her own life – past, present and future.Geoducks Are For Lovers is a great novel if you’re looking for an uplifting read. There is plenty of fun, but there is also plenty of warmth. The characters were crafted with a great deal of care and consideration and Daisy Prescott’s gift for writing organic, smart and funny dialogue is on brilliant display here. While reading this book, it reminded me of weekend gatherings I’ve spent with close friends – weekends that were fun and meaningful and sometimes life altering.If you’re having a weekend off from visiting your friends and looking for a wonderful summer read, then you should really start here. I guarantee you’ll feel right at home with this group of characters....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 30, 2013","Jun 16, 2013","Apr 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17838847-geoducks-are-for-lovers

In particular, my son is very enthusiastic for Roth's books and he is not someone who can be considered an active reader.

As often is the case during an exotic vacation, the main chThis book begins right where “Gabriel’s Inferno” left off, on a romantic holiday in Italy. As often is the case during an exotic vacation, the main characters (and the reader) are more than happy to partake in the pleasurable and sensual experiences that overwhelm a couple during the early days of their relationship. With Sylvain Reynard’s gift as an intelligent and romantic storyteller, all involved would likely be content to linger in such bliss for eternity.In this setting it can be easy to ignore the obligations and responsibilities of life; however, as the realization of Gabriel and Julia’s love affair becomes common knowledge to those around them, problems begin to emerge. It quickly becomes impossible for the two of them to ignore the inevitable complications that arise from embarking on a passionate journey whose foundation was constructed under controversial circumstances.After all the darkness Gabriel and Julia experienced in their respective pasts, the easiest thing the author could’ve done would have been to give these characters their guaranteed happiness at the moment they truly become one. But as one reads “Gabriel’s Rapture,” it becomes clear that Reynard wanted to do what was right by the characters and the world created in the first book, not just what was easy.I read with rapt attention as I studied a couple who (in some ways) came to feel more insecure and unsure of one another as their relationship progressed. Even before departing Italy, the new lovers are caught up in moments of jealously and self-loathing that only provide increasing tension and drama once they return home to immerse themselves among their families, friends, colleagues and enemies.The resulting developments in the continuing story of Gabriel and Julia are not always enjoyable to witness, but one should always remember that anything worthwhile in life is never easy to achieve. As a reader, I admire how Reynard further developed his characters by allowing all their doubts and fears and jealousies to nag at one another. To me at least, it made Gabriel and Julia all the more human and all the more relatable. And in the end, it made everything all the more satisfying. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 21, 2012","May 27, 2012","May 08, 2012",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13639050-gabriel-s-rapture
