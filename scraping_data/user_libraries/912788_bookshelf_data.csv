With the multiple voices I would have liked to have seen even more emotion come through. For example, the strong-willed and stubborn Julia - my imagination leads me to expect that she would have had a lot more ""choice words"" and would have helped us better understand how she REALLY felt that allowed her to easily walk away from her family for 25 years. I wanted to know more about how she actually achieved such power and financial success as a single mom in NYC in the 80's without the comfort and support of her family with whom she shared so much. As one of the central characters, I expected more, especially at the end when somehow all her anger, disappointment, etc. quickly melted away and she encouraged her daughter to reunite with her estranged father. Just like that? She is welcomed back by family and friends without awkwardness, tough conversations, tears, confusion? I'm left wanting to know much more about the thoughts and feelings of the sisters during such a traumatic event of their older sister abandoning them, turning her back to them. HOW does that happen? Instead, we got a lot of the same reflections about their childhood stories. A bit too perfect of an ending. ...more",Notes are private!,1,4,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Feb 05, 2024","Jan 15, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61771675-hello-beautiful

In it, hHaving read this book, I can imagine what it must be like to experience Professor McWhorter's study on American linguistic history in person. In it, he challenges the reader to consider perceived legitimacy of languages. In his words, ""English hasn't existed long enough to diverge into dozens of starkly distinct dialects as it has in Great Britain. Black English is America's only English dialect that combines being strikingly unlike standard English, centuries old, embraced by an ever wider spectrum of people, and represented in an ever-growing literature."" Using examples like Scots grammar that is quite different from English grammar and that many would consider a different dialect of English, or ""Kiezdeutsch"" speakers in Germany who are capable of speaking standard German ""when they have to"". McWhorter touches on many topics in this compact book, including code switching, Ebonics, languages around the world, minstrel speech in America, the ""N word"", ""blaccent"", Harlem Renaissance and so much more. In my opinion, he convincingly explains the nuances and complexities of Black English as a legitimate speech variety and its cultural importance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Mar 17, 2024","Jan 14, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29633629-talking-back-talking-black

The book skips along the surface and does not provide much depth of the characters - many of whom seem to have a short fuse and boil over with anger, vengeance and self-pity.

Personally, I would have enjoyed more about Haidara, the libraries, the manuscripts themselves and the librarians he employed to help preserve the manuscripts. He went to great lengths to procure the manuscripts and grants from international organizations that was in a way downplayed by the contextual information. It was certainly interesting to learn a bit about the long history of Timbuktu and the ebb and flow of its reputation as a cultural hub.

Primarily due to the fact that this is fictional book, yet so much of it is based on Lale and Gita's experiences in the concentration camp. First and foremost it is a love story. Given that Lale entrusted Heather Morris with his innermost descriptions of his war-time and post-war life experiences in 2003 after Gita had already passed, in many ways this book feels like a tribute to his everlasting adoration and love for her. So many times throughout the book Lale overcomes the most harrowing incidences that almost feel impossible. There is an overarching tone of hope, courage and determination that persists through the pages unlike any other WWII era book that I've read. Kudos to Morris for spending countless hours with Lale to really hear him and weave together this love story. What an honor that must have been. While the writing is a bit flat and even dry at times, it is nonetheless another important reminder about this unfathomable period in history. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 16, 2023","Jul 25, 2023","Jul 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38359036-the-tattooist-of-auschwitz

Dr. Verghese's writing transported me to the lush and exotic land in southern India. He wove in so many descriptions about the ways of life there at that time as it relates to religion, commerce, politics, the caste system, etc. The multitude of family tragedies seemed overwhelming, yet characters like Big Ammachi, Shamuel, and Joppan were able to demonstrate their strengths. The occasional visits from Damo the elephant seemed magical. My 4 rating is primarily due to the length of the book. In my opinion, there were unnecessary sections in the second half of the book. For the majority of readers, I imagine the overly detailed descriptions about the surgical procedures and medical conditions are difficult to comprehend. My other struggle is with one of the main characters - Digby. Humans are flawed. Digby's flaw is taking advantage of vulnerable, distraught married women because he can't control his desires. And in both instances, the women end up experiencing insurmountable adversity as a result.

I was pleasantly surprised by how many real examples about employees, internal terminology, systems and internal projects were shared. Also impressed by Whitehurst’s sharing of his own learning journey, missteps and revelations. As he stated himself, he’s not an academic, and he wrote the book to more broadly share why the open source / participative leadership approach, with meritocracy at its core, is so valuable in modern organizations where the speed of change is perpetual. In my own experience working at more traditional, hierarchical and conventional companies, that leadership style and organizational culture is quite rare. While Whitehurst provides tips at the end of each chapter, and sprinkles in good analogies throughout, it’s still quite difficult for most people to incorporate what he’s advocating. Egos, traditions, burnout, lack of EQ are just some of the barriers. That said, I appreciate the openness of the book and examples of how other organizations utilize similar concepts. He also referenced many books and contemporary leaders. I will try to remember the OODA loop example he shared and the successful Swarm approach that came from an internal leader. His tips on what competencies are crucial include patience, high EQ, personal strength and growth mindset are helpful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 19, 2022","Jan 12, 2023","Dec 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23258978-the-open-organization

Then it made a quick jump from the rebuilding of the District in 1925 to other Black owned cities on a map without much context. It has an abrupt end to it. I would have liked to see more references to what characteristics really embodied the community that led to its initial success and comeback vs pointing to other cities so quickly.

Thankfully I kept the book to read and appreciate the story again, and to share with others. It’s a gem. It helps one think about values such as pride, faith, education, hard work, trust, and integrity. How do those values hold up in times of temptation, difficult choices, mistakes, prejudices and fear of failure? It’s an emotional and gut wrenching series of events and dialogues. One might start to build a certain impression of Walter and end up being pleasantly surprised about him in the end. While there is no Hollywood happy ending, given the harsh realities facing Black America - then and now - the ending does invoke feelings of hope, curiosity and contemplation. Unlike Mrs Johnson who seems to take pleasure in watching the family struggle, readers will ultimately be rooting for the family to stick together and live their shared values. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 21, 2022","Oct 30, 2022","Oct 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5517.A_Raisin_in_the_Sun

The through line started to disconnect as soon as Theo and Jess started their relationship. What really was the point? Lots of cringy narratives and commentary. If only Brooks just stuck with the 1800’s storyline and developed the characters more thoroughly, it would have stayed strong. Jarret, his father, Scott, Viley, etc all could have been expanded more deeply. Some characters were introduced and then just disappeared. I’ll give credit for the Beautiful depictions of Lexington, lovely descriptions of the landscape, extensive vocabulary. Yet she ends up only dedicating three pages to detail Jarret’s escape from Kentucky in the Civil War to become a trusted agent of horse sales in Canada. We are left with an incomplete picture of the beloved trainer as well as how Lexington ended up in an attic despite being buried by Jarret. Much more should have been written about that rather than describing Theo and Jess’s interpersonal conflicts. Brooks’s journalistic approach could have been better put to use instead of trying to turn the book into a social justice commentary for which she missed the mark on deep and lived understanding.

Sadly, the plot lines and characters did nothing for me. I struggled with understanding what was so special about Roya and Bahman’s relationship at age 17 that they’d have such a strong connection 60 years later. Badri/ Mrs Aslan’s character was over the top evil. Zari and her Jack - who was cynical and demeaning- made for an odd couple. Turns out Mr Fahkri is a privileged rich boy who took what he wanted and then tried to make up for his sins thru his shop. But why did he simultaneously enable Roya and Bahman to court while telling Roya to be very careful??? Who burned his shop down? How did Bahman end up opening a shop 1 hour from Roya just like Mr Fahkri’s old shop, yet he never let her know? What happened to Roya and Zari’s parents after the girls chose to not return to Iran despite their promises? Did Roya ever really love Walter, or was he just safe and plain and predictable? Sooo many loose ends, contradictions and undeveloped disappointing characters for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 22, 2022","Aug 11, 2022","Jul 17, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/61075500-the-stationery-shop

I took away some important points that I hope will help me be more brave. In some essays I even saw glimmers of myself and the shame I’ve experienced. I applaud the writers for helping to explain the things that privileged white people say and do that prevent trust and contribute to the anxiety, frustration, anger, pain and exclusion experienced by Black and Brown people. Sometimes I had to just sit in silence after reading an essay to let it sink in and to try to understand the pain felt by the writer. This book forced me to think, reflect, re-read, research, and realize.

From the infallible Elizabeth to the loyal Harriet to the protective Six-Thirty - and all the characters in between - I did not want the story to end. The structure and language really worked well. Loads of life lessons, commentary about the white middle class America experiences in 50s/60s, crazy coincidences, and plenty of one-liners that left me pondering. A particular commentary from Elizabeth that I liked on page 237: ""Men and women are both human beings. And as humans, we're by-products of our upbringings, victims of our lackluster educational system, and choosers of our behaviors. In short, the reduction of women to something less than men, and the elevation of men to something more than women, is not biological: it's cultural. And it starts with two words: pink and blue. Everything skyrockets out of control from there."" Throughout the book I laughed out loud and I had tears from the heartbreaking and maddening situations that Elizabeth found herself in. And I loved the way she made coffee. ;)...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 27, 2023","Apr 06, 2023","Apr 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065033-lessons-in-chemistry

Much like the main characters (Kerewin, Simon Clare, and Joe), the structure of the book is fractured making it challenging at times to easily follow. Very smart book filled with inner most thoughts from each character, as well as many Maori words/phrases (the glossary in back is very useful). There were many references to “bones” throughout the book, yet in the end I’m unsure exactly the reason for the title itself. Does it have to do with the physical status that all three got to when they were separated after the murder of pedophile and Simon’s near death when cutting Joe? Does it have to do with the ancient Maori ancestors? Or Joe’s broken arm? Perhaps the various artifacts and remains that are washed ashore? The mysticism added another layer of complexity. For as flawed and injured as all three main people were, the ending - or beginning- was quite hopeful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 04, 2022","May 30, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/460635.The_Bone_People

However, this book confirmed for me that I really struggle getting much enjoyment from the young adult genre. The details about the young love that was blossoming added nothing for me, nor did the unrealistic situations that Daunis often found herself in. I find it difficult to buy into the idea that she was able to continue with her own investigation on the side while being a CI, and somehow managing to balance the myriad of everyday life events as an 18-year-old. And the way she handled herself after being sexually assaulted seemed ridiculous to me.

It felt too rushed. The journey was unrealistically achieved in a short period. The relationships could not have developed so deeply in that short period (especially between Bankole and Lauren).

A treasure of a book that eloquently captured many conditions and sentiments of the gritty and pungent sardine factories area where people work, live and play. Steinbeck elevated his characters in a way that made me admire them instead of have pity for or adversity toward them. Lee, Doc, Mack, Dora and others are a motley crew of entrepreneurs, thinkers, loungers, and laborers. The seemingly random stories of the old man who flip flops every evening to the ocean, and the gopher who sets up his new home have their places in the fabric of the community. Plenty of humor and irony woven throughout. A real gem. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Aug 31, 2023","May 08, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4799.Cannery_Row

While much of the writing is beautiful, I had the expectation (based on the book jacket) of reading about “centuries filled with love, loss, art, and war-all the whole dazzling your senses with hundreds of tiny magical moments”. There wasn’t much of that at all. A few quick references to some historical names (Beethoven and Wagner), but what happened to the parts that she supposedly experienced that were mentioned on page 418? “She has lived through wars, and fought in them, witnessed revolution and rebirth. She has left her mark on a thousand works of art, like a thumbprint in the bottom of a drying bowl...”. None of that was detailed. Instead, she ends up meeting a troubled cursed boy after 300 years who looks like the “devil” that she created, and who has also cursed this new love of hers- whom she loves because he remembers her name/who she is. Somehow during this love affair in the last part of the book, the afflictions they both had (people forget her/are obsessed with him) are no longer relevant as they spend their last few days together holding hands. The love affair between her and her devil is when the book started to fall apart and it continued to get worse through the end of the book. I would give this a 2.5 rating if I could. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 03, 2021","Oct 19, 2021","Mar 25, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue

I realize this is a depiction of one particular family across three generations and does not at all represent all women of Palestine or who are Muslim. There were some encouraging moments where some characters seemed to evolve (Fareeda and Khaled acknowledging their mistakes, Deya applying for college). There were also too many loose ends for my taste (did Sarah ever return to her family home? Where did Isra get caught running away with the girls?). I applaud Rum for courageously putting her story out for all to read and question and judge.

This book introduced me to the horrors that took place at the Ravensbruck women's prison camp durCaptivating, educational and at times gut-wrenching. This book introduced me to the horrors that took place at the Ravensbruck women's prison camp during WWII and the absolutely unfathomable experiments done to the Polish women who were ultimately called ""rabbits"". It is obvious that Kelly spent years researching and even visited the camp as well as the family home in CT of the wonderfully generous Caroline Ferriday. While it is a fictional book, many of the people mentioned in the book were real. Overall a 4.5 rating for the writing and subject matter. Kelly was able to illustrate how Caroline's views and relationships changed over the years and how consistent others like Herta and Kasia were with their stances. Yet there were a few gaps in the story that I would have appreciated knowing about. Overall, a great read and a time in history I hope we never forget. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 27, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Aug 30, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25893693-lilac-girls
