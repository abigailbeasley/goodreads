Like why did 1,093 feel the need to highlight the following in Ready Player One? ""Douglas Adams. Kurt Vonnegut. Neal Stephenson. Richard K. Morgan. Stephen King. Orson Scott Card. Terry Pratchett. Terry Brooks. Bester. Bradbury, Haldeman, Heinlein, Tolkien, Vance, Gibson, Gaiman, Sterling, Moorcock, Scalzi, Zelazny."" That a literal list of pop culture references is the passage that reader most responded to probably goes a long way to explaining why I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as other people did. I like nerdy-ass stuff, but it can only take me so far.I found the book at it's best fun. It has a central idea that allows for a world filled with a pastiche of sci-fi and fantasy settings, tropes and characters. It's like watching the craziest, overstuffed video game ever play out in front of me. However, most of the time the book is mired in the author's extreme writerly limitations. The characters are too flat to even be considered thinly-veiled versions of the author, they are just animated version of his ""top five"" movie/album/video game lists. The book is littered with deus ex machina twists, plot holes and implausible settings. I could get past that, but I couldn't ignore two incompatible stylistic choices, mainly because I wouldn't have enjoyed them even if they weren't logically inconsistent. The book's first chapter establishes that this is the sort of book where the main character is supposed to be the author, that he's going ""to set the record straight, once and for all"". So presumably the readers of the book are also from 2045, familiar with the general world around them. Weirdly, Cline then writes with the most exposition-laden prose I think I have ever read. Most of the first half of the book consists of passages like ""The one-size-fits all OASIS visor was slightly larger than a pair of sunglasses. It used harmless low-powered lasers to draw the stunningly real environment of the OASIS right onto the wearer's retina, completely immersing their entire field of vision in the online world. The visor was light-years ahead of the clunky virtual-reality goggles available prior to the that time, and it represented a paradigm shift in virtual-reality technology…"" And so it goes. OASIS is the cornerstone of this entire world. There is no reason the character would feel the need to explain it in this boring level of detail.I really enjoyed the central conceit, and I felt this book wasted its potential. If Cline wrote with a prose similar to A Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, where the nerdy obsessions are synthesized and integrated into the prose, I would have loved it. Instead it felt like a chore. And if a book where dudes are flinging fireballs at giant robots isn't fun, then it fails....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 19, 2014","Mar 20, 2014","Mar 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one

As it plays out, these two different view points don't elucidate each other. At its worst, it reads like someone trying to make gossipy hook-ups sound deep.

Sicha proposes a New York of economics fiefdoms filled with kings and plebs.

I hear advice about keeping the shoulders relaxed a lot, but those two areas work together. Where this book really falters is when it advances the hot nonsense of Pose technique. Pose, for those unfamiliar, is a school of running created by some dude from Russia and brought to America because too many Eastern Europeans are really good at physics, and when they are instructed to run on a flat surface by ""using gravity rather than muscles to go forward"" they scrunch up their faces at how a downward force vector magically becomes a horizontal one. Thankfully, many Americans don't know physics, and apparently never suffered childhood disappointments at the limitations of slinkies and skateboards, and think this is a good idea. The inclusion of Pose was particularly disappointing because Alexander Technique, from what I understand, is about not overthinking things and letting the body do what it naturally wants to do, which would complement a Steve Magness/Tom Tellez understanding of biomechanics. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 29, 2012","Feb 29, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/617214.Master_the_Art_of_Running
