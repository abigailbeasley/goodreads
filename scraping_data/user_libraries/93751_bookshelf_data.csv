Fast forward to February, and suddenly I’m suggesting the collection to my partner in crime (and by crime, I mean lover of books), Laura, as our next selection for the online book club we’ve created, Great Midwest Book Group.Laura and I are devoted to showcasing authors whose books celebrate the Midwest, and I loved the idea that, instead of the stereotypical corn-fed, white farmers and factory workers readers may think of when they think of that word, this author sought to educate readers about the rich diversity of Dearborn, Michigan, aka the Arab-American capital of the USA.After finishing the first story, I *knew* in my gut this was going to be our next pick (Ghassan’s writing is just that good!) and when Laura texted me to share her own enthusiastic endorsement of the selection, I might have done a little jig in my office chair.I did another one when Ghassan confirmed that he would be willing to join us for our Zoom discussion with him on Thursday, April 25, so I’ll inform anybody reading this  before that date that you are MORE than welcome to join us (message me if you’re interested in the details).Already I cannot wait to talk to Ghassan about his American experience (he grew up in Saudi Arabia); his role as a professor of creative writing at various Midwestern universities (U of M-Dearborn and Oberlin, among them); and his inspiration for the remarkable characters who populate this award-winning collection of short stories that, as I've taken to describing them, are filled with heart, humor, and history in equal measure. (Among my favorites: “Speedoman,” “Money Chickens,” “Marseille”, “I Have Reasons to Believe My Neighbor is a Terrorist” and “Yusra”.)

The focus of the story (or so you’re lead to believe) is how, with each new love interest she meets, Daphne Bell receives a slip of paper informing her how much time they’re destined to spend together.It’s an interesting concept and one that made me want to read Serle’s work again (after some of her previous titles ended up only 3-star selections for me). In the end, it wasn’t the promise of romance that kept me turning the pages of this buzzy new release so much as the direction the story took in focusing on Daphne’s growth—a personal journey that played out in a contemplative way against the backdrop of her hometown of Los Angeles (a city I happen to love). A quarter of the way through this one, I thought I saw the ending coming (by that I mean, who Daphne ultimately ends up with), but the plot twists that followed proved to be the book’s real (and rather unexpected) reveals. Those twists are what made reading Expiration Dates an overall engrossing experience, and so I wholeheartedly recommend this title, especially for anyone seeking out stories about self-love and the importance of living in the moment.

I can't for the life of me understand why not, other than the fact it was probably caught up in one of its many book bannings while I was in high school and passed over by the conservative school system that chose which novels I read for the mandatory curriculum I studied as a teenager. Oh well, I suppose it's better to come to a classic late than never at all, and this one I was all too happy to read ahead of diving into Percival Everett's new release, James.

[On a related note, I had about a dozen different versions of this book to choose from when it came to checking out a copy from Libby.

Before the credits rolled, I knew ""League"" had cemented itself onto my heart as one of my favorite films (the imprint of which remains to this day). I share this story to explain why my great love of ""League""—the most record-breaking movie about baseball of all time—makes it impossible for me to give this book anything less than a five-star .But even for readers who aren't super stans, there's still plenty within its pages to enjoy. The chapters are chock full of tidbits about the shoot (more on that in a moment), sprinkled into a narrative that offers a fascinating deep dive both into the biography of its director, Penny Marshall, and a history of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.Here were a few anecdotes that, combined with all the on-set tea spilled by cast members, made this a home run read for me:• I had no idea until reading this that the beloved character of Betty Spaghetti was portrayed by Penny's daughter, Tracy Reiner (the story of how she gets involved in casting was delightful)! • A who's who list of actresses and actors were in the running for the major roles of this film before Penny finally settled on the familiar names who were cast. Can you imagine Debra Winger as Dottie Hinson? Jim Belushi as Jimmy Dugan? We came thisclose to their names being on the movie poster! • Much of the movie was filmed in Indiana, with locals around Evansville (where the majority was shot) cast for supporting roles. Among them was local softball player DeLisa Chinn-Tyler, who portrayed the Black bystander who threw the ball in the iconic scene where words were unnecessary to convey the injustice that was Black women being shut out of the league. The fact her story is included in this book (when her name was left out of the credits) was a small sliver of justice served. • Penny shot so much film for this movie—about TWO MILLION feet—that Kodak threw her and the cast a party, complete with plenty of bottles of champagne to go 'round.***Given when I saw this film as a kid, I always assumed it came out in the second half of 1992. I was SHOCKED to learn while reading this that it actually debuted on July 1, 1992....which means it was still playing on the big screen five months later, when I saw it. It was probably at the $1 movie theater by then (remember those?!) but still, how incredible that this film—a commercial success that ended up earning $130+ million against a budget of $40 million—spent roughly a half-year in theaters!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 02, 2024","Mar 07, 2024","Mar 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75593481-no-crying-in-baseball

The influence of that one series cannot be overstated when you consider what Zwick has to say about the actors, writers, and producers he and Herskovitz hired to work on the series with them: “Their work has had an undeniable influence on the best television has had to offer,” he wrote in his new memoir. “Alias, My So-Called Life, Friday Night Lights, Brothers & Sisters, Grey’s Anatomy, Parenthood, New Amsterdam, Breaking Bad, Without a Trace, Nashville, Once and Again, Damages, Jane the Virgin, In Treatment, and This is Us, to name a few.”Ummmmmmm…. best television has had to offer INDEED!While it may have been my understanding of Zwick’s work on thirtysomething that initially drew me into this read, I was pulled along by discovering how many other projects he’s worked on that I love, most notably his role in producing and directing Legends of the Fall (aka, the film that took my teenage obsession of Brad Pitt to an 11).As Zwick says in his introduction, “I’ll be dropping a few names,” and indeed he does throughout his life story—from recounting his experience casting Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington in Glory, to discovering Claire Danes during the casting process for My So Called Life to courting Julia Roberts for the lead in Shakespeare in Love (a project for which Harvey Weinstein swooped in and stole from him like the colossal bully he was). It truly is CRAZY how many legends this man has worked with over the years!I loved the unexpected discovery of this memoir landing onto my 2024 reading list as much as I loved all the behind-the-scenes anecdotes Zwick shared within its pages. This is a title that’ll stick with me for years to come and is a must-read for anyone who loves pop culture, the film industry, and/or creative professions as much as I do. **Multiple times while reading this book, I thought of Zwick and Herskvotiz as TV’s answer to the famed theater partnership of Rodgers and Hammerstein … I also LOVED learning Ed and Marshall’s production company is named Bedford Falls Productions after the fictional town in It’s a Wonderful Life, a film that resides on the “forever favorites” shelf in my heart. ***Since reading this book, I’ve started re-watching thirtysomething and it’s SUCH a nostalgic, Baby Boomer blast from the past—one that feels like the pop culture equivalent of being wrapped up in your grandma’s coziest afghan. I can’t get enough of the series and I’m already looking forward to rediscovering My So-Called Life next! ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 28, 2024","Apr 08, 2024","Feb 21, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/176443727-hits-flops-and-other-illusions

Ethan is a good guy, so this story doesn’t set out to paint this baby’s daddy in a negative light. Matter of fact, the author chooses instead to double down with her good guys by introducing Shep (the brother of Eve’s best friend), who quickly becomes the third point of this book’s literary love triangle.Shep may be the most perfect man to exist on paper — like, in a world of romantic tropes, his Golden Retriever energy is less single dog and more litter of adorable puppies. He’s cute. Eve’s cute. Ethan’s cute.

But it’s precisely because of its setting and the major events covered in its chapters—the Korean War and polio epidemic—that I felt so compelled to read it. The narrator of the audiobook, James Patrick Cronin, does a tremendous job with all the characters' accents. The entire time I listened, I felt like I was right there alongside them, whether it was with Jacob fighting off a North Korean soldier or with Naomi and Blackburn in North Carolina, awaiting his return. Rash takes this story places I didn’t expect it to go, and I found myself holding my breath until the final minutes, unsure how it would end.

Among our critiques? Maria never joins any actual cults (such faulty advertising!) She does, however, partake in a number of support groups (Debtors Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous … the list goes on). And in writing this book, she shares lessons learned from each of those experiences along with chronicling her rise in LA as she endured multiple mental health crises. (Crises that warranted time spent at inpatient psychiatric units, so we’re not talking about your garden-variety depression here). The publisher describes Maria’s memoir as “brutally honest” and “hilariously frenetic.” While I personally felt it (ahem) light on hilarity, I did think it offered an enlightening look into the brain of someone forced to battle significant demons while fighting for her definition of career success. And truly, my heart goes out to anyone and everyone battling mental illness—what a cruel motherfucker it can be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 29, 2023","Jan 10, 2024","Dec 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112093865-sure-i-ll-join-your-cult

And this summertime read IS different …. from Carley’s 2023 title, Meet Me at the Lake, that is.It’s sexier, for starters (whew….Felix ‘Wolf’ Clark*** may just be my favorite male love interest to date—like, of any romance I’ve read). But also, this book is just more self-assured in its storytelling, with a plot that focuses on a forbidden love affair between Toronto florist Lucy Ashby and the brother (Felix) of her best friend, Bridget. Carley Fortune has been open about how the runaway success of her 2022 debut, Every Summer After, prompted crippling anxiety when it came time to write her second book, one that required a number of rewrites that made her doubt her abilities as an author. How wonderful, then, to realize within the opening chapter of This Summer that the sophomore slump is a fear of the past and that Carley is at the top of her game with this new title, which, IMO, is her best yet. Finally, talk about a love letter to a “happy place” (there’s a cute nod to Emily Henry’s books in this novel, just as there’s a cute nod to Carley’s books in Henry’s new Funny Story—these two share a literary agent and, clearly, a fair amount of appreciation for one another): After finishing This Summer, I’m now ready to read all the Anne of Green Gable novels and then book a flight for Prince Edward Island where I will happily consume my weight in Malpeque oysters. The tourism board of PEI seriously needs to send Carley a massive bouquet of flowers when this book hits shelves on May 7, because WOW is that place about to experience an uptick in visitors, mark my words! ***This is a very low stakes, spoiler-y mention about Felix I feel compelled to share that is my one gripe that isn't REALLY a gripe about this book: (view spoiler)[But I think Carley has crafted maybe TOO perfect of a man with this guy ...Like, can I believe this twenty-something guy shucks oysters with as much confidence and skill as he constructs cottages (and…ahem…performs cunnilingus)? Definitely. But do I think this same guy would actually have a fetish for classic novels published before the 20th century? [ Cue my favorite meme in response]. I guess that’s the beauty of fiction though, right? We get to fantasize about a sexy love interest who knows how to build a dock as well as he can quote Dickens.

Primarily because it's an obvious (if you know the backstory) roman a clef about Cuban artist Ana Mendieta who, after a fight with her husband, famed sculptor Carl Andre, ""went out the window"" of their 34th floor NYC apartment in the 1980s—an incident that overshadowed Andre's career up to his own death in January 2024. Case in point, here's the headline and subhead from his recent obituary in the New York Times: Carl Andre, 88, Austerely Minimalist Sculptor, Is DeadHe worked with elemental metals, granite, wood and brick in sculpture “free of human association.” His career was marred by accusations that he had a role in his wife’s fatal plunge.I first learned of Mendieta's story last fall, while reading Claire Dederer's Monsters, which is why this novel's plot—about Cuban artist Anita De Monte winding up dead after a fall that followed a nasty fight with her husband, famed sculptor Jack Martin—was so familiar to me. González references Mendieta by first name only in her dedication of Anita: ""In memory of Ana/And all the women who endured solitude/never knowing the rest of us were out there."" I happened to overlook said mention when I started reading this book. So when I came to the Acknowledgments, I expected at least a few sentences about how González wrote this novel—one so heavily inspired she basically passed off exact artworks of Mendieta's as ones created by Anita—to shine light on the life and artistry of Mendieta, much in the way González's other main character, Raquel Toro, writes a thesis that brings renewed attention to the late Anita de Monte.Instead, I was BEYOND disappointed to find no such mention of Mendieta by her full name. This failure to give her proper credit as source material? To explain more about who she was and to point readers to other resources about her (like this podcast, for example)? It felt like one more way Ana Mendieta continues to hide in plain sight from those who don't know her story. Talk about a missed opportunity! Finally, in relation to what happens to Anita's ghost, I agree with what author Jean Hanff Korelitz had to say about the strange metaphysical transformations that happen late in this book: ""It asks a good deal of a reader to shape-shift with Anita, and while many will gladly make that jump with the author, I found I wasn’t among them. In the end, it was simply a leap (or, more likely, a push) too far.""...more",Notes are private!,5,6,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 23, 2024","Dec 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127306192-anita-de-monte-laughs-last

Taylor's comedic chops are on full display with this book (which she does a bang up job reading on audio, I might add). Her humorous takes on growing up in the Midwest, flailing in jobs in her 20s, and becoming a mother made me LOL multiple times. But what surprised me most was how, depending on the context of the chapter, her writing could be as tender** as it was tongue in cheek.My favorite dynamic of the book was her great love for her dog, Harlow—the Vizsla she adopted with her husband that is definitely the star of this story. Her conversations with Har (or Carl, the nickname she gave him when he was being an asshole - ha!) were so touching I was won over ten-fold by their buddy comedy routine. I honestly can't remember the last time I cried over a dog's story—I think it was Where the Red Fern Grows? But Taylor's writing—specifically the last few chapters—really got to me. To say more would ruin the journey she takes you on with Har, and what a sweet, affirming journey it is.

(I’ve also felt, even more so, that I belong to that distinct micro generation that refers to itself as Xennials/the Oregon Trail Generation/Elder Millennials … take your pick.) I mention this age gap because it made itself all-caps KNOWN while I was listening to Kate Kennedy’s One in a Millennial.For every reference Kate made to, say, Beverly Hills 90210 or Saved By the Bell, she made a dozen more to, say, her love of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movies. (Considering I would have been a high school senior when those were popular, no way in hell would I have been caught watching them!)Many times throughout this read, I was reminded of just how much older I am than her. (Case in point: While she was a 10 year old using AOL Instant Messenger, I was a college freshman doing the same.)But despite us having some major clashing cultural touchpoints, there were plenty that we shared, including zeitgeisty references to listening to the Spice Girls, wearing a “going out” top, and shopping at Limited Too (though my preppy version of that store circa 1992 was MUCH different than the glittery version Kate shopped at years later!) Overall, I think Kate did a great job critiquing the culture that shaped our generation as women. (I especially loved her examination of the character Jessie Spano from Saved by the Bell.) And while she could often be humorous on the page, she was strikingly serious when, for example, connecting the dots on how purity culture of the 80s/90s/00s shaped the sexuality of many millennial women.No regrets about reading this and I’ll go out on this note: My favorite “nod my head in agreement” moment of the book was when Kate spoke about her “daybed days” of girlhood. Having spent MANY nights growing up sleeping alongside my BFF in her daybed, I could relate to this nostalgia—and to Kate’s assessment that sleepovers (intimate overnights spent with 2-3 of your best friends) were WAY better than slumber parties (which were bigger, louder, and involved more classmates, which, for an introvert like me, often meant less fun)....more",Notes are private!,5,9,1,"Feb 06, 2024","Feb 13, 2024","Dec 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123921296-one-in-a-millennial

I knew I wanted toSecond Review, December 2023This book shot to the top of my favorites list of 2023—hands down my most recommended book of the year. I knew I wanted to own a copy, but my love for this one ran so deep that I specifically *had* to purchase a UK edition from British bookseller Blackwell's Bookshop. Mostly because its bright orange cover features gorgeous foil-embossed spoons in empty cereal bowls—a graphic nod to an important scene central to the opening chapters of the novel. So what did I make of a second reading, this time with a physical copy in hand? I loved it every bit as much, if not more, as my first time discovering this beautiful story. I remain blown away that this book is author Claire Daverley's debut -- her ability to invoke setting and emotion and sensory imagery with just a handful of words per sentence is astonishing. And I was swept up anew in the love story of Rosie and Will, who by this point feel as real to me as cousins or coworkers. Wherever they are now in the literary ecosystem, I wish them well in their journey through life together. Original Review, October 2023I’ve been calling this book a “magic unicorn” read to all my friends, in large part because it is SO rare (in my experience, at least) to discover a novel that reads both like literary fiction AND a truly compelling romance. This story is about Will and Rosie and how they fall for each other as young teens in England (first over a bonfire and then late night bowls of cereal and then dreamy meet-ups next to the sea). But it’s also about how first love can be torn asunder by tragedy.And….sigh. Will and Rosie? They face a LOT of tragedy in their young lives. To say more would give too much away, as I feel this read is best experienced knowing next to little about the story overall. If you HAVE read it and you want to know a few specific scenes that made this a Top 3 read of 2023 for me, have a gander at my list below:(view spoiler)[* When Rosie and Will make off with a tray of desserts and talk outside during her family’s Xmas party…that was such a fabulous depiction of a stolen moment every young person wishes for alongside the crush of their dreams. (See also: eating bowls of cereal in the middle of the night together.)* When Rosie’s twin brother, Josh, confides in Rosie that he is gay and has a crush of his own on Will …. oh Josh, you sweet tormented soul, you! * Will’s relationship with his sweet grandmother.* Will’s relationship with his wise little sister, Amber.* Will refurbishing a piano for Rosie …..SWOONNNNNNNNNNN!!!* Will and Rosie finally getting stolen time together—time during which there is consolatory mac and cheese devoured and passionate love made (the carpet burns!)* Will helping Rosie care for Simon while he has cancer (a plot pivot I didn’t see coming!)* Those final chapters when Rosie and Will (both having found what they needed personally and grown as people) reunite and finally (FINALLY!) get to be a couple.

Also, friend our account on Instagram too, please!) Having finished this book on a recent road trip, and without giving anything away, here are a few thoughts I’m holding on to in anticipation of our upcoming Q&A with the author:• This book is set in the woods of rural Wisconsin, and I loved how I felt like I was right there with the main character, Elsa. I appreciated how this read was both a story about how people choose to live off the grid and a narrative about a woman who—having lived a rather bougie East Coast existence before meeting her husband, Silas—finds solace in the quiet life they establish as newylweds in the Midwest. • I *really* enjoyed this book on audio—the narrative performances were so nuanced and added tension to a story chock full of drama.• One of the throughlines of this story is about Elsa being a woman unaccustomed to accepting help from others—something she desperately needs in the wake of a family tragedy—and how she has to find it within herself to accept that help from the type of humble, hardworking people (Ethan and Luvera) who define the Midwestern lifestyle. • Dunbar herself lives off the grid (she writes from a solar-powered office on the second floor of a water tower) so I cannot wait to ask her about how this type of lifestyle has changed her, given she was once, like Elsa, a “city girl.”• This is a book I may never have gotten around to reading were it not for this book group. For that reason alone, I am grateful for the time that Laura and I are investing in cultivating this group for ourselves and for like-minded readers who want to see more fiction written about the Midwest as a place where people want to live versus leave....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 08, 2023","Nov 21, 2023","Nov 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808153-the-net-beneath-us

Which means I can remember every aspect of her meteoric rise, because I watched her strut down the halls of high school in 1999 in that “…Baby One More Time” video while neck deep in my own high school experience. [Said performance would later air ad nauseam on TRL, MTV’s after-school video countdown, a defining cultural touchpoint for most of us millennials.] What followed after her debut was watching her dance with a snake during the VMAs in 2001, a pop culture moment everybody talked about at the time (including me and my college besties). Then (and this is something I am NOT proud of…something I thought about a lot while listening to Michelle Williams’ tremendous audio narration of this memoir) came the “Is she crazy?” questioning of her behavior in the aughts—the deriding of her shaved head and “mishandling” of her babies and panning of her 2007 VMAs performance (which, watching in 2023 is not nearly as bad as media made it out to be then). So yeah, all of what I wrote above I wrote to acknowledge that this memoir of Britney’s? It’s about HER finally having a say about the shitstorm that’s been her life. But it’s also about US acknowledging our complicity in the power of the mean-spirited narrative that defined her twenties (whether it was watching Diane Sawyer roast her in that infamous interview or clicking on PerezHilton.com or scanning US Weekly headlines at the grocery store ... sadly, I am guilty of all three and for that, I am truly sorry, Britney.)Like so many others, I am here for the cultural reckoning happening in relation to this poor woman—everything from examining how media grilled her incessantly (seriously, why were they OBSESSED with asking about her virginity?) to addressing her mental health (by making her the butt of countless jokes and casual cruelty). Of all the confessions to come from this book, it is how Britney confronts these issues on her own terms that made for the most powerful revelation to me. A few parting thoughts:— I’d like to take back the money I spent on the Justin Timberlake concert I attended in 2013. That asshat deserves ALL the ridicule he’s facing in response to this book. (Fo shizz, fo shizz #iykyk )— Despite all her family put her through, Britney remains SUCH an empathetic person. This character trait comes through loud and clear throughout this short read and it endears me to her all the more.— Given how Britney explains her Instagram videos, I support her freedom to portray herself how she wants online (even if I can admit I mute them because it's just too much skin for me). But Brit, you do you.

(Learning this made for a fun dive into back episodes, some featuring interviews with favorite authors including Emma Straub and Bonnie Garmus.)I’m sharing this tidbit because: 1) If you don’t already subscribe to their pod, you should change that and 2) the reason I picked up this particular psychological thriller is because it was Becca and Olivia’s book club pick for October.Only a few chapters in and I was reminded of why I don’t really “do” psychological thrillers—they set me on edge too much! But mission accomplished, Ms. Michallon …. you had me hooked wanting to find out what would happen to the poor “woman in the shed” (aka, the sole surviving target of serial killer Aidan Thomas). This book was elevated on audio by the stellar voice work of the narrators. (After I finished, I learned the author is a member of the cast, “becoming” one of the nameless women whose short vignettes give readers clues into their final moments with Aidan before they die at his hands.)In many ways, this book made me think of the great work Jamie Dornan did playing a doting father with serial killer tendencies in the TV series, The Fall.

(I’m looking at you, 2017 and 2018….)What MOST fascinated me about this read, however, wasn’t what Dederer had to say about Woody Allen or Roman Polanski or Pablo Picasso (monsters, all) but rather what female monstrousness looks like—and that is abandoning one’s child for one’s art.Those chapters really got this brain of mine working in overdrive, convincing me this read would be an excellent pick for a book club. (I want to ask other readers—women especially!—what they think of it. And if, like me, they disagree with her notion 'pregnancy is the end of narrative.' Pfftt…that doesn’t have to be true! )One final observation: My husband and I’s tandem read of this book happened over the course of a getaway during which we toured Frank Lloyd Wright’s incredible Wisconsin home, Taliesin. The irony was not lost on us that, hitting pause on this read, we left behind one work of criticism about certain monsters to join a tour in which we learned a great deal about another. Say what you will about FLW (and it’s no exaggeration to call him a genius) but damn the man and his philandering ways! Upon leaving the grounds of his home, I felt, in the words of Dederer, “a little urpy.” Like the fan who now (unfortunately) knew too much. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 06, 2023","Oct 19, 2023","Oct 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61685822-monsters

And I’m glad I went into it with the open mind that I did, curiosity piqued by friends who spoke highly of it. Because yes, this is a book about a man who turns into a shark. But in Habeck’s world, transforming into an animal is a life-altering diagnosis that can befall any person, same as cancer or Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s.  There’s something refreshing about processing the grief and trauma of an illness or terminal diagnosis like that through the lens of the paranormal. At least, I found this to be true as I read along—immersed in a story that was unique in both concept and in construct. (Some chapters are only a few sentences long).But what really stole my heart with this title was its closing scenes, which are a beautiful rumination on loss and love and parenthood.

(Huge!) In part because I am fascinated by the science behind their decades of research. (Case in point: In a study of couples he conducted in the ‘90s, John Gotten was able to predict divorce in couples with 94% accuracy. Ninety-four percent!)Because of their expertise, I put stock in absolutely everything John and Julie have to say about the building blocks of what makes a relationship last for the long haul. If I had to summarize their major takeaway from this read it would be that partners need to build habits of *turning towards each other* in simple everyday moments—moments that, over time, build the bridges of trust and affection that help a couple survive even the toughest of times.I would recommend ANYONE in a relationship—be it days or decades old—pick up this book. There is so much knowledge and actionable suggestions to take away from it. I feel fortunate that my experience of reading it (aloud, I might add!) happened alongside my husband as we took a road trip to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary … a fitting occasion to remind ourselves of the positive practices we can incorporate into our relationship to make it even stronger than it currently is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 06, 2023","Oct 08, 2023","Oct 12, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60301229-the-love-prescription

I loved this book so much and will remember it as the title that turned me into a super fan of Adams’ work.

What I found certainly deepened my appreciation for both Ward and for this read:• Ward spent years writing and researching this book. Her work on it was stalled when she lost her partner in December 2019 (right as COVID was hitting in the US). For six months after his death, she feared she’d never write again. • Ward wondered if the world needed another slave narrative and if she should be the one to write it. It was a conversation with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates that gave her the boost to do it. “One of the things he said was, if you think about it, there were millions of people who were enslaved. So there are millions of lives to write about and their experiences were all different. The common element was the fact they were enslaved, but they all had different wants and desires and dreams and longings and griefs. That’s a very simple declaration, but I needed to hear it.” (Source)• Ward was inspired to write the book while driving from her home in Mississippi to New Orleans, where she teaches at Tulane. Listening to NPR, she heard a series they were doing about the history of New Orleans, where a portion of the book is set. “I was shocked that I knew none of the history that they were covering in the radio show,” she says. “And that I think really drove home for me the fact that that history had been erased; so erased from the landscape that I had spent years of my life in that place and couldn’t see that history at all. I just remember being appalled in that moment and wondering, What if I wrote about it? Would that help to bring that reality back into the public consciousness, back into [the] public awareness?” (Source)At this point in my life, I’ve read many a slave narrative and what I appreciated most about this one was the incorporation of spirits into the story—how they guided Annis in her decision-making and on her path to freedom.I also appreciated the title, which comes from a scene early in the book when Annis overhears the tutor of her master’s daughters (her half-sisters) learning about Dante’s Inferno. In that moment, Annis (and the reader) is introduced to the poem’s opening lines: Let us descend and enter this blind world.Such an apt description for the specific hell that was chattel slavery in this country....more",Notes are private!,2,5,1,"Jan 30, 2024","Feb 05, 2024","Aug 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/87556695-let-us-descend

If you’re not up for that, then here’s the TLDR version: She works on several manuscripts at once, writes all first drafts long hand, then locks them in a bank box and starts over FROM MEMORY.Oh, and just to get into the “rhythm” of the language of the time period in which The Vaster Wilds takes place, she wrote a version of this novel in iambic pentameter FOR FUN.With those mind-blowing facts out of the way, I will say I DEVOURED Vaster Wilds—an engrossing adventure story about a young woman who escapes the fledgling colony of Jamestown to forge her own path in the North American wilderness.I was maybe a few dozen chapters in when I realized, “Huh…this book has no dialogue in it.” In lesser hands, this would have been a deterrent. And yet, with Groff at the helm, I could not get enough of her beautiful, propulsive prose.This is one of those books I will keep returning to in my mind, turning over the fate of the characters, the hellish realities of the 17th century time period, and the atrocities committed on the natives who were here in this country first. It’s a trip to early colonial America I didn’t know I needed, and I’m grateful to Groff for gifting it to us.A few passages I don’t want to forget:“And yet you do not know the scale of this place? the voice said, and it was now scornful. And the girl said, No, but surely it must be smaller than my own far greater country across the waters, where each field is so thick with legend and myth and ancient battles that one step is not merely in space, unlike in this new world, but also through layers of time. Here there is nothing, only land, all the earth and mountains and trees remain innocent of story. This place is itself a sheet of parchment yet to be written upon.”“For what woman has not, walking in the dark of the street or along a path deep in the countryside, sensed the brutal imaginings of a man watching her from his hidden place, and felt the same chills chasing over her skin, and quickened her steps to get away.”“All the trees wore coats of ice so thick that they seemed glazed over with glass, and the stars shone so bright upon the world that the world shone back at the stars in stupid dazzlement.”“It is a moral failure to miss the profound beauty of the world, said the voice in her mind.

Because ofMy book-selling bestie, Jamie, tipped me off early to this read, having sent me a text months ago telling me how delightfully silly it was. Because of said exchange, I was the first hold for my library’s e-copy. Now having read it, I can admit I was just as smitten as Jamie was (like, LOL smitten) from its opening pages. Also, a confession: I am a sucker for vampire fiction (what can I say…2008’s double discovery of Twilight and True Blood lured me in—haha). So I’m always gonna be interested in how authors interpret this particular brand of fantasy romance.I think Jenna Levine serves up a fun rendition to the subgenre with her love story centering on one creative Cassie Greenberg (sigh…always with the manic pixie dream girl leads) and one fusty Frederick Fitzwilliam. And okay, the fact I decided my beloved Keanu Reeves would be perfect for the role of Frederick? That REALLY sucked (pun intended!) me in here. (I mean, Keanu might actually *be* a vampire, so…….)

There is just an “it” factor to Katherine’s writing—something I couldn’t quite put my finger on until I read a Guardian  of Games and Rituals, which points out Heiny’s ability to deliver “deadpan delivery, the bittersweet wisdom, the sublime farce.”See also how author Jennifer Close so perfectly describes the experience of reading Katherine’s work: “The opportunity to read a new short story by Katherine Heiny always fills me with delight.

Speaking of games (and a few rituals), here were my favorite stories from this collection:* Chicken-Flavored and Lemon Scented—a story that follows the shenanigans of a bunch of DMV workers with a surprising twist at the end* Turn Back Turn Back—a story about what happens when a bedtime story unravels a struggling marriage (side note: Katherine really likes to center her stories around the topic of infidelity)* CobRa—a story that details an “off” season of marriage between a wife relying on the Marie Kondo method to help cope with empty nest syndrome and a husband whose metabolism has turned on him “the way the tabloids turned on Meghan Markle” (when I came across that description I straight up laughed out loud)* 561—a story about a woman forced to help her ex-husband’s wife move out of the family’s home (with a brilliant backstory of how they met working at a suicide prevention hotline)Games and Rituals is easily going to end up in my list of Top 10 Books of 2023, you watch....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 19, 2023",Aug 2023,"Jul 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61387869-games-and-rituals

Well, let's just say it hurt my mama heart DEEPLY to read about. It's clear Minka has done a LOT of work on herself in therapy to overcome the demons of her youth, but this memoir is a powerful example of how ghosts from a person's past can and will haunt every waking hour of one's life, well into adulthood.

The prize of said game is the unsold manuscript of the latest book in Masterson’s successful Clock Island series, the sale of which will provide Lucy the money she needs to adopt Christopher and to embark on a fresh start.• Create excerpts from the Clock Island series that are sprinkled throughout the main story—excerpts good enough they could be be bestsellers of their own if the series actually existed. • Create riddles and games for Lucy and the other contestants to solve that stumped this reader time and time again. • Create a heartwarming backstory for Hugo, the handsome illustrator of Jack’s books, who becomes Lucy’s love interest and whose works are described so vividly I would pay good money to see them in a touring exhibition (again, if said works actually existed).

There are no shortage of celebrities who put memoirs into the world, but I was smitten with the construct of this one: Faced with a life-threatening illness, actress Diane Ladd receives a prescription from her doctor to walk to strengthen her lungs. Her daughter, the brilliant Laura Dern, recognizes the only way she's going to get her mother to exercise is by turning it into a creative exercise. And so begins the conversations that form the basis of Honey, Baby, Mine, a book that takes its title from the Crawdad Song that Ladd's father used to sing to her when she was little.These two cover all the bases in their discussions: from surviving Hollywood, to their favorite things, to raising kids and the guilt (and opportunities) that accompany the role of being a working parent. I loved every one of their ""walk and talk""s, even as SEVERAL made me cringe. (OMG…do not get Laura started on the time Diane gave her grandson, Ellery, a gender-defining hair cut!)Because these two are the acting powerhouses they are, they elevate the audio version of the book to performance art. I finished this one wanting to call my own mother as well as dig into a backlist of both actresses’ films, starting with the Oscar nominated “Rambling Rose.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 17, 2023","Jun 25, 2023","Jun 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61918824-honey-baby-mine

He might have bought a ring and tied their lives together. But Ellwood was Ellwood, and Gaunt had to be satisfied with the weight of his head on his shoulder."" Oh Sidney Ellwood! Oh Henry Gaunt! HOW YOU STOLE MY HEART!It is impossible for me to believe this is a debut novel from author Alice Winn (who reportedly began writing it at 26, inspired as she was by the stories contained in the digitized newspapers of the English boarding school she attended—papers that informed the fictional paper, The Preshutian, that makes up the backbone of In Memoriam). As Alice said, “You get to know them ... you feel like you’re watching this tiny little society just be completely destroyed and dismantled.”It is this experience—learning about the lives of these young men and then watching as war viciously snatches them away—that Winn captures so brilliantly for readers of this remarkable book that for sure counts among my Top 5 reads of 2023. It's been a long time since I've read a book with a scene that made me gasp out loud and that happened with the brilliant twist Winn writes into this story. (Another reason I loved it!) But as sad and horrifying as its gruesome battle scenes were, In Memoriam still contains plenty of heart and humor. (There is a running joke about George Elliot's Adam Bede I found particularly funny.) I saw a  of this book that compared it to ""Heartstopper on the Western Front"" and ...that's a pretty accurate summary, if you ask me. Throughout its 400 pages, you can't help but think about how different the lives of Ellwood and Gaunt would have been had they been born 100 years later—to live full lives and to love who they wanted to love without fear or penalty. My life feels a little richer now for having gotten to know them. A final note worth mentioning is that I very much enjoyed reading in Winn's acknowledgments about how many of her characters were inspired by real soldiers of the Great War. One in particular I came to love immensely, and whose fate I cared about as much as Ellwood and Gaunt's, was Gideon Devi (inspired by Indian RFC pilot Erroll Chunder Sen). There was another soldier I loved for his willingness to help Ellwood and Gaunt in a pivotal way and that was Captain Cyril Roseveare, whose bravery and loyalty was captured beautifully in the final entry Winn gives us from The Preshutian.

Then, I sat on it for MONTHS, intimidated by its brick-like size. What a dum-dum move that was, because really, what’s better? Reading two mediocre 350-page novels back to back—something I definitely did in the time between purchasing this book and finally picking it up—or reading one epic 700-page saga that reads like a modern-day masterpiece? From its opening page, Covenant sweeps you away to the lush landscape of South India’s Malabar Coast, beginning at the turn of the 20th century. And it’s here that Verghese introduces a remarkable cast of characters—Big Ammachi, Baby Mol, Philipose, Elsie, Mariamma, and Digby among them—who burrow into your heart and forever change you.Like the author, I loved these women and men deeply, all the more so because of the epic highs and lows he put them through.

That memory came back to mind as I picked up this new book—co-written by Boylan and Jodi Picoult—which my book club selected for our summer read.Now that I’m finished with it, I can say I would not have wanted to read a book about a transgendered person in the Year of Our Lord 2023 that WASN’T co-written by someone who was also transgender. In this respect, Boylan succeeded in continuing my education of the trans experience and my understanding of the trans community. This was one of those reads that was propulsive, narratively speaking, but … I did struggle with it at times. I’m not much for narratives where domestic abuse is a focus (not because of personal experience just, ugh…such stories are hard to read, you know?) Also, I felt like this book needed a bit more editing (not a ton, but had it been cut by at least 30 pages or so, it would have been even more of a stellar read …I might recommend 3-4 fewer instances where beekeeping metaphors were employed, for starters). I do, however, have one major gripe about the plot (and it’s something I look forward to talking about with members of my book club when we meet to see if they felt the same): (view spoiler)[The constant mentioning of Asher’s jerky friend Dirk made the reader believe he was going to have something to do with Lily’s death. It was enough to learn in the trial that Lily ACTUALLY died because of a medical condition related to her transition … I don’t think the story was served well by the bait-and-switch of making Maya (Asher’s jealous BFF) the person responsible for her death instead. And if Dirk WASN'T going to be involved (and this WASN'T going to be a crime of trans hate), then yeah, fewer references to him would have helped move the story along a little quicker, too.

In Bright Young Women, we get a fictional retelling of the victims of serial killer Ted Bundy—specifically his victims from 1974 to 1978, which included an attack on the Florida State University Chi Omega sorority house, where he killed two women and beat two more, before attacking another woman blocks away.Knoll purposefully never refers to her serial killer by name, only as “The Defendant,” establishing a pattern of belittling his intellect (going so far as to point out that he picked his nose while in the courtroom).There were moments throughout Bright Young Women*** where I occasionally felt out of “syntactical alignment” with the writing (and apparently wasn’t the only one). Yet overall, when I think back on my reading experience of it, this book was such a stand-out story that I know I won’t be letting go of my memories of it anytime soon—a good thing, considering I chose it for the next pick for my book club! ***Knoll named her novel in reaction to watching courtroom footage of an overly complimentary judge say of Bundy: “You’re a bright young man. You could have done all these things with your life, and you went another way.” Gross, right? No wonder Knoll felt compelled to reveal all the ways our nation “got the story wrong” with this famed psychopath.Also, if you finished this book wanting to know more—about Knoll, about her inspiration for the book, about her research for the dual-narrative timeline she used—this interview is a great companion read and so is this one, too....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 26, 2023","Nov 09, 2023","May 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/101124639-bright-young-women

What I loved most about New Kid was how deftly Jerry Craft examines issues that his Black protagonist, Jordan, experiences at his fancy (new to him) private school. From having to code switch between his wealthy peers and friends in his neighborhood, to handling school bullies, to dealing with micro aggressions from his classmates and teachers alike, Jordan is a character for the moment and New Kid is a book that makes these topics both timeless and relevant. While reading this together, my son and I had some great conversations about the above topics. He also appreciated that, while he’s not of the same race or socioeconomic background as Jordan, he IS a kid who has been picked on for being small … so to read about how Jordan successfully navigated the halls of middle school as the “shrimp"" of his group was yet another reason for him to root for this character’s success at Riverdale.

And he DOES meet his favorite Friend, Courtney Cox, while staying at her place in LA.

As I write this (the same month it came out), the memoir has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide. (source) It’s been reported Penguin Random House needed to sell “in the vicinity” of 1.5 million copies to break even with the $20 million they paid Harry upfront to write the book (with help from his incredible ghostwriter, JR Moehringer).

(Spoiler: They are not.)— That I would find myself caring about how, for many Nuyoricans, gentrification is destroying their cultural ties to the city. See also: my new-found understanding of neo-colonizing in Puerto Rico. — That I would be inspired by the author’s life story of giving up her own successful wedding planning business at 40 to become a writer accepted to Iowa Writer’s, where she wrote her first draft of Olga.— That upon learning a Hulu adaptation of Olga was in the works, I would excitedly check who’s been cast as the heroine (picturing a post-Hustlers J.Lo as my version of the curvaceous Latina) only to be…surprised(?!) to learn Aubrey Plaza nabbed the role. Um, what?! Look, I am SO glad they cast someone of Puerto Rican descent (which Plaza is), but wow, that was a left-field casting call for me! I am a tad skeptical and yet very excited to see what she does with the role, as well as Jesse Williams as Matteo (Olga’s eccentric but extremely likable love interest). Since the author is writing the screenplay, I’ll keep my fingers crossed this is one of those rare adaptations that lives up to the amazingness of the book![For a  that offers a MUCH different take on this book from mine, and one I would encourage others to read, as it's written by someone with ties to PR, check out what Melanie had to say.

I learned so much about Denmark’s role in the war from this book, one that gives children a brief glimpse into how frightening this time was while (thankfully) dwelling on a more positive story of bravery and hope. For that reason, I believe it’s a good entry point for any family looking to discuss World War II or the Holocaust with their children. ...more",Notes are private!,1,11,1,"Jan 09, 2023","Feb 06, 2023","Jan 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/47281.Number_the_Stars

The buildinWhen I was growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, I took a school field trip (in maybe the third grade?) to the Fort Wayne Historical Society. The building itself made the trip memorable, but what seared that field trip into my brain is the recollection of turning the corner on one of the floors and discovering a glass display with a dummy inside (which, dude, scary already) WEARING A FULL KU KLUX KLAN COSTUME***.I thought a lot about that trip (which gave me nightmares for months after) as I read Tim Egan’s new book A Fever in the Heartland—a work of nonfiction that hits *too* close to home given its examination of that dark period in American history when WAYYYYYYY more Americans were members of the KKK than our history books led us to believe. (In Indiana, the heart of Klan activity at the time, ONE IN THREE Hoosiers were members of the Klan in 1923. ONE. IN. THREE.) It’s easy 100 years on to romanticize the ‘20s as that roaring era of flappers and jazz and the Charleston, but peel back the Gatsby-colored curtain and pick up a book like this (or watch Ken Burns’ “The US and the Holocaust”) and you can realize this was also the same terrifying decade when xenophobia reigned supreme, the KKK was hosting parades like they were going out of style (not just in the Midwest …. apparently the organization was so deep in the pockets of Anaheim, the city was dubbed ‘Klanaheim’), and eugenics was a global movement. To say this book—which details the rise and fall of the terrible DC Stephenson, grand dragon of the Indiana KKK—was eye-opening is like saying water is wet. I learned SO much from this read—about my home state, about tolerance, and (sadly) about how we are doomed to repeat history if we do not take the time to learn from it. (To say DC would be friends with Donald Trump today is like saying …. well, you know where I’m going with that analogy).What made this book a 5-star read for me was that *very* rare experience where the topic being covered becomes personal in an unexpected way. Throughout Fever, Stephenson chronicles the pervasiveness of the KKK in the lives of everyday citizens (you could shop at Klan-approved stores! enroll your children in the Ku Klux Kiddies!) but he *also* shares the stories of the individuals who put up a fight against the terrorist organization. One of those individuals was George R. Dale, a rabble-rousing newspaper editor from Muncie (the city I’ve called home for the past 20 years).Dale has been described as “Indiana’s Jazz Age version of a Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart,” and I absolutely RELISHED every moment he was on the page of this book, raising hell against the Klan.You want to know why?Because my husband and I bought our home 17 years ago from George's great-grandson, Andrew Dale, who lives in Muncie and, like his family members before him, is involved in community building and local politics. So yeah, forget Kevin Bacon, with this book it was ALL about “Six Degrees of George Dale” for me. ***Sadly, seeing that Klansman as a kid feels like the most I recall learning about the KKK in grade school history.

This was so achingly beautiful—one of those hard but heartfelt memoirs detailing the good, the bad, the ugly of everyday life interrupted by disease. If you read (and appreciated) Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air or Nina Riggs' The Bright Hour, then I promise you will be just as moved by this love letter Amy Bloom wrote as a tribute to her husband that works double time as a testament to his final days living with Alzheimer's. This book is also a fascinating behind-the-curtains look at what it takes to end one's life in an assisted manner (a decision that is VERY difficult to carry out in the states, hence the reason Amy and her husband, Brian, jump through all the hoops—and SO MUCH PAPERWORK—to travel to Switzerland, where Brian chose to end his life with the help of the Swiss non-profit Dignitas). Finally, Amy's description here of what Alzheimer's does to the brain was so powerful and succinct (and poetic, really) that I wanted to record it in this  so I would remember it:""Those neurons, the brain's soldiers, march for years, from the time we're born, through the byways of the brain, setting actions into motion, rolling away boulders of all kinds, and then, with Alzheimer's, they're blocked by trees down at one end of the road, dangling wires at another. Over the years, the brain's soldiers—this well-trained and reliable army, which has done so much, on so many different terrains, gone high and low, swum, climbed, strolled, and marched to all the different destinations of the mind—begin to falter, long before outsiders can see the troubles. Eventually (five years on for some, three for others, ten for some), the obstacles cannot be overcome. Messages cannot be received. The soldiers cannot break through to new ground. Retreat is the only possible path and you'd be a fool to try to lure someone out, amid the heavy artillery. Alzheimer's for me is 1914, and a good day with Brian now is that famous Christmas truce, which was quite short and quite beautiful (German boys caroling to the English, calling out, ""Merry Christmas, Englishmen"" as they climbed out of the trenches; tobacco shared, souvenirs exchanged, rations shared, and prisoners swapped) and never repeated. Retreat makes sense, and it is agony for me and, I think, not much of anything now for Brian.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 16, 2022","Dec 22, 2022","Dec 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065372-in-love

And stories are what she shares in this book, which reads like a self-help manual, Commencement speech, and diary, rolled into one. My favorite chapters were the ones she devoted to her marriage, her mother, and her dearest friends. A few anecdotes I want to remember: On coming of age Our hurts become our fears, our fears become our limits.On friendshipWhat mattered is that we just kept showing up: in closeness, in commitment, in compromise, and even, in fatigue. The best way to BE a friend …is to revel in their uniqueness. To appreciate each person for what they bring, receiving them simply as themselves.Life has shown me that strong friendships are most often the result of strong intentions. Your table needs to be deliberately built, deliberately populated, and deliberately attended to.On marriageIf you choose to try to make a life with another person, you will live by that choice. You will find yourself having to choose again and again to remain, rather than run. It helps if you enter into a committed relationship prepared to work, ready to be humbled, and willing to accept—and even enjoy—living in that in-between space, bouncing between the poles of beautiful and horrible, sometimes in the span of a single conversation, sometimes over the course of years. And inside of that choice, and those years, you’ll almost certainly come to see there is no such thing as a 50-50 balance. Instead, it’ll be like beads on an abacus, sliding back and forth, the math rarely tidy, the equation never quite solved. When it [marriage] does work? It can feel like an actual honest to god miracle. Which is what love is after all. That’s the whole point. Any long-term partnership, really, is an act of stubborn faith.Finally, I had to laugh when I realized that the last celebrity-penned book I’d listened to prior to Michelle’s had been Prince Harry’s.

I LOVED the subtle ways Katherine Center broke the fourth wall in telling Hannah’s story (a technique that felt like a nod to “Fleabag” and maybe even Elizabeth Strout’s Lucy Barton). I LOVED that, in picturing Jack, Drew, and Hank Stapleton, I EASILY envisioned Liam, Chris, and Luke Hemsworth as this trio of mighty fine fictional brothers. (A fact I did not mind … not one bit!)Most of all I LOVED that, in a sea of literary rom-coms that insist on making the protagonist some form of manic pixie dream girl, Katherine Center gave Hannah JUST the right amount of quirk, balancing out her character by placing a strong head on her shoulders (which she uses ever so effectively to flip Jack in my favorite scene of the book! Oh wait…I take that back, my favorite scene is DEFINITELY the nightgown scene!)My Libby app informs me I read this book in 7 hours, most of which were consecutive because I was THAT sucked in to this fun (and funny!) story.

In tribute to those albums, here’s a “Best of” list of what I enjoyed most about Surrender:Bono’s Backstory: The way he writes about the death of his mother, Iris, at 14 and his complicated love for his father, Bob. Broke my heart multiple times. U2’s Origin Story: I’ve been a casual U2 fan for years, but I never knew the band formed in Larry Mullen’s kitchen when the foursome were young teens. What a fateful meeting that was!Bono’s Love for Ali Hewson: Good GRIEF does this man love his wife! They met at 12, married at 21, and have been together 40 years. Surrender is his love letter to her and it’s a hell of a good one.Art Meeting Life Experience: I loved learning about the trips Bono took in his 20s that shaped his songwriting for The Joshua Tree (ie, his trip to El Salvador in ’86 and the resulting “Bullet the Blue Sky” and Ethiopia inspiring “Where The Streets Have No Name”)Live Aid Memories: Bono writing about his bad haircut for this famed concert and how much (but how little) help it provided Africa.Bono Getting In The Way of the Band: Bono takes the fault for the many ways his ego and quest to “break the mold” of U2’s sound led to some less than stellar results (Pop being one example). Bono as a Parent: I adored Bono’s writing about his kids, even as he acknowledged his guilt of not being as present in their lives as he should have been. “Your children take you back to being children” is a line to remember …. as is “We begin by looking out for our children and, in time, if we are so blessed, we find they are looking out for us.” Bono and Michael Hutchence: Bono writes about the halcyon years (“a 90s carnival”) when he and Ali spent so much time with Michael Hutchence (of INXS) and his girlfriend, Helena Christensen. To have been a fly on the wall for one of their vacations! I was saddened to read about Bono’s frustrations at Hutchence’s drug use and his grief over his death. I had no idea how close those two were. Bono and Debt Relief: It was enlightening to read about Bono’s work—especially with US officials—to persuade the world to erase the debts of poor countries, particularly in Africa. I was too busy being a self-absorbed high school senior to remember Jubilee 2000, so this was an informative behind-the-scenes look into his humanitarian efforts. Bono on Mortality: Being 40 myself, and worrying about my aging parents, this scene hit me like a truck. In his words: “I was crossing the 40th birthday threshold, the halfway mark of a good life, and for the first time noticing my mortality and those of the people I loved, like Michael Hutchence, like my dad.” Bono put his feelings into a song, “Kite” (from my favorite U2 album, All That You Can’t Leave Behind). Knowing what I do now, I’ll never listen to it the same again. The Apple Partnership: A fascinating peek behind the curtains into Bono’s close relationship with Steve Jobs, the development of the black U2 iPod, and Bono’s regret over pressing Tim Cook to put Songs of Innocence on the iPhone 6. An experimental mistake he owns.Bono’s Voice: Bono’s dad loved to tell him “You’re a baritone who wants to be a tenor.” After his dad (a singer himself) passed in 2001, Bono writes about his voice changing. “I feel like he gave this gift to me in passing … I’m a tenor now.” Bono on Religion: Bono writes often about his Christian faith but divulges he’s never found a church he could call a home. “It’s more likely that church is not a place but a practice, and the practice becomes a place.” I relate to this sentiment.U2 as Family: I got teary-eyed at Bono’s parting thoughts about his bandmates—the “beloved brothers” he’s worked beside for more than 40(!) years. “These fellow travelers, who had no idea when we first met what kind of road we’d be taking…thank you for giving me a great life, thank you for letting me be in your band…”Bonus Content:— This audiobook has the best sound design of any I’ve read. My admiration went beyond the song snippets Bono performs to all the immersive sound elements in between. A treat to listen to, start to finish.— Bono is a musician who writes like a musician. But just as often he writes like an artist, poet, spiritualist, humanitarian, and punny wordsmith, rolled into one. Hard to describe what I mean until you listen to his musings in Surrender. A unique soul, this one. — Bono’s real name is Paul David Hewson. “Bono” was bestowed upon him by his childhood BFF, Guggi. It comes from the Latin word, Bonavox, or “good voice”. — Bono does impressions in the book…not all of them great. (Bono, please, no more Bill Clinton!) I love the guy, so whenever he’d break into one, it felt like my corny dad embarrassing me as I listened.

Because it’s hilarious that, after YEARS spent watching “Gilmore Girls,” Lauren Graham’s voice does not sound “normal” to me unless it’s at Lorelai Gilmore speed, which, if you are curious, is 1.5x speed on audio—not even kidding!At that pace, I plowed through this relatively short collection of new essays from Ms. Graham in record time. Let it be known I enjoyed every one, a few more than most (my least favorite being the one where she describes all the “health” camps she’s gone to over the years…namely because they all sound pretty calorie-restrictive and miserable—like, she’s binge eating Burger King before sneaking in!)What I loved most about Graham's writing here is she's reached a point in her career where she’s okay spilling Hollywood insider secrets (like how every actress wears a hair piece when filming for the sake of continuity) but also okay admitting she STILL doesn’t understand her industry and probably never will. (Case in point: She once, at the height of Gilmore Girls fame, found herself on Louis Vutton’s MVP list..a list she had no clue existed and then was promptly relegated from a year later for reasons unknown). It’s Graham's dissection of these strange pecking orders of the famous—coupled with her warmth when talking about her relationships, including her friendship with the actress Mae Whitman—that make these stories go down like …well, a cup of coffee from Luke’s Diner?

I loved the nostalgia Now invokes for the ‘90s. I loved how the characters’ family dynamics made me wish Cameron Crowe would direct a big screen adaptation (because if ever there was a book that reads like a movie Crowe would write and direct, it’s this one). And I loved that I could picture any one of the kids from “Stranger Things” playing Frankie and Zeke if a big screen adaptation does indeed happen.My paperback of Now was an advanced reader copy, and for that I’m grateful. Because its opening pages included an essay from the author not included in the published version. Said essay details the origin story of the defining phrase of the book: “The edge is a shantytown filled with gold seekers.

It taught me a lot—from what ""per cap"" meant to learning more about the tribes (Cherokee and Kiowa) written about in its pages.In certain respects, this novel (which isn't a novel so much as a series of interlinked stories where all the characters are related to the main character, Ever Geimausaddle) is semi-autobiographical.

Probably not. Were they crazy? Probably. That, too, is beyond the scope of this book.

After I finished it, a friend of mine suggested I read Fairytale Interrupted, a memoir written by JFK Jr.'s longtime assistant, RoseMarie Terenzio.I guess 2022 is the year I re-up my fixation on this particular Kennedy because Terenzio's book did NOT disappoint. I appreciated her insights into working for John—stories about his kindness, his commitment to the magazine he co-founded (George, for anybody not alive in the '90s to remember it), even her stories about the times his behavior was less than perfect (with her and others) and how he worked to make things right when that happened. To read this book—or any book about John and Carolyn—is to long for a time when the world seemed less daunting ... when 9/11 hadn't happened, the Internet was nascent, and social media had yet to fracture our political landscape. I think so often (and not in a creepy QAnon way) about the promise of John—what office he might have aspired to and held eventually—were it not for his tragic death. But in reading Fairytale, it's clear no one ""what if""s this idea more than RoseMarie, or ""Rosie"" as John always referred to her. In writing this book, she has given readers a very poignant and all-too humanizing glimpse into the final years of his beautiful life. How so many of us miss him still, quirky hats and all.[Technical critique: The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the quality of the audiobook is not great. I kept reading, despite this criticism, but the publisher should think about re-recording it—still with RoseMarie reading—and this time in a better studio without so many glitchy cuts (and occasional car honks!) included.] ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 21, 2022","Oct 26, 2022","Oct 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10415676-fairy-tale-interrupted

See, back when we had these things called newspapers, there was an almost daily need to fill them with locator maps included with many news stories (ie, whenever there was an accident or robbery or something.) The reason I share this story is because I had to take a cartography class as part of the requirements for my major. And I thought this class was going to be cool (because I was a nerd who went into EVERY class she took in college thinking—hoping—it was going to be cool). Friends, it was not cool.

Given how much I enjoy the theater, I don’t know how I’ve made it 40 years having never seen OR read any of Williams’ work, but that changed as of last month, when I finished this title—the play that first made him famous—in just two sittings. I enjoyed it immensely, and soon after spent a good hour reading up on Williams’ life, everything from how he based the character of Laura on his sister to his ill-fated romance with Frank Merlo (a love affair that inspired this work of fiction I now want to read) to how fame became an albatross he wore around his neck. I’m grateful Andy and I decided to venture into this fun little reading challenge, and I already look forward to whatever we choose to read next from the list above. It’s an exercise that’s made for a nice reminder of how beneficial it can be to step out of our reading “comfort zones” every now and then. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 24, 2022","Sep 28, 2022","Sep 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92517.The_Glass_Menagerie

Having never read James Patterson, I sort of chuckled to myself, ""Okay James, you titan of publishing, let's see what you have to teach me about John Lennon.""Ummmm....turns out a lot? As big of a Beatles fan as I am, there was so much about John I should have/could have known but, in reading this book, realized I didn't. Case in point:— John wrote and recorded ""Instant Karma! We All Shine On"" in a matter of HOURS. He was a fast writer/producer of music, and his impatience in the studio for those who weren't was well known. — John and Elton John became good friends and collaborators in the '70s. Elton played piano/sang backup on the jangly ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night"" (the only solo No. 1 hit John ever had--which I've been listening to nonstop since finishing this book)— John was a huge influence (and friend of) David Bowie. Without John, there would be no ""Fame"" — For as rock-solid as I perceived John and Yoko's relationship, I had no idea that, for a short time in the '70s, Yoko sent him off to LA, where (with her blessing), she allowed him to enter into a relationship with her personal assistant, May Pang So yeah, a lot of learning going on for me about John's life post-Beatles. And while *of course* I knew about his assassination at the hands of Mark David Chapman, I didn't know the specific details surrounding that December night in 1980. Like the fact that, at the time of his death, John was the happiest he'd ever been. His and Yoko's Double Fantasy had just been released (the first new music he'd written in 5 years), and he was feeling good about his role as primary caregiver for Sean, the son he shared with Yoko (who was born on his birthday in 1975). As a 40 year old woman with a (soon to be) 5 year old daughter, it hit different knowing that, on the night he was gunned down, 40 year old John was taking a break from recording music because he wanted to return home to give goodnight kisses and hugs to his 5 year old son. I came to the final pages of this read more emotional than I anticipated, and more saddened than ever to think of all that living—and loving—John had stolen from him at the hands of an enormous creep who, just last month, was denied parole again for the TWELFTH time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 14, 2022","Oct 05, 2022","Sep 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53019360-the-last-days-of-john-lennon

In Makkai’s version, the podcaster in question is Bodie Kane, the scene of the crime the New Hampshire boarding school she attended in her youth, the victim her former roommate, Thalia Keith, and the alleged perpetrator of Thalia’s murder the school’s Black athletic trainer, Omar Evans. I was easily caught up in the storyline above, despite moments when I thought Makkai’s various subplots and techniques didn’t always play well with the larger narrative at hand. (See: the recurring lists of unnamed women wronged by men; the #metoo storyline involving Bodie’s husband, Jerome; the second person POV that took some getting used to … it was all a LOT.) Even when Makkai lost herself to paragraph after paragraph of character backstory, I still kept reading. Because I’m a sucker for ‘90s nostalgia and her writing is that good, especially in the final act (which had that same propulsive feeling of reckoning I remember from binge listening Serial). Now that I’m finished, I’m still not sure how I feel about the book’s ending … and maybe that’s the point? It’s rare to want a follow-up to a work of literary fiction, but I’m curious where all these characters—Bodie, Fran, Geoff, Omar (even that asshole Denny Block!)—end up in the next five years. Aren’t you? I Have Some Questions for the Author• Was Bodie’s career inspired by Karina Longworth's? Readers who might be curious about what an episode of Bodie’s podcast would sound like should ABSOLUTELY check out Karina’s incredible podcast series, You Must Remember This. • Could you not have given us more scenes with a grown-up Bodie and Geoff? Even though it’s only February, that hotel room scene (specifically the moment Geoff recites lines from his  of “Pulp Fiction”) will go down as one of the best things I read in 2023.• Did you really have to make Bodie from Indiana? (Sorry, I’m just tired of reading works of fiction that shit on my home state.)• I’m guessing you gave Bodie her name in PART so you could work that clever Tom Petty riff into your book (still singing that in my head, thankyouvermuch!).

Laura Anne has done a tremendous job of penning a book that explores what it means to be young and to grapple with the grief that accompanies losing someone you love. What I also appreciated is how this book is a love letter to the Midwest, specifically Wisconsin in high summer. I want to encourage my children to read widely, and I believe that diversity in books should include geography as well as race, gender, ethnicity, and religion. Given the Midwest isn't represented in fiction as much as I'd like, my son was excited to discover the book's main character, Clare Burch, hails from outside of Chicago and loves to fish as much as him.For youngsters, this book offers up great age-appropriate themes—family strife, the comings and goings of friends, and how to make nice with bullies among them.

I feel you sister. This one’s for you.”With that tone established, let me share that this read is perfect for anyone—especially any woman—who wishes more books featured older female protagonists like Helen, Mary Alice, Natalie, and Billie. This quartet of agents-gone-rogue are out to discover who’s trying to kill them on the eve of their retirement as badass female assassins. The escapades that result from their reconnaissance work take readers from the streets of New Orleans to the catacombs of Paris to the British countryside (with flashback chapters about their early days working for the “Museum” in between). Half the fun of Killers was determining which actresses I wanted to star as the book’s protagonists. Because this book HAS to be a movie. IT HASSSSSS TOOOOOO! I dare anyone to read this and not think it would be the perfect vehicle for any number of amazing actresses who, at present, have been relegated to secondary parts because Hollywood has deemed them “past their prime”!Here’s who I could see in each starring role:Billie— Holly Hunter (64)'s pint-sized toughness is perfect for this character, who has to get the most physical in her work (and with whom we spend the most time inside the head of, narratively speaking).Helen—Patricia Clarkson, 62, has the right combination of intellect and grace to pull off this character, someone nursing a big loss who is the most stoic member of the group after Billie. (I could also see Madeline Stowe, 64, given the character being written as a “Jackie Kennedy” type.)Mary Alice—While the author makes a point of noting all these characters are white (at least, from my reading of the text!) I could see 65-year-old Sheryl Lee Ralph (where my fellow Abbott Elementary fans at?!) playing her. I could also see Jamie Lee Curtis (63) in the role, with Michelle Yeoh, 60, playing her wife (which is really my way of wanting these two to team up again after their amazingness in Everything Everywhere All At Once). Natalie—Maybe it’s because I just read her memoir and listened to her podcast episode with Rob Lowe, but Jennifer Grey, 62, deserves a comeback role like this. Natalie is the tiniest, flirtiest, FUNNIEST gal of the whole bunch, and I had fun imagining what the pint-sized Jennifer would do with the character if given the chance. “The Shepherdess” Constance Halliday: Helen Mirren.

Whelan pulls out all the stops with her sophomore title, nailing at least a dozen different accents throughout the book (including an Irish brogue with a main character that had me immediately picturing this fine fella, a fact I did not mind in the slightest!)Overall, the tone of this one was light on the romance and heavy on the career and family drama.

Below, I’m transcribing what she said in the final lines of the book, as she talked about how meaningful the experience of writing her memoir was and how she thinks memoir writing should be taught in schools, if only because it’s such a powerful exercise of reflection:“How might your retelling of your life change the way you see yourself [in your memoir]…what if the worst things ended up being some of the most transformative things? The things necessary to launch you into your next rendering? Until then, I offer you these scenes from my life … maybe your own memories rise up to meet them and your own life come back to you.

Like Demi, Selma had a crazy complicated relationship with her mother, and every nook and cranny of that relationship is explored in this memoir—as are many of her friendships with Hollywood A-listers. (I loved learning that her and Carrie Fisher were tight IRL!) My own sister has MS and I was reluctant to read this in fear of it triggering my anxiety about her condition. Instead, I was grateful for the way Blair describes what her days are often like—it made me realize that for people suffering from this incurable disease, sometimes just getting out of bed is the biggest victory of the day (which in turn makes me that much more empathetic toward my sis). A stellar celebrity memoir if you like your version of the genre served with a main course of ""tortured artist"" and a side order of A+ celebrity namedropping.

It’s hard to describe how incredible the property is until you’ve taken your own (free)Back in July, I visited the Getty Villa in Malibu, California. It’s hard to describe how incredible the property is until you’ve taken your own (free) tour of it. But to summarize, billionaire John Paul Getty built the villa—a recreation of a Roman seaside home—to house the antiquities he’d acquired over his lifetime. (The kicker being he died before he could visit it, though he was later buried there.)While at the villa, I tapped my way through an interactive display about Getty’s life, but I was left wanting to learn more. I almost bought a biography from the gift shop, but the next morning, sipping coffee and paging through the July issue of Vanity Fair, I learned about this book instead.Weeks later, I can share I’m glad I listened to it, as it offers an in-depth look into a dynastic family known for many things—from fame and fortune (through oil) to various scandals and tragedies (not the least of which was the harrowing kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in 1973).The book’s author, James Reginato, is not out to vilify the family (as has been the case with so many articles and biographies, including the 2017 Ridley Scott film, “All the Money in the World” and the 2018 FX drama “Trust.) Instead, he paints a rather sympathetic portrait of Getty and his descendants, which include his five children and many grandchildren and great grandchildren. I had to stop the audiobook multiple times to learn more about each branch of the family tree. I then went on even more deep dives to learn about Getty's grandchildren and great-grandchildren, because I was so fascinated by so many of them. Among the more memorable members:— son John Paul Getty Jr. and his second wife, Talitha Pol, who was STUNNING. In the late ‘60s, their party pad in Marrakesh was THE place to be for London pop culture elite, including the Rolling Stones.— grandson Mark Getty, co-founder of Getty Images.— granddaughter Aileen Getty, once married to Christoper Wilding, son of Elizabeth Taylor, who's done much for AIDS research (as a sufferer of HIV herself) and climate change (she’s been arrested with good friend Jane Fonda as part of Jane’s recurring Fire Drill Friday movement). — great grandchild Nats Getty and wife Gigi Gorgeous, a fascinating couple for the Instagram/YouTube era if ever there was one!— great grandson Balathazar Getty (son of J. Paul Getty III), an actor who starred in one of my favorite mid-2000s dramas, ABC’s Brothers and Sisters.— Gordon and Ann Getty, who (for years) were as close to royalty as it comes on the San Francisco social scene and whose sons were tight with the Newsom clan (as in California Governor Gavin) as well as Kamala Harris and the Pelosis. — great granddaughter Ivy, whose lavish wedding last fall made a splash in the pages of Vogue (her mirrored dress was …just wow. WOW). Ivy's photographer, Jose Villa, is someone I've followed for years (as a former wedding photographer myself) and I was so happy for him that he landed a wedding as incredible as this one! I could go on about the reasons why I enjoyed this book, but I suspect I belong to a niche audience—one that regularly peruses society pages in publications like Vanity Fair and Vogue and who is always down for stories about famous American families (the first gift my hubby ever gave me was a biography of the Kennedys!) I’ll end this (long-winded)  by noting how impressed I am by the range of interests the Getty descendants have involved themselves in—from environmental causes to wineries to fashion to LGBTQ causes to feminist art…the list goes on. No family is perfect, but as Reginato points out, compared to some of their Forbes list counterparts, the Gettys are doing what they can to make good with the fame and fortune they’ve inherited thanks to their pioneering patriarch.

On that note, this novel is heartbreaking in that it relays the story of Marion (a timid school teacher), Tom (the hunk of a policeman she marries), and Patrick (the closeted museum curator who is Tom’s true love). It’s a love triangle set against the backdrop of 1950s Brighton (though it could have been any country at the time), and sadly, it’s a story that rings familiar for other works of fiction or non-fiction focused on this era in history (two that come to mind that I've read in recent years include John Boyne's The Heart’s Invisible Furies and Elon Green's Last Call). As much as I was sucked in by the lush prose of this novel, I was also transfixed by the WAY in which Roberts allowed the narrative to play out, alternating in time between Marion’s POV in the modern day and journal entries from Patrick from the ‘50s. There comes a twist late in the story that brought tears to my eyes—a twist that reminded me of how draconian the laws were at one time for anyone not cisgender or straight. And while I finished this book on vacation in early June, I typed this  on the same day I learned Roe v. Wade was struck down in the U.S.—a ruling for which Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion targeting other Supreme Court rulings that protect same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage in America. Where we go from here, I don’t know, but I’m legitimately frightened by the future intentions of this current court. It’s because of this fear that I worry about the fate of today’s Toms and Patricks who may soon lose their rights to love and marry who they legally want. PS —I did not know, until I did a small amount of research writing this , that My Policeman is Roberts’ reimagining of the real-life relationship between E.M. Forster, policeman Bob Buckingham, and his wife.

To recaI started this book last month to coincide with AAPI Heritage Month, but it took me a little longer to finish it as my reading bled into June. To recap, this memoir belongs in that genre of books I like to call Beautiful but Hard Reads™. In it, Qian Julie Wang recounts her years living as an impoverished, undocumented child in New York City—years that weren’t all that long ago (Qian is only 34), thus making her narrative all the more jarring to read. Listening to Beautiful Country (which Qian narrates), I was reminded of how I felt listening to Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime. As in, it’s hard to reconcile the idea that while this little Chinese-born girl was sitting somewhere in Brooklyn, reading her Babysitter’s Club books** with an empty stomach and a single change of dingy clothes, I was living only a couple states away, reading my own copies of those same books from the comfort of my middle class, two-story home.Overall, what I appreciated most about Beautiful Country was how insightful Wang’s memories were of her childhood. In that sense, I feel like if you are a fan of Ashley Ford’s brilliant Somebody’s Daughter, you’ll be moved in a similar way by the clarity and charm of Wang’s powerful coming-of-age story.**On a happier note, I started following Qian on Instagram after finishing her book, and this post—in which Ann M. Martin sends her a curated box of BSC books and a hand-written note—made my heart beat fast, because is there a greater gift to give a girl who grew up in the ‘80s/‘90s worshipping this stellar YA series?! I think not! ...

""Also, so you can laugh a lot.

In PW’s starred- of this read, mention is given to how, in between moments of hilarity, Klein drops in unexpected glimpses of joy—her reminder that “being a parent is a lot like having a dream … Most of it, even when it’s ugly, is beautiful.”It might take being a parent to unpack those words, but I whole-heartedly endorse the sentiment.Also, if you do wind up reading this one, audio is 100 percent the way to go. Klein does an excellent job with the narration. I was sad to reach the end, having taken an odd degree of comfort in the dry delivery and dark humor of her words.

I discovered her work years ago when I read one of her novels and fell hard for how well she wrote a certain sub-genre of young adult fiction—the kind dedicated to fast-paced plots, troubled boys, multi-facetd girls, and pop culture nods galore.It was a delight to discover that, with the release of her adult debut, “Birds of California,” she has carried that talent and voice through a seamless transition into the Land of Grown-Up Fiction.In “Birds,” the focus of the story is Fiona St. James, a young actress whose life has gone off the rails since starring in a (believably pitched) WB-style family drama called Birds of California. I read Fiona as Jessica Biel wanting out of 7th Heaven and finding her exit ramp via a series of troubling acts that draw the attention of the paparazzi (a la Britney Spears at the height of her public meltdown). Fiona has gone back to as normal a life a possible in the wake of that era of her life—until the day she’s paid a visit by the actor, Sam Fox, who played her older brother on the series. Sam is a himbo of sorts (picture a young Justin Hartley if This is Us had never taken off) struggling to find his next steady acting gig and therefore needing the money promised with the pitch of a sequel to Birds. What happens when he tries to convince Fiona to join in on the reboot is what makes the sparks—and banter—between these two fly. This one is a perfect read for your upcoming summer vacation. And bonus: Thanks to that eye-catching cover, it’ll look great next to the cocktail you order poolside and then photograph for that “Out of Office” post you plan on sharing with all your Instagram followers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Mar 21, 2022","Mar 23, 2022","Apr 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59028605-birds-of-california

By that I mean, I appreciate Charmaine Wilkerson using her fiction to shine a spotlight on so much ethnocultural history missing from our textbooks.A few examples are the way she weaves into her story accounts of the Chinese immigrant experience in the Caribbean; the complicated origin story of black cake; the mass immigration of Afro-Caribbeans to the UK; and, most tragically, the forced adoptions in that country that went on for decades. Had Wilkerson winnowed down the length of this book, cut a few points of view (did we really need that one-off chapter from Marble’s mother?) and nixed a few of the “‘issues’ and ‘soapbox moments’ that aren’t seamlessly woven into the narrative” (as er Melissa so aptly describes), then this would have been a 5-star read for me.As it was, I found Black Cake a bit disjointed and longggg for my taste.

I listened to this on audio because I wanted her voice (that iconically sweet Tennessee accent of hers!) to be front and center as I was reading these stories. And I'm glad I did. But at multiple points, I found myself (more than any other audiobook I've read) wishing I had the physical copy alongside me for reference. Mostly because the audio here was recorded in such an anecdotal way I came to believe what I was actually listening to were the interview clips Dolly's co-writer (Robert Oermann) used to help him write the book. This wasn't a bad thing (I cannot tell you how much I giggled hearing Dolly—in her own words—acknowledge ""I just love horny songs!"" or ""They'll do anything for a titty joke!"") but I was left wishing I felt more grounded in the timeline of her life (with, say, photos from each era of her career). The chronological references seemed to jump around (confusing me a bit), and the interludes from the male narrator were stiff compared to the warmth and goodness that exuded from Dolly herself.Overall, I'm so glad I listened to this, as I learned quite a bit about Dolly's upbringing and how stifled she felt by the early influence of her creative partner, Porter Wagner. I loved hearing how open Dolly was to collaborating with other artists, especially those (like Whitney Houston) who took her work and made it their own. And while I wish I could have listened to snippets from each of the 175 songs she wrote about (handpicked from the more than 3,000 (!!!) songs she has written over the course of her career), I know it might have taken me until 2023 to read this book had that been the case! A wonderful showcase of Dolly's charm and wit, with her commitment to her roots and her care for her community evident throughout the text. May she live on wearing the crown of ""Ageless American Sweetheart"" that Betty White (#RIP) has passed down to her. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 23, 2022","Mar 07, 2022","Feb 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53916522-dolly-parton-songteller

Maybe not to everyone, but to you in particular.Within the first half-hour of meeting Sam Masur and Sadie Green, game loving strangers-turned-best friends, I knew that’s how I was going to feel about Gabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.I don’t know how much of my obsession with this knockout novel is because I, like Sadie, LOVED Oregon Trail growing up (the book’s running “SADI MIRANDA GREEN. YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!” joke is its most endearing) OR if it’s because I serendipitously read this novel while on vacation in Los Angeles (where much of the book is set), but I DO know I will spend the rest of 2022 trying to convince everyone I know to read it.And while I’m not much of a gamer (that season of my life ended with beating Super Mario Brothers at 12), I would happily while away an afternoon playing any one of Sadie and/or Sam’s brilliant games … oh, what’s that? I CAN play Emily Blaster? For REAL?!! BRAVO, KNOPF! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++On a personal note, while on said vacation to L.A., I had this sixth sense thought of ‘You were meant to live in this city.' It’s something I was struggling to come to terms with (like, did I live here in another life? in another…multiverse?) until I came across this moving paragraph in Tomorrow that reminded me I wasn’t alone in sitting with this feeling:“On the night Sam went missing, it occurred to Sadie nothing in life was as solid-state as it appeared. A childish game might be deadly. A friend might disappear. And as much as a person might try to shield herself from it, the possibility for the other outcome was always there. We are all living, at most, half of a life, she thought. There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living. Sometimes, it felt as if you might be walking down Brattle Street, and without warning, you could slip into this other life, like Alice falling down the rabbit hole that led to Wonderland. You would end up a different version of yourself, in some other town. But it wouldn’t be strange like Wonderland, not at all. Because you would have expected all along that it could have turned out that way. You would feel relief, because you had always wondered what that other life would have looked like. And there you were.”Just … chills.And to end this (rambling)  on a silly note, while there are literally 1,000 reasons for me to love this novel, the fact Gabrielle Zevin models the character of Marx (OOOHHHHH MARX, HOW I LOVE YOU SO!) on Keanu Reeves is definitely my superficial favorite!...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jul 09, 2022","Jul 17, 2022","Feb 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow

That’s how I felt with Notes On Your SuddeEvery now and then I stumble upon a book that surprises me in a way that makes me sit up and pay attention. That’s how I felt with Notes On Your Sudden Disappearance, a 2022 release I bought during an e-book sale for $2 last year after spying it pop up on a number of friends’ reading lists. Having finally gotten around to it myself, I feel like it’s one that’ll stick with me for a while. In part because it’s rare that I enjoy a book written in second person (there’s always a whiff of too much ‘try’ involved with that POV), but here? I thought it worked brilliantly. And as a ‘90s baby myself (I would have been about the same age as Kathy*** circa 1998), so much of this novel resonated with me, culturally speaking. At various points, I even found myself nostalgic for my own dog days of summer, staying up until 2 am with my best friend watching re-runs of trash talk TV. (I loved all the mentions of Jillian Williams in this book, a stand-in for Jerry Springer-Ricky Lake-Jenny Jones if ever there was one). Given the book’s plot centers around a car accident involving a teenager, this, too, made me think of my high school years. Namely because a classmate of mine lost a sister in a similar accident when I was a freshman. And really, don’t we all have an experience like this from our formative years? One in which we are forced to learn too soon that death can, indeed, come for the young? Alison Espach captures this particular tragedy in an extremely evocative and poignant way. ***My one petty gripe with this book is the fact that Sally (our protagonist)'s sister is named Kathy. Given her birth year (early '80s?), that is … not a popular name from that era. Jessica? Yes. Heather? Yes. Jennifer? ABSOLUTELY. So yeah, even though it felt like we hardly got to know her, I really wanted Kathy to have a more timely name. But hey, this is coming from a Gail born in 1982, so maybe Kathy was named after her great grandmother, too! ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 19, 2023","Jul 06, 2023","Feb 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58672976-notes-on-your-sudden-disappearance

Of course, within the rom-com genre, it fits right in to the trend of illustrated covers. But the writing in this book is so good—and the plot so layered—that I agree with Lily's take that there was a missed opportunity to catch a wider audience with a cover look more like that of Tia Williams' Seven Days in June.Never mind this minor pet peeve, let's talk about what happens between the pages of How to Fake It, shall we? This is a book that, chapter by chapter, reveals a steamy love story that pairs an up-and-coming starlet (Grey) with an A-list superstar (Ethan) in a fake romantic relationship that is believable as hell.So much so that, when I read up about its author, I was shocked to learn she lives in Oklahoma and has no attachment to the industry or to LA aside from a lifelong fascination with celebrities (kindred spirits on this front, we are--ha!) I loved picturing the stars I could see serving as Wilder's inspiration for Grey (Blake Lively) and Ethan (Ben Affleck), and I also admired how tenderly Wilder treated Ethan's relationship to his ex-wife, Nora, as well as the friendship that eventually blossoms between Nora and Grey.A fabulous first-time effort from this author—one that has me excited to read whatever she writes next! ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 25, 2022","Jul 27, 2022","Feb 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59029665-how-to-fake-it-in-hollywood

But (and I hate to admit this because I like her so much) this newest book of Phoebe's was sort of a mixed bag reading experience for me.

My husband’s jests aside, I am so glad I read this book because I LOVED IT. Here are the types of people I think would love it along with me:1) Anyone working in academia: The author nails the current climate of higher ed, in particular the way sexual politics have changed post-#MeToo movement. 2) Anyone (and this is related to 1) above) who enjoyed the Netflix series, “The Chair”: It’s interesting, isn’t it, how so many novels and films with Ivory Tower settings happen to involve professors from English departments?3) Anyone who loves unlikeable female narrators: The unnamed narrator of this novel got under my skin in a good way—a way that made me want to add her to my list of favorite female literary “baddies” (said list also includes Olive from “Olive Kitteridge” and Amy Dunne from “Gone Girl”)4) Anyone who appreciates living in the head of a woman who thinks in descriptive passages like this:“[Vladimir] wore a knit tie with an engraved tie bar over a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves, well-cut pants, and good-quality leather boots with thick white soles. Clearly a transplant from the city–no heterosexual man who’d spent much time here would look like that. Even my husband, a vain man with a taste for expensive Irish knit sweaters, had forgotten the specificity and light irony of urban style. My husband wore what he wore because he believed in it—he had lost the sense of costuming and presentation that well-dressed city dwellers naturally possessed. That perambulating sense of always being on display.”Overall, this novel was dark, insightful, and revealing in an extremely honest way that I very much appreciated. My only qualm with it might be with the ending (did not see the last act coming! would love to discuss it with others!).

What I especially loved, as I got a little deeper into the narrative, is how the major theme of the book is this relatable rumination on how even the closest of friendships go through periods best defined as droughts. Because of my age, I also appreciated how Fiona and Jane experienced teenhood in the 1990s. This fact led to more than a few scenes that made me smile with recognition, from their cruising in Fiona's hoopty Shamu, listening to Salt-N-Pepa, to their navigating the halls of high school surrounded by boys ""drenched in Cool Water cologne"". Capturing a few passages here that so vividly capture what it can be like to have a best friend from childhood that has carried over into adulthood:""She'd introduced her to Willy as 'my best friend,' though in truth they'd hardly kept in touch. A distance between them Fiona felt acutely, marked by unspoken things, added up. She knew the contours of Jane's life, not its interior. If Fiona moved back to LA, what would their friendship be like—no longer held aloft by the nostalgia for their high school years, the romance of their present distance?""""I still thought of her as my best friend, though more and more she was becoming a story to me, one whose plot I couldn't make sense of because either I was missing information or maybe I'd forgotten something from before—something important—and it was too late to ask about it now, because it would mean admitting I hadn't been paying attention.

And yet, here I am, telling you how much I FIVE-STAR loved this read.If you have even an ounce of interest in picking this title up, but your familiarity with Molly centers mostly on your knowledge of her impressive run on Saturday Night Live**, then do NOT read any more s or press she’s done for this book. Seriously, don’t even Google her!I say this because I want you (like me) to have the experience of being fully stunned by the first 10 minutes of this book (.... or however many pages that turns out to be; I don’t know, because I listened to this on audio, which is absolutely how I recommend you experience this one.)Molly’s life is a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and she’s such a first-class storyteller that she had me hooked from the get go. Having read this, I can now say how much I admire her resiliency (as an actor, but, more importantly, as a person). I also very much loved her stories from her time at SNL as well as the tender way she talked about the dysfunctional yet dear relationship she had with her dad.For those of you who have read this, I wish I could talk with you in person about some of my favorite stories from the book. (For me, the highlights reel includes: her dad cleaning the house on speed! that time she snuck onto a flight to NYC as a child! her Gary Coleman encounter! the David Mamet scheme! and the origin story of Mary Katherine Gallagher!) If you’re in the mood for a book that will make you laugh, make you feel more grateful to be alive, and might even leave you with tears streaming down your face in its final few minutes, this memoir (with its bag of dramatic twists!) is the book for you. **Molly Shannon’s years on SNL—1995 to 2001—coincided with my years in junior high/high school. When I say I was obsessed with SNL at this age, I mean I.WAS.OBSESSED. (My best friend and I had the “Superstar” tees we bought from Spencer’s to prove it. Ha!) From Molly to Will Ferrell to Cheri Oteri to Ana Gasteyer, every cast member from that era was beloved. So, it was a nice gift of nostalgia to read this book, to remember how much Molly’s fearless comedy added to the show, and to reflect back on allll those happy Saturday nights I spent glued to the TV with my best friends by my side....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Apr 28, 2022","May 07, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58541424-hello-molly

And for a moment, I wondered if he could have held back on that front, given how tough those scenes were, both for Ray and for the reader.Then I read Brendan’s “Author’s Note,” wherein he revealed many of the racially motivated incidents that Ray encounters as a violinist also happened to him in his own musical career and even though I should know better by now, I was still pretty floored.White people can really suck sometimes, huh?Putting those polarizing thoughts aside, I was completely taken with this book. Reading about what it takes to be a classical musician—the preparation, the thrill of performing, the competitiveness of it all—was such an engrossing experience. Add to it that Rayquan (Ray for short) is a minority performer in his genre (IRL, less than 2 percent of the world’s classical musicians are Black) and there was an element of raised stakes for him to be twice as good as his peers.With that set up in mind comes the novel’s compelling “whodunnit” plot: When Ray discovers that the fiddle he owns—an heirloom passed down from his grandmother—is a rare Stradivarius worth $10 million, he finds himself on the fast track to becoming one of the country’s most celebrated artists. But as he prepares for a major international competition, his beloved Strad is stolen. He then spends the rest of the story piecing together who nabbed it. Was it the descendants of the man who enslaved his great-great grandfather? Or one of his greedy family members? The answer kept me turning the pages, in awe both of Ray’s resilience and Brendan’s ability to write such a wonderfully suspenseful novel that revealed an ending I did not see coming. Bravo!

Given the uncertain era we’re living through, it feels like a warm hug to “transport” back in time to a decade when our country was prospering on so many levels, particularly the pop culture front.For proof, a person need look no further than entertainment writer Brian Raftery’s “Best.Movie.Year.Ever: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen.”This book was SUCH a delight for a pop culture nerd like me. What I especially loved is how Brian contextualizes the moment a true bumper crop of amazing films—from “Being John Malkvoch” to “Election” to “The Sixth Sense”—hit the big screen. Was it the hyperbolic BEST year for films? Maybe not, but it sure comes close and Raftery makes a convincing argument as to why. Personally, I was a junior/senior in high school in 1999 and I LIVED at the cinema. Every weekend, the theater was a destination for me and my boyfriend (usually) or my cluster of best friends. To tell you how amazing 1999 was in film, Raftery doesn’t even include the year’s mega-hit sequels to franchises like Toy Story and Austin Powers. Nor does he pay attention to the great grown-up rom-coms of 1999, from “Never Been Kissed” to (my personal fave) “Notting Hill.” While that’s a miss on his end, this book can only be so long, and I appreciate that he chose instead to veer into the rise of teen rom-coms that took off that year with the likes of “She’s All That” and “Ten Things I Hate About You.” Setting aside this minor quibble, overall I agreed with the smorgasbord of films Raftery included in “Best,” with my favorite chapters focusing on “Office Space,” “The Matrix,” “Blair Witch,” and “Boys Don’t Cry.” I also enjoyed the deep dive he did on a few others, including “Fight Club” and “Magnolia,” as his commentary contextualized those films in a way my young 17-year-old brain was too immature to understand at the time. Lastly, I appreciate that Raftery ends his book with an epilogue that points to why we (sadly) are past an era when another cinematic 1999 feels possible. (See: ‘we don’t go to movies to be challenged anymore,’ the Marvel-ification of Hollywood, and the rise of the ‘golden era’ of TV). Overall, this was a great recap of why 1999 was, as Raftery describes, “a near miraculous year of movies, full of original stories from exciting new voices.” Thanks, Brian, for taking me back for a few hours to relive it....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 25, 2021","Jan 07, 2022","Dec 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40538583-best-movie-year-ever

And with her newest novel, “Still Life,” she has accomplished the rare feat of making me laugh AND cry. When a writer can pull off that kind of emotional pendulum? Well, they earn a spot on my list of all-time favorite authors!I went into “Still Life” knowing only how much I loved Sarah’s last novel (“Tin Man”), and I thought (based on the jacket copy) this newest work of hers would center around World War II. The war does make an appearance, but only briefly as the plot moves readers to Florence, enveloping them in a story that centers on people brought together by love, war, art, flood, and the ghost of E.M. Forster.This is such a GORGEOUS novel—one that reminded me of “the goodness of people” (Sarah’s purpose in writing it, as she told Publishers Weekly) and one that has taught me about chapters of history I knew nothing about. I loved it from cover to cover and was both sad to end my “vacation” to Italy and to have to say goodbye to this lovely cast of characters (Ulysses, Evelyn, Col, Cressy, Peggy, Pete, Alys and a wise-cracking parrot named Claude) who, by the end, felt like they’d become *my* friends.Feeling grateful to have such a lovely book hangover to end this year on. I will be singing praises for this one for years to come!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 23, 2021","Dec 30, 2021","Dec 23, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57001545-still-life

I was glad my listening to iI can’t say I’ve ever thought of a book as a perfect Women’s History Month read, and yet with this one, I absolutely did. I was glad my listening to it coincided with the month we recognize the contributions of women to American history—because what a line-up of them featured in this read! Beginning with the first chapter, author Danielle Friedman expands on a topic (barre exercise) she wrote about as an article in 2018 for The Cut. Each subsequent chapter centers on the history of other forms of popular women’s exercise, from running to aerobics to weightlifting (Buns of Steel!) to yoga.Each chapter also provides an exploration of the lives of the women who were pioneers of physical activity. Their accomplishments seem easy to take for granted today, but when you put them in the historical light Friedman does—reminding readers women were discouraged to exercise right up through the ‘60s because society feared their uteruses might fall out (not even kidding!)—you understand how badass they were for wanting to break a sweat back in the day. This book is also catnip for readers who love random tidbits of trivia. For example, I can now tell you the history of the invention of the sports bra (it’s honestly pretty fascinating). See also: how Vidal Sassoon’s wash-and-wear hair cuts of the ‘60s freed women from highly sprayed bouffants that were a major reason they never pursued workouts in the first place.If I had one critique, it’s how little diversity gets represented in these pages. In fairness to Friedman, so much of the history of women's fitness is focused on white women because, for too long, they were the demographic with the means and capacity to work out. But I do appreciate that she spends her final chapter paying so much attention to rising fitness icons like queer “fat femme” yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as Sadie Kurzban, the Cuban Jewish founder of a fitness chain (305 Fitness) dedicated to celebrating the bodies of all women, no matter size, race or religion.I’d certainly recommend this read, and I thought Friedman did a nice job with the narration. Because I don’t want to forget any of these women, here were a few of the trailblazers I learned about:— Bonnie Prudden, physical fitness pioneer who shocked the country by appearing in a fitness unitard (one of the first!) on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1957— Lotte Berk, founder of barre whose free-love life story is crazy (she fled Nazis, for starters)— Kathrine Switzer, first woman to run the Boston Marathon as a registered competitor in 1967. (She went on to campaign for women to run the marathon in the Olympics…a goal she never experienced herself as the sport wasn’t an option for them until the ’84 Games.)— Indra Devi, the woman who brought yoga from India to the US in the 1950s (as much as I love and practice yoga, I cannot believe how little I knew of Indra’s contributions to its popularity….see also Lilias Folan, whose PBS series, “Lilias, Yoga and You,” was a gateway to the practice for women in the 1970s)— Jane Fonda, the woman who caused such seismic change in the fitness industry it’s seen as “Before Jane” and “After Jane”. This book taught me SO much about this icon, and the chapter on her fitness reign was my favorite. (Said chapter ALSO provided a truly fascinating history of the rise of the VHS workout as well as the story of how Reebok came to be THE workout shoe of the era…those are more trivia tidbits worth discovering yourselves, among many other gems in this insightful read!)...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 21, 2022","Mar 15, 2022","Dec 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57699965-let-s-get-physical

In doing so, I was due myself for a re-read and thus was not disappointed to revisit the story of Bill Furlong and the noble choice he makes to end this powerful story. Quiet heroism, indeed. Original Review for December 2021Every few years when the holidays roll around, I like to read O. Henry's short story, ""The Gift of the Magi."" It's a wonderful reminder that the most beautiful gift we can give another is our love. Now that I've read Claire Keegan's ""Small Things Like These,"" I have a feeling this slim little novel will be another hopeful work of fiction I enjoy revisiting in future Decembers to come. ""Small Things"" is the story of Bill Furlong, a hardworking coal merchant doing his best in '80s Ireland to get by caring for his wife, Eileen, and their five daughters. This read tugs on your heart strings, invoking shades of other Christmas classics (think George Bailey meets Charles Dickens). It's also a read that reminds you of the atrocities of the Magdalen laundries, which I'm ashamed to say I knew nothing about before picking up this book. I have Keegan to thank for that gut punch of a history lesson, but—more importantly—for allowing me to dip into a seasonal story that offers up a timely lesson in the virtues of courage, kindness, and responsibility....more",Notes are private!,1,13,2,"Dec 22, 2023Dec 23, 2021","Dec 24, 2023Dec 23, 2021","Dec 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58662236-small-things-like-these

(And for that reason, I am SO glad I re-read that novel this spring in preparation for this one!) But whereas Bix Bouton, creator of the company Mandala (a stand-in for Facebook if ever there was one), is a minor character in Goon Squad, his story—and more importantly, his invention “Own Your Unconscious”—is the beating heart of Candy House.This is a book that feels impossible to describe to someone who hasn’t read it (again with the “Inception” comparison). But for those who have, wouldn’t you agree it invites thought-provoking conversations about how we use technology for connection, be it with family or people from our pasts?And just as Egan did in Goon Squad, she employs in Candy House an array of narrative styles—first person plural, omniscient narrator, epistolary, a chapter of Tweets—to relay the stories of these characters whose lives intertwine in ways big and small.

The best part about Funny is the fact that Sussman writes with the kind of confidence that, like Taylor Jenkins Reid and Katie Cotugno, allows her to make up an alternate world where readers convincingly believe that actors named Gabe Parker and Oliver Matthias exist. That's no small feat in and of itself, and the highest compliment I can pay an author who attempts such a pop culture high wire act is to acknowledge that, after reading this book, I'd REALLY like to watch Ollie and Gabe act together in Tommy Jacks or their remake of A Philadelphia Story. So, thanks for that, Ms. Sussman. Related note: There exists a 2011 GQ profile of Chris Evans that reads like inspiration for this novel. I have to share the article because it's the reason I could perfectly picture Chris in the role of Gabe....which is funny because there's another book I loved about an ordinary woman falling for a celebrity—Ali Hughes Has Sex Sometimes —for which I ALSO pictured Chris Evans in the role.

But I have to admit, I never really settled into the storyline of her debut—not when it felt like the main character, Molly Gray, was someone who didn't know as much about herself as the reader did.By that I mean it's pretty clear Molly is on the spectrum. The characteristics Prose gives her all fit the bill. And they become a major reason why Molly (a maid in a fancy hotel) finds herself implicated as the main suspect in the murder of a man whose room she has been tasked with cleaning. What I found myself wondering multiple times throughout this novel was why couldn't we (the reader) have known from the get-go (aka, book jacket) that Molly is on the spectrum? Why couldn't Molly *herself* have been in the know? Is it because the plot couldn't stand on its proverbial two feet without her (and us) being kept in the dark? (And if so, what does that say about the story overall?) By leaving Molly's diagnosis up to ambiguity, Prose creates scene after scene where characters talk about how different she is—which makes for the perfect breeding ground for them to make fun of her and/or pity her and BLECH. I did NOT like feeling this way about her and yet, because of the way the book was written, it felt inevitable. I'll be curious if any other readers are as bothered as I was by this unspoken approach to Molly's developmental disability.

Sure, she was dealt a bad hand in being raised by a dad who was the ultimate con artist, but she herself carried on with his misdeeds, including bilking tons of people in a Ponzi scheme. Blech! Add to it the fact she allowed herself to be a pawn for so many others (from her boyfriend, Cary, to the woman she thought was her mom, Gloria), and I felt very little sympathy for her as a grown woman. For these reasons, and an ending that rushed to tie everything up with a tidy bow, I finished this one feeling indifferent about it overall.

After discovering Regina’s  (which piqued my interest), I saw the book’s arresting cover continue to pop up in my GoodReads feed.

It's a 1960s era adventure story about two very bright, very BRAVE siblings, Claudia and Jamie Kincaid, who decide to take an extended field trip of sorts, running away from their childhood home in Connecticut to spend a week living undetected inside NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art.The titular character, Mrs. Frankweiler, acts as one part narrator, two parts sage and it's a delightful journey to unravel her connection to the children. I don't know how this book missed me in my childhood, but one beautiful aspect of having children of my own is getting the chance to discover classics like this anew. Highly recommend for young readers (ideally 7-12 years old). This book sparked a lot of great discussion between me and my son, everything from whether we'd be brave enough to embark on a journey like the Kincaids, to where we'd hide in a museum, to how much things used to cost versus now, to what beautiful works of art were created at the hands of Michelangelo (who plays a part in this story as well). As a writer, I also enjoyed the ""bonus"" content included, such as Konigsburg's speech for winning the 1967 Newbery Medal for the book. Not knowing much about Konigsburg, I read up on her and when I came to this line about her work in an article written when she died (in 2013), I nodded my head in respect and agreement. We will certainly be reading more of her work in our household after this:""Konigsburg’s career was marked by a willingness to take young readers seriously, as people who could decipher more complicated literature than simple, straightforward tales. Her novels often include intricate structures, puzzles, and characters who aren’t immediately likable. Both of the novels for which she won the Newbery—From The Mixed Up Files Of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and The View From Saturday—are marked by their structural playfulness, which extends beyond their sometimes complicated subject matter.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Sep 2021,"Nov 28, 2021","Dec 03, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3980.From_the_Mixed_Up_Files_of_Mrs_Basil_E_Frankweiler

If you’ve read it, you know how inventive it is—a high-concept pandemic novel wrBack in 2015, I fell hard for Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven. If you’ve read it, you know how inventive it is—a high-concept pandemic novel written long before any of us knew COVID-19 existed.Then, in 2017, on my birthday (lucky me!) I attended a reading with Emily at Butler University. What struck me then was how … uncomfortable she seemed on stage? Not that she didn’t do a wonderful job, just that, as a self-described introvert, she gave off vibes of someone for whom this extroverted aspect of the job was a challenge. (When I made small talk with her during the signing, I recall her wearing a 'deer-in-the-headlights' look, but maybe that metaphor stuck because of her beautiful, doe-like brown eyes.)ANYWAY, the reason I’m sharing this story is because, upon meeting the character Olive Llewellyn in Emily’s newest novel, Sea of Tranquility, I was transported back to my evening with Emily. Olive is an author in Sea who resides in one of the moon colonies. She’s returned to Earth for her latest book tour in the year 2203. In her chapters, readers are given an intimate glimpse at what a slog such a tour can be (from staying in a string of look-alike hotel rooms to answering the same—often patronizing—questions from people to grappling with how to feel when something you write catapults you to a level of fame you never anticipated). So yeah, in a lot of ways, Olive could be Emily. Or Emily could be Olive. (You get my point.) And I loved the autobiographical leanings of this character as much as I loved the rest of the cast in this “time-traveling triumph” (The Guardian) of a book—one that leapfrogs over a few pandemics, embraces a future that entails space travel, and makes readers question if there’s a glitch in the matrix after all.To say more about Sea would be an error on my part, because this is a read where discovery is so much a part of the experience—you don't know how the characters are all connected until the end. Also, after a string of so-so reads, it was wonderful to be back in the hands of a storyteller as masterful at her craft as Emily St. John Mandel. Cast of characters so I don’t forget them:— Edwin St. John St. Andrew (British traveler who witnesses something remarkable in a British Columbian forest)— Olive Llewellyn (author of Marienbad)— Gaspery-Jacques Roberts (a hotel worker who becomes a journalist/detective)— Mirella and Vincent (supporting characters from Glass Hotel)Key passage to remember: “…my point is, there’s always something. I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world … But all of this raises an interesting question,” Olive said. “What if it always is the end of the world?” She paused for effect. Before her, the holographic audience was almost perfectly still. “Because we might reasonably think of the end of the world,” Olive said, “as a continuous and never-ending process.” ""A life lived in a simulation is still a life.""Finally, two facts (if you made it this far): (1) Emily grew up in British Columbia (where part of her book is set) and (2) her grandfather was British and his name was Newell St. Andrew St. John (so that’s a fun flip of his name for Edwin’s character!)...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"May 11, 2022","May 17, 2022","Dec 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility

Even more than earning my respect, Dave straight-up CHARMED me. In all ways, he came across as an affable older brother—a goofy dude raised by modest means with an aw-shucks niceness who put in a LOT of hard work honing his talent, all so he could be ready to fulfill his rock-and-roll destiny. In his appropriately titled memoir, Dave details all that his creative destiny has encompassed, starting with his early years of learning how to play drums on his pillows before dropping out of high school at 17 to tour nationally with his favorite punk band, Scream.The chapters that chronicle his career with Nirvana were riveting (longtime fan that I am of the band), as was his account of what came next for him after Kurt’s death—from trying to escape his grief in rural Ireland (and failing spectacularly), to being asked to play with Tom Petty on SNL, to turning down the chance to become a Heartbreaker to pursue the side project he was more passionate about—creating a band he called the Foo Fighters after learning the name from a book about UFOs. All these fascinating stories are there for the taking (and when narrated by Dave, come fully alive in his laid-back tenor and delivery of a well-timed “fuck”). So, too, are the frequent and fond mentions of his relationship with his mother, Virginia. As the mother of a boy myself, I never tired of hearing him talk about her influence (case in point: we have her to thank for Dave joining Nirvana), and I can only dream of having the kind of “best friend” relationship with my son that these two still share.“Storyteller” has proven to be my favorite surprise read of 2021: I went into it with zero expectations and came out appreciating the opportunity to get to know more about a guy who seems to be one of the nicest in the biz—grounded, humble, and grateful to still be making music after all these years, despite all the sadness, drama, and bullshit he’s endured along the way to get here.

Now I’ll do my part to keep that 5-star love going by telling you that if you want a summer read that will tug at your heart strings, remind you of the power of love, and make you laugh in equal measure, you REALLY need to do yourself a favor and discover how big-city ER doctor Alexis Montgomery falls for small-town do-gooder (and new favorite fictional boyfriend) Daniel Grant. This book gets bonus points for: (1) having actual high stakes for its main characters (2) centering a love story around a younger man falling for an older woman and (3) convincingly relaying the friendliness and welcoming spirit of a small-town community.

Sutton has lent her musical and acting talents to Ball State for years now, coming to teach as a guest instructor and to help produce our students’ musicals. (I’ve even had the privilege of getting to interview her a few times while she was on our campus … a real treat!)I share this anecdote because it’s the reason for my biased, 5-star  of this book. The Sutton I’ve come to “know” through stories from our faculty and students is the same affable, charming, and down to earth personality who shows up in the pages of “Hooked.” Also? She’s a bit of a nerd. And she’d be the first to admit it! But when you center your memoir on your love of crafting, maybe you can deduce as much? Overall, I loved getting to learn more about her backstory, even if it was hard to hear about the emotional abuse she and her brother, Hunter, suffered under the watch of their agoraphobic mother. Sutton’s fraught relationship with her mom casts a long shadow over much of her memoir, but there is a lot more to her life that she explores in these pages, including the meteoric rise of her musical theater career. (I especially loved hearing about how she gave up a starring role in Broadway’s “Les Mis” to take a chance on a then-unknown musical, “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” a show that went on to help her land her first Tony Award.) She also writes about the loves in her life (while I knew of her first marriage to Christian Borle, I did *not* know she had a steamy relationship with Bobby Cannavale before her second marriage!) And she shares about her entry into TV with “Bunheads” followed by “Younger” (a show I loved through all seven soap-y seasons), as well as her emotional journey of becoming a mother via adoption. Sprinkled throughout the book are also fun anecdotes that are the mark of any great celebrity memoir, from her fan-girl feelings for Patti LuPone to her stories about how Peter Hermann (her hunky “Younger” co-star) is the world’s best gift giver. If you like Sutton going into this book, you’ll love her after you finish.

They are:	• the person who knows the perfect wine to pair with the entrees they’ve ordered for the table. 	• the person who, minutes after greeting you in their home, makes you your favorite cocktail.  • the person whose love for food gets you to try new things, be it borscht, ceviche, or escargot.After listening to “Taste: My Life Through Food,” I can confirm Stanley Tucci is DEFINITELY one of these people. Is there a culinary lottery that exists where the prize is having this man make me a meal? I’d go broke buying tickets if there was. Of course, if I won, I’d have to decide which of the wonderful recipes he shares in “Taste” I’d want him to make for me. Would it be ragu and Bolognese? Spaghetti alla Nerano? Bouillabaisse? I’d suppose I’d settle for a Totino’s pizza if the consolation prize was having him make me one of his famous stirred martinis. (I can hear Stanley say “Kill me now.”)If you can’t tell, I found “Taste” to be a DELIGHTFUL read—a book that took my modest crush on this actor-turned Internet boyfriend-turned NYT best-selling author and dialed it up to an 11. All the things I love most about Tucci are on full display here, from his comedic timing and droll delivery to his erudite commentary on life, love, traveling, and the volatile nature of the entertainment industry. If you read this book, you get all those observations, plus the occasional recipe, on the page. But if you LISTEN to the book, you get that extra narrative “spice” (sticking with food metaphors here) that flavors Tucci’s storytelling, whether he’s name dropping famous friends like Ryan Reynolds or describing the best bowl of spaghetti carbonara he’s ever had. (The way he delivers an emphatic “Fuckkkkkkkk!” when describing this particular dish still makes me chuckle to think about.)Tucci covers a lot of personal highs and lows in “Taste,” from the death of his first wife to cancer to finding love again with Felicity Blunt (yes, Emily’s sister), to his recent battle with tongue cancer. There's one particular paragraph I want to remember here, because it made me unexpectedly tear up. To set the scene, Stanley is talking late in the book about how much he loves to cook for people, and how this love is inspired by his Italian parents and his appreciation for their recipes, which have been passed down for generations. He writes: “Watching my guests enjoy the meal I’ve made filled me with great familial pride. In those moments, it was clear to me that someday, when my parents are no longer alive, I will always be able to put their teachings, and all the love they gave me, into a bowl and present it to someone who sadly will never have had the good fortune of knowing them. But by eating that food, they will come to know them, if just a little.”Swap out his mother’s timpano for my mother’s potato salad, and it’s a beautiful reminder that, to many of us, food truly is family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 16, 2021","Oct 29, 2021","Oct 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55360284-taste

I hit purchase but felt a bit skeptical—was I really going to spend the next 7 hours and 18 minutes entertained by some dude talking about the act of …. breathing? Turns out, yes, absolutely, I was. With each chapter of “Breath”, author James Nestor approaches the topic of health, breath, and the idea of how and why we breathe, from angles I never saw coming. His decade-long quest to investigate the history of breathing took him to places as far-flung as the the streets of Sao Paulo to the secret catacombs of Paris, where he examines the skulls of a whole lotta dead people to explore how the food we eat today (softer, mushier) has changed the shapes of our faces and made breathing more difficult than it was for our ancestors. Nestor’s curiosity also leads him to learn more about the women and men who were pioneers in studying the art of breathing. One of those individuals was Katharina Schroth, a German woman who straightened her severely scoliotic spine by repeatedly inhaling into one lung. Another “pulmonaut” (Nestor’s term for people who explore the bounds of human lung capacity) was Carl Stough, a New Jersey choral conductor who, in the 1950s, developed a deep form of breathing that helped singers improve the resonance of their voices and members of the US men’s track team break a bunch of records at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968. As a yogi, I was also fascinated to learn about the Indus Valley Civilization, a Bronze Age civilization in what today would be Afghanistan/Pakistan/India that is believed to be the first to practice yoga and yogic breathing.Along with the history of breathing, Nestor examines the topic from a wellness perspective, too. Perhaps the biggest takeaway? Breathing through your mouth is bad for you. Like, so bad for you it takes years off your life!Overall, I found this book to be the perfect combination of non-fiction that reads somewhat like a novel—engaging and informative in a way that reminds me of the work of the brilliant Mary Roach (so if you like her books, you’d love this).My final kudos (for the audiobook, at least) is that Nestor invites renowned Swedish breathing expert Anders Olson (a pulmonaut who joins him for an intense, weeks-long study to compare mouth vs nose breathing that he writes about in detail in the book) to lead listeners through a series of breathing exercises. I made notes for each of the styles of breathing, and fully intend to make future use of them!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 22, 2021","Oct 04, 2021","Sep 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48890486-breath

Did it really take me three weeks to read this book? It did. You want to know why? Because this book is the Triscuits of books covering the '90s. And, I guess I wanted it to be more like the Wheat Thins of books covering the '90s? I was not expecting Klosterman to write in such a drrrryyyyy way about ....well, basically everything there was to love about the '90s. Does he cover ""it"" all (""it"" being almost every major pop culture and newsworthy touchpoint of the decade, from Zima and Crystal Pepsi to Ross Perot and the Oklahoma City bombing)? Yes, yes he does.But in a way that is so borderline academic in tone I found myself bored at how laborious the book felt (these feelings were especially present when he broke down the Gen X generation for his readers).Also, there were multiple times where I didn't grasp the logic of his approach to various topics. Typically this didn't bother me, but it did make for occasional head-scratching moments. (One example: In the span of a chapter, he goes from covering the Biosphere project to the cloning of Dolly the Sheep, to Radiohead's popularity to....Pauly Shore's ascendance as an actor?)I will say my favorite element of his pop culture analysis is how he stressed the idea that the things we considered normal to us in the '90s would now seem batshit insane. (The popularity of Pauly Shore in the '90s standing in as a pretty great example of this—as in, we all just went along with the fact Pauly Shore could be the ""face"" of a movie in the '90s, when now we'd be like, ""The hell?!"") You will find far more five-star s of this book on GoodReads than three-stars, and that goes to show that Klosterman has a built-in fan base after so many years of writing about American pop culture. (I wouldn't know, as this is my first time reading him.)But I definitely come down on the side of GoodReads er Tracy on this one: ""I loved the idea of this book, but The Nineties turned out to be far more dull than the ‘90s ever were.""This '90s teen who wanted a ""warm, fuzzy romp"" through one of her favorite decades agrees....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 22, 2022","May 12, 2022","Sep 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58082714-the-nineties

""Billy"" is well-done crime fiction. Really well done crime fiction, in my opinion. The first half reads compelling enough, mainly because King is a master at what he does, so it's easy to be swept up in the story of Billy, a Marine sniper-turned-murderer for hire (think Dexter without the need to dispose of all the bodies) moonlighting as a novelist waiting to finish out his “one last job.” (“If noir is a genre,” King writes cheekily as Billy, “then ‘one last job’ is a subgenre.” )Where “Billy” picks up serious steam is exactly midway through—with the introduction of a secondary character whose depressing life circumstances eclipse Billy’s own. I don’t want to say anything more about who this person is because I want readers to be as shocked as I was by the outlaw-ish twists and turns that reveal themselves in the second half of this book. I came to the closing pages sad to let “Billy” go while also in complete agreement with Adrienne Westenfeld, writer of the Esquire article I mentioned above:“To see the undisputed master of horror shift seamlessly into the realm of noir thrillers is proof that King can still surprise and astound us, all these decades later.""...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 27, 2021","Nov 09, 2021","Sep 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56852407-billy-summers

This is why I knew, months ahead of its August release, that Jeff had a new book coming out—it's also why, fan that I am, I couldn't wait to dive in to it. For sure, I was not disappointed. ""In the Wild Light"" serves up all the familiar delights of Jeff's previous novels—prose that borders on poetry, scenes that make you laugh one moment and tear up on the next page, an abundance of sensory details, scenic descriptions of Tennessee, and teenage characters whose greatest attributes are their heart and their humility. In Jeff's hands, these elements come together this time around to tell the story of Cash*** and Delaney, high school friends whose bond is formed by tragedy and then transformed when, together, they leave behind their hometown for the educational opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to attend an elite East Coast boarding school on full scholarship. I always lose count of how many pages I dog-ear in Jeff's books, but enough that the book grows bigger by the time I (unwillingly) turn to the last page. That was true here, of course. But what I especially loved about this title, and maybe it has to do with my own children getting older and so my ""parent hat"" is more firmly in place, is my appreciation for the many scenes in which Jeff was telling his readers that it's okay to:  — feel like an outsider — seek help for your mental health, especially if you are a guy — find solace in religion, especially prayer — be proud of your family, no matter your socioeconomic background — express emotions in front of your friends — stick up for someone who needs help, especially when that someone is a young woman in duressThose are important lessons that everyone needs to hear, but especially the young adults who make up Jeff's core audience.A beautiful book and my favorite of Jeff's novels since his debut, which will forever hold a spot on my shelf of all-time favorite reads. ***Bonus points to Jeff for working in the reference to Cash's physical resemblance to River Phoenix.

To give you an idea of how much this book overwhelmed me (and I mean that in the best way possible), I stayed up WAY past my bedtime one night recently to finish it. (Anything that gets me to see the other side of midnight has to be astonishingly good.) Then I laid there staring at the ceiling for a solid 20 minutes, full of wonder at what a genius Anthony Doerr is for all that he was able to accomplish with this latest novel of his.Because somehow he manages to brilliantly weave together the narratives of five women and men who start off having nothing in common and whose lives span the course of eight centuries. These women and men include Anna and Omeir, teens who survive the 15th century fall of Constantinople; Idahoans Seymour and Zeno, a radicalized young man and aging Korean vet, respectively; and Konstance, a 14-year-old passenger on a 22nd-century spaceship fleeing an Earth ravaged by climate change.Over the course of ""Cloud""'s 600-plus pages, Doerr employs fast pacing and short chapters (a signature approach to writing he’s admitted to adopting because of the relatable restrictions of parenthood), to reveal just how the stories of these five characters interconnect—and the end result is truly a genre-bending work of wonder. I could wax on for a long, LONG time about all the reasons why I love this book and all the lessons it has taught me, most notably to dig deeper into a topic (lost manuscripts) I’d never given much thought to previously.Instead I want to end my  by borrowing this spot-on line from author Marcel Theroux's  of ""Cloud"" for the New York Times: “It’s a wildly inventive novel that teems with life, straddles an enormous range of experience and learning, and embodies the storytelling gifts that it celebrates. It also pulls off a resolution that feels both surprising and inevitable, and that compels you back to the opening of the book with a head-shake of admiration at the Swiss-watchery of its construction.”A Swiss watch is not the analogy I would have grabbed myself to describe “Cloud Cuckoo Land.” And yet it is the perfect word to describe a book this wildly innovative, creative, and appealing.

It's an essential book for anyone committed to racial justice as well as an incredibly timely one for those of us paying attention to the fight over critical race theory that's been playing out across America in 2021. In ""How the Word Is Passed,"" journalist Clint Smith heads to places where the *true* stories of our country are hidden in plain sight. Among the locations he visits:1) Jefferson's Monticello Plantation2) The Whitney Plantation (the only plantation in the country where the perspective of slaves is central to the tours given)3) Angola Prison (Louisiana's state prison, which is HUGE..and, as I learned from this book, has a GIFT SHOP...the HORROR!)4) Blandford Cemetery (the largest Confederate cemetery in the country)5) Galveston Island (where the proclamation freeing slaves was read on June 19, 1865, which led to the national holiday of Juneteeth)6) New York City (this was my favorite chapter; I learned so much about slavery in the north from it)7) Gorée Island (the island off Africa that was the center of the slave trade for centuries)Within each chapter, Clint shares experiences from his visits, interviewing the people who work there or are affiliated with each location as researchers or tourists. I found his interviews with all his subjects to be fair, demonstrating a commitment to journalistic integrity that this former reporter greatly admired. I'm also glad I listened to this one too, as Clint does a great job narrating his work. A few points he made that I wanted to capture so I didn't forget them:• “I think that history is the story of the past, using all the available facts, and that nostalgia is a fantasy about the past using no facts, and somewhere in between is memory, which is kind of this blend of history and a little bit of emotion…I mean, history is kind of about what you need to know…but nostalgia is what you want to hear.”• “...I'm left wondering if we are all just patchworks of the stories we've been told. What would it take - what does it take - for you to confront a false history even if it means shattering the stories you have been told throughout your life? Even if it means having to fundamentally reexamine who you are and who your family has been? Just because something is difficult to accept doesn't mean you should refuse to accept it. Just because someone tells you a story doesn't make that story true.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 20, 2021","Dec 31, 2021","May 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55643287-how-the-word-is-passed

For me, I couldn’t get past how ludicrous the actions of the individuals involved were related to the incident in question. (And apologies for being so opaque about what I’m referring to, but I keep my s spoiler-free, and this one deserves the shock it delivers to the reader once it’s introduced.)Overall, those two factors might have pulled me out of the book a bit, but I still enjoyed the time I spent in the heads of these complicated characters.

But KC also helped me belatedly appreciate Bourdain as both chef and person: supremely talented, sarcastic, vulgar and gruff—the “Elvis of bad boy chefs.” Bourdain’s delivery of his own words could at times be exhilarating (the way he talked about food made me want to immediately try whatever he was discussing, from oysters to sashimi to Beef Wellington) while also exhausting. (There’s one chapter where he delivers an hour by hour account of his life as a chef, barely pausing to take a breath, and I felt like I needed to sit down on his behalf when I was through with it.)It is so effing sad to think Bourdain is gone when his work—from his storytelling to his culinary skills—made so many people so happy.

I feel like it's best to know little about the beat-by-beat plot going in, so instead of divulging too much about it here, let me instead share the three reasons why I loved it as much as I did—enough to read passages out loud to my mom (as I was in her company the weekend I devoured it).1) ""Weekend at Bernie's"" is one of my favorite childhood movies. It's SO ridiculous, and yet the childhood version of me was madly in love with Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman so it was one of those '80s flicks I watched on heavy repeat on the good old VHS player. (To this day, when I think about them dragging Bernie behind their speedboat, I still laugh.) The comparisons of ""Dial A""'s plot to ""Bernie"" are on point. So when you factor in my love for ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (also a comp for this book) AND the fact I have been a wedding photographer myself (just as the book's main character, Meddy Chan), then you realize I'm a biased shoo-in for this book's target audience.2) The AMAZING Nahnatchka Khan is adapting ""Dial A"" for Netflix . The book reads pretty much like a screenplay, so this news does not surprise me. It does, however, excite me greatly, given how much I ADORE Always Be My Maybe (the Netflix rom-com Khan directed in 2019). Cannot wait to see who gets cast for this forthcoming flick! 3) The Aunties—THEY.ARE.HILARIOUS. I loved them all, and I could picture the incredibly funny Asian-American actress Amy Hill (who I've loved since her days on Margaret Cho's short-lived All-American Girl) as the eldest aunt.

How else to explain why I’m so drawn to history of that era, particularly profiles about female trailblazers from that time period? (In journalism school, one of my favorite books was Katharine Graham’s Personal History. ‘Nuf said.)I’m not sure this book will be cat nip for everyone, but it certainly was for me. Inside its pages is a fascinating slice of American history that chronicles in equal parts (1) the rise of NPR (a preferred news outlet of mine) (2) the technological and political history of the U.S. in the latter half of the 20th century and (3) the personal lives of the Founding Mothers of public radio (whose corner of the NPR office was dubbed the “Fallopian Jungle” … by a man, OF COURSE.)I loved how this book provides such detailed backstories about these four women—Susan Stamberg, Linda Wertheimer, Cokie Roberts, and the aforementioned Nina Totenberg. Their career history spans the extraordinary leaps made by women of that generation, and it never ceases to amaze me how close in the rearview mirror are the days when women routinely had their bottoms pinched and were “chased around the table” by men (gross!) while at work. This book made me admire these women even more. (I especially loved learning more about Nina, a fearless reporter who wrote scathing profiles of people in power like J. Edgar Hoover, but who also had the chutzpah to publish a piece in 1974 about the nation’s dumbest congressmen. Ha!)

After finishing Danielle Evans’ “The Office of Historical Corrections,” I found this aptly titled one: “‘The Office of Historical Corrections’ is a Necessary Critique of the Current Moment’.”Evans’ wastes no words in this collection of stories that are tightly structured and timely in topic, touching on everything from friendship and privilege to race and representations of history. Given the line “Office” walks between satire and reality, it was surreal to read the titular novella, “The Office of Historical Corrections,” a week after I finished Clint Smith’s “How the Word Is Passed.” In Evans’ fictional telling, the character Cassie works for a government agency (the Institute for Public History) responsible for correcting the historical record, from fixing a flyer for a Juneteeth cake to amending the wording of a plaque commemorating a historical event involving a Black business owner. In Smith’s work of nonfiction, he pays visits to various cities and attractions in the U.S., detailing the history of each locale hiding in plain site (making him the living embodiment of Evans’ character).The juxtaposition of these similar narratives—one very real, the other not so much—makes for a powerful reminder of just how ""of the moment"" this collection truly is. And because I’m the worst at remembering short stories, I'm documenting the titles of those in “Office,” along with a few notes, so I can recall them when talking about this book moving forward: “Happily Ever After”: Lyssa (who works on a tourist attraction replica of the Titanic) grieves for her dying mother while reconciling her boyfriend becoming a racial target after trying to help them “Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain”: Rena misses her sister against the rom-com backdrop of a missing groom and an interracial wedding party hookup“Boys Go to Jupiter”: Claire and her Confederate-flag bikini“Alcatraz”: A young woman reflects on how her life has been shaped by her mother’s efforts to restore a family member’s reputation as an Alcatraz prisoner“Why Won’t Women Just Say What They Want” (this one was delightful in a very George Saunders way): a series of unnamed women (ie ‘Former Personal Assistant’) receive creative apologies from a despicable Don Juan who then makes the act of apologizing into a work of public art gone wrong“Anything Could Disappear” (this story pulled at my heartstrings!): Vera and the young boy from the bus and the life that could have been for them if she hadn’t done the presumptive right thing...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 23, 2021","Jan 03, 2022","Apr 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51777605-the-office-of-historical-corrections

That’s why I was giddy when my bookselling bestie sent me an advance copy of their newest, The Soulmate Equation (which releases May 18). The science-y premise of this book—what happens when a single mom gets “diamond” matched with the founder of a DNA-based dating company—was unique enough to sell me on the story.

I don’t know about some of you, but I really do miss all of those romance flicks that were made in the early aughts. (I can’t tell you the countless weekends in college wherein I would inevitably end up curled up on the couch, sucked into another cable showing of any one of these films.)

As for me, what I personally loved most about this book had nothing to do with its plot but was another excerpt that I read in the same letter referenced above. In these words, Thorne acknowledges a truth I have come to know intimately as a writer of fiction myself—a truth I wanted to remember in sharing this  here:“I’ve come to a realization that becoming good at something creative or worthwhile is a process of applying layers, and being willing to be really uncomfortable when the Thing is halfway done…..You will not like it. You will be pretty sure that you’re not succeeding. This is when another layer must be applied. …A book starts off as a blank page ….

On this front, and in the ways in which she interweaves her keen knowledge of history and pop culture into her writing, ZDH nails it. Where I struggled with this read is in the level of trust she placed in me, her reader, to keep up with the plot. Especially when, out of nowhere, she starts switching from the point of view of the main character, Zella, to….well, honestly, I’m still not quite sure who several of the characters were, not even as I came to the closing pages of the novel. Then there is the element to the book where the “Get Out” comp becomes relevant (a comp that had me giddy at first because that movie was one of my favorites of 2017). I don’t want to ruin the element of surprise for future readers, so I'll just say I could pick this concept apart (pun intended) as being too left field for me to appreciate its application in relation to the rest of the story. The race politics of this novel, coupled with ZDH’s mad storytelling skills, are deserving reasons for why this book is one of this month's most anticipated releases.

The narration was excellent, which is just part of the reason it was a quick, 5-star read for me. The story is written as a teleplay about Chinatown that explores Asian-American stereotypes through the eyes of Willis Wu, a young actor figuring out his place in Hollywood as he ascends the ladder of parts (Generic Asian Man to coveted Kung Fu Guy) historically available to most Asian-American actors. The book is part speculative, part family drama, part satire, and it’s one of the most creative things I’ve read in years (which is why it’s no surprise it took home last year’s coveted National Book Award). On Monday, when I learned that Steven Yeun had made Oscar history as the first Asian American to be nominated for best actor, I thought of Yu’s book—how maybe, *maybe* Hollywood had reached a turning point when it comes to Asian-American representation (in films, in pop culture, in media).

My heart continues to go out to everyone in the Asian community. I shared a post on Instagram today with my  of this novel and a few more thoughts about how to show my support and solidarity with the AAPI community.And, back to this stellar read that feels more relevant and necessary than ever, I found  this profile about Charles to be an excellent companion read. What a remarkable series of careers he's had! I think he can, with great confidence, call himself a proper writer now. As for me, I look forward to seeing what's in store for him in the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 04, 2021","Mar 07, 2021","Mar 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44436221-interior-chinatown

I’m biased because I adore her, but I think this is Amy’s best book yet.

Maybe it's the time of year (December being a hectic month for myself and most others I know), but I had a lot of stops and starts with this one. I felt it could have benefitted from a tighter edit, one with at least 2-3 fewer points of view (did we really need that random chapter from Abernathe?). Also, as much as I appreciated Ulysses, he carried with him shades of the troublesome Magical Negro trope.These misgivings are slight enough to keep this from being a five-star read for me, but I still immensely enjoyed the book. To read Towles is to appreciate his clever word play and his genius comprehension of literature.

Listening to Suleika Jaouad's “Between Two Kingdoms,” the story of the author’s years-long journey battling an aggressive form of leukemia, I was blown away by just how compelling Suleika’s voice was on the page. Her capacity for introspection and her gift of connection with her words made me feel like I was right there with her in all those hospital beds, enduring the ups and downs in her relationships, the ravaging effects of her chemo, and (much later) the freedom and solitude of traveling the open road in a beat-up Subaru. This is the best memoir I’ve read since Tara Westover’s “Educated” (and Suleika does a fantastic job narrating it on audio). In a twist of serendipity, it was a pleasure to discover musician Jon Batiste through this book.

As Women's History Month draws to a close, I have to share how much I enjoyed reading “Ida B. Queen: The Extraordinary Life and Legacy of Ida B. Wells.” This book is filled with gorgeous illustrations and artifacts that tell a compelling story about the Black experience alongside the biography of an awe-inspiring woman who was ahead of her time—as a journalist, as a publisher, as a suffragist, and as a civil rights activist. What makes this book all the more powerful is that these stories about Ida are compiled by her great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster.Ida’s investigative journalism brought to light the horrors of lynching in early 20th-century America. For years, she failed to garner the accolades and attention she deserved (when she died in 1931, the NYT didn’t even write an obit for her). So I’m glad that, today, her activism and her investigative work are being rediscovered and celebrated through landmarks, a posthumous Pulitzer (awarded in 2020), and creative works like this book.

And though it's been ages since I've read YA, I decided to give it a go when I saw it was available to check out on Hoopla. Within the first 30 pages I could tell this was the kind of YA novel that transcends its audience—the kind of novel that everybody should read, no matter their age.""Clap"" is a powerful story about the bonds of family—and the secrets that can break them apart and/or bring them back together. It's also a beautiful work written in homage to the victims of AA Flight 587, which happened not long after 9/11 (and, prior to reading this, I sheepishly knew nothing about). Everyone who died on that flight in 2001 was from the Dominican Republican. Acevedo, who was just a young teen at the time, grew up wanting to write a book in response ""about personal and public grief — to show how certain communities mourn on their own from events that perhaps deserve more attention.” (source)She accomplishes that goal and then some with ""Clap."" And the fact she does it in verse? That just makes this book all the more impressive. This is a read I've only just finished but already recommended to four of my friends. I look forward to reading more of Acevedo's books (including her award-winning debut) and have a strong hunch my future self will fall for anything she writes. A few beautiful lines that I had to highlight along the way:Passage 1 (when Yahaira is talking about her relationship with her girlfriend, Dre): ""We both know what it's like to haveour parents look at uslike we are dressed in neon questionmarks.""""We also know exactly what it's like to look at the other& see all the answers of ourselves there.""

She's a comedian, actress, and the first Black woman to write for a late-night network talk show (Late Night with Seth Meyers). I started following her on Instagram shortly after the new year, and I've liked every one of her posts, many of which are snippets of her monologues from her own late-night show on NBC's Peacock. In a similar vein as Trevor Noah, Amber uses caustic humor to explore our country's social justice issues.

When I say I loved this book, I mean I LOVED THIS BOOK. On audio, it's an A+ listen. That's almost entirely because of Amber's comedic timing and delivery. She and her sister had me laughing out loud multiple times, and, just as often, shaking my head in ""Can you believe this shit?"" agreement. To give you an idea of just how good this book is, one of the mornings I was listening to it while getting ready for work, my husband overheard a bit of it and got so sucked in that he sat on the edge of the tub and listened to the rest of the chapter with me. As we both discussed, it's truly appalling the extent of microaggressions that Black women and men put up with on a daily basis. Listening to a book like this reminds those of us who are white that we need to do a hell of a lot better calling out this kind of racist behavior (in stores, in our workplaces, and in social settings).

I knew little about the author, and I don’t typically delve into collections of short stories, but, intrigued enough by the promise of learning more about Cambodian culture, I added it to my “to reads” list.I was about three stories into this collection when, amidst my Googling of topics like the Khmer Rouge, “The Killing Fields,” and the resettlement of Cambodian refugees to California after the end of so much ‘70s era conflict in Southeast Asia, I discovered this stellar profile of Anthony Veasna So, written by the talented journalist, E. Alex Jung. I was SHOCKED to discover Anthony had died of an overdose on December 8, 2020, less than a year before he could experience the release of the book he had, at 28, dedicated his young life to creating. It’s a crying shame he’s gone, too, because, as Jung writes, Anthony would have delighted in the praise that followed for his (in the words of the NYT) “witty and soulful” stories.Many of the stories are indeed that. They are also a comprehensive glimpse into the lives of “Cambos” who struggle to process the legacy of their family’s past traumas as a result of the genocide that led to the fracturing of Cambodia and the deaths of between 1.5 and 3 million of its people between 1975 and 1979.Discovering Jung’s profile in tandem with reading “Afterparties” made for an unforgettable reading experience—a chance to dive deep into the inspirations of a particular artist who proudly lived his queer, immigrant life on the page.Because short stories are reading that’s “slippery” to me (meaning, I later blank on most, if not all, of the stories I read when I do pick up collections), I wanted to make note of my favorites from “Afterparties” so I don’t soon forget them: “Three Women of Chuck’s Donuts”—the first story in the collection (and previously published in the New Yorker) there was a cinematic quality to this story of a mother and her two daughters holding down the family’s all-night donut shop that I found particularly arresting“Superking Son Scores Again”—an interesting introduction to Cambodians’ passion for the sport of badminton that was equal parts funny and informative “Generational Differences”—Initially I sort of rolled my eyes at this one, because the fact AVS writes it in second person felt like an annoying hat tip to his MFA training, but I found this story—a sort of “looking back” manifesto written to a son from a mother who survived the Khmer Rouge and also witnessed a school shooting at a Stockton elementary school—to be a powerful one and it left me guessing how much of it may have been autobiographical for the author and his family....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 31, 2021","Sep 05, 2021","Dec 29, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/51733706-afterparties

One of the first authors to take a go at it is Michael Farris Smith, whose new release “Nick” serves as a prequel to “Gatsby.”The book’s dust jacket—itself a reinterpretation of “Gatsby”’s most iconic cover—was enough to lure me in. But what kept me turning the pages is my long-held appreciation for Nick Carraway. In “Nick,” we are with the character on the battlefields of World War I, then back home again to the Midwest, an ill-fated sojourn in New Orleans, and beyond. Smith’s version of Nick, a young veteran confronting the traumas of war, pandemic, and economic decline, reminded me that history has a habit of repeating itself. Leaving behind a year in which Americans have endured so many losses, I found myself wondering if, post-pandemic, we (like Nick) might get our own version of the Roaring ‘20s.

There were scenes in this book that made me laugh out loud, and others so tender and contemplative on the topic of loss and love and family and regret that I felt compelled to read certain lines twice. As one Goodreads er so aptly described it, this book is “charmingcholy”, through and through. The ending of this book was especially rewarding, as Rowley allows Patrick to discover a fresh start for himself in a way that lets him build off his charisma as the former star of a popular network sitcom. Playing casting director in my mind, I tried out Jim Parsons as Patrick before deciding I’d love to see what Matt Bomer would do if given the opportunity to play GUP.

I say this because, based on a few early GR s, there appear to be readers who aren't on board with what she's trying to accomplish with ""Malibu Rising."" Before I break down the reasons why I disagree with them, let me acknowledge that what I've long loved about TJR is her willingness to push herself as an artist. I've read all her titles, and I've enjoyed their progression from standard women's fiction to novels with bigger thematic and structural risks (e.g., the incorporation of Old Hollywood tabloids in ""Evelyn"" and the oral narrative of ""Daisy Jones""). With ""Malibu Rising,"" she's broken the novel in half: the first section is told in third-person omniscient style (a style popular in classic lit), wherein we're inside the heads of all the Rivas, from parents Mick and June to their offspring, Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit. The chapters jump perspective AND time, which was a style I settled into after a few chapters, but may not work for every reader.In the second half of the novel, we follow the plot from inside the heads of a host of characters—A-list celebrity, model, and lowly caterer alike—in attendance at Nina Riva's epic annual summer bash. Again, this style of narrative head-hopping won't work for some, but for me, it reminded me of some of my favorite '80s and '90s ""party"" flicks (e.g., ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait""). When done well, you don't care that you're only ""meeting"" these characters once or twice—they still have a line or scene that makes them memorable. And for me, that rang as true with ""Malibu Rising"" as it did those films. (Case in point: Vaughn Donovan, aka the ""Plate Thrower"")At its heart, this book is about the bonds of family. But, true to the style TJR has grown into, it's also about celebrities, fame culture, and the place that is the epicenter of where the two collide.Already I'm eager (as always) for what TJR puts into the world next. It's fun to imagine a future novel of hers set at the Chateau Marmont or, true to the way she creatively pushes herself, maybe she'll give us her version of ""Mulholland Drive"" next. Wherever she takes her readers, I'll be ready for the ride.A FEW LINES I WANT TO REMEMBER-----(these were two scenes I really, really loved)[the moment when Ashley, Hud's girlfriend, leaves the party...Springsteen lover that I am, it's writing like this that is a primary reason why TJR is my No. 1 Author Crush]:""As she pulled out onto PCH, ""Hungry Heart"" started playing through her speakers and Ashley felt just the tiniest bit of hope. Your whole world could be falling apart, she thought, but then Springsteen will start playing on the radio.""[The way TJR describes how Kit grieves is...exactly the way I grieve, too]: ""The two of them still held pockets of grief in their bodies that bubbled up at inopportune moments. **Kit, particularly, grieved the way some people drink, which is to say: rarely but always alone and to excess.** So she could not keep Mick's gaze at that very moment because she did not want to cry.""...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 21, 2021","Jan 30, 2021","Dec 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55404546-malibu-rising

So, it was a full-circle moment to finally be able to support her by purchasing her first collection of poetry this fall.What I loved most about these poems is how arresting so many of them were. With just a few stripped down lines, Baer is able to capture an essential sentiment about womanhood/motherhood—a feat that, more than a few times, left me in breathless awe of her tremendous talent. Here is one such poem I never want to forget—a poem that took me *right* back to the delivery room on the afternoon my daughter was born. It was a day that made me feel closer to God in a way that might as well have been my personal version of a Terrence Malick/""Tree of Life"" movie montage.

It's a time for reflection and recuperation, for slow replenishment, for putting your house in order. Doing those deeply unfashionable things—slowing down, letting your spare time expand, getting enough sleep, resting—is a radical act now, but it is essential. This is a crossroads as we all know, a moment when you need to shed a skin. If you do, you'll expose all those painful nerve endings and feel so raw that you'll need to take care of yourself for a while. If you don't, then that skin will harden around you. It's one of the most important choices you'll ever make.""“Then we enter that strange period between Christmas and New Year, when time seems to muddle, and we find ourselves asking again and again, What day is it? What date? I always mean to work on these days, or at least to write, but this year, like every other, I find myself unable to gather up the necessary intent. I used to think that these were wasted days, but I now realize that’s the point. I am doing nothing very much, not even actively being on “holiday”. I clear out my cupboards, ready for another year’s onslaught of cooking and eating. I take Bert out to play with friends. I go for cold walks that make my ears ache. I am not being lazy. I’m not slacking. I’m just letting my attention shift for a while, away from the direct ambitions of the rest of my year. It’s like revving my engines.”""Winter is the best season for walking, as long as you can withstand a little earache and are immune to mud. Best are the coldest days when even that freezes solid and the ground crunches underfoot, firm and satisfying. A good frost picks out every blade of grass, the crenellated edge of every leaf.

Set shortly after the turn of the 20th century, this book portrayed a vanished way of Western life, one complete with a one-room school house and detailed descriptions of the hardships of a pioneering existence on the prairie. The plot is narrated by one of the three sons, Paul, of Oliver Milliron, a dirt farmer whose wife dies and who is in need of a housekeeper to help him and his boys. The woman who shows up, Rose, brings her brother-in-law, Morris, along, and the drama that unfolds makes for a heartwarming story with cinematic qualities, a lovely nod to Halley's Comet, and a surprise twist ending! I tend to stick to one of several lanes as a reader (contemporary, literary, women's fiction) and rarely explore writers who are known for their work on a geographic basis. In reading this, I learned that Doig has been described as the ""reigning master of Western literature,"" and I enjoyed discussing his work with my sister in law, who lives in Bozemann and is quite the fan of the fellow Montanan....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 02, 2020","Nov 12, 2020","Oct 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/262545.The_Whistling_Season

It IS that. It's also not a book I would recommend to just anyone (especially if they're prone to anxiety or triggered by doomsday prophecy).My unease with this book was heightened by my physical surroundings on the night I finished it, which happened to be Halloween. We were driving back from a (physically distanced because #2020) visit with family, and I was reading on my phone in the car. At a certain point, a friend texted me a link to a news story about the caravans that had ran the Biden campaign bus off the interstate, and the account deeply disturbed me. That news story felt like a harbinger of bad things to come, and that word—harbinger—is basically the plot of ""Leave the World Behind"" in a nutshell. So yeah, on a holiday filled with its own spookiness, in a year with a nothing-but-ominous news cycle, I was sitting in our vehicle, reading this nail-biting book, and THEN we were nearly in an accident when a truck careened in front of us on the 465 loop around Indianapolis. (Cue the Hitchcock strings.)By the time we made it home, I felt more wound up—because of the election, because of the state of the world, because of our near-miss on the interstate—than I have at any other point in 2020! Maybe it was fitting then, that I would finish this foreboding book on a night that already had my heart racing—a night when I was more than ready to leave both the fictional world I was stuck in (and the real one I wanted to get out of) behind. Related: I decided to read this b/c I knew about the Netflix adaptation in the works with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.

Washington), and I also found myself thinking this *could* be a rare instance where I end up liking the film more than the book. We'll see...but knowing this news is why I chuckled at the wish fulfillment aspect of the author slipping a ""You look like Denzel Washington"" line about G.H. into the book.

And because they were released as individual titles (which is ridiculous, given each is the equivalent of about 10 pages long, but I'm sure was a marketing ploy), GoodReads wants me to  them each individually, too. Instead of doing that, I'm just going to tell you in one swoop that I read—and enjoyed—all of them. And if you're a fan of Kaling's, you will enjoy them, too. It's just that simple. Because almost everything this woman does is good. (Top-rated TV series? Good. Comedic movie starring the goddess Emma Thompson? Good. Two NYT best-selling collections of essays? Good.) In the case of these stories, they're effortlessly good. The kind of good that makes obvious that Mindy is a born storyteller. The kind of good wherein she admits she cranked them out in her bed at night, after doing all the other awesome things she does in her day-to-day life (from being a hands-on single mom to helping run a production empire) and they are STILL that good. Some of the stories in this collection are fluff. (""Searching for Coach Taylor"" is basically just Mindy humorously professing her undying love for Coach Taylor....which, can't all FNL fans relate to?)Some of the stories are hilarious. (""Once Upon a Time in Silverlake"" is Mindy sharing about the time her and BFF BJ Novak were...well, not quite, but almost carjacked in LA by a drifter who looked like an ""extremely worse-for-wear Sean William Scott"" and who recognized them from ""The Office."") But others are more emotional (like this one, ""Kind of Hindu,"" about her desire to raise her daughter as Hindu and how complicated that wish proved to be, given her own falling out with the faith she was born into). Then there is the one that got to me most as a mother myself (one who is lucky enough to still have her own mom to look up to) and that's ""Help is On the Way."" In it, Mindy writes about how much she misses her mom and how hard it was not to have her there to help her when her daughter, Katherine, was born. I loved reading about how Mindy was able to find a live-in nurse (Rose) who became a surrogate mother figure in her life right when she needed one most. To me, that story was a powerful reminder that when we look at celebrities who we think ""have it all,"" that's not always the case. I'm pretty sure Mindy would trade on her fame and fortune for the opportunity to relive her daughter's first few months with her beloved mother at her side.

This book was a lesson in why we shouldn't judge a woman for her profession—a truth I was reminded of when I read a recent essay Christina wrote for Lit Hub: ""Every woman’s experience is worth investigating, and if former Bunnies felt their time spent in a costume was fun and empowering, that’s valid, especially if there were so few other avenues available to them if they wanted to have a blast.

Harper is a phenomenal writer, and if she chooses to write more books on her profession, I would be happy to read them. For now, I'll settle for reading and watching interviews with her (like this stellar one with Trevor Noah, another creative crush of mine), and remembering a few memorable passages from her memoir, which I've shared below. On how her wealthy family kept the abuse at the hands of her stepfather a secret for so long:""Like all elites, we didn't expose our private, upper-middle-class shame to the public sphere. Why would we have? After all, we had worked too hard to get here to risk a crack in the fragile facade that fronted our legitimacy. All elites knew the code: Take your pills with your cocktail, use your cosmetics to cover the blemishes and bruises, clean up quickly, whatever it takes so you can present a smiling, perfectly coiffed and clad self to the world.""""America still has so many more strides to make. I am evidence.""""...these details fall under the category of 'it's not my job,' but that's what doctors are often called to do, and it's what makes it impossible for us to excel at what is actually our job. In emergency medicine, as in the case of the overworked mechanic, working outside one's prescribed duties makes the work dangerous.

To use an analogy (that will make sense only to me, and maybe the 2 or 3 other GoodRead-ers who stumble upon this ), it takes three strings to make a braid, right? And each string has to be equally strong to hold that braid together. If ""A Burning"" was a braid, I'd tell you that the strings/stories about Jivan (the Muslim girl accused of bombing a train station) and PT Sir (Jivan's opportunistic gym teacher who hitches his star to a right-wing political party) weren't as strong as the one that pulled you along with Lovely (the hijra on the fast track to becoming the next Bollywood star).For that reason, about a third of the way through the novel, all I could think about was how I no longer cared about Jivan (sad as her story was) or PT Sir (who witnesses a mob murder SO distressing I almost put the book down—ANOTHER reason this one left me lukewarm), and that the only reason I wanted to finish was to find out what happened to Lovely.I guess this  is my long-winded way of saying, had this book been Lovely's life story, it might have been a five-star read for me. Because Majumdar is a wonderful writer, and I learned so much about Indian culture with the glimpses into the lives of these characters she created, Lovely especially.

It wasn’t until he shared his cancer diagnosis with Jeopardy! viewers, and experienced an outpouring of love, that he realized perhaps people *did* want to know more about the guy who’s been reading all those clues to them over the past 35 years. Trebek’s humble manner (a hallmark of Canadians, eh?) and his do-good-ism are evident throughout this book. One example can be found in the stories he reveals about his role as a World Vision Ambassador. He has given generously to the non-profit, and traveled extensively in his role as a humanitarian. Learning this was a nice reminder that, behind the scenes, there are plenty of people in Hollywood who are doing honorable things—the kind of things we should be talking more about IMO. My one critique of this book (which I listened to, with Ken Jennings doing a bang-up job narrating, with Trebek’s trademark voice chiming in to deliver the most personal stories) is that it was organized in a “cutesy” way. Every memory seemed to have a “What Is ….” lead-in to it. This was obviously meant as a tie-in to Jeopardy! but proved cumbersome by the end.What I loved most about ""The Answer Is ..."" was how Trebek spoke so lovingly about his wife and his children, about his pride in being an American (and what that stands for in light of our democracy’s current struggles), and his acceptance of his cancer and final months of life. (His thoughts on these topics were so poignant and personal they drew a tear to my eye.)Two bits of trivia he shared that I really enjoyed:—The theme song for Jeopardy! was written by show creator Merv Griffin as a lullaby for his infant son. Griffin has earned royalties off the song ever since to a tune of $80 million and counting (about $3 million a year!). Isn’t that crazy?— Trebek has a favorite animal. And it is (drumroll) the MUSKOX. How RANDOM, right? But he describes his great affection for how they are “family oriented” and talks about his years as a devoted activist to the animal.

But as I kept reading (because Kristin Hannah makes that so very easy to do), I eventually found myself sucked into the plot, especially once the Dust Bowl hit. Talk about an absolutely fascinating, gut wrenching time in American history. If you have never seen Ken Burns’ Dust Bowl series, you should. It chronicles the horrors of that particular ecological disaster through the testimonies of the real women, men, and children who lived it, and as I was reading Four Winds, I kept picturing the stark visuals and voice overs from that film. Overall, what I enjoyed best about Four Winds was the empathy I felt for Elsa and the hard decisions she had to make as the mother of two young children. And, ever the softie, I fell hard for the romance that ultimately blossomed between her and Jack. At the end, I felt there were a few too many storylines that got shoehorned into the plot, but I finished this book feeling grateful that our present-day hard times are nowhere near as bad as ones like these that our ancestors lived through. I feel compelled to add that many of the issues explored in this book—labor organizing, xenophobia and economic exploitation among them—are issues that still have their hooks in America today.

Now that I’ve experienced Hilderbrand’s talent, I can attest she’s a master of her genre in the same way Stephen King “owns” horror and Mary Higgins Clark “owns” suspense. From the opening pages, I was swept up in the story of Mallory and Jake, a couple who never get the timing right for a real relationship outside of the Labor Day weekend they spend together every summer at the Nantucket cabin Mallory inherits from her aunt.Normally I’m not one to get behind a plot that involves infidelity. But Hillenbrand makes the set-up for Mallory and Jake’s affair SO convincing that I went along with it, even if many, *many* times I wanted Jake to throw in the towel on his marriage to his wife, Ursla. This book made me fall hard for all of its characters (even the unlikeable ones).

Julia Alvarez’s “Afterlife” is One of the reasons I will always love my book club is because it introduces me to novels I might otherwise never read. Julia Alvarez’s “Afterlife” is one such novel. I’m ashamed to admit I’d never heard of Alvarez before this summer (especially since her prior works are considered classics by many). Within the first 5 pages of her latest novel (her first in 15 years) I knew immediately why she is as beloved as she is. In those pages, Sam, the husband of main character Antonia, dies—but it’s the way Alvarez reveals his death (in a discombobulating but beautiful kind of poetry) that really sunk its hooks into me. I want to say I loved the rest of this novel as much as I did the first few chapters, but after awhile it lost a bit of luster for me. Antonia’s tendency to seek direction from the works of literature she loves (and taught for decades as a professor) was a narrative device that ultimately became overused. And her constant nitpicking with her sisters (while colorful and relatable) grew tiring to me, too. What I *did* love was how Alvarez took one tiny detail she introduced in an early chapter (a sticker affixed to her Subaru, a gift received for having made an annual donation to her local sheriff’s fund) and turned it into a kind of Chekhov’s gun—one that delivered a powerful punch by the novel’s end.Overall, a timely read that explores the topics of loss, family, grief, immigration reform, and what we owe society as “good” citizens of our country.

I wish it had more about and from the cast members who defined the seasons that I recall with great fondness from my junior high/high school/college years (Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Kenan Thompson, Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, and company).

NoWithout question, this book is not just one of the most informative (and transformative) books I will read in 2021, but over the course of my life. Now that I've absorbed the truths that Wilkerson laid out in these pages, I will never be able to think about racism in America in the same way. For, as Wilkerson describes, caste is ""the bones"" and race ""the skin"" in our country's body of discontent. I am in awe of her research and, most especially, her ability to weave disparate ideas (the study of caste systems of India, the Third Reich, and slavery/Jim Crow in the US) into a thoughtful and compelling narrative that reveals the commonalities that existed between these groups all along. Also, I never want to forget that I was reading this on January 6, 2021, when a riot to uphold white supremacy played out within the hallowed halls of our U.S. Capitol. This is what I wrote  about that day—and about this book—on Instagram. What a moment to have Wilkerson's words guiding me through that dark hour in our nation's history. Finally, here are a few passages from the book (my copy has so, so many dog-earred pages) that I don't want to forget: “In our era, it is not enough to be tolerant. You tolerate mosquitoes in the summer, a rattle in an engine, the gray slush that collects at the crosswalk in winter. You tolerate what you would rather not have to deal with and wish would go away. It is no honor to be tolerated. Every spiritual tradition says love your neighbor as yourself, not tolerate them.” “So the real question would be,' he said finally, 'if people were given the choice between democracy and whiteness, how many would choose whiteness?"" (Taylor Branch, quoted in Caste)“Radical empathy, on the other hand, means putting in the work to educate oneself and to listen with a humble heart to understand another's experience from their perspective, not as we imagine we would feel. Radical empathy is not about you and what you think you would do in a situation you have never been in and perhaps never will. It is the kindred connection from a place of deep knowing that opens your spirit to the pain of another as they perceive it.Empathy is no substitute for the experience itself. We don't get to tell a person with a broken leg or a bullet wound that they are not in pain. And people who have hit the caste lottery are not in a position to tell a person who has suffered under the tyranny of caste what is offensive or hurtful or demeaning to those at the bottom. The price of privilege is the moral duty to act when one sees another person treated unfairly. And the least that a person in the dominant caste can do is not make the pain any worse.”...more",Notes are private!,0,14,2,"Dec 26, 2020not set","Jan 16, 2021not set","Aug 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51152447-caste

My curiosity was piqued (because CT excels at being a badass on screen—obviously) and I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this film on Netflix earlier this month. What can I say after watching it and reading the first volume of the comic? Namely that the movie (while hewing close to the source material) is better. Why? Because it takes what’s done well in the comic and ratchets it up ten-fold. Also, the casting is SO superb—the main characters are more diverse (and better looking) than their comic counterparts, as well drawn as they may be.

One night, as I was on Apple Books (my gateway to reading on my phone), I discovered this paranormal romance had made its way onto one such 2020 list tucked away on the app. I chuckled to myself because the title stood out (in tone and genre) from the other books (which included heavy hitters I’d read and/or seen elsewhere). But since “Reborn Yesterday” was only a few bucks and I needed a new book to read on my phone, I thought, “Why not?”Here’s where I admit that circa 2008-09, I happily devoured the glut of vampire fiction that was EVERYWHERE during those days. (I was equal fans of Edward Cullen AND Eric Northman is what I’m saying.) Now, in 2020, here’s where I admit that (much to my surprise), I was, like the Fug Girls, ready for some “hot vampire shenanigans again.” What I liked most about “Reborn Yesterday” is that there was some solid humor baked into the romance of the plot. (In fact, the way in which the MC, Ginny Lynn, meets the very hot and very undead Jonas Cantrell is a great comedic set-up that would make Taiki Waititi and the rest of the vampire gang from “What We Do in the Shadows” proud.)For a large portion of this book, I enjoyed the plot and the development of these characters, but I struggled toward the end.

Still, it was an enjoyable enough read (especially for the $$) that if a TV series was developed, I’d be curious enough to want to see which actors were responsible for bringing Ginny and Jonas to life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 03, 2020","Jul 10, 2020","Jul 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50609790-reborn-yesterday

It’s for this specific reason—and the fact I’m not so far removed from my own days of mothering an infant—that I am so very, very fond of this book (which happens to have been written by an author who is a favorite of mine).In “Friends and Strangers,” Sullivan mines the relationship between the new mom in her story, Elisabeth, and the college-aged caregiver, Sam (who watches her son), to explore a myriad of topics—from class and privilege to womanhood and what it means to come of age in our modern times.I think this novel would make for a tremendous book club selection—so much could be discussed about the way Sullivan compassionately uses her characters to examine complicated facets of life. I especially loved how she made Elisabeth out to be the sort of woman who is not inherently bad, but who has an obvious blind spot to her own wealth—access to money that has made her life immeasurably easier (but also, in terms of her relationship with her father and sister, harder as well). “Friends and Strangers” is not the kind of book that I would recommend to everyone, but if you read the synopsis and/or my or other people’s s and your interest is piqued, I can promise that, in Sullivan’s talented and capable hands, you will not be disappointed with your decision to pick it up. PS — If you get a minute, check out this NPR interview with Sullivan, wherein you learn both the origin for this book and how an interaction in Sullivan’s own life might have influenced what (to me, at least) was its satisfying ending. And speaking of satisfying, this Washington Post  hits the exact right note on how great this novel is, particularly with this parting line: “Once again, Sullivan has shown herself to be one of the wisest and least pretentious chroniclers of modern life.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 07, 2020","Jul 16, 2020","Jul 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48889985-friends-and-strangers

Perhaps what I adored most about this read is knowing that, in the midst of great uncertainty and grief in her life, Gilbert wrote AND researched the hell out of it.

I'd love to sit down with Gilbert and just pick her brain for an hour about all the ways she worked to make this book feel as true to life as possible.)In a time of turmoil in our country, when my head's been full of fear, anxiety, and the hard but necessary homework of reading antiracist texts, slipping into the sparkling and salacious world of ""City of Girls"" felt like the ultimate form of escapism—one I didn't know I needed until this month, when I found myself ever so gratefully immersed in it.

The first one, “My Dungeon Shook,” is a letter to his nephew (that was surely the inspiration for Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me""). The second essay, “Down at the Cross: Letter from a Region in My Mind,” explores Baldwin’s dissolution of faith, his meeting with Elijah Muhammad, and Baldwin's take on why Blacks were historically drawn to the Nation of Islam. I read this book right around the time I watched “I Am Not Your Negro,” and if you’re new to Baldwin, I’ll admit that this documentary is where you want to start. It’s incredible, made all the more special because of how many clips it includes of Baldwin speaking—his intellect on full display, the cadence of his speech fiery, the anger and sorrow in his eyes as electrifying as it is memorable. So yeah, in case it’s not clear, I really, REALLY dig the guy—and I look forward to continuing to read everything he’s ever written. Here are a few passages from “Fire” I don’t want to soon forget:“White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.”“Therefore, whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.”“If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.”“Depressed populations don’t have the time or energy to spare [to read]. The affluent populations, which should have been their help, didn’t, as far as could be discovered, read, either—they merely bought books and devoured them, but not in order to learn: in order to learn new attitudes.”And WOW does this line drive home how current Baldwin’s words and ideals remain:“It demands great force and great cunning continually to assault the might and indifferent fortress of white supremacy, as Negroes in this country have done so long.  It demands great spiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose foot is on your neck, and an even greater miracle of perception and clarity not to teach your child to hate. The Negro boys and girls who are facing mobs today come out of a long line of improbable aristocrats—the only genuine aristocrats this country has produced.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 09, 2020","Jun 19, 2020","Jun 30, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/464260.The_Fire_Next_Time

The book’s three main characters, Ann, Poppy, and Michael, alternate points of view throughout the novel—their complicated dynamics and life-altering secrets acting as the glue that holds this beautifully rendered narrative together.So why is “Second Home” a five-star kind of read for me?

At the same time, she's mourning the recent loss of her mother while juggling two relationships with fellow writers: one with established author Oscar (whose young sons become smitten with her) and the other with Silas, who's closer to her age but distant in ways that make it hard for her to get close to him. Where this book REALLY sunk its teeth into me was in the final chapters, which left me (as someone who dreams of publishing a book one day) with a racing heart and sweaty palms, equal parts thrilled and anxious on Casey's behalf. In the end, W&L proved to be a brilliant novel that, IMO, opened as slowly and as beautifully as a rose in a springtime garden. It's bound to end up on my Top 10 List of Reads for 2020, for sure. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 16, 2020","May 21, 2020","May 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45289222-writers-lovers

Her deadpan humor and confessional approach to writing are on full display once more, polished to the point where I experienced even more laugh-out-loud moments in “Wow” than in “We Are Never Meeting in Real Life.”I think a big reason I loved “Wow” so much is that, having read “Real Life” before it, I knew enough about Irby to feel a personal connection to her life stories as she updated us about the status of her marriage, her relationship with her stepkids, her credit score, her bodily functions, and the evolution of her career from working at an animal hospital to becoming friends and writing partners with the likes of Abbi Jacobson and Lindy West. (Samantha’s essay about how Abbi befriends her, as well as her essay about the summer she spent in LA, writing for the TV adaptation of “Shrill,” were my absolute favorites in “Wow”—mostly because I am a pop culture junkie and so reading about a fellow Midwesterner’s misadventures in Hollywood was extremely my jam.)Overall, I recommend reading Irby if you’ve never given her a try. This interview is a great introduction to how much of an open book she is—not to mention off-the-cuff funny.

From the minute I pressed play, I was sucked into this book, which provides a minute-by-minute account from hundreds of people who were part of this tragic day but also reveals many telling details I never knew about—from the marine evacuation of lower Manhattan to where President Bush went to wait out the attacks to how flight controllers coordinated landing every other plane in the sky.This was an *incredibly* gut-wrenching read. And yet, I found myself making every excuse I could this past week to get back to it. In part because, as Graff writes in an afterword, for too many of us, the events of 9/11 have shifted focus to the geopolitical consequences of that day, from the creation of the TSA to the war in Afghanistan. What has gotten lost along the way are the human stories—the vivid memories of people present at the tragedy, from first responders to officer workers in the towers to government leaders to children recalling their memories of the morning. We like to use the hashtag #NeverForget when we talk about 9/11, and yet, the more time passes, the harder it is for all of us to remember the details of that day. Thanks to the work of Graff and so many other historians, there exists this incredible collection of these personal stories, culled from thousands of oral histories, to make sure that we never do. If you, like me, want to find a small but significant way to honor the victims of this day, I encourage you to pick this book up and press “Play.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 31, 2021","Sep 09, 2021","Mar 04, 2020",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/43821581-the-only-plane-in-the-sky

Here are some names I’ve been called on social media as well as regular media: “Bland,”….""Transparent,” “Powder,” .... “If Milk Became a Person,” “Gay Casper,” ...”If Jizz Became a Person,” …and of course, “The Actual White Devil.”With that passage, Colin had me in stitches by page 3. I love a good celebrity memoir—and a good SNL tie-in—so it’s no surprise that I’m giving Jost’s take on the genre five stars here.I’ll end this  by sharing that Colin and I are only a few months apart in age. As a result, his life timeline (the college years and early 20s, anyway) aligned with mine in a way that made his stories resonate all the more with me. (One in particular that I don’t want to forget, “Why I Love My Mom,” had a 9/11 focus that had me taking a break from the laughter to tear up at the power of Colin’s memories of that harrowing day and the heroism of his mother, a doctor for the NYFD who barely survived the towers collapsing—TWICE.)Overall, I loved discovering Colin’s sharp intellect, his insane work ethic on behalf of SNL, and his remarkable ability to make any story he tells a super funny one. Speaking of, dammit if “The Time Jimmy Buffet Saved My Life” didn’t send me down the rabbit hole of looking up photos of Colin surfing, which led to my realization that, “Welp, I guess I have a huge crush on Colin Jost.” So, thanks “Punchable Face,” for that ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"May 11, 2021not set","May 18, 2021not set","Mar 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48989372-a-very-punchable-face

In the first 50 pages of this book, Coe dives into some solid rhetorical criticism about how Washington and his family have been portrayed by men in previous biographies written about them. I was SO there for that kind of dish and was really captivated by her writing.But within a few chapters, the book settled into a pretty standard biography (albeit a great one at that) and I struggled (ie, started to nod off in bed) a few times while reading it. This was mostly due to the fact there were a lot of 18th century personalities mentioned whose names were immediately forgotten soon after coming across them. Also, whenever Coe included sample text from an article/journal/letter of the period, I had to re-read it because the writing of yore was SO different.I think my greatest takeaways from this book were 1) the attention Coe paid to covering Washington and his treatment/attitude to his slaves and 2) learning specific details about the great rivalries that existed among our Founding Fathers—proof in historical form that this Nation has ALWAYS struggled with a political divide. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 19, 2020","Feb 27, 2020","Feb 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51239966-you-never-forget-your-first

I’ve read almost every one of her YA novelsThere are certain writers whose voice you fall hard for, and Katie Cotugno is one of those writers for me. I’ve read almost every one of her YA novels, and with each one I've found pieces of my teenage self reflected back to me through her characters.It’s impossible to travel back in time and hand a tote filled with Katie’s books over to the version of my 16-year-old self blasting Dave Matthews in her bedroom. So instead, I’ll announce plans to 1) buy them all for my daughter someday and 2) before her, my teenage niece who turns 15 this year. With her newest novel, which releases in June, Katie explores the complicated relationship that springs up between her dual narrators, Meg and Colby.Meg is a proud feminist who’s equal parts cynical and smart. She’s just ended the “perfect” relationship with her boyfriend. She’s still coming to terms with her parents’ divorce and, now, the fact her mother might be an alcoholic as her father moves on with his new family. With all that she’s got going on, Meg still finds time to excel at her job, working for a nonpartisan non-profit where she spends her nights calling people, helping them register to vote.It’s during one of these phone calls from her cubicle in Pennsylvania that Meg “meets” Colby, a surly, hot loner type living in a small town in Ohio, working long hours at the Home Depot, trying not to open his own Pandora’s box of family woes.I won’t give away what happens between these two, but I will say I 100 percent loved this book’s ending. I especially loved how real Meg and Colby felt to me. Their late-night phone calls took me back (in ways good and bad) to a particular long-distance high school relationship of my own. Maybe that’s why I’m always gonna recommend Katie’s books to people, regardless of whether they’re 16 or 36. Because every now and then, it feels good to remember the messy, complicated nature of young love. And when I’m reliving that kind of love in a world created by Katie Cotugno, I’m never disappointed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 10, 2020","Jan 23, 2020","Feb 18, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/45306303-you-say-it-first

Within the first few chapters, I knew I was in the hands of an author who, stylistically, I could envision myself being BFFs with IRL. What do I mean by that? Well, the fact that Kate is clearly a pop culture junkie, as evident in her writing. The fast-paced banter between her characters gave me serious Amy Sherman-Palladino vibes, and I loved getting to know Tuesday, her BFF, Dex, and the rest of the novel's eccentric and well-drawn cast.The only reason I'm not giving this book five stars is because I have to admit, around the midway point, the plot sagged a bit for me. Honestly, I can't even put my finger on why that is, exactly? Just that, when I picked it up at night to read before bed, I wasn't as enthusiastic for awhile there as I had been when I first dove in. I'm grateful I had an hour stretch to tear through the last 100 pages, which were as wholly satisfying as the first. For that reason, I would highly recommend this engaging read. It's a mystery at heart, but in the end, the plot isn't as important as the growth of the richly drawn characters Kate introduces us to along the way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 23, 2020","Mar 06, 2020","Jan 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42478640-tuesday-mooney-talks-to-ghosts

It took a while for my copy to be made available (and wasn't the best timing of reads), but I found it to be a fast listen, and I liked how Rodsky talked in specifics (and gave acronyms to) a lot of the elements related to domestic responsibilities that cause problems among couples. (For example, she points out that ""CPE""—conceiving, planning, and executing—of a task needs to be owned by ONE person, and that it's this breakdown——wherein, say, one partner may conceive and plan a grocery list, and the other executes, leading the person who does the last step to think he/she has 'done it all'—— to be especially problematic in the division of household labor in the house. (Namely, that women are FAR more likely to do the C and the P, which takes a lot of mental work, with men occasionally helping with E and thinking, ""Look at what I did for the family!,"" if that makes sense.) I've already talked to my husband about the book, and I'd be interested in ""playing the game"" within the Werner house (and he seems amenable to giving it a try), because, while he is better than a lot of men in contributing to division of labor in our home, there are still tasks that—if we could provide definition to who is holding the card in any given week, as Eve would say—we could eliminate the tendency to nag one another about when one of us forgets to do it, or to allow RATS to crop up on us (randomly assigned tasks), which can be equally frustrating and argument-inducing. The elements I took objection to in the book are covered in other s here on GoodReads, but I'll add that Eve's term ""unicorn space"" (to define the time partners gift one another to chase their passions) nearly drove me up the wall!

But whereas ""Crawdads"" is more coming-of-age, ""Giver"" examines the lives of five women (two mostly) settled into adulthood and struggling with the more mature themes of marriage and motherhood. For this reason, I think I liked ""Giver"" more. (Of course, this also has a LOT to do with the fact this book fictionalizes the stories of real women who stepped up in a badass way to deliver books to the hill folks of eastern Kentucky. Horse-riding librarians! Truly! How incredible is that?!)

The implication, of course, being that Weinstein was such a despicable human being who harassed, abused, and raped SO many women, that MULTIPLE reporters chasing him from multiple publications still couldn’t keep up with unspooling the tangled ball of his deplorable acts. (Also, SHOCK when I looked up Ronan’s age, expecting him to be pushing 40, and discovered that he is THIRTY-TWO, with the resume of a child prodigy.) ANGER at how many times Ronan was told “No” by NBC News when he tried to push to break this story for the network (which he worked for at the time) in the first half of 2018. Couple this with Farrow’s reporting on Trump, Weinstein, and American Media, Inc., and I was borderline rage-y by the end of this book.DISGUST at what a pig Matt Lauer was and (likely) still is. Same goes for too many heads at that network who tolerated a culture that mistreated women for far too long. I told my husband after finishing this, “If you ever turn the news to NBC, I will turn it off immediately.”FASCINATION with how Farrow incorporated bits and pieces of his personal life—namely his relationships with his sister, Dylan, herself an abuse victim, and his fiancé, the podcaster and speechwriter, Jon Lovett—into this story. I especially lived for the moments when he’d write about talking through his next steps in reporting with Jon, whose wry sense of humor shone through every time Ronan included him in the book.And, lastly, RESPECT, which is my attitude regarding most journalists, but especially those whose work made for some of the most captivating stories of 2018.I’ll end this  by adding that “Catch and Kill” was the best audiobook I’ve read since Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime” in 2017.

To illustrate, here’s a sampling of the delightfully weird yet wonderful questions he poses in this great coffee table book-kind-of-read:• Is this movie better, the same, or worse with The Rock in it?  (This chapter I had to read out loud to my husband…. by the end of it, I was laughing SO hard I actually couldn’t breath.)• Did the Rockford Peaches make the right decision trading kit?

(When DOESN’T Michael BAE Jordan do this?)• When was Diane Keaton the most charming in Something’s Gotta Give?  (Not Shea’s answer, but my own: Every. damn. scene. she’s. in. )Lastly, the one that I’m STILL chuckling over: “What happened at the Michael Myers press conference?”This book (with BRILLIANT illustrations by Arturo Torres) is the ideal gift to give that extra cool someone in your life (you know, the person so cool you never know what to buy him or her).

Victims do not have the time for this. Victims are also students, teachers, parents, who can’t give up work or education … It is not reasonable to casually demand that victims put aside their lives to spend more time pursuing something they never asked for in the first place. This is not about the victims’ lack of effort. This is about society’s failure to have systems in place in which victims feel there’s a probable chance of achieving safety, justice, and restoration … The real question we need to be asking is not, ‘Why didn’t she report?’ but ‘Why would you?’...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 07, 2019","Oct 12, 2019","Sep 29, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/50196744-know-my-name

I'm so glad I clicked ""Buy,"" as I found this memoir to be a profoundly moving read.I lost my maternal grandmother to Alzheimer's when I was 16, and I can remember vividly the toll her decline took on her caregivers, especially my mother. Dementia is the cruelest of conditions, and KWP doesn't shy away from describing in detail how painful it was for her, her siblings, and her father (bless that man!) to watch a woman as brilliant as Linda Williams (who, at the time of her diagnosis, was raising millions for the Michael J. Fox Foundation) succumb to the disease. And yet, I greatly admired KWP's retelling of this difficult time in the life of her family. It reminded me that the people we think have it all together—the ones who look so beautiful in movies and on the pages of glossy magazines—have their own crosses to bear outside of the celebrity spotlight.As difficult as it was to read about Linda's condition, there were plenty of light moments to leaven this read. I especially loved learning about how Kim got cast in ""Father of the Bride"" and how she met and fell for her hubby, the country singer Brad Paisley. But what I will carry away from this well-written memoir—and why I will buy future copies for the people I love whose life is touched by Alzheimer's—is to pass along the valuable lessons KWP shares with others forced to confront this disease head-on. Those lessons include a helpful resources guide and FAQ that includes KWP's advice that anyone diagnosed with dementia create a personal note while they still are able, detailing how they want to be cared for as their disease progresses. Her mother never took the time to do so, a fact that complicated her family's decision-making about her care in the years that followed. KWP shares her own example, and the power of this note serving as the final sentences of this memoir cannot be overstated. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 29, 2019",Oct 2019,"Sep 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25852857-where-the-light-gets-in

As the linked post details, part of that cinematic adventure entailed a lot of YouTube rabbit holing. One of those YouTube binges brought me to Amanda's interview of Keanu in the early '90s for the UK program, ""The Word."" As it turns out, Amanda (the UK '80s-It-Girl who married John Taylor from Duran Duran) has enjoyed a years-long friendship with Keanu (that, at one time, turned romantic). She speaks lovingly about that friendship in ""It's Messy,"" a book that was such an enjoyable experience to listen to, I was sad to finish it (especially since Amanda's voice in my ear felt like it belonged to a wise older sister that commands your respect with her wit, humor, and no-nonsense advice giving).The more I've read about Amanda, both in her book and online, the more I've come to admire her. Namely because her interests are my interests: I'm a journalist turned photographer who LOVES interviewing people, so it makes sense that Amanda's professional arc from ""The Word"" to fashion photographer to originator of the awesome series ""Conversations"" would be catnip for me.What I loved most about ""It's Messy"" is that it's a collection of essays that found me at the right age, at the right time. Amanda's musings about men, sex, friendships, and, most especially, motherhood, all resonated deeply with me. The fact she dished about the ups and downs of her life while keeping the narrative focused on the feminist lessons she's learned along the way has made her a woman in pop culture I intend to keep my eye on. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 28, 2019","Sep 30, 2019","Sep 29, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/28693713-it-s-messy

Introducing an eating disorder on top of a bonkers plot was so unnecessary to this narrative. Every time Amy (our MC) started stuffing her face with food (in one scene, she jams handfuls of meatloaf and mashed potatoes into her mouth, not even bothering with a fork or spoon) I was yanked out of the narrative in such a jarring way I couldn't help but wonder if Jackson was battling her own demons through the unhealthy choices of her narrator. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 03, 2019","Sep 17, 2019","Sep 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36679186-never-have-i-ever

With ""Such a Fun Age,"" ReidEntertainment Weekly was spot-on when it wrote that Kiley Reid had written ""the most provocative page-turner of the year."" With ""Such a Fun Age,"" Reid immerses her readers in the transactional relationship of Alix and Emira.Alix is a Waspy 30-something who's shot to modest fame with her online brand as a feminist cheerleader (a brand that, over the course of her novel, Reid calls into question as a disingenuous, navel-gazing charade). With Alix, Reid simultaneously skewers ""influencer"" culture while creating the best mean girl character since Regina George. (And yet, the fact that, as Tina did with Regina, we still find ways to empathize with Alix speaks volumes about Reid's impressive talent.)Emira happens to be the young black woman babysitting Alix's precocious toddler, Briar. As a recent college graduate, Emira's struggling to define her career aspirations, trying not to begrudge her girlfriends whose professional lives are taking off in a way that's leaving her—and her IKEA furniture—behind. For now, she's content to keep watching Briar, a child she suspects she loves in a deeper way than the woman who's paying her in cash every week to help raise her.The opening chapter of the book finds Emira at a grocery store with Briar, being interrogated by a security guard and a white shopper who fears Emira's kidnapped this white child. It is the kind of aggravating racial aggression experienced on the daily by (too) many black people, and Reid makes the scene feel as real as if you were watching it play out on your television. (Speaking of, I cannot wait to see how Lena Waithe adapts this story from page to screen.) The chapters that follow track what happens after this frustrating night, chronicling the aftereffects of the incident on Alix, on Emira, and on Kelly, the white customer who becomes Emira's boyfriend soon after he sends her the video he recorded on his phone of the charged encounter.The way the lives of these characters intersect is as surprising as it is surreal. I was more than happy to accept a (fairly major) coincidence Reid worked into her plot for the resulting pay-off of discovering what she had in store for each of them by the end of the book.I'll end this  by saying that ""Such a Fun Age"" is the most ""now"" novel I've read in ... well, ages. In all her young wisdom, Reid has captured in her writing a kind of self-reflection (about race and class and privilege and popularity) that defines a lot of the fears and frustrations of our modern age.

(In a world where fact meets fiction, he and Elizabeth Gilbert meet at a bar in Morocco and hit it off swimmingly.) On one hand, it's hard for me to believe a book like this one can win the Pulitzer in 2018. On the other, maybe those judges were, like me, worn down and eventually charmed by Paul-as-Arthur's pratfalls—not to mention an ending that pulls off the sweetest of narrative surprises.A book I'd recommend to some, but certainly not all of my friends. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 13, 2019","Aug 28, 2019","Aug 23, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39927096-less

But I can already tell that this is the one I’ll most want to press into other people's hands. Why? I think it’s because of how Kendi approaches the subject material, blending the personal with the intellectual in a way that commands attention and respect. As the New York Times puts it, “Instead of focusing on our racist ideas, Kendi offers up a wrenching examination of the evolution of his.”It’s very powerful to realize that ANYONE can be racist. And in striving to push people to become antiracists, Kendi leads by example. Each chapter of his book explores various topics (from Ethnicity and Color to Body and Culture) in tandem with the ways in which his life experiences shaped the stereotypes he absorbed (which informed the creation of his own prejudices). The writing of this book leans academic (which makes sense, given Kendi is a college professor), but it's worth persevering through the occasional complex passage to absorb the book's biggest takeaways (and to make it to an ending that shocks as much as it reveals about Kendi’s health and fortitude). I think I underlined passages on every page of this book. In ing them now, here are a few that I don’t want to forget any time soon in my own journey to become an antiracist:“Racist ideas make people of color think less of themselves, which makes them more vulnerable to racist ideas. Racist ideas make White people think more of themselves, which further attracts them to racist ideas.”“This is the most consistent function of racist ideas—and of any kind of bigotry more broadly: to manipulate us into seeing people as the problem, instead of the policies that ensnare them.”“One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an anti-racist.” “The history of the racialized world is a three-way fight between assimilationists, segregationists, and antiracists” (This theory, found on page 31, which Kendi incorporates throughout the novel, was a MAJOR lightbulb moment for me in terms of contextualizing racism in a way I'd never considered before). As an example (from page 80): “Segregationists who consider Black neighborhoods to be war zones have called for tough policing and the mass incarceration of super-predators. Assimilationists say these super-predators need tough laws and tough love to civilize them back to nonviolence. Antiracists say Black people, like all people, need more higher-paying jobs within reach, especially Black youngsters, who have consistently had the highest rates of unemployment of any demographic group, topping 50 percent in the mid-90s.” “The problem of race has always been at its core the problem of power, not the problem of immorality or ignorance.” “The history of racist ideas is the history of powerful policymakers erecting racist policies out of self-interest, then producing racist ideas to defend and rationalize the inequitable effects of their policies, while everyday people consume those racist ideas, which in turn sparks ignorance and hate.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 12, 2020","Jun 20, 2020","Aug 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist

And I was deeply rooting for Cora and Caesar as they made their break from Georgia and established themselves in South Carolina (where the government set-up gave them at least a semblance of freedom...not that it was really that at all).But it was after this—when all hell broke loose and Cora wound up in North Carolina—where this book took an eerie turn that sent actual chills down my spine.Any slave narrative is going to be a challenge to read. But in this alternative narrative, one in which each state adopts its own approach to handling slavery, the picture Whitehead paints of what's happening in North Carolina sat with me in a way so wrong, I couldn't shake it. Because in North Carolina, runaway slaves like Cora are violently executed and then STRUNG UP ALONG THE ROAD FOR MILES AND MILES, WHERE THEY REMAIN FOREVER FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.The knowledge that those bodies went on for miles, never to be taken down ... I just... I couldn't. After reading this, I continued to plod along, but my heart was largely stripped from the story (mostly out of shock). Still, I hung in there for a conclusion that was far more optimistic for Cora than I'd been expecting (especially after that harrowing scene!) Also, I did appreciate Whitehead's decision in the end to share with us what happened to Mabel...I'd been wondering!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 31, 2019","Aug 09, 2019","Jul 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

Needless to say, I love the new Queer Eye crew—Tan France especially. When I saw he'd released a book, I was intrigued.

(The book also features lovely illustrations created by Tan's talented—and equally fetching—husband, Rob Frances; I found this knowledge to be quite endearing.)

The narrative is written as a letter to Little Dog's mother, recounting traumatic snippets of their immigrant experience. These vignettes include stories about the beatings he took at the hands of his shell-shocked mother, the sadness he felt watching her endure a debilitating career as a nail technician, and his grandmother’s haunting memories of the Vietnam War—all told alongside Little Dog’s memories of his sexual awakening as a young gay man. There were SO many lines of beauty in this book, which blossomed not only because of Vuong’s talents as a wordsmith, but because of his fascination with linguistics. (“It’s not fair that the word laughter is trapped inside slaughter,” is one such line that comes to mind.)As hard as this book was to read, I am grateful I did so, as Ocean is clearly one of the most talented writers being published today. Expect great things to continue to come from him. And I’ll put a twenty down now on this book winning the National Book Award for 2019. What say you?

This one? TWENTY-THREE HOURS. Reaching the final chapter of this novel felt like the literary equivalent of finishing a marathon, but one I’m better for having completed. In his  of this “tree mad” novel, Nathaniel Rich writes for The Atlantic that Richard Powers has “the courage and intellectual stamina to explore our most complex social questions” … including “the destruction of the natural conditions necessary for our own survival.” I felt that sentiment over and over again during the course of listening to this epic work of environmental fiction. What made “The Overstory” so smart and so special wasn’t just Powers’ exceptional writing (certain lines felt like poetry, reminding me of my experience reading “All the Light We Cannot See,” another Pulitzer winner I listened to a few years back) but the rich payoff of discovering how the lives of this book’s nine major characters were all interconnected.Sometimes I think certain novels find us right when we need them most, and that’s the case with “The Overstory” for me. From the minute I hit play, listening to Toren’s calm voice narrate this story soothed me at a time when a global pandemic has left my nerves otherwise frayed.And what a serendipitous blessing it was to listen to this novel while swinging on warm spring and summer nights in my backyard hammock, eyes trained to the sky, watching the soaring branches of my neighbor’s oaks sway in a magical way that felt like the perfect visual accompaniment to a novel devoted to a trees’-eye view of our planet.With every walk I’ve taken in recent weeks, I’ve found myself looking up at the trees with more wonderment than ever before. Thanks to this big, beautiful book (a “gigantic fable of genuine truths,” as Barb Kingsolver so deftly described it), I hope that feeling doesn’t fade any time soon.

I’m still wrestling, and like Jacob, I will wrestle until I am blessed. God hasn’t let go of me yet.”— “What I love about the Bible is that the story isn’t over.

(Not to mention multiple times I thought, “Wait a minute, I KNOW people from Spencerville…not everyone hates this little town! Not everyone is this much of a loser/fuck up/parasite on the world!”)Therein lies my problem with certain authors of Midwestern lit. It’s why I’ll favor a writer like Nickolas Butler or J. Ryan Stradal over someone like Deborah Kennedy. At least Nick and Ryan know that, amidst the struggles of any Midwestern town, there are rays of hope and good reasons why people stick around. Communities that come together to support one another in ways big and small.I wanted to see more of THAT flavor of a small town represented here—even if it was just a sliver of security and purpose from ONE character—but instead, what Kennedy's readers get is a portrayal of a backwater Hoosier town, a portrayal that too often is the ONLY version of Indiana (or most Midwestern towns) that anyone gets.Add to this disgruntlement my frustration with keeping track of all the characters in this book, and we have a read that clearly wasn’t my cup of tea.BUT, this book IS beautifully written (which is why I kept reading; see also, I always finish a book club pick), and I understand that my visceral reaction to it is weighed HEAVILY by the fact I’m from the area where the book is set, so, I can see why others would like it far more than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 25, 2019","Jul 11, 2019","May 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30360168-tornado-weather

My attempts to capture some of the highlights are below:[A conversation about whether we can still like the work of artists like Woody Allen and Michael Jackson and Bill Cosby...this caught my attention only because it provided me with a term for these jerks now]: ""Take a quick dip into any one of the thousands of years of art history and you'll find that plenty of great art was made by jerks, creeps, assholes, vampires, perverts, and worse, all of whom left a trail of victims in their wake.  To steal a term from Jenny Offill's Dept. of Speculation, these people are what we call ""Art Monsters."" [About why you still get up and do the work]: ""You start each work not knowing exactly where you're going or where you'll end up. 'Art is the highest form of hope,' said painter Gerhard Richter.""[Creativity vs productivity....and I agree wholeheartedly with this statement]: ""It's always a mistake to equate productivity and creativity. They are not the same. In fact, they are frequently at odds with each other: You're often most creative when you're the least productive."" [On persevering as an artist]: ""Try your best to fill your days in ways that get you a little closer to where you want to be. Go easy on yourself and take your time. Worry less about getting things done. Worry more about things worth doing. Worry less about being a great artist. Worry more about being a good human being who makes art.""And a great checklist that captures some of the ways to get yourself unstuck as an artist: (1) switch your phone to airplane mode (2) draw up some lists (3) have a child teach you how to play (4) make a gift for someone (5) tidy up (6) lie down for a nap (7) take a long walk ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 20, 2019","Jul 31, 2019","May 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40591677-keep-going

""The Great Alone"" takes some seriously dark turns (and about three quarters of the way through, the melodrama *really* gets ratcheted up .... to an almost eye-rolling degree), and yet I always hated to pull myself away from the characters and the evocative imagery of the rugged Alaskan setting every time I set the book down.

The trip did not disappoint, and it opened a new world of discovery for me about an artist whose music I’d always enjoyed, but now have a deeper affinity for after visiting his home. (I went so far as to start my record collection while at Graceland, picking up Elvis's first (and arguably best) album there). And curious reader that I am, there was no way I was leaving the place without snatching up SOME book about The King. I could have nabbed one of the many biographies that were everywhere in the gift shops, but instead, I was compelled to pick up this memoir written by his wife, Priscilla. In part, it caught my attention for the cheese factor alone (that cover! the back jacket photo of Priscilla with her 1985 Dynasty hair!) but after the first 50 pages, I got so engrossed in her and Elvis’s love story, I couldn’t put it down! My only regret? Wishing I could have read it poolside because it is the quintessential vacation read—a dishy, dramatic tell-all that reads like fiction (and cost only $8 so if it gets wet, who cares?)Here’s a related side hop down memory lane: After I started reading this, I had a flashback to being a kid, remembering watching a TV movie about Elvis and Priscilla on a tiny television set in my parents’ bedroom. Turns out that movie was inspired by this very book, and it premiered in 1988—which meant I would have been a 6 year old with no business watching it! Needless to say, I HAD to look the movie up and was delighted to rediscover it in its entirety on YouTube. Cheesy? Without question.

I HAD to because, with just a small glimpse into Evvie Drake’s world (as created by the remarkably talented Linda Holmes, host of my favorite podcast, NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour), I knew didn’t want to leave. “Evie Drake Starts Over” is a SUPER smart rom-com about Evvie, whose husband dies, leaving her upset NOT because she’s a grieving widow, but because, on the day of his death, she's getting ready to leave him. This rom-edy(?) (this story is WAY more dramatic than a typical rom-com) set up then involves Evvie renting out an apartment in her home to the best friend of her best friend, Andy. Andy’s best friend happens to be Dean (ho hey! You KNOW I love that name), a Yankees pitcher with a case of the yips. Together, Evvie and Dean begin the hard work of healing each other’s hurts, one broken piece of dishware and one errant pitch at a time.

I read it on my phone, and at a certain point, I realized I was highlighting words on every page. Here were a few that struck out to me especially:• Once we belong thoroughly to ourselves and believe thoroughly in ourselves, true belonging is ours. Belonging to ourselves means being called to stand alone—to brave the wilderness of uncertainty, vulnerability, and criticism.• Belonging so fully to yourself that you’re willing to stand alone IS a wilderness—an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. • True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to *be* who you are.

Over the past few months, this friend and I have been texting like crazy as we’ve cheered for “Mayor Pete” in his rise leading up to his run for President of the United States.It’s far too early in the campaign slog to determine how Pete will fare come 2020, but I cannot deny that I am deeply impressed by this man: a fellow Hoosier who’s brilliant, modest, and committed to restoring hope in the heartland—a heartland too many coastal elite are too quick to write off as some kind of post-industrial, conservative wasteland. Pete’s memoir is a well-written, revealing look into the life of a quiet academic, an aspiring politician, a well-respected mayor, and a 30-something grappling to accept his sexuality. (His chapters about meeting and falling for Chasten, his husband, brought tears to my eyes, particularly because, in the audio version of the book, Pete himself becomes emotional as he tells their story). Above all else, Pete Buttigieg appeals to me as a person and as a politician because his outlook on the world resonates deeply with me. He is only a few weeks older than I am—a fellow millennial whose optimistic take on change is one I wholeheartedly endorse. For these reasons and more, I have found his call for generational leadership change and his aspirations to usher in a new era in politics inspiring in the best, breath-of-fresh-air kind of way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 19, 2019","Apr 20, 2019","Mar 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40180047-shortest-way-home

Hers was truly an EXTRAORDINARY life, and I came to view Lee Miller as an American badass. I still feel that way about her, which is why, when I heard about Whitney Scharer's “The Age of Light”, I had to pick up this new read. The book is a fictionalized dramatization of Lee’s life in Paris and her love affair with her mentor, Man Ray. It’s a powerful story about one of the most fascinating women of the 20th century—a woman who is SCREAMING to have a biopic made about her (come on Hollywood, get on it and resurrect that Kate Winslet project, please!)Reading Whitney’s debut sent me down a rabbit hole of looking up Lee’s work and falling for it (and her) all over again.

I'm glad I did, because this read is such an inspiring glimpse into the mind of a musical genius.

Reading about creatives always sparks my own creativity, and this emotional read did exactly that for me.

Too often, these books get poo-pooed for not being serious enough or having pink covers or script-y fonts.But here’s why Ms. Reid is a queen of women’s fiction: She writes stories about real women, leading ordinary lives, in a way that elevates the genre. In the instance of “After I Do,” the book centers on a couple who takes a year-long break from their marriage. Not divorced, but separated—and MULTIPLE times I found myself wishing I could press this book into the hands of every person in my life who’s ever complained to me about her marriage.It has such lovely gems of truth, particularly for readers who, in their own life circumstances, may want to save a sinking relationship. The characters are well-rounded and entertaining (I loved the grandmother especially), and it’s the perfect read for when you want something light enough to lift you up, but serious enough to make you appreciate the universality of its truths. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 17, 2019","Jan 28, 2019","Jan 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18775359-after-i-do

She did SUCH a wonderful job with this audiobook, delivering nuanced performances for each of its major players. (The voice of Lisa's mother was especially distinct). Her narration was reason alone to keep me reading.Of course, so was this powerful coming-of-age story, one that centers on the fragile relationship author Lisa Brennan-Jobs had with her father, the creative genius Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. At best, Lisa remembers Jobs (who at first denied paternity of her, until he was sued by Lisa's mother for child support) as awkwardly warm, with Steve trying be an engaged father but never quite getting there with the many off-color comments he'd make in her presence. (Asking her once, in front of her stepmother, if she masturbated is one example.) At worst, Steve could be an outright dick—unapologetically mean to Lisa or to anyone else in his path of disapproval, be it a waiter, employee, or fellow family member. I've read plenty of memoirs, and I can't recall any that left me feeling as hollowed out as this one did. Maybe that's because I didn't really know how casually cruel Jobs could be in his day-to-day life. But also because, as Katy Waldman described in her 2018 New Yorker  of the book: ""[Lisa's] memoir elicits little sympathy for [Jobs], and “Small Fry,” a book of no small literary skill, is confused and conflicted, angry and desperate to forgive. Its central, compelling puzzle is Brennan-Jobs’s continuing need to justify not just her father’s behavior but her longing for his love. It is a mesmerizing, discomfiting reading.""Discomfiting is a PERFECT way to describe how I felt reading this book. Even with that discomfort level factored in, I'd still recommend this read. For me, it was a fascinating exploration of how all the money, prestige, and accomplishments in the world can't make a person truly happy.

And yet, for me it fell short (as it did for several of my girlfriends who put it down!)The characters in ""The Alice Network"" felt enough like caricatures that I could never quite fall for them (in particular the antagonist, René, who was SO over the top all he was missing was a mustache to twirl, a la a Disney villain).Admittedly, I stuck around because I was smitten with Finn (the Scottish driver), but I found myself struggling to like Charlie St. Cloud (the protagonist in the post-WWII-era story). This was mostly due to the fact the author INSISTED on summarizing her thoughts in math equations (ie, ""She had taken the hopeless mess around her, pared away the meaningless variables, the Ys and Zs that didn't matter, solved for x."") UGGGHHHH. These equations tied back to Charlie's interest in math, which we learned about early in the narrative, but considering there were about 20 of them sprinkled throughout the book, they drove me mad after awhile.Lastly, on a related note, this book could have benefited from the heavier hand of an editor who might have whittled it down at least 50-75 pages.

I didn't always agree with the parent's decision-making (that cross-country move was a doozie!) but I respected the care and thought that went into everything they did. I also loved how funny and warm the author made these characters—they came to life on the page, in particular Penn and Rosie's marriage. Lastly, because I always read Acknowledgements and Author's Notes, I loved what Laurie had to say about writing a novel (which refers to the idea that this book is based on her child's trans journey): ""Writing a novel is like making a soup. The base is a broth we make up wholesale—for instance, I have one child, not five, and am not only not a doctor, but, in fact, am made woozy by paper cuts. Then, to that entirely made-up broth, we add a sprinkling of research, some chunks of childhood memories, a handful of sauteed morsels overheard at the playground, a few diced bits we weren't planning on but turned out to need for depth of flavor, and some finely chopped pieces of our own lives.

But tucked in between chapters about the fire is an historical accounting of libraries across America—with a few tangential chapters on arson, the history of book burning (the pages about the Nazis made me shudder) and a few snapshots of what it's like to work as a librarian today. (I was especially amused by a scene during which Orlean 'shadows' the reference desk of the Central Library for a day—the questions people asked of them are absurd!) Orlean also mines the concerns of today's librarians in a way that makes you empathize with them, from how they must keep pace with technology to how they are expected to best serve the homeless, men and women who deserve to be in the library as much as the next person, but who often tax the library's resources by making the stacks and reading rooms a second kind of home. This is the perfect book for someone who is a) a history junkie b) a book junkie and/or c) grew up spending almost as much time at the library as he/she did at home. In summary, it was a book that was right up my alley, one that had me Googling aplenty afterward, looking for pictures of the library, reading profiles about the author, and looking up stories about Harry Peak, the man who was arrested but never indicted for starting the '86 fire. More often than not, these are the kinds of books that stay with me the longest after reading them, and I'm sure ""The Library Book"" will be no different. My only caveat: I listened to this as an audiobook, and while the author does a nice job reading it, I had a hard time keeping track of certain names (like the FASCINATING American figure of Charles Fletcher Lummis, who plays a central role in the history of the Central Library) and certain narrative elements as the weeks flew past. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 20, 2019","Dec 14, 2019","Dec 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39507318-the-library-book

Then today, I found a dozen little moments to keep at it—turning pages as I browned meat for our lasagna dinner, sneaking in another chapter as Audrey stirred from her nap—so that I could finish it, spellbound by its suspense-driven ending. I had wondered if the hype on this one was overblown, but nope, it's as good as everyone told me it would be. Now I can't wait to discuss it in a few short weeks at the next meeting of my book club.

This is a multi-generational story that features three sisters, all of whose backstories and subplots come together in a way that makes you want to keep reading. Some of the writing was lyrical enough to make me stop and savor it, which is always a plus.If I had any critique, it’s in the way this book was marketed. It’s billed as “The Mothers” meets “An American Marriage” and….well, I’ve read both of those wonderful novels and I just don’t see it. If you want to go there because this novel—like those—delves into the lives of African American characters, sure. Maybe I’ll let you pass on the “American Marriage” comparison because one of the sisters, Althea, is, like Roy, incarcerated. But her crime doesn’t read nearly as serious as his, nor is there any question she's the one at fault. I found myself frustrated by the comparisons because, in making them, I felt like they took away from the pleasure of this story’s ability to stand on its own.

Much like my first go at it, I devoured it in 2 days ... remembering all the while just how GREAT its premise was. I also binged the first three episodes of the miniseries after they dropped Friday night and man oh man do I love this cast. If I (as a devoted fan) have a hard time comprehending just how surreal it is to listen to (really great!) music created by fictional characters made real, well ... I can't imagine how surreal it must be for Taylor Jenkins Reid, who calls this book her ""baby"" and this TV adaptation her ""grandchild."" I cannot wait to keep watching as Amazon releases more of the 10-episode series on a weekly basis. Original  (December 2018-January 2019): I picked a hell of a good book to start off my stack of 2019 reads. I’m a super fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid and her latest, “Daisy Jones and The Six” was THE book I was most looking forward to reading this year. I was lucky enough to snag an advance copy (the book releases in March) and I tore through it in two days. It’s a mind-blowing read on multiple levels: 1) the concept—a ‘tell-all” memoir of a ‘70s-era rock band, is revealed in an oral history so original, it’s unlike anything I’ve ever read 2) as is true of most TJR books, there’s a fantastic narrative twist you don’t see coming 3) by the end of the book you're so convinced that this is a REAL band, that you will long to find their No. 1 album “Aurora” online, just so you can hear Daisy and lead singer, Billy Dunne, duet together but 4) since that’s impossible, TJR has done something that's off-the-wall incredible—she’s WRITTEN THE ENTIRE ALBUM, the lyrics of which are included at the back of the novel. The creativity it takes to pull off a feat like this is extraordinary. If you are a fan of rock ’n’ roll, love the film “Almost Famous” or have made a resolution in the new year to read more “good” books, stop what you’re doing and pre-order “Daisy Jones” right now....more",Notes are private!,0,16,3,"Mar 03, 2023Dec 31, 2018not set","Mar 06, 2023Jan 2019not set","Oct 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six

One that was written by a 27-year-old, Irish-born literary phenom who’s been hailed as the ‘Salinger of the Snapchat generation’? Ummm …. how about an honest admission that I didn’t LOVE this book the way I expected I would. I was lucky to get my hands on an ARC (it releases stateside in April), and while I found plenty of passages where Rooney’s exceptional writing was on full display, I also felt like I was picking up a heavy weight every time I plucked this read from my nightstand. That has mostly to do with the book’s main characters, Marianne and Connell. Over the course of “Normal People,” we follow them from high school into college and beyond, observing the ways they come together as sexual partners, as friends, as occasional frenemies. One  I read of “Normal People” professed the writer’s belief that Rooney had convincingly captured what it meant to be young today: often overeducated, neurotic, and slightly too self-aware. This I can see, but the truth of it depresses the hell out of me. Namely because this book was exhausting, both in terms of its realness and the emotional complexities of its characters. If it makes any sense, I was glad I read it, and yet grateful to come to its final page. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 03, 2019","Jan 14, 2019","Sep 20, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41057294-normal-people

Because it affirmed what I assumed to be true: That Jules Moulin (a writer for TV and films) wrote ""Ally Hughes"" as her ""midlife fantasy on paper.""This book certainly reads as such—a dual narrative centered on the life of serially single Ally Hughes both in the past and the present. In the past (10 years ago), she hooks up on the last day of the semester with one of her seniors at Brown (where she is a professor). That student, Jake Bean, is where the fantasy comes into play: He's handsome in a blue-collar kind of way, handy (Ally hires him to fix a bunch of stuff around her house), a fan of feminist theory, and charming as all get out. In the present narrative, Ally meets Jake again—only this time, he's the famous actor ""Noah Bean"" (picture a Chris Evans or Chris Pratt kind of hunky-every man-turned-Hollywood-leading-man star). As a lover of pop culture, I was down for this storyline, which basically read like a movie script. Admittedly, the plot meanders into weird territory. (Ally's daughter, who meets Noah because she is cast in a movie he's starring in, gets involved in a weird Internet sex scam, and Ally's friend, Teddy, is just plain awful). But what saved it for me was whip smart, fun dialogue and, of course, my own midlife fantasy crush on Jake Bean. A sampling of dialogue that made me LOL:Ally shrugged. ""I don't know, Jake. What do I know? Look at my life.""Jake smiled. ""Listen, you fold your towels in thirds. That's class. We fold our towels in half at our house. Your'e doing great.""Ally laughed and studied him.Also, I loved this passage (please note that Jake takes the initiative to make the bed here...he really is a fantasy on paper!!! Ha!):""It's a beautiful day."" He turned and started to straighten the bed. ""You don't have to—"" She crossed to him.""Yes, I do."" She joined him and they pulled up the top sheet together, then the blanket. Jake began to tuck them in.Ally then stopped. She was struck by how easy it was to make a bed with someone else. It's a two-person job, a bed. It's a two-person job, this life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 16, 2018",Sep 2018,"Aug 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27192733-ally-hughes-has-sex-sometimes

Both of them—Richard, the pianist with ALS; Karina, his ex-wife who isn’t over his cheating but grudgingly cares for him—were so stubborn and narcissistic in their own ways that it made their bullheadedness nearly unforgivable.Yet, what I loved about this book was how ALS became the most important character. Similar to what she did with Alzheimer’s in “Still Alice,” Lisa Genova masterfully chronicles the progression of a heinous disease. It makes for a brutal read, but also an enlightening one—particularly when you consider whether you could endure dying in such a way with dignity.The acknowledgements are worth a read. In them, Lisa shares that she was inspired to write this book because the director of the film adaptation of “Still Alice” (which was fantastic) suffered from ALS. As someone who took piano lessons for seven years, I also loved the way the instrument played (ha!) such an important role. And the character who plays Richard’s male nurse, Bill, was incredible. He was so patient and funny and kind—the best depiction of the talented, brave women and men who do the hard work of being home health aids. One final thought: Even if I didn’t love these lead characters, I’ll still read anything Lisa writes—she’s such a talent.

In this sweeping, brilliant book, she has masterfully captured what it must have been like to endure the terror and tragedies of this country’s worst health crisis. To be handed down what essentially was a death sentence, and then, to wonder who you loved would get the horrific news next … I cannot imagine the fear and anxiety that followed an entire generation of men, but Rebecca did a hell of a job casting those feelings onto an incredible cast of characters for me. And because I love novels that jump around in time, I might add that this one does a terrific job of taking readers between a 1980s Chicago storyline and a 2015 Paris storyline, with a character that has a prominent role in both stories. As someone who came of (early) age during the AIDS crisis, I am drawn to books that help me better understand just how far-reaching this epidemic was and how little our government did to combat it.

Much as I tried, I never clicked with him, and I had to work extra hard to understand his teaching style. That spring, we had a young woman as our student teacher. Under her patient tutelage, all those equations and symbols suddenly made sense to me.I thought of this yin-yang academic experience as I was reading Madeline Miller’s “Circe.” In a similar vein, I never had a high school English teacher or humanities professor (all male, in my experience) who did Greek mythology justice—not for me, at least. All that time, I guess all I needed was for Madeline Miller to come along.“Circe” started slow for me (mostly due to my lack of understanding about basic Greek mythology, which explains why I had to Google “Titans vs. Olympians’ multiple times as I wrapped my head around the vast family tree of Greek gods). But after the (badass) goddess Circe is banished to the island of Aeaea, I I couldn’t stop turning the pages. Miller’s prose is poetic and powerful, and I was transfixed by her account of Circe’s entry into witchcraft, her love affairs with men like Daedalus and Oydysseus, and her desire to become more human than nymph. I give Miller all the credit for inviting new readers to discover Greek mythology thanks to her extraordinary work.

I read an essay the author wrote for TIME magazine in June (coinciding with the anniversary of D-Day) and I was intrigued. I’d never heard of épuration sauvage, the wild purge, that followed WWII—a time when women across France were publicly humiliated and wrongfully accused for perceived collaborationist activity with the Nazis. I love books that shed light on forgotten elements of history, so I was like, “Sign me up!”But I ended up giving up on this one. Once it was due back at the library, I returned it half-read.There were a few reasons it frustrated me: 1) Mah utilized too much French. Her characters are French (but not her protagonist, an American visiting the country), so I can understand the decision. But it was done to a gratuitous degree (there would be at least six or seven French words italicized on most pages), and so it became a distraction—especially for someone who doesn’t speak much French. And 2) there was some foreshadowing going on in certain places that felt misplaced or unintended. (In one example, I thought the wife of the cousin the protagonist was staying with was ill and they didn’t want the protagonist to know…maybe that ended up being true, but I think I was wrong). Again, little distractions that maybe only nagged me.

I decided 2020 would be the year I tackle 3 stellar novels that have sat too long on my bookshelf: A Gentleman in Moscow, Heart’s Invisible Furies, and Americanah. (Two down, one to go!) What a narrative ride this book proved to be. It gave me so many insights into what life was like for so many closeted gay men who were forced to hide their sexuality in secret for much of the 20th century. I loved all the characters (even the ones I didn’t much care for) because Boyne created them with such love and attention to detail.Some readers have compared this book to “A Little Life” but I didn’t pick up on that. (If anything, I thought it paralleled a lot of the themes of Rebecca Makkai’s “The Great Believers"".) Maybe it's because of this comparison that I wasn’t prepared for the dark humor that was so abundant throughout this book. As bleak as the subject material could be, there were moments I laughed out loud (Cyril had such a wonderful dry sense of humor, and there were lots of running gags, ie 'adopted son'). But then….oh, but then…I did cry, too. I don’t want to say why (that risks giving away the masterful delivery of the book’s most harrowing scene), but that moment—and much of the story—got to me in a way only the best books can.A few of the main characters, so that I don’t forget their names: Catherine, Cyril, Charles, Maude, Julian, Bastiaan, Alice, Ignaac....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 25, 2020","Sep 04, 2020","May 10, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34413704-the-heart-s-invisible-furies

Which is why I was similarly entranced with this novel of hers, despite the heavy subject material. I think it's a bold move when an author attempts a ""ripped from the headlines"" concept for a story. In this case, Slimani pulls it off well as it's eerie to plunge into the minds of a nanny who kills the two children she cares for (don't worry, you find this out in the opening pages) and the couple for whom she works. Slimani doesn't dwell on the horribleness of what happened so much as spend the bulk of her novel developing a brilliant character study of these three along with commentary/criticism about the modern times we live in (as parents and people both).I'm also intrigued by the fact this novel captivated France upon its release, becoming one of the most read books in the country in 2016.

Like ""The Interestings"" became the year of its 2013 release, ""Persuasion"" is sure to be one of 2018's most buzzed-about reads. How can it not when its subject matter—feminism, misogyny, the ""big terribleness"" (how Wolitzer chooses to refer to Trump's presidency)—are all topics that are central to so many of the conversations so many of us are having these days? It's a novel that covers a great number of ideas and opinions and topics (and years) and while it's a bit messy and there are scenes that lean too heavy on description (well-written though that description is), overall it was another Wolitzer book I could not put down. It's also one that I very much look forward to recommending—and discussing—in the new year, particularly with my friends who are of the female persuasion.Passages I loved:A scene where Cory and Greer are reading together while still in high school (early in the book) that resonated with me given my own love of readingCory was reading a bulky book for his economics class; Greer was reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and underlining so often that some pages were entirely marked up.""What are you marking up?"" he asked, curious.""Things that stir me,"" she said without self-consciousness.[...] Love ran through everything Greer read—love of language, love of character, love of the act of reading—just as it ran through everything that had to do with Cory. Books had saved Greer as a child, and then Cory had saved her again later on. A scene where Faith is giving Greer more responsibility at the women's foundation Faith founded, Loci (blech–horrible name...it was one of the things I liked least about the book, but I think that might have been a point Wolitzer was trying to make): Greer wondered why Faith was giving her this gig. She remembered something Faith had said to the team once, early on: ""Men give women the power that they themselves don't want.""  And just, overall, because with the flip of every few pages, Wolitzer writes the kinds of reflective passages (like the ones below) that feel like arrows to your heart because of the way they resonate with her readers:Your twenties was a time when you still felt young, but the groundwork was being laid in a serious way, crisscrossing beneath the surface. It was being laid even while you slept. What you did, where you lived, who you loved, all of it was like pieces of track being put down in the middle of the night by stealth workers. There are some people who have such a strong effect on you, even if you've spent very little time with them, that they become embossed inside you, and any hint of them, any casual mention, creates a sudden stir in you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 29, 2017","Jan 04, 2018","Nov 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35480518-the-female-persuasion

But upon hearing an NPR interview with him around the release of ""Camino Island,"" I was curious enough about the storyline (admittedly because I'm a sucker for all things Fitzgerald) to want to pick it up.What can I say? Grisham is the King of Commercial Fiction. Which means he doesn't disappoint in the fast-paced plot department, but there's little to no development to his characters here, something that bothered me as I came to the closing chapters of the novel. Nevertheless, ""Camino Island"" is a quick read as Grisham keeps you turning the pages, trying to guess how those original Fitzgerald manuscripts will ultimately make their way back to their rightful owner (Princeton University). One passage that stopped me in my tracks (which surprised me, only because that's not something that usually happens for me outside of literary fiction) was a small, rather insignificant description from the main character (a writer named Mercer) about her relationship with her sister. It caught my attention namely because I've seen people IRL going after the same empty dream as her sister (especially now in my 30s), and I appreciated the way Grisham captured that chase on the page:""Now the sisters emailed once a month; chatted by phone once a month; kept things civil and upbeat. Mercer dropped by occasionally when she was near Nashville, often at a different address. They moved a lot, and always to larger homes nicer neighborhoods. They were chasing something, a vague dream, and Mercer often wondered where they would be when they found it. The more money they made the more they spent, and Mercer, living in poverty, marveled at their consumption.""PS - For anybody who's read this, did you catch the way Grisham made Mercer's mother mentally ill in a way that mirrored Zelda Fitzgerald's own mental illness? He even placed her in a psych hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, where Zelda died in a fire in 1948!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 19, 2017","Aug 26, 2017","Aug 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34121119-camino-island

I know already how good this crew will be in their parts, Joe Alwyn especially.

Throw in some complex explanations about time travel and I was done.Here's my final thought on time travel books: I have already bought into the concept, authors. You do not have to sell me on the particulars of HOW your characters are time traveling. Just....LET THEM TIME TRAVEL. Let them fall in love. Let them fall out of love. Fight, kill each other...what have you. Just, for the love of God, DO NOT EXPLAIN TO ME IN DETAIL HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE I DO NOT CARE....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Jul 2017,Jul 2017,"Aug 16, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27405006-all-our-wrong-todays

I have long been a fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid and yet, with this newest release of hers, I found myself thinking multiple times at just how much she'd upped the game. This is a novel that transcends book club fiction and is borderline literary in the way Curtis Sittenfeld and J. Courtney Sullivan straddle those two worlds. I had one of those reading experiences where I simultaneously couldn't put the book down and yet kept drawing out the time I was spending reading it because I didn't want my time with the Hollywood starlet Evelyn Hugo (and co.) to end.I have always appreciated how TJR can masterfully weave twists you don't see coming into her works and this book was no exception. The final chapters were gripping and I finished the read believing it was one of the most satisfying endings to a novel I'd experienced in quite some time.Would HIGHLY recommend and am excited my book club let me convince them to read this for our summer pick.

But Rachel Khong found a beautiful balance between happy and sad tackling the topic in her slim little read “Goodbye, Vitamin.” I loved this book for how much it read like the chronological diary of a young woman trying to manage her own quarter-life crisis while helping her father, a college professor comiing to gripes with the early stages of Alzheimer’s, handle his own. It was witty and wise and gave me warm fuzzies in ways I never expected. A “darkly comic” novel, as the NYT so aptly describes it…I could definitely see this one being given the big-screen treatment.

It's the story of a suburban family (with a house full of teenagers), that develops a close relationship with the mysterious woman who’s living with her daughter in the family’s rental house nearby. But it's so much more: a fascinating exploration of race, making art, coming of age in the late '90s (which is exactly when I did, making me feel a deep affinity for the Richardson clan), and what it means to be a mother. I couldn't put it down, but I did—often—just to keep revisiting the pleasure that comes from reading the best books.

That Laura McBride based the major plot point of the book on a real event; the wonderfully in-depth way she described the landscape of Vegas outside the Strip; and the portrait she painted about the lives of Iraqi vets suffering PTSD (details that were so intimate that it was evident she’d done her research well).

If you’ve read any collection of his short stories (Tenth of December is a good place to start), you already know this and it’s likely what you love about him. It’s also the reason why, when I heard he was writing his first novel, I was down for whatever it would be.The end result is Lincoln in the Bardo, an other-worldly look at the true story of the night in 1862 when a young Willie Lincoln dies and his father, then-President Abraham Lincoln, visits his crypt. Saunders reveals the plot through quotes from historical documents (some real, some not) coupled with monologues from 100-plus ghost-like characters who, like Willie, are stuck in the “bardo”—a Tibetan state of post-life, pre-afterlife existence in-between.I listened to Lincoln as an audiobook and, in the end, that might have been both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because of the incredible star-studded line-up of celebrities—Nick Offerman, Rainn Wilson, David Sedaris, Lena Dunham, Don Cheadle and so many more—who brought the story to life.A curse because the time I devote to an audio book is reduced to snippets drawn out over the course of a few weeks (listening in the car, walking the track at work at lunch, etc.) So, this particular story (namely because of the sheer number of characters) suffers if you try to ""check in"" with it over time.My attention waned in multiple places and I barely finished it. And so, in the end, I give the originality of its premise five stars, but my interest in the plot overall two stars. What I loved most was the insights Saunders gave into what Lincoln must have gone through in those early days mourning his young son. What I could have done without was the dozen or more side narratives of the ghost-like characters whose subplots weren't pertinent to the overall story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 16, 2017","Apr 10, 2017","Feb 06, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

But pretty much from the first chapter, I was once more sucked into the story of Sunja, the female protagonist around whose life this multi-generational novel turns. I just love the way Min Jin Lee writes. So much so that, when I was nearly finished with this, I went ahead and ordered a copy of her first novel because I love her work too much not to read everything she publishes. I look forward now to watching the TV series (even as I know, from reading up on it, that much has changed in terms of characters and timeline). And I stand by my 5-star  of this novel, which in every way is a modern classic. REVIEW from 2017:As soon as I heard about Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko, I fell hard for its gorgeous cover and was intrigued by its title. What is pachinko? Turns out it’s a game of chance that’s a cross between pinball and a slot machine (or Plinko, if you grew up a Price is Right fan ;) ). It’s also hugely popular in Japan and serves as the glue of this novel, a sweeping saga about a Korean family enduring the hardships of their nation being annexed by Japan during the 20th century.What an eye-opening read this was. I had no idea the extent to which Koreans have historically been looked down upon by the Japanese. As a total sucker for a well-told family drama, I was immediately drawn into this book’s multi-generational storyline. If you like novels that read like contemporary classics (in the vein of Dickens or Tolstoy), you can’t go wrong with discovering the memorable characters of this harrowing yet beautiful read....more",Notes are private!,0,18,2,"Apr 07, 2022Mar 06, 2017","Apr 22, 2022Mar 10, 2017","Feb 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29983711-pachinko

And I found myself thinking about this time and again as I devoured Kayla Rae Whitaker’s “The Animators”. Here was a fully realized story about two young women—the underconfident Sharon Kisses and her in-your-face BFF Mel Vaught—who unabashedly chose creative careers over the men (and women, in Mel’s case) in their lives. And they were so unapologetic about doing so, it felt impossible to fall into the standard societal trap of questioning their choices otherwise. At several points in this book, I found myself thinking about how fresh it all felt (the ideas, the bawdy language—from Mel especially, whose antics might have made Sid Vicious proud) and how it’s the kind of read where I know the characters will stay with me for a lonnngggg time. I mean, Vaught & Kisses….how can you forget a combo like that?For this Midwesterner, an added benefit: After the book’s first “No way!” plot twist, Whitaker, a Kentucky native, draws her characters back to Kisses’ rural Kentucky hometown. Living only five hours and some change up the interstate from where a lot of this part of the book took place, all of it (the people, the language they used, the food they ate) was familiar in a context I don't see often in contemporary literary fiction. Without a doubt, this book is my first must-read of 2017.

I’m glad I finally tackled it this spring. It’s one of the rare times I followed it up with a date for myself at Starbucks during which I filled dozens of pages of a notebook with all the lessons I learned from it. Here are but a few: • Story is metaphor for life.• When talented people write well, it is generally for this reason: They are moved by a desire to touch the audience.• Of the total creative effort represented in a finished work, 75 percent or more of a writer's labor goes into designing story. WHO are these characters? WHAT do they want? WHY do they want it? HOW do they get it? WHAT stops them? WHAT are the consequences? Finding the answers to these grand questions and shaping them into story is our overwhelming creative task.• Talent without craft is like fuel without an engine. It burns wildly but accomplishes nothing. • The source of cliches can be traced to one thing: The writer does not know the world of his story. • An honest story is at home in one—and only one—place and time.• Can't kill your talent but starve it into a coma through ignorance. Talent must be stimulated by facts and ideas. Research wins the war on cliche, and is key to victor over fear and depression. • The sudden impression that a story is writing itself marks the moment when a writer's knowledge of a subject has reached its saturation point....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 14, 2017","Apr 10, 2017","Jan 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48654.Story

Hansberry's own family fought a similar battle all the way to the Supreme Court. Now I'm curious ... how many of you have seen the play or film?

I discovered it after reading an interview in The Millions with Richard Russo (whose work I’ve long admired), mentioning it as one of the books he enjoyed most in 2016. After finishing it myself, I can see why. “Norwegian by Night” is the story of WWII vet Sheldon Horowitz, a Jewish curmudgeon who, after the death of his wife, is forced to uproot his American life to move to Norway with his granddaughter Rhea and her husband, Lars. He hates everything about his present situation until the day he gets entangled as an accessory to a brutal murder that happens in the family’s apartment complex. Relying on his military training, he takes it upon himself to go on the lam with the murder victim’s young son, creating a cat-and-mouse plot that concludes with a gripping climax that left me wishing for more of Sheldon’s story.What I loved most about this thriller was Miller’s writing (certain sentences I savored enough to re-read and make note of) and the way this book felt like a mirror reflecting the world’s changing geopolitical landscape and people’s fears of refugees. It’s one of those novels older people would enjoy (especially in light of Sheldon’s flashbacks to his war experience and his regrets over losing his own son in Vietnam) and would make a great gift for any parent or grandparent who’s a reader....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 06, 2016","Feb 18, 2017","Dec 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15775210-norwegian-by-night

It took me about 75 pages to get into the characters of Lucy and Josh (they hated each other SO much and I had too little context for why up front) but once I got hooked by the storyline (somewhere around the time Lucy went on her date with Danny, a decision that prompted a hot scene of jealousy from Josh), I didn't want to put the book down.As my friend pointed out, nothing about the plot of ""The Hating Game"" is original and yet Sally Thorne ""wrote the crap out of it."" Thanks to plenty of great banter between the characters (who had great chemistry in the end) and a build-up of sexual tension that held until the book's final chapters, there was plenty of reasons to keep reading. I also appreciated that in falling for Josh, it wasn't the feminist-friendly Lucy who compromised in any way, but the object of her affection instead. *****Loved this line from Josh (so Darcy-esque): “Watching you pretend to hate the nickname [Shortcake] is the best part of my day.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 18, 2017","Aug 22, 2017","Nov 28, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/25883848-the-hating-game

And why was she being ripped away from her husband and the life she knew? I was about to find out. Over the course of the book’s 300-plus pages, Rena plays out the narrative via a story-telling device that offers us glimpses of Clara’s life in the past juxtaposed with those in the present. And BOY was I quickly hooked.The main reason I found myself so fascinated by The Girl Before is because of the subject matter upon which it’s based. I don’t want to give it away, as discovering the “world” I’m referring to is part of the allure of the novel. All that to say, I couldn’t believe it was my first time reading a story that revolved around such timely subject material.I love how Rena made you root for Clara, while also understanding her faults and why she was so drawn to Glenn (writing a bad guy with redemptive qualities? That takes SKILL!). Her writing style is very cinematic, which is probably why, about mid-way through this fast-paced read, I found myself wishing this was one thriller that would make its way to the big screen. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 15, 2016","Oct 29, 2016","Nov 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27833860-the-girl-before

Thankfully, Nicola’s latest release, “The Sun Is Also A Star” isn’t as good as her debut, it’s BETTER. I found myself falling SO hard for this quick read. So hard, I carried it around all week and stayed up until 1 a.m. Monday because I didn’t want to leave the version of NYC Yoon had created for her characters. Natasha and Daniel’s timely 21st-century story is a multi-ethnic mash-up that’s one part “When Harry Meets Sally,” one part “An Affair to Remember.” It’s a book about love (which the world ESPECIALLY needs more of right now), family, immigration, existentialism, and the power of fate. If I had mad Oprah money, I’d buy up 1,000 copies and hand them to everyone for Christmas. THAT’S how much I LOVED this book.And because Yoon is a master of language (seriously, this gal is SO brilliant, she has me all, who’s John Green again?) there were many pages of this book I dog-eared so I could remember the lines she spun that I loved. Here are a few:• I’d give anything to really want the life my parents want for me. (Pg. 50)• There’s a Japanese phrase that I like: koi no yokan. It doesn’t mean love at first sight. It’s closer to love at second sigh. It’s the feeling when you meet someone that you’re going to fall in love with…Maybe you don’t love them right away, but it’s inevitable you will. (Pg. 74)• America’s not really a melting pot. It’s more like one of those divided metal plates with separate sections for starch, meat, and veggies. (P. 128)• It’s hard to come from someplace or someone you’re not proud of … “You’re not your dad,” I say, but he doesn’t believe me. I understand his fear. Who are we if not a product of our parents and their histories? (Pg 144)• Maybe part of falling in love with someone else is also falling in love with yourself. (pg. 150)• I squeeze her hand. “You know the way we feel right now? This connection between us that we don’t understand and we don’t want to let go of?

Susan Jane One of the reasons I love book clubs is because they push you to read outside your comfort zone, discovering books you never knew existed. Susan Jane Gilman’s “Undress Me in the Temple of Heaven” is such book for me. The true account of Gilman, an accomplished journalist, who set off to tour the world with one of her college classmates, this story is a WILD ride. Namely because the two start their journey in 1986 in China, landing in a country whose borders had been open for “all of ten minutes”. What happens to them leaves you on the edge of your seat (and turning the pages!) but for anyone who’s traveled—especially abroad—this book is full of plenty of reminders of the graces that come with stepping outside your comfort zone and developing camaraderie with fellow travelers you meet along the way.A few favorite lines: “No one ever tells you this,” I said despairingly, waving at the turquoise tiled walls, the bare, hissing light fixture. “All those travel magazines. People with their vacation photos. They just make it look so easy.” I suppose, travel is a bit like the Internet—there’s a protective anonymity to it. Cast into a situation with people you never have to see again and shielded from repercussions, you turn brazenly candid.Lee was thirty-six. If we’d met in the States, we’d have had absolutely no reason to sit together and probably nothing to say. But here? We had the special camaraderie of the displaced, of sad people with suitcases. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 02, 2017","Jan 04, 2017","Nov 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4757303-undress-me-in-the-temple-of-heaven

Here was this super buzzy book that was being touted as defining what girlhood meant through its throwback storyline and all I could think was, ""Am I reading the same book?""I bring that novel up again only because of the timing of the release of Jacqueline Woodson's latest novel (her first adult book), ""Another Brooklyn."" HERE is a book that, within a small number of pages, manages to define girlhood. The kicker for me as a white reader? I'm not black like its characters. Nor am I from Brooklyn. Or a child of the 1970s!And yet that's precisely the power of Woodson's writing. As much as her themes resonate with black readers, they are written so eloquently as to strike the same level of nostalgia in white readers, too. (I had numerous flashbacks to the days of my own four-some squad of girlfriends at this age while reading it.)I'm still new to Woodson's work (""Brown Girl Dreaming"" was my introduction), but ""Another Brooklyn"" solidifies why she has become one of my all-time favorite writers. Her style is lyrical, evocative, and defined by the kind of prose you savor. (It's also highly distinctive; you could hand me a book without showing me the cover and within a few pages, I'd be able to tell you it's her work.)So yeah, I HIGHLY recommend this little gem of a novel—and while it's the pettiest of bonuses, at a slim (and quick-reading) 192 pages, this is the perfect pick if you're in the mood to boost a reading goal, or feel more accomplished, or more 'up' on fiction these days. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 19, 2016","Aug 24, 2016","Sep 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27213163-another-brooklyn

If you’re not familiar with the term, it’s the phrase writers use to discuss the approach of writing characters outside their race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.Jodi Picoult wrote the other in a MAJOR way with “Small Great Things,” a multiple-point-of-view novel anchored by the story of a black neonatal nurse named Ruth. When confronted with a medical dilemma presented by the newborn patient of a racist parent at the hospital—a white supremacist who refuses Ruth’s care for his son—Ruth balks. As a result, the child dies (and the bulk of the book afterwards follows the days leading up to the climatic trial that ensues). This book—the only Picoult I’ve ever read—helped me understand why her work is so popular. The story was compulsively readable and I felt she did a pretty good job of creating fully realized characters, including Ruth’s public defender, Kennedy, a woman best described by Roxane Gay in her NYT  of SGT as “a proxy for well-meaning white folk who don’t realize the extent of their racism until they are forced to confront it.”For those who’ve read SGT, what did YOU think?

The first third, it felt like Graham struggled to ease into her own narrative voice (it was so! Lorelai! Gilmore!) and she threw in a lot of corny little jokes on top of it (which weren’t necessary IMO…she’s witty enough without the need of punchlines in need of a rim shot). I LOVED the mid-section (though many people might not have) because, as a writer, I was curious to hear how she found a daily routine that allowed her to squeeze in work on this memoir, her second novel, AND a screenplay for The Royal We (CANNOT WAIT FOR THAT). She shares the schedule gifted to her from a Hollywood friend, Don Roos, and I copied it down so I could hang it above my desk for inspiration.The last third of the book felt like the payoff everyone was looking for and that was her journal-esque chapters on how the Gilmore Girls Netflix reboot came to be. The big takeaway from this final passage: Lauren felt like that ending was a gigantic cliffhanger too AND her writing hints at an interest in playing Lorelai again, should ASP want to resurrect the town of Stars Hollow a third time.While a bit uneven in tone and subject material (some of those essays felt like a stretch to hit a word count!), overall I’d recommend this memoir to anyone who counts Lauren Graham among the celebrities they’d most like to grab a drink with (me! me! me!)Two other tidbits worth commenting on:1) That Peter Krauss is an outdoors-ish type of guy. I'm confident he and my husband would get along well.

Brilliant because author Rahul Kanakia created such an unlikable narrator I SHOULD have wanted to throw the book across the room. Instead, I kept being tugged along by the words on the page, wondering what she'd do next. Reshma is SO cut throat, she's willing to plagiarize, blackmail, and file lawsuits against anyone who stands in the way of the collegiate future she envisions for herself.On the other hand, I grew frustrated because, throughout the narrative, the softie in me that desperately wanted Reshma to be kinder and gentler finished the book a bit disgusted with her decision-making and the way she treated even the most genuine, loyal people who cared about her (GEORGE!) That said, Rahul DOES gives Reshma a final chapter that leaves you satisfied for having taken this narrative journey with her. Because while Reshma will always be Reshma (cut throat and competitive), she does manage to find a way to channel that energy for good in the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 14, 2016","Oct 09, 2016","Aug 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22060619-enter-title-here

And you guys, whimsical and light was EXACTLY what I was needing this month.As an #imwithher gal, I was pretty down in the wake of Donald Trump winning the election. As a result, Asher’s book showing up at the library when it did felt like a karmic sign. I happily devoured this sweet slip of a story about Sierra, whose family operates an Xmas tree farm in Oregon, requiring her to spend every Christmas helping her parents sell said trees on a lot in Southern California. Asher makes Sierra feel like a very relatable teen and her crush on one of her customers, Caleb, took me back to my own days of pining for cute dark-haired boys with dimples. Maybe the one surprise for me was how I kept expecting the storyline to get darker (Caleb allegedly has a dark past). When that past finally gets revealed, it left this reader at least thinking “Huh…that’s it?” Which also made me realize that, in the world of YA fiction, not every book needs something as dark in its plot line as a suicide or a murder or physical abuse. A timely read for the holiday season, What Light made me feel a bit happier than I was when I picked it up. It also left me wanting to go order a peppermint mocha. And smell all the Xmas candles.

In 2022, I finally got aroundEvery year during Black History Month, I aim to read a book by a prominent Black author whose work I’ve yet to discover. In 2022, I finally got around to reading my copy of Octavia Butler’s “Kindred” (which has sat on my book shelf, unopened, for too many years to count).I have to admit, this one stuck with me in a BIG way. First published in 1979, ""Kindred"" is about a young Black woman, Dana, who keeps being pulled between the present (1976 Los Angeles) and the days of 19th century slavery. While in the past, she has to keep saving Rufus, the white man she discovers is a distant ancestor of hers.It's the ultimate Catch-22 of a plot, and as a slavery text, it brought to life the antebellum South in a way I've never experienced from any other book set during this (awful, awful) time in our nation's history. This, of course, was Butler’s intent: “The reason for my writing this novel really was to try to make people feel the past as well as understand it (the slavery experience) in your skin, in your mind, in your emotions, to feel it.” (Source)Last year, FX ordered a TV adaptation of this seminal novel, and now I am SO curious to see who will play these characters. And because playing amateur casting director is one of my favorite related pastimes to reading, here are my picks for who should play Dana and who should play her white newlywed husband, Kevin:Kiki Layne as Dana —If you’ve never seen Kiki act before, she’s incredible in “If Beale Street Could Talk” and “The Old Guard,” both of which are also adaptations (of a Baldwin novel and a graphic novel, respectively). Chris Pine as Kevin —Chris does period pieces well (see his role in the Wonder Woman franchise) and his graying hair and scruff as of late are perfect for this role (for reasons I won’t elaborate on for fear of spoiling a plot element in “Kindred” but IYKYK).Also, I want to give a huge shout-out to Octavia Butler, who was the first Black woman to receive the Nebula and Hugo Awards, the highest honors in the science fiction and fantasy genres—and the first science fiction writer to win a MacArthur genius grant.

Jessi Klein's collection was no exception. From the start, I loved her voice—wry but laser sharp, keenly pointing out and then skewering so many of the things women didn't know they needed to be laughing about (case in point: her essays on the insanity of the Bar Method and her loathing of bathes–which I share—were two of my favorites). Klein's writing was relatable because she's a real women who just happens to have a bad-ass job (which is why her essay on trying to buy French lingerie was hysterical because THAT WOULD SO BE ME). And if you're a mother, much of what she writes about her new experiences as one herself might also ring true (especially if, like me, you, too, are a BIG fan of epidurals).As head writer of Inside Amy Schumer, Klein is stepping out from her boss's shadow to have her own well-deserved time in the spotlight. I look forward to following what comes next.A few related tidbits:Great  from New York Magazine of ""You'll Grow Out of It""—I especially loved this sentiment of Klein's: “I think for a very long time, including now, there has been this view that writing about the details of women’s lives feels somehow more trivial than writing by men,” Klein tells me, adding that she always believed her own insights and experiences could never pass as quote-unquote “real literature.” Working on Inside Amy Schumer, in a writers’ room where she was free to pitch topics that another sketch show might have rejected, helped her strengthen her voice, and to realize that she had something to say that other women might want to hear. “Even when I was starting out to write a book, I thought, those are books, that’s literature, and what am I going to write?” Klein muses. “How is my stupid essay about Anthropologie going to matter? And I think that’s a really toxic view to internalize. I think the details of women’s lives are as important as anything in all of literature.”AGREED!

Instead, I see it becoming the breakout book of 2017, a novel that gifts its readers a protagonist who isn't just likable but empathetic in a way that makes you feel—no matter if you are black or white—a connection with this girl, her family, and her neighborhood in an eye-opening way that will knock your socks off....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,Mar 2017,"Mar 06, 2017","Jul 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32075671-the-hate-u-give

That's how I felt when I discovered Morgan Matson earlier this month. Then suddenly, she was everywhere. (And by everywhere, I mean I came across 1) an Amazon interview with her and 2) her interview on a podcast called 88 Cups of Tea, which, I happen to love: http://88cupsoftea.com/podcast/morgan...)Pretty sure Morgan came onto my radar as of late because she has a new book out but when I searched for it at the library, all I could find was this novel, which was her debut. I reserved it and, upon picking it up, was utterly charmed.It's one of those YA reads that's sweet but underscores all the issues and complicated feelings that come along with being a teenager. In this case, Amy is grieving the loss of her father while trying to navigate the tricky business of moving cross-country from California to join her mother in Connecticut. Enter Roger, the neighbor-turned-college kid hired by Amy's mother to accompany her on her journey east (and for whom Amy can't help but develop feelings for--wink, wink ;) )I think I got swept up in this book for two big reasons: 1) it's an epistolary novel, with a series of journal entries, play lists, ""receipts"" and postcards complementing the narrative and 2) Morgan Matson has great voice. So, so great. I found the world she spun for her readers so easy to jump into that I looked forward to cracking open the pages of this book every change I got. Which is probably why it read as quickly as it did.

This is less the result of the book not being good, and more the fact I tried tackling a 600+ page tome in the span of two months that involved a lot of travel and other commitments. I put it down and picked it back up multiple times, which is why—looking back on it now—it feels as if the various narratives (Sam’s experiences with his friend and his friend’s sister, his unrequited love; the flashbacks to his mother’s life in the ‘60s; the present-day narrative about Sam and his World of Elfquest friends) all feel like separate books to me. There is a lot of humor to this narrative (very wry humor, I might add), which is probably what carried me through to the end. Not to mention the on-the-nose social and political messages it has to offer in these tumultuous times we find ourselves living in here in the U.S. (aka, Trumplandia). I think Nathan Hill has a writing style that would appeal to fans of Donna Tartt and/or John Irving. He’s immensely talented and I’ll have my eye out for whatever he puts out next. A line to remember: ""What's true? What's false? In case you haven't noticed, the world has pretty much given up on the old Enlightenment idea of piecing together the truth based on observed data. Reality is too complicated and scary for that. Instead, it's way easier to ignore all data that doesn't fit your preconceptions and believe all data that does. I believe what I believe, and you believe what you believe, and we'll agree to disagree. It's liberal tolerance meets dark ages denialism.

This  may only make sense to those of youHow many of you stumbling across this  have seen the film of “Hidden Figures” and read the book? This  may only make sense to those of you who answer “Both.”First thing first: I picked this as an audio read. In hindsight, that wasn’t such a good idea. This book is chock full of history, which, at times, made it quite the slog. With so many names (and so many opportunities to get distracted while listening), I got lost more than a few times (forgetting some folks, though never the key players). Then, I saw the film when I was about half-way through the book. It led to this bizarre set-up where I was constantly contrasting what I knew was true with what I was watching on the big screen. There were multiple examples, but here are two: 1) the Kevin Costner character was an amalgamation of multiple male bosses in the book and 2) the bathroom incident in the film happened to Katherine Johnson; in the book, it’s Mary Jackson (and the run-in she had with one of the engineers while stewing about it is what led to her landing a better job and becoming an engineer herself).In the end, these differences bothered me only a little as “Hidden Figures” proved to be SUCH a visual story it’s one of the rare times I preferred the film to the book. I left the theater wondering how the screenwriter had written it—did she have Shetterly’s manuscript in her hand while crafting the screenplay? And how had she managed to pull off what Shetterly couldn’t—shining a laser-sharp spotlight on the few years that made for the most fascinating convergence of these women’s stories (for context: Shetterly doesn’t even GET to John Glenn’s space odyssey until the last few chapters). Turns out screenwriter Allison Schroeder wrote it at the same time Shetterly was writing her book, using the author's research to inform her, but not the manuscript itself (this profile about her is a must read)My final take: If you are a history nerd and/or super interested in the full account of these women, you’ll want to read the book. But if you are the type that finds finishing, say, a beach read challenging, this isn’t the book for you. Pay your tribute to these women at the cineplex instead. The movie is remarkably inspiring and their story far too good to miss. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 29, 2016","Jan 23, 2017","Jul 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25953369-hidden-figures

As in, I cannot even BEGIN to describe how powerful a read this novel is. If this doesn't win every book prize for fiction this year, something is wrong with the game. First, can we just talk about the fact Yaa Gyasi is 26? TWENTY SIX. Yeah, I KNOW. If this is her debut, be prepared to hear her name someday receiving the Nobel Prize, because seriously, she is that good.In ""Homegoing,"" Gyasi tackles the concurrent stories of two families derived from African half-sisters, beginning in Ghana in the 1700s: one, Effia, the wife of a English trader who moves into the palatial Cape Coast Castle and the other, Esi, imprisoned in the castle's dungeon and sold into the American slave trade.In alternating chapters Gyasi introduces us to the descendants of these women as their stories span multiple generations and hardships that carry through to the present day. I am particularly in awe of how Gyasi chose to have these families' stories intertwine at the end of the book. It left me turning the last page speechless/wanting to push ""Homegoing"" into the hands of everybody I knew.If ever there was a modern-day sequel to Alex Haley's ""Roots,"" THIS IS THE BOOK. If ever there was a series of stories that tackled the question ""What is it like to be black in America today?,"" THIS IS THE BOOK. If ever there was a novel that should be required reading of everybody, especially given recent current events, THIS IS THE BOOK.Empathy is born within the pages of novels—but especially one as powerful as this.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I borrowed this from the library and should have bought a copy because now I'm un-dog-earring a ton of pages I marked up b/c of the most amazing prose. Here are a few I don't want to forget:Pg 18: ""Cargo ships like black specks of dust in the blue, wet eye of the Atlantic"" (GAHHHHH this writing...when so many of her buzzed-about peers are falling to purple prose syndrome, Gyasi's vivid descriptions are perfectly placed...this is just one example)Pg 39: ""In my village we have a saying about separated sisters. They are like a woman and her reflection, doomed to stay on opposite sides of the pond"" (Such an elegant way for Gyasi to mirror her plot with one of the stories told by one of the African villagers she writes about) Pg 72: ""The corners of her lips always seemed to twitch upward, unwillingly, then fall within milliseconds, as though attached to that sadness that had once anchored her own mother's heart. ""Ain't we all done lost someone?"" Ness asked. (Ohhhh man....It was Ness's slave narrative that might have wrecked me most in this book) Couple that with the final paragraph of her story on page 87 and I was a blubbering fool.Pg 93: ""They would just trade one type of shackles for another, trade physical ones that wrapped around wrists and ankles for the invisible ones that wrapped around the mind."" (Very quickly in the book, you understand that one of Gyasi's objectives was to introduce her readers to how Africans—Asante and Fante, in this case—were complicit w/the whites in the slave trade—a particular chapter of the ugly slave narrative I'd never heard)Pg 112: Kojo's story—God, I just...this one was SO HARD, too: ""Every time Jo saw a slave in Baltimore, he felt like he remembered. Every time Jo saw a slave in Baltimore, he saw himself, saw what his life would have been like had Ma Aku not taken him to freedom. His free papers named him Kojo Freeman. Free man. Half the ex-slaves in Baltimore had the name. Tell a lie long enough and it will turn to truth."" (One of those lines I had to stop to savor ... so powerful)Pg 145: ""There should be no room in your life for regret. If in the moment of doing you felt clarity, you felt certainty, then why feel regret later?"" (Words to live by) Pg 216: ""In the new apartment Willie had no Bess to leave [Carson] with, and so she left him by himself on days she went to work, making sure to shut the windows and lock the doors and hide the sharp things. At night she would find that he had put himself to sleep, the mattress soaked with his ever-present tears."" (This scene in Willie's chapter—Willie the daughter of Big H, whose story REALLY broke my heart—made tears fall onto my cheeks because I have a son the age of her son and I could just NEVER imagine having to be in a position where I would leave my son alone all day the way this character had to) Pg 226: In Yaw's chapter, the paragraph that is essentially the thesis of Gyasi's brilliant novel: ""This is the problem of history. We cannot know that which we were not there to see and hear and experience for ourselves. We must rely upon the words of others......We believe the one who has the power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must always ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth?

Her newest, One TruOne thing I know for certain after reading three of Taylor Jenkins Reid's four books: She is an author who—for me—is a sure thing. Her newest, One True Loves, explores the life of Emma Blair, who marries her high school sweetheart, only to lose him in a ""Cast-away"" like plane crash. She finds love again with a classmate she's always had a soft spot for, but soon after, has to confront fate knocking on her door in the form of her dead husband, suddenly very much alive. As with all her books, I couldn't put this one down! [Without spoilers, I'll add I was REALLY satisfied with the ending—and I'd been on pins and needles throughout the book wondering if I would like it!]A few lines I loved/thoughts related to the book:""I think that perhaps everyone has a moment that splits their life in two. When you look back on your own timeline, there's a sharp spike somewhere along the way, some event that changed you, changed your life, more than the others. A moment that creates a 'before' and an 'after.'"" ""I had predicated my life on the idea that I wanted to see everywhere extraordinary, but I'd come to realize that extraordinary is everywhere.""""Flirting is probably just as much about falling in love with yourself as it is with someone else."" ""It's rare that you love the person who loves you, that you love only the person who loves only you. Otherwise, somebody's heartbroken. But I guess that's why true love is so alluring in the first place. It's hard to find and hold on to, like all beautiful things. Like gold, saffron, or an aurora borealis."" And lastly, this scene I loved (because I had never heard of this phenomenon yet experienced this MANY times:""That's the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon,"" Olive said when I mentioned it at lunch. ""My brother just told me about this. You don't notice something and then you learn the name for it and suddenly it's everywhere."" Olive thought for a moment. ""Whoa. I'm pretty sure I have the Baader-Meinhof penomenon about the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.""Two things: 1) That scene made me LOL and 2) in One True Loves, there is a reference to Emma's parents taking a ""disco nap."" Now, I had never heard of such a thing. At 34 years old, I had to look it up! So, I'm reading this book on my phone and meanwhile, I'm reading a hardbound copy of Cynthia Sweeney's ""The Nest."" Like, literally a day after learning this ""disco nap"" term in TJR's book, it turns up in ""The Nest!"" So, yeah, the BM phenomenon?

I'm curious by nature and it's what I do). I also love getting a sneak peek into a creative's working life, so these are great for that as they're especially good about painting a scene of the artist in his/her work environment at the time the interview was conducted (many in this volume in the 50s-60s).

As in, the biggest thing that happens to Ari (our teenage male protagonist) is meeting Dante (the geeky, curious kid who becomes his BFF). The two then commiserate about being outcasts and sharing the weight of being named after famous philosophers (and we also get some backstory on their lives—a LOT of backstory when it comes to Ari's relationship w/his dad, a Vietnam vet suffering PTSD).But somewhere along the way—driven in large part by Benjamin Alire Sáenz's beautiful writing—I got more and more interested in the story until at one point, I had my car turned off, just sitting in my in-laws' driveway, not wanting to stop listening, because I didn't want to get out until the pivotal scene in my ears was over.I both loved and hated that this book had a sort of portent of doom hanging over basically the entire narrative. It kept me guessing and then sighing with relief at its HEA ending. Overall what I loved most about the narrative is that it introduces its readers to diverse characters with real and authentic problems. While it's set in the '80s, without question it's that kind of classic coming of age story that, if not already on high school reading lists, will be someday. And it should because it has that definitive ""it"" factor that makes you think every teenager needs to read this story....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 14, 2016",Jun 2016,"Apr 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12000020-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe

It’s perfection. My take? For a few sentences worth ofFirst off, forget everything I say below and just read my friend Jessica’s  of this book. It’s perfection. My take? For a few sentences worth of backstory, I’d never bought a cast recording of a musical before November 2015. Ever. But something happened to me last fall. I was bitten by the Hamilton bug (wasn’t everybody?) I can’t think of the last piece of art to move me the way this musical did (and continues to). I’m going to cry when I see the real thing (which, hopefully happens in Chicago in the next year because Lord knows I can’t get my mitts on a ticket to the NYC show). When I pre-ordered Hamilton: The Revolution, I thought it’d be a neat look at Lin-Manuel Miranda’s inspiration behind this juggernaut of a show. It was that, of course. But it was surprisingly SO MUCH MORE. For starters, for every person involved with this show, there's an incredible backstory. Every single one of them captivated me (Jessica details a few in her  that are SO good—the ones about Ron Chernow and his wife and Oskar Eustis and his child especially). Then, the pictures. Oh they are GLORIOUS—particularly for those of us who will never see the original cast perform on stage at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. (They also helped me understand actor relationships in the story that are hard to glean by merely listening to the cast recording—for example, how Anthony Ramos plays both John Laurens and Philip Hamilton….matter of fact, the way in which Lin uses the same actors to play multiple roles throughout his show is an aspect of the production I most appreciate)Finally, the cherry on top of this gloriously creative sundae: Lin’s annotations to the lyrics. It’s one thing hearing all these songs with the vague understanding you are listening to somebody whose influences are so ingrained they are the very reason this show exists (who else would read an 800-page biography of a Founding Father and think 'Oh, this is a hip-hop musical'?). It’s another to have Lin point them out to you in such a way that you realize this guy is a human SPONGE. (Case in point: I’ve told multiple friends about the “Ten Duel Commandments” sampling of Notorious BIG’s “Ten Crack Commandments” … again, genius!). Another thing I LOVE about Lin (there are many things, of course, not the least of which is his enthusiasm for EVERYTHING) is that, while he is a man of superior intelligence, he never lets on as such. Throughout the book he sprinkles in pop culture references to zeitgeist-y gems like Harry Potter and Parks and Rec, proving he's ""one of us."" It’s these little touches that make you love him that much more, which is a feat unto itself if you—like me—thought that wasn't possible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 14, 2016","Apr 24, 2016","Mar 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26200563-hamilton

Like I was missing a couple new best friends who lived in the pages of this book. So I did something I never do: I read the darn thing over again, front to cover. And I loved it even more.Look, I’m not from the South (if I was, I might get a tattoo of this book’s cover on my bicep, that’s how much I loved it). BUT I am from the Midwest, and when it comes to book love, where I’m from is as about as forgotten as the particular patch of Tennessee Zentner sets “The Serpent King.” I recognized all its people and places. Swap out chess pie for sugar cream, and these situations and this backdrop could just as easily have happened in the rural part of Indiana where I’m from. On that note, Zentner walks a fine line the way all my favorite authors do, writing openly and honestly about a place that’s down on its luck without ever being too out-right condescending about it (see also my  of Nickolas Butler’s “Shotgun Lovesongs”). I’ve started following him on social media and recently he posted a pic of his book being sold at Wal-Mart. Not in an ironic way. In a “for a lot of people I know, this is the only place you can buy books in town and I’m damn grateful for it” kind of way. No lie—it made me want to give him a high five.So yeah, I LOVE this book. Have I said that already? Six-star loved it. Loved it so much I’m sending texts to friends, asking them to read it too, then trying to live vicariously through their first readings all over again (“Are you at that part where Lydia jokes about the Starbucks? HAHAHAHAHA”!)To say too much about this coming-of-age story would be a disservice to letting y’all (see what I did there?!) discover the twists and turns of its plot. Instead, I’ll just say again it’s the characters that did it for me. For Generation Z, Dill, Lydia, and Travis remind me a LOT of another trio of friends I famously adore. Yep. Not since Sloan Peterson have I wanted to BE a teenager the way reading this made me want to be Lydia Blankenship (hell, she even had me developing my own crush on a young William de Kooning—seriously, Google him. Where does Jeff come up with this stuff?!) The coolest girl in YA lit? Abso-freaking-lutely. A few other thoughts:• Lydia’s Dad. I just….I can’t even. Best parental figure in fiction since Becky Albertalli penned Simon’s awesome mom and dad in Simon vs the Homo Sapien Agenda (a 2015 release I loved every bit as much this) . Mr. Blankenship’s moment with Dill in the car on the way home from Nashville WRECKED me. Almost as much as that other moment in the book. Y’all know the one I’m talking about. The TEARS FOR DAYS moment. • Having several creative friends who are on some level Internet famous, I loved Zentner’s take on Lydia being a fashion blogger—it’s a keen observation about the world we live in today in terms of fame and success and what it looks like on the web versus real life (the “off brand” commentary about posting photos of Dill and Travis especially!)• Jeff’s writing is incredible—especially his descriptions (sights/smells/sounds) …so many sentences I highlighted and/or underlined because they felt like a nod to poetry (all his years of songwriting have paid off!): “When they pulled into Forrestville, the shadows were long and the light looked like it was streaming through a pitcher of sweet tea”—I mean, COME ON! So good!)• And finally, where can we get a link to those YouTube videos of Dearly singing? Never before have I so wanted a character’s art to be real. (Wait…. I take that back—2016 so far has me wanting to see JB’s retrospective of Jude and Williem…but that’s when you know your love for a book is deep—when even the art the characters are creating feels alive and real) So yeah, do yourself a favor and fall for this trio already. Then join me in admitting you want to be in high school again if only to have the “once in a generation” kind of friendship Dill, Lydia, and Travis do.BRAVO JEFF!  ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 10, 2016","Mar 12, 2016","Mar 17, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22752127-the-serpent-king

Unable to muster up a give-a-damn for three secondary characters meaner than Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters combined.

Just a little ""whelmed"" by the story tucked inside its pages (as in, not underwhelmed but not overwhelmed either).I must say HIB's premise is a great set-up: 16-yr-old Solomon has agoraphobia. He meets the sweet but slightly overzealous (and in one case, slightly conniving) classmates Lisa and Clark who try to rescue him. Conflict ensues. I loved all the scenes of the trio hanging out because they felt so true. True enough they took me back to being a teenager, playing video games with my own friends in one another's basements. But when I got to the ending of this book (which I liked) I found myself thinking, ""That's it? That's all we get?"" Maybe that's a testament to JCW's writing (scratch that, I know it is) but also because, in the end, this book was a quiet kind of story. That doesn't make it one that shouldn't be told (JCW needs to tell more stories—all the stories—and I'll be first in line to read every one), just that this particular one will likely slip from my memory in the months to come. (As a final note: I know one audience for whom this book will resonate—and probably stick with always. And that's those kids and adults out there who suffer from anxiety—and it's a growing number. Solomon will be your hero, trust me. Also, as I was reading, the way JCW describes the physical manifestation of anxiety in a person's body, I could tell he'd experienced it firsthand. That's why his revelation he shared in this insightful interview with BookPage came as no surprise. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 12, 2016","May 27, 2016","Feb 26, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26109391-highly-illogical-behavior

I took a moment upon coming to this passage to feel deflated (like, am I THAT unoriginal here?)

Overall I liked the voice of Jamie Watson (who writes the story), but the case itself that he and Charlotte Holmes were trying to solve (who was trying to frame Charlotte, who happens to be Sherlock’s great-great-great granddaughter) was just…well, not all that interesting to me.To be fair, I’m a bandwagon Sherlock fan. I love the BBC show (though have only caught the first two seasons) and have seen the newest Sherlock films but unlike my hubby, I've never read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles’ stories (I know, I know—so bad!). So maybe I’m not the best judge on how well Cavallaro did, slipping nods to Doyle’s actual Sherlock stories into this book of hers. (Scratch that, I KNOW I’m not.)On a final note, not sure if any others who read this dealt with the same issues I did as far as coming across certain passages where the writing felt a little clunky. As in, I had to re-read paragraphs to infer who was in the crosshairs of a particular action in a particular scene. (In one case, I can remember the author slipping in a few paragraphs of backstory about secondary characters and then jumping back into Charlotte speaking without addressing the return to the present and me thinking, “Wait….oh, so we’ve left the past then?”) Just little things like this that might be improved upon for the second book in the series (which, at this point, I’m not sure I’ll get around to reading!)...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 25, 2016","Mar 27, 2016","Feb 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23272028-a-study-in-charlotte

I’ve been a fan of this woman’s shows for quite some time (though admittedly I don’t watch Grey’s or Scandal at present) and I admire the way she OWNS.HER.LIFE. Without apology. Without the “Who me? I don’t deserve this” lack of confidence so many women can fall for as a trapping of their own success. On the surface this book may seem an unnecessary read (like, hasn’t every celebrity written some kind of memoir about how to be a better person?). But because it’s Shonda, her version trumps any and all other cliched attempts from her peers to write about life truths. And man does she present a LOT of them in “The Year of Yes” (which is dedicated to all the ways she starts saying “Yes” to life—from improving her health, to taking on more speaking engagements, to appearing on an episode of The Mindy Project).Highly recommend for anyone who is a fan of Shonda’s shows (there’s some fun backstories included–I loved Shonda’s take on Christina Yang especially); in search of stories about successful women; or in need of a boost of creative empowerment and/or wanting a dose of solid inspiration. A few scenes I bookmarked while listening—sorry for the bad transcription here, but I wanted to remember these and typed them up on the fly! “I thoroughly enjoy making stuff up; I do like to make stuff up. I love it. It’s also kind of ingrained in me. My brain naturally leans in the direction of half-truths. My brain turns toward fiction like flower to the sun…fabrication is like a bad habit that feels good….spinning tall tales is my dirty little vice….but it’s not just a bad habit. I need to do it. I HAVE to do it. It turns out making stuff up is a job. For real. Seriously.”(Shonda describes writing TV as laying a track for a train—how it's never-ending and she has to keep up—I loved the analogy): “When laying track feels like going from climbing a mountain on hands and knees to flying effortlessly through the air, like breaking the sound barrier. Everything inside me just shifts and I break the writing barrier. Feeling of laying track changes from exertion to exhalation. OWN YOUR GREATNESS: “You have to grab hold of it. You have to believe it….in order to be as good as Serena, you have to decide that no one is going to be as good as you are at tennis. Then you have to make it true.” On how she had to cut people out of her life as she started living a happier life saying ""yes"" to stuff: “Unhappy people don’t like when other unhappy people become happy”(YESSSSS–tuning in to my writing has made me an introvert) “There’s a certain amount of time alone I need just to have the brain space to write. To have what I call mental pantry time”(THIS--because I've never read something that better captures the struggle it is to be a writer and have to fight like hell to get to that place where the words can come)“Writing is the hum. Writing is the high. Writing is the track. Now imagine that hum, that high, that track to be laid is behind a door. That door is five miles away. Those five miles are just writing crap and doodling and trying to have an idea and surfing the Internet and hoping like hell you don’t get so attracted you don’t give up. Worse, those five miles are lined with brownies and cupcakes and episodes of Game of Thrones and Idris Elba waiting to talk to only you and really good novels to read. Every time I sit down to write, I have to mentally run those five miles past all of that, to get to that door. It’s a long, hard, five-mile run. Sometimes I’m almost dead by the time I reach the door. That’s why I have to keep doing it. The more often I run the five miles, the fitter I become. And the fitter I become, the easier the run begins to feel and the less fresh and exciting all that stuff on the side of the road seems. More important, as I get fitter I can run faster, and the faster I can run the faster I can get to that door. When you sit down to write every day, it becomes easier to tap into that creative space in your mind. The faster I can get to that door, the quicker I can get to the good stuff. Behind the door is the good stuff. So when I reach the door and open it, that’s when creativity clicks in. That special spot in my brain starts working and I go fro exertion to exhalation and I can start writing forever…and then someone opens the door and asks if I want coffee and I’m five miles away all over again.”“Writing and I are MFEO. …. I have no ability to downgrade my creativity in my soul. I have no desire to do so either.” “My happy ending is not the same as your happy ending …. Everyone has their own version of happiness. We all spend our lives kicking the crap out of ourselves for not being this way or that way, not having this thing or that thing, or being like this person or that person. For not living up to some standard we think applies across the board to all of us. We all spend our lives trying to follow the same path, live by the same rules…I think we believe happiness lies in following the same list of rules and being more like everyone else. That is wrong. There is no list of rules. There is one rule: The rule is, there are no rules. Happiness comes from living as you need to. As you want to. As your inner voice tells you to. Happiness comes from being who you actually are versus who you think you’re supposed to be.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Feb 11, 2016","Apr 03, 2016","Feb 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29540318-year-of-yes

(It was right around page 10, when our protagonist informs us that the guy at the gas station MASTICATES HER WITH HIS EYEBALLS....like, WTF? Pretentious much? Because WHO CHEWS ANYTHING WITH THEIR EYEBALLS?!) But I took a deep breath and soldiered on. In most ways, I'm glad I did. I can't say I ever really liked Tess. As our narrator, she's closed off. Cold. Nearly unknowable. But she's also the lens through which Danler lets us enter the behind-the-scenes world of one of NYC's most successful restaurants. And that.world.is.FASCINATING.It's very much an I-wrote-this-while-earning-my-MFA kind of read (complete with second person passages!) but all in all, I guess I'm glad I stuck with it. Why? I can't say for sure (the book left me feeling melancholy, pretty much like all the characters in it....also, I HATED its ending.) But like the best books do, it transported me to a world I'd never known before and for that, I couldn't stop turning the pages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 03, 2016","Jul 05, 2016","Jan 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26192646-sweetbitter

It's a hard concept to pull off, but in the hands of a talented writer like Sullivan (whose Commencement was also a MPOV novel), it's done remarkably well. Which is probably why I really engaged (pun not intended!) with this novel of hers, a story that casts a mega-watt spotlight on Frances Gerety, the copywriter responsible for elevating DeBeers and diamonds to the world, penning one of the most famous phrases in the history of advertising—""A Diamond is Forever."" If you're a Mad Men fan, you'll find a bit of Peggy Olsen inspiration in Gerety's character, a woman who was way, way ahead of her time when it came to being defined by her career. The chapters about her life and the elements of history about how diamonds came to prominence as THE jewel of choice for women were some of the most interesting of the book.Interwoven with Gerety's chapters were the time-spanning stories of four other characters—James, a down-on-his luck paramedic; Evelyn, a frustrated retired school teacher whose son's divorce is unraveling her at the seams; Delphine, who leaves behind the comfort of life in France for a lover she's taken in NYC; and Kate, a New Yorker who is happy with her partner, Dan, but sees no need to put a ring on their relationship.By the end of the book, I really admired the way Sullivan had pulled all these characters' stories together (hint: a diamond ring may have something to do with it!) My only criticisms were that Sullivan occasionally has a tendency to typecast characters (Kate especially drove me nuts—the descriptions of her read too much like central casting for Brooklyn Mom with Issues) and there were times where Sullivan's research came across as clunky (like she'd found a great fact about the diamond business in 1952 and needed to fold it in verbatim)Those small quabbles aside, I am truly amazed at the AMOUNT of research Sullivan did for this book. It's quite impressive and for that reason alone (along with it being an overall pleasurable read), I'd recommend it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 10, 2016","Jan 18, 2016","Jan 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20166980-the-engagements

The challenge comes when that friend In the short time since I’ve read this book, I’ve recommended it to no fewer than a dozen people (and counting). The challenge comes when that friend or coworker says, “What’s it about?” and I have to describe that it’s a memoir of a man who died of cancer. I watch their face fall as if to say, A death book? Oh man, Gail … I don’t think so.That’s when I start backpedaling, stealing the words of a er who speaks of how Paul’s words in “When Breathe Becomes Air” “crackle with life.” Because for as much as this book chronicles one man’s last days on earth, it’s a BEAUTIFUL rumination on how he lived them with fortitude (a lesson all of us, living or dying, need to hear). For me, the melancholy of finishing the last page came with the punch-in-the-gut realization that death has robbed the world of Paul’s incredible voice (and his talents as a neurosurgeon/neuroscientist). I could not believe how beautiful his prose was, how easy to read, how, even when he was suffering the effects of chemo, these were the pages he was able to produce. To say he was brilliant would be a massive understatement. I’m going to steal Ann Patchett’s words about Paul’s memoir because they are indeed so fitting: “Thanks to ‘When Breathe Becomes Air,’ those of us who never met Paul Kalanithi will both mourn his death and benefit from his life. This is one of a handful of books I consider to be a universal donor—I would recommend it to anyone, everyone.”I agree with Ann, which is why I’ll keep telling everyone I know about it until it ends up in their hands, too.A few of my favorite passages from “When Breathe Becomes Air” excerpted below: A beautiful sentiment of Paul’s: “You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.” Paul’s final words of the book to his daughter Cady (cue the waterworks): “When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a stead joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.” And my favorite passage in the gorgeous epilogue that Lucy, his wife, wrote Paul (because it speaks to all those tender moments that make a marriage the blessing it can be): “His diagnosis was like a nutcracker, getting us back to the soft, nourishing meat of our marriage …. [on their remaining time together] …. “We were as inseparable as we had been as medical students, when we would hold hands during lectures. Now we held hands in his coat pocket during walks outside after chemotherapy … He knew he would never be alone, never suffer unnecessarily. At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know to breathe.” That Paul and I formed part of the deep meaning of each other’s lives is one of the greatest blessings that has ever come to me.”[And finally, as some of you may know, Paul’s wife, Lucy, is the twin sister of Joanna Goddard, founder of A Cup of Jo, my favorite blog on the web. While Joanna is never referenced in the book, the fact that I’ve been a long-time reader of hers and that she has written of Paul’s death (and this book) several times on her blog, served as a powerful reminder of how the Internet can make the world feel so small]...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Feb 07, 2016","Feb 11, 2016","Jan 08, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air

For me, that's what makes reading her work worth it. I enjoy studying it, the details she notices and transfers through her readers, the way she structures her sentences. It's uniquely her own style (and I meant to capture a few examples here, but forgot to jot them down as I was reading!) Be that as it may, this book almost felt like I could wring the melancholy out of it. The protagonist, Lucy, was a woman so beaten down, so under-confident, that being inside her head reminded me of how Arrested Development always had those Charlie Brown moments throughout the series.I was talking with a friend of mine about ""My Name is Lucy Barton"" after I finished. I said it felt like almost *too* personal of a glimpse into Strout's life. Because the way she writes her characters (these here in this book and in her previous works) makes me think her home life was...well, less than pleasant (this was confirmed in hearing her completely clam up talking about when Terry Gross interviewed her some weeks ago on Fresh Air about Lucy).Overall I'm glad I read this because it's a slip of a novel that I plowed through quickly (curious all the way) but I would be selective on who I recommended it to—best for lovers of literary fiction and fans of Strout's (and anybody who wants to commiserate with a loveless family situation, perhaps)...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 19, 2016","Mar 23, 2016","Jan 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25893709-my-name-is-lucy-barton

Relationship drama + great characters=excellent storytelling no matter the age, am I right?Saint Anything happens to be Dessen’s latest book and it landed on quite a few Best of YA Books for 2015. It’s the story of a wallflower protagonist (Sydney), struggling in the shadow of her trouble-making brother (Peyton), who finds love and support from a family (the Chatams) that notices her in a way her family doesn’t. In short, it’s got all the trappings of a classic YA set up: conflicted girl, cute boy (that would be Mac Chatam), and a great supporting friend cast (Layla Chatam is all sorts of fun). As a writer who’s still relatively new to her craft, I love reading Dessen because she’s an author who *gets* story structure. I know some may find fault with this (that it's tiresome and formulaic) but guys, there’s a reason Sarah Dessen has sold like, 10 million books: IT’S BECAUSE STRUCTURE WORKS AND READERS LOVE IT. I’ve come to love deconstructing her books alongside the writing lessons I’ve picked up in 2015 from authors like Martha Alderson and KM Weiland. Maybe what I love most about Dessen is her voice. It feels relatable and real with very little ‘try’ (literary fiction types could learn a lesson or two from commercial writers like her when it comes to this), and for me, that’s what makes her work aspirational—because I want whatever books I write to be as relatable to my own future readers....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 29, 2015","Dec 31, 2015","Jan 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23009402-saint-anything

Don’t just tell them about this book, GUSH about it. That’s been me the past few weeks, as I finally got aroundWant to get dubious looks from people? Don’t just tell them about this book, GUSH about it. That’s been me the past few weeks, as I finally got around to reading Royal We. (On a serendipitous note, I started it on the 5-year anniversary of Kate and William’s wedding—a fact I wasn’t aware of until former students of mine tagged me in Kensington Palace’s IG post marking the occasion … these students having joined me at 5 a.m. on a chilly April morning in 2011 to watch the ceremony in my living room, scones and hot tea in hand.)Am I a “Royal watcher”? Yes, but not in a super fan kind of way. Nor would I be the first in line to pick up a book that is for all intensive purposes fan fiction of this famous coupling. So why did I? Because of the brains behind it.You guys, Heather and Jessica are GREAT writers. You’d know this if you’ve followed their Go Fug Yourself blog. (Which I have, on and off, for years—never without having at least ONE LOL-moment while perusing the celebrities whose fashion tastes they skewer; for a nice tie-in to Royal We, check out their recent retrospective on Kate and William—again, so many chuckles). So yeah, I fell HARD for this book. In it, the Kate character is an American, Rebecca Porter (Bex for short, which I ADORE), who leaves Cornell and America behind for a British exchange program that lands her at Oxford, rooming in the same hall as Prince Nicholas (married to a prince of a man named Nick myself, of course I ADORE his name, too). What makes this retelling work so well is just how SMART it is. I mean that in the best way possible. It takes clever writers to come up with the amount of wit on display in Royal We (case in point: Bex’s father is the inventor of the Coucherator, a couch that has a fridge in the base … remember how Kate’s parents own a party-planning enterprise? Also, the amount of fun Heather and Jessica have with nicknames and imaginary tabloid headlines for these two—“Trouble in Porterdise? Bexzilla Wants Nicky to Love Her More Than Britain”) Half the fun of reading this was turning the page wondering what kind of humor I’d rub up against as I kept going.Heather and Jessica pull something else off, too—they humanize Will and Kate. At multiple points throughout the book, I took what Bex and Nick were going through and thought about the royal couple as PEOPLE. Something that, for a lot of years, we haven’t seen them as, am I right? (figureheads, yes; gorgeous celebrities, yes; people who burp and cuss and can be crass behind closed doors same as the rest of us? Not so much). To get what felt like an “insider’s take” on what it’s like to BE them was strangely humbling (says the girl who one evening while reading tumbled down an Internet rabbit hole of Googling images of Will and Kate from their own college years).All that to say, there’s a reason why this book was lauded by the New York Times and Entertainment Weekly and Kirkus and Publishers Weekly. Because it DESERVES to be. Get over yourselves (if you happen to be one of those readers snubbing it as fan fiction, which you might think is somehow below you) and go buy it or check it out from the library because I promise you, you'll have one hell of a good time reading it.Also good to know: The book JUST came out in paperback (with a great cover) so there’s that ….. AND Lauren Graham (of Gilmore Girls) is slated to write the film adaptation with Mae Whitman (her Parenthood daughter and a wonderful actress) attached to star as Bex.

She's got a great voice and her writing is smooth; she's also a wonderful storyteller. But I have to admit I was a little drained by this book. I picked it up after reading Joanna Goddard (of Cup of Jo) praise it in audio format but for me, I grew weary of the narrator's voice, the way she put on so many different accents and inflections for the various characters. To use a food analogy (which seems fitting), too much salt can spoil a soup, you know what I mean? With audio reads, any time you find yourself being taken out of the story because you're distracted by, say, the reader doing her best Bronx accent, that's a problem.Subject material wise, as fun as it was to read Ruth's experiences as the New York Times restaurant critic (a position she held in the mid-90s), going to NYC restaurants in disguise, I just wasn't familiar enough with the culinary landscape of the city to appreciate this the way I'm betting a lot of New Yorkers would.I will say, however, that I immensely enjoyed the short Q&A that was conducted with Ruth herself at the back of the book (talk about a REAL New Yorker's accent). Perhaps my favorite part is when she responded to the question of when she writes, given that she also balances a day job (or did; having left the NYT to take on the editor role at Gourmet, a magazine that was shuttered in 2009). Her response captivated me because it is for the precise same reason that I wake (or try to most mornings!) and write myself:""Like most writers, I hate writing; I'd rather clean toilets. But I love having written. You sit down at your desk and half the time nothing good happens. But when something good happens when you're writing, it's a kind of magic that no other time. You disappear. You're sitting there and nothing happens and you look at your watch--it's 5 am; it's 5:30 am, but then, when you're lucky, something happens and the next thing you know, it's 7:30 and you vanished and there's something on the paper you can't even explain how it got there and you can't even explain how it happened.

I'm gonna go with an exercise metaphor: There are certain novels you read when you want a literary workout (Lauren Groff's Fates & Furies comes to mind). Then there are those that you approach like you would when you want something a little more gentle for your brain.

She has insomnia and soon enough, meets Eli, who suffers the same fate for entirely different reasons. Together well....you get to discover that one for yourself. It's one of those chickish love stories that's as comforting as a Lifetime movie and guess what? I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

Easy to read in one setting, though I chunked it out in a few more because I wanted to savor the lessons held within. A look at how to spend more time with God when your days are filled to the brim with being busy, as written by one of Saddleback Church's pastors (that's a group of pastors whose work I trust more than a lot of spiritual leaders out there).A few gems from the book I underlined (and there were many) highlighted below. This would make a great stocking stuffer gift for Christian followers in your life or anyone who might benefit from learning more about the gift of God's grace:• When I'm spiritually empty, my life sputters. Things feel different. Not good different—bad different. I'm shallow, confused, and anxious. • If guilt defines you, I'm so sorry. I pray that you'll come to see that you're not a ""lousy Christian"" if you don't have traditional quiet time with God. The Christian life is not about locks and chains. Jesus came to set us free. Yes, some guilt may serve as God's motivator, but too many Christians cower because of false guilt—aka condemnation—that they've headed upon their own shoulders because they've compared themselves to an unrealistic model and come up short. The guild is wrong and unfair, and it will weigh you down and wear you out. • God is at work in our lives ... There will always be some sort of mess God is working with. But every time we notice a positive change in our character, we can thank God because He's at work. • My connections with God are much more free-flowing (than they used to be). I read God's Word but sometimes I do it at home, sometimes at work, sometimes in the car. Other times I'll read verses I've written on three-by-five cards that I leave on my dash to meditate on while at stoplights. <---Love that idea! ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 17, 2015","Nov 25, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6083324-refuel

Fantastic research of the period (1914), tight story, fascinating glimpse into trends of the era (carrier pigeons! strikes! kidnappings!), as well as the not-so-subtle subtext being a woman during this time would have sucked (hurray for 1920 bringing with it our right to vote!). At the center of the story is Constance Kopp and her younger sisters, targets of a low-life factory owner and his cronies. How Kopp defies odds to take this man down after his automobile collides with the sisters’ buggy leads to her earning a badge as the country’s first female deputy sheriff.

Given I am elbows deep in the middle of a big creative project of mine, I felt inspired to do the same—this time on audio—and boy oh boy, I was NOT disappointed. First off, Liz's voice is SO soothing. I could listen to her read me the phone book, but even better here ... it's a compilation of her thoughts on the magic (literally!) of creativity, which I wholeheartedly believe in myself.Just a few of the lines on this re-reading that I wanted to remember:""Do you have the courage to bring forth the treasures that are hidden within you?""""The universe buries strange jewels deep within us all and then stands back to see if we can ever find them. The hunt to uncover those jewels, that's creative living. The courage to go on that hunt in the first place, that's what separates a mundane existence from a more enchanted one. The often surprising result of that hunt? That's what I call BIG MAGIC.""""A creative life is an amplified life. It's a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner, continually, and stubbornly, bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you, is a fine art in and of itself. Because creative living is where big magic will always abide."" On the assistance of genius — ""When that assistance does arrive ... the sense of the moving sidewalk beneath my words ... I am delighted and I go along for the ride. In such instances, I write like I am not quite myself....while it's happening, I thank the mystery for its help. And when it departs, I let the mystery go, and keep on working diligently anyhow, hoping that someday my genius will reappear. I work either way, assisted or unassisted, because that is what you must do in order to live a fully creative life. I work steadily, and I always thank the process, whether I am touched by grace or not, I thank creativity for allowing me to engage with it at all. Because either way, it's all kind of amazing, what we get to do, what we get to attempt, what we sometimes get to commune with ... gratitude always. Always gratitude."" ""Wake yourself up in the middle of the night in order to be alone with your inspiration while no one is watching...you don't need that sleep right now, you can give it up. What else are you willing to give up, in order to be alone with your beloved?""""Do what you love to do, and do it with both seriousness and lightness, at least then you will know you have tried, and whatever the outcome, you have traveled the noble path.""Review from First Reading, October 2015:For my creative soul at least, this book feels sort of sacred. Like, I could never do its pages justice. So many dog-earred corners, but here's a passage from one such page (and there are MANY)....was not prepared for how much this book would exceed my expectations!!""So take your insecurities and your fears and hold them upside down by their ankles and shake yourself free of all your cumbersome ideas about what you require ... in order to become creatively legitimate.

I was struck over the course of its pages how, the older I get, the more I'm softening for women's fiction.

What I enjoy most about Weiner's writing are her characters—I felt like I knew Rachel and Andy (admittedly, I might have had a crush on the latter myself) and that is a testament to her storytelling ability.What I've discovered in the past three years is that writing a book is damn hard work. To make people believable, to make readers want to turn the pages, to craft a plot tight enough that even with a few nods of predictability we want to keep living in it, is no small feat.

The plot started off so strong, sucking you in with the children of a couple discovering letters from their father's lover before their mother gets ahold of them. Then it unravels because Pierpont seems to care more about style over substance—spending more time describing the world of her characters (so many little observations that, by the end, damn near pulled me out of the story) than fleshing out her characters.By the time I reached Part II (where she flashes forward in time), I wanted to throw the book across the room.

That’s exactly how J. Ryan Stradal’s incredible debut ""Kitchens of the Great Midwest"" unfolds. I picked it up because 1) that cover art (gorgeous, no?) and 2) it had Midwest in the title (Midwest tales have my <3) but the tale I discovered inside—about the young food prodigy Eva Thorvald who grows up to become the country’s most sought-after chef—had me turning the pages as fast as I could. Spot-on storytelling that makes for a perfect read for foodies, folks who love literary fiction, and anyone who appreciates plot lines with characters so real you feel like you personally know the people (ESPECIALLY if you grew up in the heartland).

(Matter of fact, I'm excited to pick up The Engagements here soon.) I say that first and foremost because what I loved best about this book is her talent. This story? At times? Ehhhh not so much.I mean, I loved the characters—Bree, Sally, April, and Celia. I loved that they were experiencing college together, sharing in 20-something memories that in many ways felt both familiar and real. And I also loved that they were four individuals who were totally flawed (because women, especially, are multi-faceted creatures, right?).What I didn't love? All the parts that read like Sullivan wrote her senior thesis at Smith College (where the book is set) ABOUT Smith College, then cut up the pages into strips she felt she had to insert into this book.In my view, its 400-plus pages would have greatly benefited from some cutting on the editorial side of things(at least 20 pages worth), most of it coming from the points about Smith that Sullivan insisted on making multiple times. Like how Smith is the Lesbian College Capital of the world. (Which, while likely true...at least according to the Google searching I felt compelled to do post-read, it still felt like this point in particular got crammed down our throats time and time again.) Overall, Sullivan a great author. This was her first novel (and it's at least 6-7 yrs old now, with two out since), so I'll be curious to see how her skills have evolved in subsequent reads. If her characters in those books are half as well-drawn as these four best friends, I'm sure to fall hard for them....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 02, 2015","Aug 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6080420-commencement

Maybe it's because I'm obsessed with her show, but I could ""hear"" Mindy reading these stories to me and it was such a pleasant reading experience for that reason alone. When I got to the chapter on things her friends should bring to her dinner party, I laughed out loud so hard I had tears in my eyes. Dang she's funny.Act Two, wherein Gail marvels at how Mindy does everything she does: Reading the essay about Mindy's work day (which starts at 5 am and ends at midnight) in between lulls in my own work day made me appreciate what a hustler she is. That girl PERSONIFIES ambition. And I love that she's not afraid to OWN that. Her knack is owning it in such a way that never makes her sound like a selfish, deranged nutcase (maybe it's because she's got a creative job? If a banker worked 20 hours a day, we'd call him/her a workaholic with a completely different connotation). Also, mid-way through the book is when I texted my friend a pic with an excerpt from an essay in which Mindy reveals the ""sexiest thing that ever happened to her"" and typed, ""PLEASE LET THIS BE ABOUT CHRIS MESSINA"". The read-between-the-lines-effect of this book? SO STRONG.Act Three, wherein Gail decides Mindy is the best in the biz at writing these tell-all-y memoirs: It was around the point I had my nose buried in the essay about Mindy revealing her short-lived fling with a member of President Obama's security team that I realized she's TRULY amazing at this--and by this, I mean this whole writing books thing. Then I thought, but why am I surprised by that? This is what she DOES for a living (versus some comedians whose memoirs have been less than stellar...ahem...Amy Poehler...ahemm) Anyway, I loved Mindy's command of her material, how she gives the rub to people who have pissed her off (she BURNS a Vanity Fair reporter for an unflattering food-related portrayal of her in an article he wrote about her years ago), how she's funny and REAL, and how you can just tell these essays were easy for her to write (they had to be—she must have wrote them in the four hours a day she wasn't at work!)In short (ha! the irony, given everything I wrote above), this new book of Mindy's does NOT disappoint.

A whole nation of people needing to pare down in the wake of disaster and needing someone to help them do it. Marie is so huge in her native country now they call her the Beyonce of tidying!) Note: I get that there are some mega eye-roll moments to this read. For instance, I will never talk to my possessions, I will never fold my socks, and I will never unpack my bag every night when I get home from work. But, that aside, I am such a proponent for tidying your house and its effects on your life that I'm willing to look past these kookier elements of Kondo's philosophy to appreciate the greater results she aims for with her method). ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 15, 2016","May 25, 2016","Apr 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up

IBack in July, Martha Brockenbrough was one of the faculty members we brought in for our 2015 Midwest Writers Workshop here in Muncie (where I live). I sat in on her session on writing and as she spoke, I felt an actual thrill run through my body—to me, she was that inspiring of a writer.Which is why I had high hopes for this read and in NO way was I disappointed as I devoured this beautiful book of hers—one that has snagged a slew of awards and nominations in 2015 for being one of the best YA books of the year.Only, I found myself wondering, IS this book YA? It is and it isn't, in the sense these characters of Henry and Flora (he's white; she's black) are young pawns in a twisted game of fate between the immortal characters of Love and Death in a story that transcends any genre I could think of ... instead it read like a wholly original book that was its own dream-within-reality genre. Combine a great story with rich history (its setting is in the 1930s); wonderful musical knowledge (Martha is a musician and clearly knows her subject material); and vivid descriptions of Seattle (where she lives) and for me, this was a high-stakes story I couldn't put down. It's gotten a lot of comparisons to The Book Thief (that whole Death as a character bit) but while it didn't feel anything like it to me, I believe fans who love Markus Zusack would also love Martha's prose. And here, from the Kirkus Review, which pretty much sums up my thoughts about the book (the ""luscious prose"" part especially): Kirkus Reviews (starred)A lovingly realized Depression-era Seattle becomes the field of play for the latest round in the titular, age-old game. In February 1920, Love and Death choose their newest pawns as infants: Love's is Henry, a white boy of privilege; Death's is Flora, the soon-to-be-orphaned daughter of African-American jazz musicians. Brockenbrough's precise, luscious prose cuts back and forth among the four protagonists. Race, class, fate and choice... join Love and Death to play their parts in Brockenbrough's haunting and masterfully orchestrated narrative....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 14, 2015","Dec 20, 2015","Apr 14, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20308537-the-game-of-love-and-death

I'm excited my campaigning paid off, making this our next pick, because I'm really looking forward to talking more about ""The Martian""'s edge-of-your-seat plot with these women (and will be similarly gunning for them to come with me to see the film since I'm already obsessed with its cast!)To counter my positivity about the book, I *do* understand the criticisms lobbed against it. Its geektastic exposition is cumbersome at times and yet, once the plot expanded beyond this one guy's story of being stuck on Mars (incorporating everything that was happening back on Earth to try and save him), then I couldn't put the book down. I anxiously speed-read my way to the end to see what would happen to this brilliant, goofy astronaut who'd been stranded alone on the Red Planet for more than a year. As I was talking about ""The Martian"" with a girlfriend, I summed up my feelings about it with the following anecdote: There once was a generation of men and women that, on a hot summer night in 1970 (and if you're a Mad Men viewer, you just saw a version of this play out on the small screen), held its breath collectively as it watched an astronaut safely take man's first steps on the moon. Not since that fateful night has there been a story so massive, on such a POSITIVE (plenty of negative to counter this) scale, to capture the world's attention. Which is why this particular odyssey of one Mark Watney gave me a bright, shining glimpse of what a moment like that to come might be like. If all of us would set aside our differences amid the trials of the day--war and famine and drugs and poverty and politics among them--and join together to express collective hope for a mission that by then would stand for so much more than the science involved.

But people, this book. THIS BOOK. Shew. One of the few times in my reading life I needed a day of transition to ease my way out of it and back into reality. Once you dive into the world of Jude, JB, Willem and Malcolm, you, too, might have to claw your way back out (sometimes willingly, like when the writing gets darker than dark, and other times, like when you’re living in its many, many happier pages, less so). I can’t quite describe what it is about Yanagihara’s writing that felt so inescapable, but clearly I’m not alone. Consider what The New Yorker had to say: “Yanagihara’s novel can drive you mad, consume you, and take over your life. Like the axiom of equality, “A Little Life” feels elemental, irreducible—and, dark and disturbing though it is, there is beauty in it.” It’s this beauty that critic Jon Michaud writes of that sustains you as you read “A Little Life.” There are passages so magnificently crafted you want to read them twice, memories shared by these friends you want to claim as your own, and a feeling throughout that you are in the hands of an immensely talented writer who never tries to be clever about the story she is telling (if you love character-driven stories, then you will LOVE her writing). I might also add that Yanagihara’s knowledge and research of so much—medicine, art, music, architecture, and law to name but a few—is one more reason this book is so beautiful, jaw-droppingly so at times. Yet (as some of you might know), there are also a LOT of scenes that delve into Jude’s tortured past, episodes so difficult to read (some of the hardest subject material I’ve come across in fiction) that you might (as I did) have to take a break to compose yourself enough to go on. If you do, that’s okay. Chances are great you’ll come back to the story because “A Little Life” is a marathon read that demands to be finished. When you finally get there, don’t be surprised if you turn around and give your partner a hug or get up and call your oldest friend. I did the same thing myself.A few other observations:• I would go see JB’s retrospective in a heartbeat. Williem Listening to Jude Tell A Story… I just …. I CAN’T EVEN [insert bawling faced emoticon here]• The Little Life Instagram account is fascinating to follow—insights from the author and scenes of NYC that correlate with the book…those pics of Lispenard Street fascinate and gut me at the same time: https://www.instagram.com/alittlelife...• When you read widely and often, you’re always seeking characters who will live with you long after the page—some for days and months, others for years. This NYC foursome is a “years” kind of cast. Should I ever hear of anyone cutting themselves, I will forever think of Jude. When I spy an architectural model, I’ll think of Malcolm. And if the scent of sandalwood happens to be in the air, I will (so fondly and wistfully) remember my favorite HY character, Willem.• Does anyone else want to be adopted by Harold and Julia too? And for that matter, join me in the I Hate Caleb club?• Lastly, if I had one fault with the book it was that, in Jude’s final scenes, his memories felt repetitive and never-ending. A friend of mine who read it at the same time (so many texts exchanged b/wn us over various OMG plot points!) speculated that perhaps this was intentional—Jude is an insufferable character in so many ways, it may have been a case of the writing reenforcing this right up until the end. (Also, a grammatical aside: Anyone else feel there were instances of misplaced modifiers multiple times in this book? I think it was the all-male cast that led to this but sometimes I was like, what ‘he’ are you talking about?!)To end on—if you, like me, want to talk about, read about, obsess over this book, hit me up in the comments, but also see:Vulture: How I Wrote My Novel: http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/how-ha...Wall Street Journal: How Little Life Became a Sleeper Hit: http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-little-...Slate’s Interview with HY: http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/bo...HY’s Late Night appearance: http://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-se...Bustle: 18 Quotes from ‘A Little Life’ That Are So Relatable It’s Unreal: http://www.bustle.com/articles/68505-...The Atlantic: A Little Life—the Great Gay Novel Might Be Here: http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainm.......more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 20, 2015","Jan 03, 2016","Mar 04, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22822858-a-little-life

I've lost interest in watching them play out on screen (probably because there are so few options these days!), so I was all too happy to pick up Taylor Jenkins Reid's newest, Maybe in Another Life. The Sliding Doors-ish story of 29-year-old Hannah Martin captured my attention right from the get-go. I loved the dual ways Reid carried the story through to the end, hooking readers with plot lines involving Hannah and two VERY different men. The book had me craving cinnamon rolls, obsessing over top knots, and smiling at the way Reid deftly managed to bring both of Hannah's ""lives"" to satisfying ends. One of those rare reads that had me up until 2 am—I couldn't put it down because I had to find out what happened to this flawed but lovable protagonist! ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2015","Mar 03, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23492661-maybe-in-another-life

My book club selected it for its March pick and I have to say, I think it made for maybe the best discussion we’ve ever had.In large part, that's thanks to Emily St. John’s flair for storytelling: Station Eleven is an incredible work of literary fiction that follows a cast of characters on the eve of a virus that decimates the globe. (It’s also masterfully told in nonlinear fashion which is no small feat for a writer to pull off!) What all of us in our club touched on was how the book just doesn’t let you go. How we found ourselves thinking about it even when we weren’t reading it (and long after)—how we would fare in a world in which there is no more Internet or air conditioning or a thousand other modern conveniences St. John Mandel points out (in haunting language) are no longer available to people after civilization collapses. (For me, a particularly disturbing scene involved a character who no longer had access to his glasses and thus had become a stunted version of himself because he was basically blind; as someone with horrific vision, this deeply affected me, the idea of living in a world where you remembered sight but no longer had access to the things that helped you see — or, as she touches on, what about those who lose access to life-saving medications? Well..she answers that too: They die, of course.) It’s this unsettling, overarching plot paired so beautifully (and brilliantly) with some great subplots (Station Eleven refers to a graphic novel that has enormous significance to multiple characters throughout the course of the narrative) that make you understand why this was one of the most buzzed about books of last year. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 27, 2015","Mar 08, 2015","Feb 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

Let’s forget this “working mom” stuff. Because it’s a word that seems to come with a LOT of baggage and quite frankly, I’m sick of it. “Working mom” has this icky connotation to it, a leaves-a-bitter-taste-in-your-mouth sentiment that can make women feel guilty for taking pride in not only bringing value to a workplace, but also their home. So I think the next time someone asks me about being a “working mom”, I’m going to rephrase things. I’ll tell them I’m a “career-loving parent” who, as journalist Mary Curtis (quoted in Lean In) describes, “is just doing the best she can with what she’s got.” That’s life as a parent with an 8-to-5 job in a nutshell.Many kernels of wisdom from this book I can see slipping into future conversations I have with friends. Here are a few I wanted to remember:• Women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce. Instead, they make a lot of small decisions along the way, making accommodations and sacrifices they believe will be required to have a family. Of all the ways women hold themselves back, perhaps the most pervasive is that they leave before they leave.• The cost for two children (an infant and four year old) to go to a day care center is greater than the annual median rent payment in every state in the country (AKA, why Nick and I don’t have a second child yet)• (these next few are from the great chapter “Make Your Partner a Real Partner”): Whenever a married woman asks me for advice on co-parenting with a husband, I tell her to let him put the diaper on the baby any way he wants as long as he’s doing it himself. And if he gets up to deal with the diaper before being asked, she should smile even if he puts the diaper on the baby’s head. Over time, if he does things his way, he’ll find the correct end. But if he’s forced to do things her way, pretty soon she’ll be doing them herself. (SUCH TRUTH TO THIS; at so many points in this book, I found myself being SO grateful to a husband who truly splits this parenting gig 50-50 with me)• When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool boys … the crazy boys. But don’t marry them. The things that make the bad boys sexy do not make them good husbands. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks women should be smart, opinionated, and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects, or even better, WANTS to do his share in the home. These men exist, and trust me, over time, nothing is sexier. (AMEN SHERYL!!!)• Research supports when husbands do more housework, wives are less depressed, marital conflicts decrease, and satisfaction rises. When women work outside the home and share breadwinning duties, couples are more like to stay together. In fact, divorce rates reduce by about half when a wife earns half the income and a husband does half the housework (FASCINATING).• Today, stay-at-home moms spend about 17 hours per week on primary child care, on average, while mothers working outside the house spend eleven. This means an employed mom today spends about the same amount of time on primary child care activities as a non-employed mom did in 1975. (YESSSSSSS!!! So glad to come across research that validates this opinion I've had. Growing up, my mom stayed at home, but I don’t remember her being crazy hands-on with me—Sheryl attests to a similar childhood…I’m actually a bit overwhelmed at the extent/way many moms parent today…this helicopter madness doesn’t feel healthy to me nor does it allow a child the kind of opportunities to grow their imagination on their own)• Sheryl quotes several studies that are reaffirming to working moms. The key finding being: “Exclusive maternal care was not related to better or worse outcomes for children. There is thus no reason for mothers to feel as though they are harming their children if they decide to work.”• The best advice anyone can offer is ""for women and men to drop the guilt trip, even as the minutes tick away. The secret is there is no secret-just doing the best you can with what you’ve got.” (I feel like I need to get this printed as a poster to hang in my house) ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 21, 2015","Feb 27, 2015","Feb 21, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16071764-lean-in

So why bother starting this  off with this? Because if you're like me, when you start telling everyone and their brother about this book, you'll owe it to the author not only to remember her name, but how to say it correctly.Within the first few pages of ""Everything"" I knew I was going to love Ng's writing style: Her prose is effortless, uncomplicated, but IMPECCABLY written. There's also just enough detail mixed in--and it's the RIGHT kind of detail, the kind that makes you wish you were as observant as she is. At 292 pages, ""Everything"" almost felt TOO short --which again is a testament to Ng's writing. That while it's actually an appropriate length for a novel, it reads in that I-can't-put-this-down sort of way that happens with the best of books. (Which IMO is an even bigger accomplishment given the genre this falls under--literary fiction).Another way I knew I loved this book? I slowed down reading it as I neared its end. You ever do that? Try and live in a great book a little longer by putting off its last few pages? Which to me says even MORE about Ng's talent when the narrative is as bleak as this is. ""Everything"" tells the story of the Lee family, Chinese Americans living in rural Ohio: father James, who's a professor fearing he's fallen short (in life in general); wife Marilyn, who's living with the ghost of becoming her domesticated mother; and their three children, Nath, Lydia, and Hannah. Within the first few sentences, you know that Lydia is the favorite child and that she happens to be dead. But it's the way the fallout of her drowning affects the rest of the family that makes for the real surprises in this story. Like I said, remember Ng's name. I have no doubt, with a debut as great as this, you'll be hearing it again.

How they’re as good as they are now is a mystery to me, after a hundred years of systematic denial that they’re human. I wonder what kind of miracle we could make work with a week’s decency.""That's a grown up Jean Louise Finch giving it to Atticus for his regressive views on race. In so many ways, coming to those lines made plowing through the rest of this messy first draft worth it. This much-maligned book is unquestionably an editorial disaster (lots of POV switch ups, rambling monologues, and lengthy backstories--an undisciplined first draft at best) and yet, I’m glad I dove in to it.

I've gotta admit, now that I stayed up late last night, then rose early this morning to finish (in that delicious hour before anyone else, when reading feels like the guiltiest pleasure), HECK YEAH IT IS. All the buzz for this is that it's the ""next Gone Girl"" and it's an apt comparison. Only instead of one unreliable female narrator, Paula Hawkins' gives us three--all great, all wanting something different and yet, in so many ways, the same thing. There is Rachel, the drunk who starts the story with her keen observations aboard her daily train into London; Megan, the woman Rachel sees from the train whose life she fantasizes about (though for reasons she'll soon discover, shouldn't); and Anna, the one who unites them, whose philandering gives her what she wants yet will burn her in the end.The book is fast-paced and leaves you guessing until a point where, even though you suspect the outcome, you still plow through to find out how Hawkins takes you to the end. As I often do, I read some articles on the book and discovered the author sold ""The Girl on the Train"" on a partial manuscript (fewer than 100 pages and an outline): If you're unfamiliar with how the publishing world works, you should know this is EXTREMELY rare. Meaning her agent and her editors all knew she was on to something (and what a satisfying something it was--particularly that ending...I loved the last line and the way it brought the story full-circle).In interviews she gives, Hawkins seems surprised at the book's success, but she should hold on--the buzz is only going to build from here. As the bookseller in this article noted, “The Girl on the Train is intense, and it’s in an Internet sense ‘shareable ...by that I mean, once you read it you want your friends to read it too so you can talk about it. Once a book becomes viral like that, there’s no slowing it down.” (Source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/b...)So yeah, prepare yourself to hear a LOT about this one, if you haven't already.

Barnum's career BEFORE his circus empire (which didn't get under way until he was in his 60s), and how General Tom Thumb was the wee catalyst who launched his entire career.

On the other hand, there were a LOT of passages that made me squirm: her recounting of her first masturbatory experience; the youthful touching of her sister while the two shared a bed--which, though it made me uncomfortable, in NO WAY did I consider it abuse, as critics have alleged; and that time she outed her sister. (Writers who turn a family member's challenges/decisions into their own always make me twitch a bit; see David Sedaris on this as well). Maybe it's because she's still young and eager to prove herself, but Dunham's work in this collection feels unnecessarily coated in a sticky layer of shock value. To me, the infuriating thing is she's a brilliant enough writer it doesn't need to be! And while in no way do her life experiences smack anything close to mine, I still found myself captivated by the ""lessons"" she's learned along the way.

In this case, that might have been a bad thing. Because I found out he works for an ad agency, one for which he was part of the team that wrote the copy for that Clint Eastwood commercial, ""It's Half-Time in America"" (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRRJx...). Once I knew that, I couldn't keep that macho style of writing from leaking into my head as I was reading. Knowing Henderson worked on that project (which is awesome, yeah, but I feel a tad overwrought too), I could see so much of the same footprint in style here.

So glad I did as ""We All Looked Up"" will be one of my most memorable reads of 2015, particularly in the YA genre. Its plot--an unlikely friendship forged among four high school seniors trying to come to terms with the world-ending likelihood of a giant asteroid crashing into Earth--is genius and Tommy's writing really beautiful. My only complaint (and it's not a criticism) is how I finished it (in bed, at 5 am, having last put it down at midnight the night before) feeling incredibly melancholy (particularly in relationship to the outcome of one of the major characters, a personal favorite of mine). Seeing as how many of my favorite books leave me feeling this same way, I'm still beyond happy to have read it.

Don't get me wrong: There was plenty she DID manage well -- many of the chapters were humorous, duh (one of my favorites was the one Mike Schur annotated; see also her breakdown of everyone from the cast of P&R) -- but overall, there was a melancholy feel to the material that just ... brought me down in a rather unexpected way.In talking about it with a friend afterward, I told her I suppose this is because, when you finish one of these ""meant-to-make-you-laugh"" memoirs, you expect to feel lighter, happier, more inclined to want to be this person's best friend.

While Rowell handles the secondary fanfic plot of Baz and Snow remarkably well, admittedly my eyes kind of skimmed certain sections of theirs (only because I just wanted more Levi!) Needless to say, this was a definite favorite read of 2014, capped off only by getting to see Rainbow speak that month in Indianapolis.

I'm not sure how much I'll keep up with Claire and Jamie (hats off to Diana Gabaldon for keeping up with characters over EIGHT books, and SO MANY PAGES), but this is one of those reading experiences I'll never forget. Don't we all love getting lost in the pages of a good book?PS - One of my favorite memories of reading this book is that the experience happened while I was at a rental cabin in Tennessee with my husband's family. The night I finished the book (at like, 2 am), I woke up the next morning desperate for coffee. I reached up into the cupboard and the first mug I found was an I <3 Scotland mug.

Lucky for me, Lori is a FANTASTIC writer and while I don't delve into the mystery genre often, her debut has me looking forward to reading more! Lori is an alum of the university where I work and, like me, also works in higher education. Which is probably why I gravitated toward this plot line as much as I did: The story of a sociology professor, Amelia Emmet, shot by one of her former students, and the mystery of why. In her journey of healing, Emmet encounters quite a few ghosts from her pasts and reaches the bottom of things with help from her new grad assistant, Nath (who admittedly, I found myself developing a half-baked crush on). Lori does the dual POV between Ameila and Nath very well here, and the pages of this one go fast. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2014","Jan 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18666094-black-hour

Abbott has created a story so true to life the reader might well feel she's living in its pages. In The Fever, she's plucked a ""ripped from the headline"" concept (remember those girls in New England a few years back—the ones who all were falling prey to the same strange illness?) and crafted a gripping plot around it, one that keeps you glued to the page, start to finish. (I like what this Slate er has to say about her: ""There are lots of authors who write books you want to devour, but, to borrow an old construction from that esteemed literary critic Yakov Smirnoff, with Megan Abbott, her books devour you."" Source: http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/bo...)The main characters of the novel are members of the Nash family: 16-year-old Deenie; her older (dreamboat) brother, Eli; and their divorced dad, Tom, a chemistry teacher at the high school where both kids attend. When Deenie's friends (first Lisa, then Gabby, then more of her female classmates) start being struck with a mysterious affliction, the entire town ends up nearly delirious with worry, everyone convinced by a different conspiracy as to what may be going on. (It's remarkable how Abbott's words, the way she paints scenes in this book, particularly the night the school's PTA and board is confronted by all the angry parents, can leave you, the reader, feeling anxious and paranoid yourself.)What I love best about Abbott's writing is how tight it is. No words are wasted and just the right amount of detail is added in (and there is a lot of great detail here——descriptions of the town, its mysterious lake, the banalities and mysteries and backstabbing of high school). When you finally do figure out what's going on, the way the lives of the Nash family have intersected with the book's other (incredibly drawn) supporting characters, you still won't want the book to end. Only because immersing yourself in a world as vividly rendered as this one makes returning to real life a bit of a bore when you do. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2014","Jun 20, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18656036-the-fever

(We read this for our book club and all felt this way, though we said that while her editor perhaps might have also felt this way, he or she wasn't going to go toe-to-toe with the 'great' Donna Tartt)I had quite a love-hate relationship with this one. There were moments (especially early on, when Tartt so touchingly and hauntingly portrays Theo's confusion and sadness over the loss of his mother in the bombing) that were on par with the brilliance I expect from Tartt based on her earlier work (The Secret History being one of my favorite novels). And then there were times I felt my eyes glazing over, especially when Tartt found the need to give every minor character two to three pages of backstory--like, Jesus, GET ON WITH IT ALREADY. This was especially true toward the book's end, when Tartt took readers on a crazy international journey that lead them to the bottom of the seedy underworld of stolen art (or, in this case, Amsterdam). It was in this final leg of the book where I felt more lost than at any earlier point, but by then, I really didn't care if I couldn't keep my gangsters and mobsters straight, so anxious was I to finish the book. (Also, a note on that ending: I could have done without the approach Tartt chose of cramming a 10-page lesson on philosophy and art into it---that felt out of sync with the rest of how she told this brilliant story, didn't it?)And still, even with the faults found by this particular reader, STILL I would tell people to pick up The Goldfinch (assuming they were die-hard readers up for the challenge of tackling a heavy-ass tome of a book). I don't regret having finally picked it up (and, Pulitzer Prize winner that it is, I now see what all the buzz--good and bad--was about). I guess my only regret is ultimately the way I felt about it, wishing I could say I loved it more than I did (though, to be sure, I doubt I'll ever forget Theo or, perhaps the best gift The Goldfinch gave us, even better than a goose chase over a tiny little painting, the character of BORIS!)

No surprise that I would turn to Harvey Karp for answers, since his Happiest Baby on the Block book (he of the great ""swaddling"" fame) saved me as a new mother in those very early days of parenthood! His Toddler answer to his parenting series has been no different, providing me some GREAT solutions (and insight into the toddler mind) that have really helped sooth my frayed nerves during this difficult transition into a new era of parenting. As Harvey says, toddlers are challenging until they're about 4 or so —which means, you know, we've only got about another 2 years to get through this stage (and then it's all smooth sailing right?

It's masterfully written (Lockhart is among the best of the YA authors out there now) and filled with the kinds of vivid metaphors and imagery that, along with a compelling plot, make it impossible to put down.A few lines I want to remember (most relating to Gat, one of those literary crushes who's well worth having—and props to Lockhart for making him such a multi-dimensional character, both in his diversity (I loved that he was Indian) and his thoughts and actions):“He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.”“If you want to live where people are not afraid of mice, you must give up living in palaces.”So when will they start filming the movie? A few early casting picks: Vanessa Redgrave as Tipper Sinclair (the grandmother) (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000603/?r...)Joely Richardson as Penny, Cadence's mother (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000613/?r...)Suraj Sharma as Gat (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4139037/?r...)Chloe Grace Moretz as Cadence (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1631269/?r...)**A final parting thought: I LOVED Johnny. For being a secondary character, Lockhart put so much life into him my guess is he HAD to be one of her favorite characters to write! ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 17, 2014",not set,"Apr 16, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16143347-we-were-liars

Like, WHAT IS IT that makes her writing SO damn good? And I think it's this: The entire time I read Astonish Me, I never once thought there was ""too much try"" to her work—-not even a hint of it. There are some writers out there who, in their effort to keep up with all the accolades and buzz (and there has been plenty of both heaped on Shipstead in recent years, especially with the kind of talent she has at just 30 (!!!)), feel such a need to please that it comes across for readers of their work. But Shipstead's prose reads effortlessly, carrying with it the kind of inspiring lines that showcase her keen eye at observing life (especially those moments I think we all feel but have never read in print before)I read recently how literary fiction is best described as work that's written in such a way it leaves its readers enthralled with the writing, mulling over lines long after they've read them. And if this is true, than there may be no finer example currently at work producing it than Shipstead herself. I look forward to having at her debut novel, ""Seating Arrangements"" soon too. One line that I loved in ""Astonish Me"", among MANY because it was so damn good (along with a plot that was SO thrilling—I think about ballet now constantly): ""Sometimes I wonder,"" Joan said, her mouth red from the punch, ""how you're supposed to know if you're really feeling what you think you're feeling.

I mean, I found the plot of this e-novella (wherein what lies ahead for us is a world in which a strange, disturbing insomnia has gripped the nation, forcing people with healthy sleep patterns to donate their sleep to the less fortunate in a kind of futuristic blood bank of zzzs) to be fascinating.But about mid-way through, I hit a snag of sorts with Russell's writing that reminded me of why, despite the hoopla that surrounded it, her ""Swamplandia!"" failed to stack up for me in EXACTLY the same way. And I think it's this: Russell's writing overreaches and, at times, can easily pass as being condescending to the reader. I mean, I'd like to think I'm a well-read person, someone with a more than average/decent vocabulary. But when I'm highlighting words on my phone, ones she's chosen to use as her adjectives of choice, searching for their meaning ('chitinous' shell of sarcasm? the actual 'ungulate'? 'nacreous' skin?), then enough already. I mean, WE GET IT. You're REALLY REALLY smart and you have the vocabulary to prove it (and I don't know..maybe hold degrees in biology and astrology and Greek mythology? Seriously, the girl knows her stuff in those departments or else no way would she be drawing from the banks of words she does to describe the everyday and mundane.) It's just ... weird for me...I've yet to experience this phenomenon with any other writers I read, this disconnect of sorts in wanting to like the writer more than I do and feeling that the promise is there if she would just, I don't know, maybe get out of her own way a little bit (or have an editor to address this issue with her). And who knows, perhaps I'm the only one to feel this way about Russell's work (and it's likely I am, publishing darling that she is), but I just think if she would lose hold on her tendencies to overreach with all those descriptions of hers, then her books would be that much better——out-of-the-ballpark awesome even.

She has a way of writing description that pulls you right into the scenes she's creatinThis was my first Alice Hoffman novel and I really enjoyed it. She has a way of writing description that pulls you right into the scenes she's creating—just enough and not too much. In this case, it's the world of New York City shortly after the turn of the 20th century, when the city was just beginning to define itself with all the changes being hurled at it (electricity and automobiles among the most significant) and the disparity between rich and poor was at its most extreme.Along with describing how the landscape of the city was changing at this time, Hoffman captured both the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire (more than 140 people died in it; the grossest case of worker mistreatment in that city's ugly era of injustice for the urban, working poor) and the fire that happened at Dreamland along the Coney Island boardwalk a few months later so, so well. Her main characters in this are Coralie, a young girl who's living under the thumb of her maniacal father, Professor Sardie, whose museum of misfits and extraordinary things is losing out to the growing popularity of attractions farther down the boardwalk, and Eddie Cohen, a young Jew who becomes estranged from his father, taking up with a photographer and later capturing the city's seedy underside from behind his camera. How these two meet make for a gripping love story (though Hoffman makes you wait for hundreds of pages before she gives you the pay off) but it's a good one, so it's well worth it. (The scene where Eddie sees Coralie in the yard of the museum for the first time still is burned into my brain, two months later.) My biggest fault with the book overall was its construct: This might be the first time where how a book was told actually stood out to me, and not for the right reasons. Hoffman alternates points of view between Coralie and Eddie—and that's fine, but she then alternates those between first and third person (using italics to switch off). AND THAT WAS MADDENING. This book was read for a book club I'm in and we all were in agreement this technique did nothing to add to the story and would have made an otherwise great read that much better had it just been told in one point of view or the other (not both; especially not when having TWO narrators to do so only added to the confusion, especially since she time hops between those POV narratives)A few lines that stood out: Eddie: ""No wonder I had closed myself off. Love like this was all consuming. I found that I was jealous of the strangest things—sunlight, streets, curtains, even her clothing, anything that was close to her.""Eddie: ""He felt overtaken by his love for her. Love like this wasn't what he'd planned or wanted or expected, surely it was indeed a trap, for even when you tried to run way, it followed you through the grass and lay down beside you, it overtook common sense and willpower.""Coralie: ""It was an ordinary life I wished for, and that is what I have.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 08, 2014","Apr 20, 2014","Mar 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18144053-the-museum-of-extraordinary-things

In the hands of a writer like Butler, an author who's clearly put the time and effort into making the story one with great flow, these elements have aligned in such a way to elevate ""Shotgun Lovesongs"" to the five-stars, favorites shelf—-at least, for me anyway.On my end, I suppose Butler gets extra bonus points because he is a Midwesterner too (someone who also takes PRIDE in that fact, I might add), and because, a few years into my 30s myself, I felt a kinship with these characters in a way I probably wouldn't have at 23 or even 25. And I'll admit, it probably *also* stoked my love a bit (at the very least, it first piqued my interest) this whole Justin Vernon-Bon Iver angle of the book (that now everyone can't stop talking about). But for ALL these reasons and more, I'm confident ""Shotgun"" will wind up my favorite read of 2014. A book that, as a writer, I expect to keep thinking about for much of the rest of the year too. (For the sake of record keeping, in 2013 that title for me went to Meg Wolitzer's ""The Interestings""; 2012 I didn't exactly have one ... ""Fault in Our Stars"" perhaps? and 2011 was Chad Harbach's ""Art of Fielding""). There's plenty that's been written already about the plot of this book—five 30-somethings in a small town in Wisconsin, all trying to find their way in life while figuring out the challenges that accompany it: loyalties, friendships, relationships, finances, a sense of belonging. The most notable of the group is Lee, who's struck it big as an indie musician (here's where that Justin Vernon comparison comes in, Butler being from the same town as the Bon Iver frontman), but the characters who ground the entire book (and the ones whose chapters I eagerly awaited most) were Henry and Beth, the married couple of the book, good 'ol salt-of-the-earth people tied to their family farm, struggling to stay afloat, but content in so many ways (I saw in them traits of many of the people I grew up with in my small hometown in Indiana). You know a book is good when you don't want to quit its characters, when they stay with you even off the page, and it seems like, once or twice a year, I experience that with a title. I certainly did with ""Shotgun."" And while occasionally I found Butler to want to overwrite a scene, the instances were seldom enough (and stopped just short of trying too hard) for it to really bother me. Especially when there were so many other wonderful lines to treasure. Here are a few still on my mind a few weeks after reading:• ""Maybe it's a good thing, from time to time, to spy on other people's lives. For me, anyway, it has the effect of making my own life feel like a well-loved thing.""• [I loved this scene of Henry and Beth in a taxi, as throw-away as it may seem...chiefly because I'm always a little in awe of an author who captures a moment in words something I've experienced before that no one else has ever attempted to put down on the page] ""He looked down at me, his chin compressing itself, the type of angle you only see on the face of a person you love—his nose hairs, the crow's feet about his eyes, his hairline, gently receding. I pulled his face down to me, and we kissed.• ""It's a funny thing, being married to someone for so long, being someone's best friend for so long. Because on those few occasions when they surprise you, it feels like the biggest thing in the world, like a crack in the sky, like the moon, suddenly rising over the horizon twenty times bigger than the last time you looked."" (such a BEAUTIFUL line and so poignantly true)• America, I think ,is about poor people playing music and poor people sharing food and poor people dancing, even when everything else in their lives is desperate, and so dismal that it doesn't seem that there should be any room for any music, any extra food, or any extra energy for dancing."" Related: With the book being so new, after finishing, I hopped online to read a few s and was lucky enough to catch Butler in a live Q&A. When I asked about the status of the book being turned into a film (Fox Searchlight is working on the script), I brought up actors for characters and suggested that Ryan Gosling would make one hell of an awesome Lee. He agreed, but mentioned that the Hollywood types thought Justin Timberlake. I knew I already liked the guy, but when he wrote, ""This made me cringe a little ... in my soul"", I laughed out loud. YES. God, PLEASE don't let JT (""The Serious Actor"") get his hands on that role.

He has a knack for writing material that's very on point for the times (case in point: he folds in a lot of famous people of today, along with skewering some of this country's latest bad habits—need another food of your photo posted to Instagram anyone?)I'm a huge fan now of his written work— I think my only critique might be that reading this all in a sitting or two (as I more or less did) is a disservice of sorts to the material, since there are SO many stories (all of them VERY short..like, a few pages at that) that, by the end, you'll probably forget having read at least half of them (oh well, just a great excuse to go back and have another chuckle at them again!)Here's perhaps the shortest example:""If you love something, let it go.""""If you don't love something, definitely let it go.""""Basically, just drop everything, who cares.""If you smiled at that, then trust me, you'll want to pick this one up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 27, 2014","Mar 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18007533-one-more-thing

I have a feeling this is one I'll be touch-and-go on recommending to people. For starters, it's short stories, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea (it's not my usual favorite, but I'm learning to love them more, especially since I want to be able to write more of them myself). Second, Saunders writes with a creepy vibe. It's a vibe I appreciated the more and more that I read, but I'm not sure it would sit well with everyone. But here's why it worked for me—Saunders' flair for black comedy. Even when I was reading some of the most disturbing stories presented here (the brilliant ""Escape from Spiderhead"" where the character of Jeff is sent to a experimental prison where he and several other characters are guinea pigs on display, and ""The Semplica Girls Diaries"", where a father keeps a diary of gifting his daughter Semplica Girls, young girls saved from human trafficking that become lawn ornaments), there was still just enough ""something"" that was comedic enough about them for you to want to keep reading, to even smile wryly at Saunders' ability to get away with it—it being writing about some of the absurd concepts he does (WHERE does he come up with this stuff?!)I appreciated the unique voice given to the characters of every story. Hands-down my favorite though was ""My Chivalric Fiasco"". I just...OMG I laughed so hard at that one ...to the point where the guy at the place I was having my oil changed looked at me funny.

So many great quotes from this title...here are but a few:“Friendship is born at that moment when one man says to another: ""What! You too? I thought that no one but myself . . .""”“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”“Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”“People who bore one another should meet seldom; people who interest one another, often.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Feb 2014,"Mar 29, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30633.The_Four_Loves

Primarily because, like so many GoodReads readers, I'm a huge fan of Rainbow Rowell's writing. It's quick, clever, and engaging—in short, one hell of a great way to spend an afternoon. I especially loved the early banter in this book between protagonist Georgie McCool (what a GREAT name! I read that it came from Rowell's love of the song Georgy Girl along with the town McCool Junction in Nebraska ... source: http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/bo...) and her TV writing partner, Seth (and their lackey, Scotty). There was a line Seth had about Georgie coming into the office, wearing her mom's bejeweled clothes (""You look like Britney Spears, back when she was dating backup dancers and walking around gas stations barefoot..."") that made me laugh out loud. It's moments like this—especially with her dialogue— where Rowell shines most as a writer.My only criticism with the book is that, while the concept was a fun one (of Georgie finding this magical landline phone that let her connect with her husband from when they were dating in 1998, leaving their troubled marriage behind for a few nights), it started to wear on me a bit as I reached the end (especially as Georgie kept driving herself crazy in trying to find the meaning of discovering this ""magic"" phone). Also, I think maybe it was because it felt like Georgie and Neal kept having the same conversation—both on the phone and in her head. But those small quibbles aside, there's still plenty to love about Landline: Rowell's wonderful use of pop culture references, her smart dialogue, her great insights on life and marriage and getting what you want, and, let's not forget, a FABULOUS shout-out to ""Leather and Lace"" (God I love that song...and now I'll have it stuck in my head all day).Already I'm ready for whatever it is she'll put out next. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 12, 2014","Mar 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18081809-landline

(This often times is what happens with books I read wherein, mid-way through, I discover the Hollywood ideal for the character in question; thankfully, in this case, I'm 100 percent sold).At any rate, I liked that, in the end, Veronica took this series where it NEEDED to go. It was a bold ending that some hated but I appreciated. And I liked the dual perspective of Tris and Four (because honestly, Tris bored me a little bit overall). So those last 50 pages or so? They saved this one for me, big time.** I also have to note I'm a fan of Veronica's for multiple reasons (including the way she was able to write such an elaborate series at the young age she is) but I'm especially grateful to her for answering questions I posed to her for a magazine article I'm writing related to the writing workshop where she met her agent.

Then I read King’s sage words on the topic and just …. let it go. It all felt very free. He writes extensively on the topic (around page 163). Here were a few lines worth remembering:“You may wonder where plot is in all this. The answer—my answer, anyway—is nowhere. I won’t try to convince you that I’ve never plotted any more than I’d try to convince you that I’ve never told a lie, but I do both as infrequently as possible. I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible. It’s best that I be as clear about this as I can—I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves.

Knowing it was YA and knowing it had just won the Newberry Medal, I ordered it. What I discovered is that The One and Only Ivan is this author's soul-stirring fictionalization of a true story. There really WAS a gorilla named Ivan who was forced to live in a pen at a SHOPPING MALL (if you want to know more, as I did, here's a good place to start: http://www.zooatlanta.org/ivan). I recently read that the author had learned of Ivan years ago in a NYT article, clipped the article out and held on to it in her ""idea file"". I'm so glad she did!Where Katherine Applegate excels with this book is in walking that fine line of childhood whimsy-meets-adult-wisdom with Ivan's thoughts as he processes life in his cage (with his friends, Bob the dog; Stella the elephant; and, eventually, little Ruby, the elephant who inspires him to change his life).This is one of those stories that, whether you have a child to read it to/with or not, it'll tug at your heart strings. Well worth the time and investment. Passages I Want to Remember: My life is flashing lights and pointing fingers and uninvited visitors. Inches away, humans flatten their little hands against the wall of glass that separates us. The glass says you are this and we are that and that is how it will always be. // Many days I forget what I am supposed to be. Am I a human? Am I a gorilla?

BUT, I’ve been mulling the concept of “grace” over in my mind a lot this past year and my mother-in-law let me borrow this title as a great way to help me explore the concept. Max’s writing may be a bit fluffy or simplistic for some folks, but I found this to be a quick read and one that reenforced a lot of what I love best about my relationship with God and His Son.Passages I Want to Remember: “To accept grace is to accept the vow to give it.” // “Saving grace saves us from our sins. Sustaining grace meets us at our point of need and equips us with courage, wisdom, and strength. It surprises us in the middle of our personal transatlantic flights with ample resources of faith. Sustaining grace promises not the absence of struggle but the presence of God.” // “Grace is the gift of feeling sure that our future, even our dying, is going to turn out more splendidly than we dare imagine.” —Lewis Smedes // “If you ever catch yourself thinking, ‘I can do whatever I want because God will forgive me,’ then grace is not happening to you … Grace creates a resolve to do good, not permission to do bad.”Would I Recommend? Depends on the audience. For those who, like me, are interested in learning more about the concept of grace and are open-minded to Christianity, I would. For those new to this religion or more skeptical about religion in general, this could be one of those books you start but never finish....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2013","Jun 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13664840-grace

But I absolutely adore Corey's writing style and I've recently started drafting a new YA manuscript that is futuristic in its concepts but set just far enough into the future so that the plotline can still focus on themes popular in contemporary YA lit. Because Corey tackles the melding of these two aspects SO DARN WELL in ""Noggin,"" it felt like a great read to dip back into again for inspiration. Of course, it didn't disappoint. If anything, I found the characters to be even richer and funnier the second time around. 2014 Review: I can't be the only reader who, immediately after picking up a book, flips to the photo of the author at back, right? I mean, aren't you curious about whose work it is you're getting ready to dive into? So when I did this with Noggin (though believe me, it was hard to tear my eyes off its AWESOME cover—SO clever), I knew immediately upon seeing John Corey Whaley's photo I was going to like this book. That—and it was just a hunch, but a good one—it was going to be the literary equivalent of that dimpled smirk JCW was wearing on the inside jacket. Three hundred odd pages later and I can say ABSOLUTELY IT WAS. Only better because I found myself being SO impressed with this guy's talent (at what? THIRTY?) that I couldn't help but think ahead (HA! look at that …a head pun…I'm CONFIDENT JCW would appreciate that one!), knowing he's got so much more great work in store for those of us he's winning over as fans.Here's what I had to say about Noggin over on my blog, which I think sums it up best: You have to trust me when I say that while the plot is a bit out there (a kid whose head is cryogenically frozen comes back to life, five years later), the author does a brilliant job of making the focus as much a charming, witty, coming-of-age story as a sci-fi mind bender. Also, talk about a GREAT first line: Listen—Travis Coates was alive once and then he wasn’t. Now he’s alive again. Simple as that. Can’t wait to read more from this guy!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Aug 05, 2017May 12, 2014","Aug 10, 2017May 18, 2014","Jun 21, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/18049084-noggin

This title was the July pick for my local book club, elsewise I'm not sure it would have been at the top of my stack.I had read some of Fowler before (I enjoyed her Jane Austen Book Club years ago) and I was encouraged about reading this one after spotting so many ""I can't put this book down"" s on Amazon and GoodReads. The verdict for me? Well, let's just say I COULD put it down. And did, many nights before I drifted off to sleep. It's not that this book was BAD (far from it), I just found myself losing interest in the plot at times (which took off in a million directions). At its core, WAACB is about a young girl named Rosemary, her siblings (sister, Fern and brother, Lowell) and the complications of what stands for a sibling bond when animals (particularly a they relate to animal rights and cruelty) are involved. To say more might reveal a bit of a plot twist for future readers ... Fowler is certainly a great writer, but the biggest weakness I had with this title of hers was her distracting use of detail. As several of us in the book club noted, there were SO many details (about Bloomington, Ind. (where Rosemary's father was a professor); UC Davis (where Rosemary would attend college) and on the topics of psychological studies and theories) that many of us felt the story itself got a bit bogged down in all of that research (or, as one noted, ""I got to wondering,' Did this whole thing REALLY happen?' The answer? No, it did not). A solid read, overall, just not one that blew me away is all.Passages I Want to Remember: Language does this to our memories—simplifies, solidifies, codifies, mummifies.

Whenever it is, I'm glad Rick Yancey got his incredible book, The Fifth Wave, in before it happens.This book was kind of like The Walking Dead meets Aliens meets (as we're getting accustomed here with this genre) a pretty satisfying love triangle.

She is a Christian author, one who writes honestly and transparently about so many real-life topics and issues — from finding yourself in your 20s and the values of friendship, to the trials of parenthood and the importance of family. Whereas a few people I’ve recommended her work to over the years have come away finding her to be too saccharine or prone to humble bragging, many more have told me they, too, have fallen in love with her voice just as much as I have. Every story of Shauna’s shared over the course of her three books has felt like a conversation to me, Bread & Wine being no different. Perhaps that’s why I love her so much — because, as an aspiring writer myself, I know that as easy as she may make it seem, that is no simple feat.About the Book: Bread & Wine is Shauna’s third collection of essays, this time focusing on her love of food and family and the dinner table. As she says, “a series of love letters centered on life around the table.” Over the course of its four parts, Shauna shares stories about a host of topics, from growing up in Michigan and the legacy of her mother’s blueberry crisp as a Sunday night ritual to her trial-by-fire turn as a chef at a culinary boot camp in her home city of Chicago. What I loved most about Bread & Wine (beside all the DELICIOUS sounding recipes for various appetizers, salads and entrees) is how well Shauna captures our relationship with food and the memories it can evoke for us. Whether it’s the way a chocolate mousse takes her back to a trip to Paris with her husband or how the preparation of a certain salad is her signal to the start of summer, Shauna’s words are a culinary trip down memory lane. They also made me think about my own food-centric memories …how sacred I’ve come to view meal times with my own family, both as a child and adult. For me, the best thing about reading Bread & Wine is that it’s introduced me to thinking about words and cookbooks and recipes in a new way. Shauna has inspired me to delve more into a world of smells and tastes between two covers (for starters, I just finished this cookbook and am in LOVE with it…more on that in a future !) The older I get, the more I fall in love with the therapeutic ritual that is cooking and providing a wonderful meal for myself and my husband (and some day, my son). As I’ve long said, it’s my personal form of therapy and it’s books like this one that only make that love affair deepen.Passage(s) I Want to Remember: One thing’s for sure: If you decide to be courageous and sane, if you decide not to overspend or overcommit or overschedule, the healthy people in your life will respect those choices. And the unhealthy people in your life will freak out, because you’re making a healthy choice they’re not currently free to make. Don’t for one selcond let that stop you. Either I can be here, fully here, my imperfect, messy tired but wholly present self, or I can miss it — this moment, this conversation, this time around the table, whatever it is — because I’m trying, and failing, to be perfect, keep the house perfect, make the meal perfect, ensure the gift is perfect. But this season I’m not trying for perfect. I’m just trying to show up, every time, with honesty and attentiveness.Recipes I REALLY Want to Try: Maple Balsamic Pork Tenderloin, Bacon-Wrapped Dates, Watermelon Feta Salad, Robin’s Super-Healthy Lentil Soup, Blueberry Crisp, Dark Chocolate Sea Salted Toffee, Basic Risotto.One I tried and falled in love with? Annette’s Enchiladas. OMG are these SO good! They’ll now be my go-to dinner for any new parent or friend in need of a hot meal! Just check out that yummy-ness!Would I Recommend? Most definitely! The thing I love MOST about Shauna and her books is the way she constantly reenforces this idea of “Me too! I thought I was the only one! I love that too!” type of thinking through her thoughts and words. She seems so down-to-earth and yet hip at the same time, that I would die to have her sit down at the dinner table with me. Truly. (And I’m SUPER envious of her cooking club that she writes about in the book!) I also think this book would be wonderful as an audio book, particularly if it were narrated by her. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 20, 2013","Mar 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16182601-bread-and-wine

Which is why reading this newly released historical fiction title about Zelda Fitzgerald was RIGHT up my alley. What I knew about Zelda going into this was that she was considered zany (the original Flapper girl!) and suffered from mental illness later in life. What I learned in reading this book? Her life was so much more complicated—and incredible—than that. I also learned that her relationship with Scott was rife with complications and yet, those two seemed fated to fall in love (despite the way they almost destroyed one another in the process…As Fowler explains in her footnotes, you’re kind of either Team Zelda or Team Scott the more you read about this pair). Also, reading this made me believe life among all those ex-pats in Paris in the ’20s? A TOTAL soap opera.

It made the perfect pocket companion as an e-book on my phone over the past two months.

You don't have a career. You have a life. Do the work. Keep the faith. Be true blue. You are a writer because you write. Keep writing and quit bitching. Your book has a birthday. You don't know what it is yet."" ...... ""You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both direction. Don't waste your time on anything else"".....""Most things will be okay eventually, but not everything will be. Sometimes you'll put up a good fight and lose. Sometimes you'll hold on really hard and realize there is no choice but to let go. Acceptance is a small, quiet room."" .... ""Your assumptions about the lives of others are in direct relation to your naive pomposity. Many people you believe to be rich are not rich. Many people you think have it easy worked hard for what they got. Many people who seem to be gliding right along have suffered and are suffering. Many people who appear to you to be old and stupidly saddled down with kids and cars and houses were once every bit as hip and pompous as you."" .... ""The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks.

The novel shares the real-life account of Cambodian Arn Chorn-Pond’s escape from the Khmer Rouge and it is one of the most “I-cannot-believe-this-actually-happened” true life stories I’ve ever read. Nearly two million people—one quarter of Cambodia’s population—died during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the late ’60s-early ’70s. So many time as I was reading this, I thought to myself, “And where was THIS story in my history book?” I was shocked and embarrassed to know so little about what happened there in the Killing Fields. Arn’s story (as told to writer Patricia McCormick) traces his separation from his family, to his life surviving death camp (a decision to voluntarily play music for the soldiers saves his life), to the trials of his life in America as a refugee (where he continues to this day to speak about his life under the Khmer Rouge). It’s a haunting journey, one readers of this book won’t soon forget.Passages I Want to Remember: “In just one day a person can get use to seeing dead body.” // “I see some kids die in the field.

She’d found me on account of my love of male writers Joshua Ferris (whose Then We Came to an End is one of my fave books of the past 10 years) and Jonathan Trooper (who is one of my all-time fave writers. Period.) The truth is, John Kenney’s Truth in Advertising does have a lot of that same sardonic wit to its pages. Its plot focuses on Fin Dolan, an advertising exec whose luck has been on the outs since breaking off his engagement to the woman of his dreams. The storyline follows the ups and downs of his career with one of New York’s biggest ad firms (he pitches diapers for a living, which makes for a lot of jokes in the book). At the same time, Truth also chronicles Fin’s painful past. Things come full circle when he has to care for his dying father and reconnect with a family he long thought was in his rearview mirror.Passage(s) I Want to Remember: “What a thing it is to live in New York City. To move here and not know a soul. A clean slate, a chance to walk away from the past and start anew…I will feign coolness. I will slowly learn the art of not showing that I am surprised or impressed or moved. I will feel the elation that comes from anonymity. I will feel the comfortable loneliness of wandering the avenues in the rush of humanity, the side streets by myself.”Would I Recommend? My problem with the book was it lagged a lot in the first half. What those early chapters lacked in emotion, Kenney tried to make up for by writing prose that often tried too hard to be funny, edgy and/or philosophical. Where the plot finally decided to pick up was when the author chose to focus on Fin’s family struggles. Only then did the pages started to turn a lot faster for me.

I haven't read a novel this compellingly addictive since ""One Day"" (which perhaps comes to mind because both books are weepy British cross-overs; one already a mega-hit, ""Me Before You"" sure to follow this year). Readers will finish this lopsided love story majorly conflicted, especially so depending upon their spiritual and religious beliefs. But to explain why reveals more than I want to share about its plot or ending. So let me just say the story of Lou Clark, a 26-year-old working class girl who becomes the care assistant to Will Traynor, a victim of quadriplegia in the wake of a motorbike accident, is unshakable. There are so many tender moments contained in its pages (if you've read it too, you'll know what I mean when I say the gift of those bumblebee tights is just one of them). So many maddening circumstances (if only Lou could convince Will to change his mind for love..will she have enough time?!). But, most of all, so many scenes that stir such deep feelings of empathy for Will's condition that, at times, you too might have to put the book down. That's because Moyes paints life as a quadriplegic with such poignancy, your heart feels as though it will be crushed by the weight of the burden this once vibrant, still handsome man must endure.Overall, I can't say enough about this must-read. It will anger some, sadden all, but, most of all, I hope it makes its readers live outside of themselves. Even for just a minute. And I'll end with Schillinger's final line to her excellent  (found here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/boo...

""Bernadette""'s plot is about as clever as they come: Told through documents, secret letters and e-mails, the story focuses on 15-year-old Bee's efforts to find her mother, Bernadette, a reclusive creative whose embarrassment over the failure of an L.A. architectural project years ago has left her slightly unhinged. When her husband, a Microsoft big-wig named Elgin, decides his wife needs mental help just days prior to their departure for a trip to Antarctica (a promise made to Bee for good grades), Bernadette flees and it's up to her family to put the pieces together of the mystery that is trying to find her. The book's setting is Seattle and Semple, herself an LA-to-Seattle transplant, skewers the city quite a bit (though she has since said she's fallen in love with living there). Her insights into living there (like Seattle's love for five-way stops) are quite hilarious. What am I saying-- the whole BOOK is hilarious (not that I'm surprised, given that Semple's background before turning novelist was a screenwriter for two of my favorite shows, Mad About You and Arrested Development). I found myself slowing down finishing this because I didn't want this book to end -- I wanted to see what other smart ways she was going to let this plot pan out. And while the ending may have been a bit far-fetched (though, to her credit, Semple has indeed been to Antarctica herself -- I mean, WHO TAKES A VACATION TO ANTARCTICA?

After reading Bread & Wine earlier this spring, I felt inspired to pick this cookbook up and I’m so glad I did! I found myself totally immersed in Jenny’s life story, about remembering the days her mom went back to school and her dad made breaded chicken cutlets every night for five years. How she and her husband started to explore cooking in their tiny New York City apartment in their early 20s. And, perhaps most of all (given the season of life I’m in), I enjoyed reading about how Jenny managed to keep dinner time sacred in her home after the addition of her two daughters, born barely a year apart.As I read this book, I found myself exclaiming out loud several times, “Yes!” or nodding my head in agreement with something Jenny had written (like the passage I excerpted below). Because you see, somewhere between my late 20s and the age I am now (31), I’ve become obsessed with preserving the dinner hour in my own home. I’m grateful that I was raised in a house where my mother (who stayed at home with all four of her kids) had dinner on the table every night without fail. Sometimes I was a brat about what she served (I recall a year where I felt like we ate nothing but casseroles and as an 8-year-old, tuna noodle casserole instantly made me stick out my tongue), but for the most part, my mom has been and always will be the best cook I’ve ever met. The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve realized food is my mother’s love language — she bakes the best pies, she volunteers with funeral dinners at our church and her potato salad is legendary. So I’m lucky that I had her in the kitchen as the foundation for my love of cooking.So now, while I may be a working mom, I subscribe to the work philosophy that Jenny wrote about here in DALS: I never want a job that keeps me from being able to put dinner on the table for my family. I’ve become a big believer in the philosophy that if more people could just return to cooking AT HOME, with REAL INGREDIENTS, our nation would go a long way to healing its health crisis. (Apparently the incredible Michael Pollan’s new book is all about this very subject — I shared this article of his on Facebook earlier this week). There is something beautiful in the routine of coming together as a family over food and I so look forward to having those moments with Dean and any future children Nick and I might have in the years to come.Passage(s) I Want to Remember: I was starting to shape a theory about dinner. I found that if I was eating well, there was a good chance that I was living well, too. I found that when I prioritized dinner, a lot of other things seemed to fall into place: We worked more efficiently …, we had a dedicated time and place to unload whatever was annoying us about work and everything else, and we spent less money by cooking our own food, which meant we never felt guilty about treating ourselves to dinner out on the weekend. And perhaps most important, the simple act of carving out the ritual—a delicious homemade ritual—gave every day purpose and meaning, no matter what else was going on in our lives.Recipes I Loved: What’s fun about cooking—really cooking—is exploring recipes and learning new techniques you’d never tried before. Which is how I came to discover the beauty of an egg wash on the dough of Jenny’s YUMMY chicken pot pie (who knew it took a bit of egg white to make a crust look SO golden-y delicious?!) and also how I decided to make Jenny’s recipe from the book for curried chicken with apples. I LOVE exploring ethnic cuisine (even though it totally intimidates me; I blogged about my first attempt at making Indian food a few years ago).Would I Recommend? Here’s who I think this book would be perfect for: New brides (this would make a WONDERFUL shower gift), families with little kids who enjoy cooking (because Jenny is a wonderful example of how you can still make dinner (with a variety of courses) a priority despite all the families out there who may insist you have to live off chicken nuggets until your kid is a teenager); foodies (duh!); and anyone curious about a cookbook that, while it IS a cookbook, reads just as much like a wonderful memoir as a collection of delicious dishes. You can do yourself a favor first and spend some time on Jenny’s blog if you want …I didn’t have to, but in the time since, I’ve become obsessed with it and find it to be one of my daily reads!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 28, 2013","Apr 06, 2013","Nov 22, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13043698-dinner

But in such a beautiful way. For when you read about Mary Anne, you are humbled by what an incredible individual she was —- a feminist who blazed trails in the 50s-60s with a career as an Ivy League admissions counselor, mother and doting wife; a human rights activist who worked tirelessly up to her death for refugees and victims of abuse worldwide; an incredible Christian with a welcoming heart, open mind and keen intelligence shaped by the thousands and thousands of books she read in her lifetime. Some readers may be turned off by the way Schwalbe writes in detail about the numerous books he and his mother read together in the book club they formed in the hours they sat and waited for Mary Anne to undergo her chemo. Yet I loved all the descriptions (of both the books I'd also read and even those I hadn't) and the way Schwalbe could write so effectively about them without giving away too much of their plots for those who may still want to read them.While I knew the entire time the book would end with Mary Anne's death, I felt the ending was anything but depressing. More so incredibly uplifting and a powerful example of a life well lived, cut short too soon. Favorite lines: ""We all have a lot more to read than we can read and a lot more to do than we can do.

She was a mother. And she worked. ""People don't talk about working fathers,"" she once said to me. She came to as many of our school plays and sports events as she could.

All that to say, I'll do what I have to do (in this case, break my ""no e-books"" rule) to keep up my penchant for reading fiction.With Attenberg's ""The Middlesteins"", the focus of the novel is on Edie Middlestein, an obese, depressed Jewish housewife whose eating habits are putting her life in danger and tearing her family's relationships apart at the seams. Nowadays, with our nation's preoccupation with food, it could be the storyline of far too many Americans' lives. I debated whether to pick this one up -- I'm a huge sucker for family dramas, but even I recognized this one wasn't going to end happy. And yet, as dreary as this book's plot turned out to be, I found myself tearing through it, so vividly does Attenberg paint these characters (along with Edie, husband Richard, daughter Robin, son Benny and daughter-in-law Rachelle) and the drama of their lives. Reading through s of the book, I felt the words of Washington Post fiction editor Ron Charles were spot-on in describing its greatest strengths: ""The range here is small. Except for Richard leaving his wife, these are not people prone to change or drama. Attenberg’s success lies in miniatures; she mutes even the few potential moments of conflict, focusing instead on the inaudible repercussions. But with a wit that never mocks and a tenderness that never gushes, she renders this family’s ordinary tragedies as something surprisingly affecting."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2012","Nov 22, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13525938-the-middlesteins

For this National Book Award winner, Katherine Boo spent five years getting to intimately know a handful of Indians who call Annawadi--a makeshift slum in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai Airport--home.It's incredibly harrowing to think this is a non-fiction narrative. That the people Boo meets, teens like the entrepreneurial garbage sorter Abdul, aren't figments of her imagination but real flesh and blood individuals. Boo is careful to balance her storytelling in such a way that you never quite feel sorry for these families, despite the utter disgust you feel for the way they are forced to live. What Boo comes to realize is that all of them are doing what they can to rise above their surroundings, even if that entails sorting through trash for 12 hours a day or bending their moral rules to get what they want. What struck me in particular was the corruption Boo encounters in every facet of the city. When Abdul's family is accused of contributing to a neighbor's death, there is little they can do to prove their innocence if they don't want to pay their way out of it (with everyone from the police to the hospital to the legal handlers accepting bribes to bend the story in the family's favor).I couldn't help but feel this time of year was a particularly good time to read this book. As we enter a holiday season when so many Americans are standing in line overnight for the latest iPad or flatscreen TV, this book was a powerful reminder of the excesses we convince ourselves we *have* to have to feel complete. What would we do if we had to live like these residents of Annawadi? If we had to stand in line for water 3 hours every day? If our home was a shack with a dirt floor?

Now, I've since read a critique from a mother of two who liked Tracy Hogg's take on ""E.A.S.Y."" parenting too —- until she actually HAD the baby. And then discovered it's not a perfect mold. Which, I get ... you can't apply one parenting concept to every kid. That said, what I liked about Tracy's take on parenting versus some other articles (even books) I've read is how she really drills in this idea that, YOU GUYS--IT'S COMMON SENSE. Yes, parenting is hard. But so much of it is in the approach, and the more even-keeled you are about it, the better off your baby is going to be. Ahhhh...reassuring words to someone who, despite her best efforts, feels like she can't go anywhere these days without getting conflicting parenting advice from family/friends or coworkers. Overall, Tracy's biggest recommendation is to get your child on a routine. Sure you might have to change it up some, but if you follow a routine pattern with them from the get-go (eating/activity/sleeping/some time for you), you're far more likely to have a baby with a better temperament whose needs are being met than one who gets to call the shots in the house. Overall, this is probably my favorite (more) technical parenting book I've read yet. My only fault with it? About halfway through, in researching a bit more about Tracy on the Internet (Tracy who talks about how she's British, which led me to picturing her as this perfect British nanny, right down to the accent), I learned that she died about 10 years ago (at only 44!) from cancer.

Prior to now, her work was lumped on that pastel-hued shelf of chick lit authors I'd pass up in favor of other (what I considered smarter) reads on the bookshelf.For what it's worth, I DID find myself getting sucked into the story: Marian, a 30-something NYC TV producer who has to deal with a knock on the door one night and the presence of a stranger who turns out to be her long-lost, 18-year-old daughter, Kirby. A daughter she gave up for adoption but never stopped thinking about. There are a few (predictable enough) plot twists in the book that I don't want to say too much about, only that I became a BIG fan of Conrad. (if you read it, you'll do the same, trust me ;) ) It's clear from the get-go that Giffin's books aren't meant to be serious reads. While the subject material does delve into serious matters, the writing is such that it reads more like a movie script than a serious novel.And that's the thing, I'm sure it already IS a movie in the works.

Something I'm working on in 2016 is scaling back with this technique, especially when I have a tendency to abuse it. But dang it all if Brene's insights weren't so great in this (my first read of hers) that I couldn't help myself. I'll share some of my favorites below, but overall a few thoughts:1) Brene's writing grew on me--I've read enough about her to know she feels her strength is as a researcher, less as a writer. Initially, I felt that a bit ...her writing seemed to get stronger in certain passages, like on applying vulnerability to how we teach and parent (coincidentally, these were my favorite).2) I wish I have skimmed the Appendix before reading the book....for a lot of the time, I kept wondering WHAT research Brene? She refers to her work throughout, but in a 30,000 foot sort of way (or specific comments people have made to her post-lectures, etc.). It wasn't until I get to the very end and the appendix after (which is 20-ish pages long) that I thought, Ahhhhhhh HERE we go! Lines/concepts I loved from Daring Greatly (and I should mention, as many others have, I've already recommended this book to half-dozen people I know!)• I loved Brene's breakdown of what vulnerability IS (as a creative, I constantly feel like I'm there, but just don't always know how to describe it): ""Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren't always comfortable, but they're never weaknesses.""• ""What's worth doing even if I fail?""--I've heard other writers refer to this idea; I think Brene's the one who owned it first.• Saving this just because I really like the way Brene defines empathy (and want to remember it!) ""Empathy is connecting with the emotion that someone is experiencing, not the event or circumstance.""• LOVED Brene's anaylysis of the three forms of shielding that people employ in their ""vulnerability arsenal""...1) foreboding joy (dread that clamps down on momentary joy, ie, My life is so great...but what if my husband dies in a car accident tomorrow?) 2) perfectionism (if only you do everything perfect, you'll never feel shame) and 3) numbing ('nuf said)• One of my favorite passages of the book: ""When we stop caring about what people think, we lose our capacity for connection. When we become defined by what people think, we lose our willingness to be vulnerable. If we dismiss all the criticism, we lose out on important feedback, but if we subject ourselves to the hatefulness, our spirits get crushed. It's a tightrope, shame resilience (those affirmations we tell ourselves to counter our 'gremlins') is the balance bar, and the safety net below is the one or two people in our lives who can help to reality-check the criticism and cynicism""• Brene's definition of what a leader is was revolutionary to me--I definitely want to remember this! ""I've come to believe that a leader is anyone who holds her or himself accountable for finding potential in people and processes. The term has nothing to do with position, status, or number of direct reports."" • A few final thoughts on the parenting chapter, which REALLY resonated with me:— This quote from Joseph Chilton Pearce: ""What we are teaches the child more than what we say, so we must be what we want our children to become."" —As parents, we help our children develop shame resilience and worthiness by staying very mindful about the prerequisites that we're knowingly or unknowingly handing down to them. Are we sending them overt or covert messages about what makes them more and less lovable? (ie, are we teaching girls to be thin, nice, modest to be worthy? boys to be stoic, put status first, be aggressive?)— We need to separate our children from their behaviors...there is a significant difference between ""You are bad"" and ""You did something bad"" (pg 224, on making the distinction between shame and guilt...shame is so painful to children b/c it's linked to their fear of being unlovable) —Hope is a function of struggle. If we want our kids to develop high levels of hopefulness, we have to let them struggle (pg 239) — And lastly, ""Who we are and how we engaged with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children will do than what we know about parenting"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jan 20, 2016","Feb 11, 2016","Sep 21, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly

So it's still pretty great and a super fast read. The story focuses on Silver, a washed-up drummer for a one-hit rock band who's had a tough go of entering middle age (a fact unhelped by a bombshell bit of news from his college-bound daughter and his wife leaving him to marry Rich, a better man than Silver in a lot of ways).The plot of the book centers on Silver learning he has a life-or-death heart condition—and his decision NOT to treat it. The repercussions of that decision are what make the last half of this book fly by and my only true fault with it overall is the way Tropper decided to give the novel a non-committal ending.

Reading it, I couldn't help but think two things: 1) We'd all be so lucky to have a poet for a friend, one who could pen us the most gorgeous sentences to look forward to in the mail such as these and 2) no one writes eloquent letters like this anymore, not in this Internet-driven, 140-character-favoring society we now live in.What I loved most is how the letters between Beth Ann (a University of Mississippi English professor and mother of a toddler) and one of her former students, Kathleen (pregnant at the time the letters were written) were so moving and honest and, somehow, ever-so reassuring. And while it's so easy for other parents to dole out advice to a mother-to-be with a side of cynicism or sarcasm, Beth Ann shies away from that — acknowledging the hardships of parenthood but letting her warm thoughts for what she's gained in becoming a mother overshadow all of the struggles that come with the role. Case in point, this passage: ""When sharing your news, you might come across some disgruntled parent-folk. You know, the kind who snort and say ruefully, ""If there was anyplace you want to travel to, go now."" Don't let them squelch your joy, dear K: these are the kind of people who never went anywhere *before* they had babies either.""And while I'm sharing, another gem I loved so much (among so many to be found in this slim collection): ""The second thing I want to pass on is a piece of advice I need to take myself, which is this: Accept mediocrity. Be underwhelming. You can't do everything, so choose some things to sacrifice, and absolve yourself from guilt. It may be that you can raise a child and write a dissertation——but have the ugliest lawn on the block. And that's okay.

And yet, I'm going to.Because even though I'm still glad I read it (and I'm glad my purchase of it supports Bob's international non-profit, Restore International) at times, I wasn't always glad to BE reading it. My issue with ""Love Does"" was this: Overall, Bob Goff's stories were hit or miss. There were 31 total -- some did their job helping readers grasp Bob's ""Love Does"" philosophy. Others felt like desperate attempts to fill space with memories more suitable for sharing at the dinner table. The ones that were really good? Even those felt as though they belonged in a magazine like Relevant (such as the story about Bob's friend, Don, the inventor of Starbucks VIA coffee) or Guideposts (like the cutesy piece about forgiving the elderly woman who totaled his Jeep). Not necessarily deserving of their own book. Sooo...the writing wasn't that strong. Bob himself admits he's not the greatest writer ... that this book was is in large part the result of championing on his behalf by his talented writing pal, Donald Miller. Despite knowing this, I decided to keep reading (though my biggest pet peeve--the way Bob started each chapter with trite ""I used to think.... but now I know"" one-sentence summaries--would only grow in scope by the time I'd reached its end). It's just, I wanted to personally take away more from Bob's stories. I didn't. And I think *that* was my biggest fault with ""Love Does."" It's precisely because Bob lives SUCH a large life that, to him, what so many of us are limited in doing in the name of Christianity is not enough. We may only have the time and resources to hope and pray, read the Bible, and support a charity with our financial givings or donate a few hours each month to a soup kitchen. Bob wants us to get out there and GO BIG. To drop everything and, say, work in an orphanage in Africa or a human rights camp in India. To be THAT kind of ""Love Does.""And I get it. Grand gestures like his are home runs in the halls of heaven, for sure. I just was soured by the fact that an unintended byproduct of this grandiose messaging was the feeling that, for those of us who have to keep our feet tied more closely to home (because maybe we have newborns at home, or jobs we're committed to, or family we can't leave), our efforts to become better believers can never measure up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 08, 2013","Jul 05, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13497505-love-does

A wonderful piece of historical fiction focused on the nascent career of silent film star Louise Brooks, ""The Chaperone"" shares the story of Louise's first trip to New York City in 1922 while accompanied by her chaperone, Cora Carlisle.It's a fascinating bit of back-and-forth storytelling between the two women, with Moriarty offering plenty of insight into both their lives to keep you intrigued for the 360+ pages of her novel. The time period is early 1920s and onward, which I always find to be one of my favorite eras in American history (which perhaps made me love this book all the more).I came to greatly admire Cora, for all the hardships she is dealt in life, both as a child and as an adult. I'd say more as to what those hardships are, but doing so would ruin the wonderful journey of discovery the reader experiences with each chapter of this book. And while Louise Brooks often times comes across as a spoiled, selfish individual, you can't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for her as you learn more about her and her childhood and past.Overall, a WONDERFUL summer read——perfect for the beach (which is how I spent most of my time reading it) and one that leaves you all the more curious about the real lives of the individuals you've just met within its pages.A favorite line of Cora's, on her time with the younger Louise (and a commentary of sorts about the changing times she found herself in): ""That's what spending time with the young can do——it's the big payoff for all the pain. The young can exasperate, of course, and frighten, and condescend, and insult, and cut you with their still unrounded edges. But they can also drag you, as you protest and scold and try to pull away, right up to the window of the future, and even push you through."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 27, 2012","Jun 11, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13056159-the-chaperone

Its subject material walks that fine line between the delicate and—for many of us—the entirely unknown:You have Billy, our bi-sexual narrator, who starts off as a young teen growing up in a 1960s conservative Vermont town (a familiar Irving plot construct). It's while attending boarding school that Billy begins to understand his penchant for both girls and boys (an understanding shepherded along in a variety of bi-curious ways thanks to his (ahem) ""mentorship"" with the local librarian, MISS Frost). As Billy becomes a man, we follow him to NYC, where Irving chooses to immerses the reader in the city's gay culture (perhaps, for this reader, too much so) and we see how the signs of the times carry a heavy weight for both narrator and a supporting cast of equally sexually confused characters.For me, the weaknesses of the book came in two key areas: 1) Irving spends entirely too much of the first third of the book dissecting the works of Ibsen and Shakespeare as his characters (Billy included) perform in productions of both at the local community theater and boarding school. It made for such a slow start to the book, a less devoted reader would have given up. 2) I found it entirely difficult to believe that within such a small circle of known characters there could be THAT much sexual confusion among its members. A grandfather who likes to cross dress? That's just the start...to say too much more about what we discover about a few other key players' sexuality would give away too much for those still curious enough to read this.But (and for me, there seems to always be a ""but"" with Irving), this book was a worthy read in more than a few ways:1) I learned more about the AIDS epidemic in 1980s New York than I could have imagined. Irving did his homework on the subject (thanks in large part to his friend and physician, fellow talented author Abraham Verghese) (Also, did you know more people died in NYC in the '80s of AIDS than all Americans in Vietnam? Wow.)2) It stirred up powerful feelings of empathy, trying to put myself into the shoes of this young man and those of others (real and make-believe) who struggle and/or encounter adversity on the road to accepting their sexual differences—be they bisexual, transgender or homosexual.3) Because Irving has a knack for creating characters that, before all is said and done, just get under your skin—and I mean that in both the best and worst ways possible.And finally, though I was skeptical how the rest of our book club would react to this book (it was our May pick), discussing it with the open-minded women who are its members made for one of our best gatherings yet (the conversation went on for nearly an hour). Not one for everyone but for anyone who can relate to its plot or whose worldview loves all of humanity—regardless of how it dresses or identifies itself—then this one might be an interesting read for you.

So, you see, I feel a bit of a unique bond with these books. If for the sole reason that they were a HUGE welcome distraction to what was the most miserable travel scenario of my life.I'll say of the three books in the series, this was my favorite. With a title as such and all its talk of sex, I thought, ""Oh great, what am I getting myself into with this...how is this going even DARKER in the bedroom"" but it's more a reference to the main character's past and what you learn about it in Book 2 than anything. And that past for Christian Grey includes a childhood that could have him swapping stories with Dexter (another series that's more macabre but equally likable for that very reason that you can't help but root for the guy) That plot twist right there is where the intrigue in this book came for me (screw all the sex scenes--pun intended). I suddenly found myself wondering if this girl could get this guy to give up his shady sexual preferences for her more innocuous ways. If he could ever understand that, just because he was born to the person he was and grew up the way he did, that didn't make him the monster he imagined himself to be.It may be a classic bait-and-hook chick lit storyline but sure enough, it snagged me enough to keep reading.

There I stood at a book/magazine kiosk at the Phoenix airport, having finished my last read with three hours of travel time still in front of me. It was this series, a handful of Dean Koontz and/or Sophie Kinsella paperbacks, and the Hunger Games on the stand. Those were my only options to choose from. So, you see, it's like I didn't have a choice in picking this one from the stack! In truth, I'd been wondering for a few weeks what all the buzz was about over the 50 Shades trilogy so I bit the bullet and bought the first book, thinking it would be awful and I wouldn't get through it but at least I'd know what everyone was whispering about (and as I did so, I found myself wondering if I should have shielded my eyes from the clerk as I handed over my debit card). And yes, not gonna lie...by far THE most smutty reading I've personally embarked upon, but hey, I don't jump into erotica all that often (nor do I imagine three-fourths of the readers who've blushed their way through this series) so it was, let's say, a bit out of my comfort zone in certain passages. But here's what surprised me about 50 Shades—about mid-way through the book, I started actually caring a bit about the characters. Sure I still had to plow through all its sex scenes (and learn a lot about a lifestyle that neither myself or the protagonist, Anastasia Steele, was all that keen on exploring), but damn it all if, by the end, I wasn't hooked enough to want to know what happens to these two next.I am greatly amused at the way this book and its successors have become the pop culture touchpoint of the summer. I'm annoyed (is that the right word?) at those who laugh and say it's just ""mommy porn"" because, now that I've read it, I can't say I necessarily agree with them (maybe a smidge but that's not what hooked me enough to keep reading books 2 and 3). And because there are those who want to criticize how the series started as Twilight fan fiction, all I have to say is, had you not TOLD me that was the case, I wouldn't have picked up on the comparisons. Thankful enough, there are no vampires or werewolves to be found here. The likeness (for me) stopped at a gorgeous guy falling for a gangly girl (and the unlikeliness of it all, but come on, that's a storyline that's been played out for decades. Sixteen Candles, anyone?). Oh, and no, the writing isn't great, but, again, if you're the open-minded type that enjoys a good yarn and can put literary judgment aside for a hot minute, it's no worse than Twilight's prose. (Though, good grief, if I had a dollar for every time EL James referenced Ana's ""inner goddess"" I'd have my car loan paid off in full).

Of course, given the subject material, I should have expected this. War reads are always hard for me, particularly when they involve the haze of ongoing war we've been through over the past 15 years. Plop morally confused characters into a battlefront in an unspecified Muslim country (Iraq? Afghanistan?) and suddenly I'm melding whatever storyline is in front of me with whatever other pop culture touchpoint (be it movie, novel or magazine article) I've read on the subject since college.That sounds terribly politically incorrect (and I'm sorry for that) but I doubt I'm the only one who's war-weary (both of the actual subject and of its treatment in the media.)So, right, why then did I pick up this book?

It seems like most of those geared toward pregnancy putI've purposefully shied away from so many parenting books on the bookstore shelves these days. It seems like most of those geared toward pregnancy put you in a mild panic about all the things that could go wrong. And the rest? They induce a sense of fear, guilt and inferiority that, book lover though I am, I don't want to gravitate toward as I enjoy this stress-free pregnancy of mine. BUT...I'd heard a lot of discussion about this particular book and I have to say, if it ends up being the ONLY book on parenting I read in the lead-up to my child's birth this fall, I'm better off for having made the choice. For some quick background, the author is an American who finds herself living with her British husband in Paris at the time of their daughter's birth. Experiencing motherhood herself, Druckerman witnesses firsthand the differences in how the French families around her are raising their children and the ways in which she's drawn to the modern-day, American style of parenting she's most familiar with.But that's the thing—this modern version of American parenting? ATTACHMENT parenting, as they call it? It's the antithesis of the way the French do it and, I believe, the way Americans USED to parent, 30 to 40 years ago. (In short, I think it's all a bit nutty). I borrowed a library copy of this book but intend to purchase my own, as I dog-earred so many pages (a guilty habit of mine!) that I want to  it again in full at my own leisure. Some wonderful parenting concepts explored inside the book, a favorite being this idea known as The Pause, or letting your infant child lay in his/her crib for 5-10 minutes and fuss before stepping in to see if there is a wet diaper or empty belly as the root cause of the problem. As the French have learned (and Druckerman provides research to support), infants need to teach themselves to fall back asleep—it's a learning process. But because Americans are so quick to jump in and intervene, it's a key reason why they set their children up to be unable to sleep through the night at 8, 9 or 10 months old.Other major takeaways touch on the emphasis the French put on establishing a ""cadre"" or framework of discipline and responsibility for their children; the importance of manners (it's not just please and thank you but hello and goodbye for the French); instilling a child's independence (ie, not hovering over them on the playground) and teaching them how to behave at the dinner table, all the while eating food that vastly trumps our ""chicken tenders friendly"" U.S. kids' menus. Some may balk at Druckerman's writing or the book's subject material, but I couldn't help but fall madly in love with these concepts. I've grown SO accustomed to seeing American children be the center of their parents' universe (constantly interrupting them in conversations, engaging their parents in their meltdowns at the dinner table) that it was a refreshing change of course to read about a culture where THAT kind of behavior is abnormal. A culture unafraid to teach its children patience (""You must teach your children frustration"" is a French parenting maxim that I whole-heartedly endorse). How little of that is happening in America these days. And, as a result, not only do we have a nation of ill-behaved kids, but one for which overstressed parents are paying the price.I am so determined not to join that rat race style of parenting — and so this is a book I intend to come back and consult in the years to come. ...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,not set,Jun 2012,"Feb 14, 2012",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/13152287-bringing-up-b-b

Instead, ""Then Again"" is Keaton's mash-up of her life story (with entries as diverse as battling an eating disorder to dating Al Pacino) intermixed with chapters devoted to her mother, Dorothy Hall. I was conflicted while reading because Diane uses Dorothy's journals——unread by Diane until her death-—to share so much of her mother's stories. Some of the entries felt so private and raw and while, on the one hand, I appreciated what Diane was trying to do with preserving (or, better yet, justifying) her mother's life story, another part of me wondered what Dorothy would think to know so many strangers were reading about private pains in areas of her life such as her marriage and sense of worth. Add to all that Diane's detailed recounting of Dorothy's last days with Alzhemier's disease (an illness I'm uncomfortably familiar with, having watched my own maternal grandmother wither away from it) and I don't know...I just had a hard time with this one. Probably explains why I had to force myself to pick it up on more than one occasion.(Note: The best part of the book for me was Diane's love for Woody and Annie Hall.

Maybe because such occasions are so rare, the novels that bring tears to my eyes stick out in memory more than most.I have a feeling ""The Fault in Our Stars"" will be one of those titles. This is an honest, real, and raw look at cancer. Made all the more punch-in-the-gut because it's a book about teens with cancer. Yet it's the talent of an author like John Green who can find humor and an uplifting message through cancer's stages of grief. As my author idol Markus Zusak says on its back cover: ""You laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more."" In short, I didn't want to put it down.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the story of 16-year-old Hazel, a young teen handed the fate of terminal cancer. She's been outliving her odds thanks to a new test drug, but her sharp wit is shaped by the reality she carries around that death is imminent. While attending a local cancer support group, she meets Augustus Waters (oh Gus...I adored your character so much, even if your philosophical look at life may have been a bit advanced for your 17 years) and it's his entry into her life that changes everything.To say much more would give away what readers should discover for themselves about what makes this latest novel of Green's so great. All I can say is I loved it from start to finish and am having a hard time giving these characters up. Without question, no matter the genre (as he's identified as a young adult author), John Green is one of the best writers being published today. A few other thoughts:• It was surreal to read about characters in a setting (Indianapolis) so close to home. At one point, Hazel makes a sarcastic remark about a street in the city (Grandview) that one of my dear friends lives on! It bothered me a bit to see Indianapolis painted in the harsh light of Hazel's eyes, but I reminded myself she's a teenager (and what teen likes the town they grew up in?) I feel better (having followed John for some time on Twitter at @realjohngreen) knowing the author's opinions of the city where he also lives (and I love) are much closer aligned to my own! • The lines that gave the book its name (pg. 111): ""Were she better or you sicker, then the stars would not be so terribly crossed, but it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he had Cassius note, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves.""Bits of dialog I loved and want to remember: ""I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things.""""Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.""""What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war, with a predetermined winner."" ""I missed the future ... I would probably never again see the ocean from thirty thousand feet above, so far up that you can't make out the waves or any boats, so that the ocean is a great and endless monolith. I could imagine it. I could remember it. But I couldn't see it again, and it occurred to me that the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 30, 2012","Feb 05, 2012","Jan 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars

I'm adThere are only a handful of non-fiction reads that stick out in my mind from the past few years (Henrietta Lacks and Unbroken rise to the top). I'm adding ""Destiny of the Republic"" to that list as well. Trying to explain this book to friends, it seems like such an obscure premise to get worked up about: the assassination of a long-ago president whose time in office was so short, it was but a blip on most Americans' radars. And yet, to read this, you discover what a *fascinating* and supremely intelligent man Garfield was. Not only that, you can't help but be fascinated by the era in which this happened — 20 years before the turn of the century, a time of great change and yet a few years away from some of the life-changing inventions and scientific developments that would have saved this president's life.For those unfamiliar, Garfield was only months into his presidency when a crazed gunman by the name of Charles Guiteau felt called by God to shoot him. The incident happened in a train station, in a day and age when the president walked around with no security (at the time, the president had open calling hours for the public at the White House—three hours, every day. Could you imagine!?) While the gun shot was not life-threatening, what did put Garfield in mortal danger was the number of doctors who began poking and prodding for the bullet from the train station floor. It was these men who would introduce an infection into his system that would go on to (ever so painfully and slowly) claim his life. The way Millard weaves in the stories of other famous men of this era whose inventions and discoveries could have saved Garfield (in particular, Alexander Graham Bell, who worked feverishly to create a machine that would be the precursor to the x-ray to find the bullet and Joseph Lister, whose theories on sterile surgery were a few years' shy of adoption in the U.S.) is captivating. I hugely admire Millard's attention to detail and her thorough research in writing this and how well she made a work of non-fiction read like a suspenseful fictional thriller (even the passages about the politics of the era were fascinating — for instance, Garfield never campaigned for the presidency — he simply gave such a rousing speech on the convention floor that he became the overwhelming favorite politician for the post!). It's a wonderful book and so I hope its arcane subject material won't keep readers away. Elsewise, they'll miss this fascinating look at a slim but important chapter in American history. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 18, 2012","May 25, 2012","Dec 29, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12738936-destiny-of-the-republic

In a way, I kept distracting myself from the plot of this Graham Greene novel (my first of his) Can I just say nobody writes novels this way anymore? In a way, I kept distracting myself from the plot of this Graham Greene novel (my first of his) because I kept rhapsodizing (particularly to my husband, a Greene fan) about the man's eloquent and finely tuned writing style. My copy was an old edition from the library (1950s) and a previous reader had done me the favor of underlining some of its finest lines. Consider this: ""Sometimes I get tired of trying to convince him that I love him and shall love him forever. He pounces on my words like a barrister and twists them. I know he is afraid of that desert which would be around him if our love were to end, but he can’t realize that I feel exactly the same. What he says aloud, I say to myself silently and write it here.""Or this: “Eternity is said not to be an extension of time but an absence of time and sometimes it seemed to me that her abandonment touched that strange mathematical point of endlessness, a point with no width, occupying no space.”Like I said, no one today writes a gut-wrenching love story (or, depending how you view this book, anti-love story) with passages like these, right? In short summary, The End of the Affair follows the tumultuous love affair between Bendix (the narrator) and Sarah (whose husband, Henry, is both a friend, confidant and enemy of Bendix's). The time period is World War II — the London Blitz — and shortly thereafter. When Sarah mysteriously breaks off the relationship, Bendix hires a (quirky) private eye to follow her. Its within the pages of her journal (stolen for him) that Bendix discovers the promise Sarah made to God that brought an end to their affair.Sadly, I feel I knew a bit too much about this book's Big Reveal.

Because you cannot believe what you are reading has any basis in reality. And yet, when you realize the extensive research Adam Johnson has put into it (including his own trip to North Korea), you realize there is so much that *could* be true it frightens you to think where that line of fiction and authenticity blurs. ""The Orphan Master's Son"" follows the life of Pak Jun Do, a boy who grew up in a North Korean orphanage ran by his father (his mother, a singer, was ""stolen"" by the government to Pyongyang when he was a kid). From the orphanage to the tunnels he worked along the DMZ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilita...), on to working as a kidnapper of Japanese citizens (yep, that happened: http://tinyurl.com/78ec3pj) and later, a radio receiver on a fishing boat interpreting signals of enemy ships, the young Do becomes the Korean citizen whose live provides a glimpse into the shock and awe of growing up in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPKR). The book is divided into two parts: the first focusing on Do's life before getting sent to a prison camp. The second, on his life after his time in prison, impersonating the evil Commander Ga. Do has fallen in love with Ga's wife, the national actress Sun Moon, and will risk his life to save her and her children from the hands of Kim Jong Il. While the plot of the book seems far-fetched (the second half especially), the more you learn about North Korea, the more you ponder, ""Well, actually that COULD happen."" (In the book, an American rower is kidnapped by the DPKR...a plotline that reminded me of the kidnappings of Euna Lee and Laura Ling in 2009). It's hard to describe the way I felt reading this book because it was so violent——the lives of its characters so harrowing——that, at many points, I set it down thinking, ""I don't know if I can keep reading this."" And yet, I kept coming back because I felt I owed it to Jun Do and Commander Buc and Sun Moon. But also, maybe, to the millions of North Koreans whose own stories cannot be told under a government allowing only one kind of narrative to be shared with its citizens——a form of propaganda leaving so many in the dark. A fascinating read and timely given the December death of Kim Jong Il and questions of how the transition of power to his son will affect the country. I have read several interviews with Johnson now and admire his years-long commitment to sharing this story. It's humbling to realize, in this modern era, a life like this exists for an entire country not even aware of everything (from music to art to religion to pets, for cryin' out loud) it's missing....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Jan 2012,"Jan 07, 2012","Dec 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11529868-the-orphan-master-s-son

In my case, a COPIOUS amount of notes (12 pages worth, I There are certain books for which you take notes as you read along. 7 Habits is one of them. In my case, a COPIOUS amount of notes (12 pages worth, I think?) There were just that many nuggets of knowledge I wanted not just to gloss over but hold on to for the months and years—lifetime, really—to come.In a nutshell, Stephen Covey boils down the 7 basic principles he views as the principle-centered, character-based building blocks of a productive life. Here's a run-down of the habits and some of the gems I put down in my beloved Moleskin—a peek at why you need to pick up this book with your best New Year's intentions for 2012.Habit 1: Be Proactive• Proactive people focus their efforts on their Circle of Influence. Reactive people tend to focus their energies on their Circle of Concern.• The Circle of Concern is filled with ""haves"" (If I had more obedient kids...If I had a degree...If I could just have more time to myself) and the Circle of Influence is filled with ""be""s (I can be more patient...I can be wise..I can be loving). It's the CHARACTER FOCUS.• Any time we think the problem is ""out there,"" that thought is the problem. WE EMPOWER WHAT'S OUT THERE TO CONTROL US.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind• Think about what you want the end of your life to look like—what you want people to say about you—and use that as the criteria upon which you examine all else in your life.• We are either the 2nd creation of our own proactive design or the 2nd creation of other people's agendas, or circumstances, or past habits.Habit 3: Put 1st Things 1st• Effective people aren't problem-minded; they are opportunity-minded...work on feeding opportunities and starving problems.• You have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage to say ""no"" to other things. And the way you do it is by having a bigger ""yes"" burning inside. You are always saying ""no"" to something.• Work on building the emotional bank account with people (understand the individual, attend to the little things, keep commitments, clarify expectations)Habit 4: Think Win/Win• Aim to see life as a cooperative, not competitive arena, one in which your frame of mind is constantly seeking the mutual benefit in all human interactions.Habit 5: Seek to Understand, Then Be Understood• Don't project your own ""home movies"" onto someone else's behavior. Seek to listen to others empathetically.• Next to physical survival, the greatest need is psychological—to be understood, affirmed, validated, appreciated.Habit 6: Synergize• When working with others (spouse, employee, friend) synergize and reach solutions that both can feel good about. Honor one another's differences and what each of you can bring to the table.***I LOVE THIS THOUGHT***• The more authentic you become, the more genuine in your expression, particularly regarding personal experiences—even self-doubts—the more people can relate to your expression and the safer it makes them feel to express themselves. That expression in turn feeds back on the other's spirit, and genuine creative empathy takes place, producing new insights and learnings and a sense of excitement and adventure that keeps the process going.Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw• Routinely  your four dimensions: physical (exercise, nutrition, stress mgt.), mental (reading, writing, planning), social/emotional (service, empathy, synergy, friendships) and spiritual (study, meditation)• Covey's Daily Private Victory: Spend 1 hour a day in some combination of physical/spiritual/mental dimensions in a way to keep yourself centered• What do we reflect to others about themselves? How much does that reflection influence their lives?• The things you do in 1 dimension have a positive impact on other dimensions because they are inter-related. Physical health affects mental health; spiritual health affects social/emotional health. Improving in 1 dimension increases your ability in other dimensions.And finally, a quote from George Bernard Shaw that Covey shares and that I love more than just about anything else I've read this year:""This is the true joy in life—that being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. That being a force of nature, instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It's a sort of splendid torch which I've got to hold up for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possibly before handing it on to future generations."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 12, 2011","Dec 20, 2011","Dec 12, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People

Talk about surreal....But King has a fantastic way with this novel of not only making you ponder the perceived consequences of such a mode of transportation but also, to make you wonder if you could be the one brave enough to take a path back in time like our protagonist, Jake Epping, a newly divorced high school English teacher whose main mission is to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK. This is a beast of a book——800-plus pages——and yet, given or take 75 pages or so, it read like a dime store paperback, so engrossed do you get in the subject material. I personally felt the storyline of Epping tracking Oswald and the president (because the ""time portal"" dumps him into the year 1958, Jake has to adopt an alias and live in the past until that fateful day in 1963 comes along) was boosted greatly by how Jake passes his time in the past—most notably his serendipitous chance to fall in love. Overall, a pleasurable read and one that was a surprising addition to King's otherwise grisly collection of titles. I'd recommend this to many people but especially for those leery of King because they fear nothing he writes cannot be gory or gruesome.Two tidbits to note:• King actually got the idea for this back back in 1971, but felt he didn't have the time to do the proper research (or the right skills as an author) to pull it off.• King himself hopes this a book that reaches readers outside of his typical fan base: ""This might be a book where we really have a chance to get an audience who's not my ordinary audience. Instead of people who read horror stories, people who read The Help or People of the Book might like this book"".Would make a great vacation/travel read if you're willing to haul it around (this is one case where an e-reader WOULD come in handy!) ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Mar 2012,"Dec 12, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10644930-11-22-63

It's one of *those* boAfter finishing ""The Sense of an Ending,"" I was struck how much I wanted to immediately sit down and re-read it all over again. It's one of *those* books...the kind that drops hints and foreshadows moments that only make sense in its final pages. This is the first book of Barnes' I've picked up, namely because I'd heard such good things upon it being named winner of the 2011 Man Booker Prize. At 150 pages, it's short enough to be a novella and a title that can be read in a single sitting (as I did on one long plane flight earlier this week).The plot centers on an aging Brit, Tony Webster, who finds himself ruminating on his youth only to have certain people from it——an old classmate (Adrian) and one of his first loves (Veronica)——come rushing back into the present. When they do, he realizes his memories of the time they had together may not be the reality shared by all.I hopped online and delved into bits of commentary on this one because it's a book that begs to be talked about with others, particularly its you-never-see-it-coming-and-is-still-hard-to-make-sense-of-ending. (I love how Barnes mines this double entendre with title and plot..and oh my, how I had to  that equation of Adrian's a dozen times before it even vaguely made sense to me!)Here's what Barnes had to say to NPR about the book: ""It's a book about 'memory and time.' What time does to memory and what memory does to time, how they interact. And it's also about what happens to someone in later years when they discover that some of the certainties they've always relied on, certainties in their mind and memory .... are beginning to be undermined."" A fascinating concept, then....how our history is not always what we make of it and how we do (and don't) rely on others to help shape it. A few passages I loved from Tony and found worthy of marking down:""I still read a lot of history and of course I've followed all the official history that's happened in my own lifetime—the fall of Communism, Mrs. Thatcher, 9/11, global warming–with the normal mixture of fear, anxiety and cautious optimism. But I've never felt the same about it—I've never quite trusted it—as I do the events in Greece or Rome, or the British Empire, or the Russian Revolution. Perhaps I just feel safer with the history that's been more or less agreed upon. Or perhaps it's that same paradox again: the history that happens underneath our noses ought to be the clearest, and yet it's the most deliquescent.""""It strikes me that this may be one of the differences between youth and age: when we are young, we invent different futures for ourselves; when we are old, we invent different pasts for others.""""But time...how time first grounds us and then confounds us. We thought we were being mature when we were only being safe. We imagined we were being responsible but were only being cowardly. What we called realism turned out to be a way of avoiding things rather than facing them. Time...give us enough time and our best-supported decisions will seem wobbly, our certainties whimsical.""""When you're young—when I was young—you want your emotions to be like the ones you read about in books. You want them to overturn your life, create and define a new reality. Later, I think, you want them to do something milder, something more practical: you want them to support your life as it is and has become. You want them to tell you that things are OK. And is there anything wrong with that?""...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 25, 2011","Dec 25, 2011","Dec 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10746542-the-sense-of-an-ending

BUT, there’s no news on that front as of now (but thanks to those who’ve been asking ;) haha). Really, picking this up was a quick read for me and a good time to do so as I’m hopeful that I’ll be photographing more babies in 2012 for past clients and dear friends. While I am not a studio specializing in newborn photography, I like the idea of offering intimiate, at home sessions for friends and past clients who are transitioning from their wedding with me to starting a family.So, on that note, there was a lot for me to love about Me Ra Koh’s “Your Baby in Pictures”. I’ve been a fan of Me Ra’s for years now, as her blog was one of the first I discovered who actually taught me something about aperture and shutter speed and ISO. That easy-to-understand knowledge resurfaces 10-fold in this book, which, admittedly, a lot of it was old news to me (each “recipe” she posts for poses comes with an explainer on achieving the look with a point-and-shoot and a DSLR) but it’d be wonderful reading for new parents who are not professional photographers.Where I felt like I benefited most in reading was learning more about moments parents may want to have captured by their photographer, from tiny hands and yawns, to the power of a simple image like dad touching nose to nose with his new baby. While I’m tempted to give my copy away to a mom who could use the tutorials, I’m holding on to it because of the posing inspiration alone!Me Ra also shares a lot of little tips on getting your baby to best cooperate with you for a shoot, cranking the heat up so they’re not fussy, shooting early in the day as that’s when babies tend to be more active (I never knew that!), to considering shooting in a parking lot instead of a park (“I resist shooting at the paper because sunlight reflecting off green grass can give babies a weird tint”).If you’ve photographed your fair share of babies, you likely already know most of this, but I still feel like I learned a lot and this book would make for a great Christmas or shower gift for an expecting parent or a mama or papa whose baby is under a year old.

Mention your weight struggles. Elaborate on the trajectory of your comedy writing career. Be a woman.Yes, yes...Mindy's book and Tina's book ARE similar in those ways. And yet, different enough to leave it at that (and sorry, nothing is going to trump Bossypants ... not even Mindy). What I did enjoy about Kaling's collection of essays is how laid-back they were in tone, as if they were stories shared over drinks with friends. Or, better yet, pints of ice cream divvied up between roommies, the kind which Kaling writes so loving of during her early writing days in NYC. For me, there were never any true laugh out LOUD moments in IEHOWM, but just an overall appreciation for Kaling's wit. (And speaking of appreciation, I did learn Kaling was the writer behind the hilarious Office episode in which Michael Scott ""grills"" his foot on the Foreman. I mean, come on, that might be the greatest episode of that series of all time, so, really...thank you Mindy for that!) A few fave passages:From ""I Am Not an Athlete"": If my parents have any soft spot, it is for books, and I knew that the best way to get out of chores, or sports, or talking to elderly relatives on the phone was by holding up a book and saying, ""But I'm just enjoying Little House on the Prairie so much!"" (Confession: Honest to God, as a kid I did this EXACT SAME THING and (no joke) WITH THAT EXACT SAME SERIES!) From ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"": Mindy writes about her freshmen ""posse"" -- a group of girls she clung to who were so inseparable they literally had an acronym for themselves (JLMP). It's a funny yet touching essay on how we grow up and grow out of friendships. ""One friend with whom you have a lot in common is better than three with whom you struggle to find things to talk about."" (If that's not one of the biggest lessons of your late teens/20s, I don't know what is).The entire chapter of ""Best Friends Rights & Responsibilities"", which was full of oh-so-true girlfriend rules like, ""I should never be overly harsh when something doesn't look good on you, because I know you are fragile about this and so am I. I will employ the gentle, vague expression ""I'm not crazy about that on you,"" which should mean to you ""Holy shit, take that off, that looks terrible!""Other nuggets worth remembering: Mindy has major comedy crushes on Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler. Steve Carrell doesn't talk shit about anyone. Ever. (which annoys the hell out of Mindy). And she's a fan of men with chest hair (""When I see a perfectly hairless, tanned guy onscreen, I am forced to recall the Chihuahua."") HA!

Until I read herEven though I had several friends praise Patti Smith's much-heralded memoir at the time of its release, it slipped past me for years. Until I read her recent New Yorker tribute  to the great playwright Sam Shepard. It was phenomenally written and reminded me again why I owed it to myself to pick up ""Just Kids.""Over the Labor Day holiday, I had a few long stretches of car rides to indulge myself in reading this, coupled with an hour or two where I slipped away purposefully from the pool just so I could live a little longer in the pages of '70s era NYC with Patti and her creative soulmate, Robert Mapplethorpe. I finished it early the next morning, forgoing my usual 5 a.m. writing routine because I wanted to see these two through the end, then tearing up at the final scenes of Robert's death from AIDS, captured so powerfully by Patti.To say this book is outstanding is an understatement. Even if you know nothing about Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorpe as artists (and I knew very little myself), you will find a compelling story that will keep you reading—ESPECIALLY if yours is a creative soul. It was fascinating to read about the era Patti and Robert came of age in NYC, hobknobbing with some of the most legendary artists of that time (Joplin, Hendrix, Warhol's Factory crew, to name a few). As Tom Carson wrote in his 2010 NYT , ""'Just Kids' is the most spellbinding and diverting portrait of funky-but-chic New York in the late ’60s and early ’70s that any alumnus has committed to print.""I couldn't agree more. It's a book that'll stick with me for a long time, if not forever. A few lines I want to remember:(a childhood memory of Patti's, her first visit to an art museum, a scene that resonated with my own childhood experiences of coming face to face with art created by the greats, Picasso in particular): ""In the following year my father took us on a rare excursion to the Museum of Art in Philadelphia. My parents worked very hard, and taking four children on a bus to Philadelphia was exhausting and expensive. It was the only such outing we made as a family, marking the first time I came face-to-face with art. I felt a sense of physical identification with the long, languorous Modiglianis; was moved by the elegantly still subjects of Argent and Thomas Eskins; dazzled by the light that emanated from the Impressionists. But it was the work in the hall devoted to Picasso, from his harlequins to Cubism, that pierced me the most. His brutal confidence took my breath away."" ""In my low periods, I wondered what was the point of creating art. For whom? Are we animating God? Are we talking to ourselves? And what was the ultimate goal? To have one's wor caged in art's great zoos—the Modern, the Met, the Louvre?""This line, because I had to stop and read it twice, written as beautifully as it was: ""You could feel a vibration in the air, a sense of hastening. It had started with the moon, inaccessible poem that it was. Now men had walked upon it, rubber treads on a pearl of the gods. Perhaps it was an awareness of time passing, the last summer of the decade. Sometimes I just wanted to raise my hands and stop. But stop what? Maybe just growing up."" Of living in the Hotel Chelsea (the chapters she detailed of this experience were among my favorite): ""So many had written, conversed, and convulsed in these Victorian dollhouse rooms. So many skirts had swished these worn marble stairs. So many transient souls had espoused, made a mark, and succumbed here. I sniffed out their spirits as I silently scurried from floor to floor, longing for discourse with a gone procession of smoking caterpillars."" In the final chapter, Patti writes of one of her last encounters with Robert (ohhh this scene got me!): ""There was no one present save his nurse and she left us to ourselves. I stood by his bed and took his hand. We stayed like that for a long time, not saying anything. Suddenly he looked up and said, 'Patti, did art get us?' I looked away, not really wanting to think about it. 'I don't know, Robert ...I don't know.' Perhaps it did, but no one could regret that. Only a fool would regret being had by art; or a saint.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 02, 2017","Sep 05, 2017","Oct 17, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/341879.Just_Kids

I honestly thought, ""I want one more day to delve into this world."" But then, 20 minutes later, there I was, picking it back up to reach its final page (and discovering a wholy satisfying resolution, which rarely happens for me with most books).This is one of those novels where the characters don't just live on the page. They live WITH you. Here I was, book nowhere in sight, and yet I still found myself at points of my day, wondering what Henry and Schwartz and Pella were doing at that very moment. The hype for this one? TOTALLY WORTH IT. And to say ""The Art of Fielding"" is a book about baseball is to say ""Friday Night Lights"" is a TV show about football. Yes, yes, the book's protagonist is short stop (and baseball phenom) Henry Skrimshander. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that involve the diamond and batting cages (and a central plot point that involves Henry's first-ever errant throw). But it's SO much more than that so don't let all the sports talk dissuade you from reading it. Because wrapped up in all those baseball analogies are the universal themes of suffering and failure and that age-old question of ""What am I doing with my life?"" It may be a stretch for some, but for me, this is as good as it gets in earning that rare title of Great American Novel.Finally, my love for ""Art"" may very well be jaded but that's only because I've learned so much about how it came to be. Chad Harbach spent NINE years laboring over this, his first-ever novel. NINE YEARS. Only to go from a poor guy with debt collectors after him to landing a book contract worth more than $600,000.

I had those studies in mind as I read Vanessa Diffenbaugh's ""The Language of Flowers."" Chiefly because, without empathy, I would have failed to fully appreciate its narrator, Victoria Jones.A foster kid, Jones is a tough girl who blew her chance at being adopted and so, for 18 years, has bounced from group home to group home with the worst of attitudes. The book follows her life upon being emancipated (all the while weaving in her back story and her days living with Elizabeth, the closest foster parent she's ever had to a real mother). She finds a job with a local florist and, soon enough, her gift of deciphering the Victorian message of flowers becomes her ticket to a new life.""Language"" was a novel that captivated me for a couple reasons. I'd never heard about the Victorian language of flowers (that, for instance, asters mean patience and yellow roses infidelity) and so, as a plot construct, this alone kept me reading. But what also grabbed me was how personal this novel was to its author. Diffenbaugh herself is a foster mother. She is passionate about the importance of foster children landing on their feet upon gaining their independence. (So much so she's created a non-profit, the Camellia Network (camellia meaning ""my destiny is in your hands""), to raise money for its cause.)What was most difficult about Diffenbaugh's book was exercising that empathy muscle while reading it. Victoria makes so many decisions—many of them so rash and so hurtful—that those of us who have grown up sheltered and loved could never understand her reasoning behind them. And so it takes the reminder of ""You don't know what it's like to be in her shoes"" to forgive her those actions (and the hurt she inflicts) over the course of ""Language""'s 300-plus pages.Overall, an engrossing read (especially for a debut novel); likely to remain one of my favorites of the year.Knowing Hollywood (reportedly) has come calling for this film, I couldn't help envisioning a cast I'd love to see take this one on:Victoria: Evan Rachel Wood (the actress has to be younger and have that ability to play tough and vulnerable at the same time--I think she'd nail it)Elizabeth: Naomi Watts and Catherine: Anne Heche (I kept picturing these sisters as blonde--I think both these actresses would be amazing in either of these roles)Grant: Andrew Garfield (because I'd LOVE to see what he'd do with the subtleties of the character...plus, I just love him as an actor and want to see him in everything-haha)And finally, a passage I loved--so much so I stopped to read it twice (pg. 279):""When you work with flowers, everything about you changes. The set of your jaw loosens. Your eyes glaze with focus. Your fingers manipulate the flowers with a gentle respect that makes it impossible to believe you are capable of violence....""I knew the girl of whom she was speaking. It was the same one I'd glimpsed in the dressing room mirror with Elizabeth, after nearly a year in her home. Perhaps that girl had survived somewhere within me after all, preserved like a dried flower, fragile and sweet....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Sep 09, 2011","Sep 14, 2011","Aug 30, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10032672-the-language-of-flowers

A book that, earlier this month, had all of the publishing world and plenty of folks I know through social media in a tizzy over its release? I've mulled it over now that I'm finished and here are what I view as the strengths and weaknesses of Erin Morgenstern's ""The Night Circus""...(I think if I just could have given more weight to the strengths I'd have fallen harder for it):STRENGTHS• The lavish settings—Without question, readers will want to join visitors buying a ticket for this circus, one complete with a dizzying array of features—from a Labyrinth and tents made of ice to a wishing tree and rides where the sky reveals your dreams. It's a gorgeous backdrop to Morgenstern's plot and the author walks that fine line between wonderment and the tedium of too much detail. Should they turn this novel into a film (and surely they will), I can't help thinking it'll be the most challenging to adapt (from a special effects perspective) since Harry Potter. But, on that note, also the most beautiful (I can't wait to see how they construct Celia's color-changing dresses!)• Wonderful primary characters—It's hard not to be drawn in by Celia and Marco's story, one that begins with their being trained to challenge one another as powerful illusionists (but not knowing that their opponent is each other). What they create together is the basis of the book but, better than that, are the handful of scenes in which their love takes hold. Specifically, one scene I loved so much I wish I had wrote it, involving Marco sweeping Celia away in an illusion where they're floating upon a sea of ink in a boat made of books. Beautiful imagery, for sure....and an ideal romantic gesture for this bibliophile. WEAKNESSES• For all the build-up of the challenge, its reveal felt like an anti-climatic let-down. • The back-and-forth of the storytelling—The book switches every few chapters from the present to the past. Normally, this is a fine construct for me, but the problem here is the dates being so close together (for instance, the ""future"" being, say, 1902, and the past, only a year or two prior).

In ""The Art of Fielding,"" those characters were stripped down, living in a small Midwestern town at a small liberal arts college and the writing? It felt...less complicated but in a way that still felt true. With ""The Marriage Plot"" (particularly the first 100 pages), that world was Brown University and those characters pretentious in that fashion of ""I'm earning an Ivy League degree so I'm going to speak in a way belittling of anyone below my IQ"". Or was that just me who felt that way? Suffice it to say, ""Art"" was my favorite book of the year. ""The Marriage Plot"", still a worthy read, not so much. Here were three central characters and a plot built around how their lives intertwine: Madeleine, the WASP-y English major and Audrey Hepburn type pined for by Mitchell, the Midwesterner with a sharp analytical mind and penchant for philosophy. Problem being Madeleine's heart belongs to Leonard, a brilliant, tobacco-chewing loner whose struggles with manic depression dominate most of this book's 400-plus pages.Maybe part of my problem was I spent too much of ""The Marriage Plot"" trying to analyze who was who from Eugenides' own life (fueled by this article I read a few weeks' back on how Eugenides may have wrote himself as Mitchell and Leonard a loose version of one of his literary contemporaries, David Foster Wallace (http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/...)). Whatever it was, I just never connected to ""The Marriage Plot"" the way I wanted to and while one part of me loved the ending, another, greater part of me felt it trite after the heaviness that preceded it.Overall, I still give this novel high marks and praise as one of the year's best. The way Eugenides can craft a sentence can, on occasion, force you to pause and re-read a line not once, not twice, but, in some cases, three times. And, for me, it wasn't even the big ""sweeping"" passages that invoked this, but the small sentences Eugenides' used to construct his characters. One of my favorites? This description of Madeleine's mother: ""Phylida's hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face."" Yeah, I know...I wish I could write like that too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 29, 2011","Dec 11, 2011","Aug 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot

The true character of the narrator, Katy Kontent, is buried under the first half of the novel's slower storyline, one that follows Katy and her boardinghouse roomie Eve (shout out to the wholesome independent Hoosier!) through a blustery courtship of sorts with the elusive Tinker Grey. It's a freak turn of events that leaves Katy as the odd girl out, pondering what she needs to do with her life to move on and out of the funk she finds herself in.Enter Wallace Wolcott. Once Katy begins to succumb to the charms of her sweet friend (platonic though those charms may be), Amor Towles finds a real rhythm to his novel, a cadence to Katy's witty prose, and I...well, I couldn't put the book down for the final 150 pages!From Katy's rise from a Wall Street secretarial pool to the publishing offices of Conde Naste, to her later dealings with Tinker and his ""(fairy) godmother"", Anne Grandyn, I was hooked.

Here were a few that made me admire the talent of author Amor Towles (not that I didn't already admire a guy who, at 46, with a successful Wall Street job, publishes his first novel—doing a bang-up job of telling a woman's perspective no less):(pg. 128): ""Uncompromising purpose and the search for eternal truth have an unquestionable sex appeal for the young and high-minded; but when a person loses the ability to take pleasure in the mundane—in the cigarette on the stoop or the gingersnap in the bath—she has probably put herself in unnecessary danger. What my father was trying to tell me, as he neared the conclusion of his own course, was that this risk should not be treated lightly: One must be prepared to fight for one's simple pleasures and to defend them against elegance and erudition and all manner of glamourous enticements.""(pg. 215): ""Watch out for boys who think they owe you something. They'll drive you the craziest.""(pg. 239): (I just loved this scene)—Quit worrying about the coat. It'll find me. That's why I leave my wallet in the pocket in the first place. Now what's the fuss?—It's a long story.—Leviticus long? Or Deuteronomy long?—Old Testament long.—Don't say another word.(pg. 259): ""Most people have more needs than wants. That's why they live the lives they do. But the world is run by those whose wants outstrip their needs.""(pg. 297): (from Dicky, a character I loved): ""If only we fell in love with people who were perfect for us, he said, then there wouldn't be so much fuss about love in the first place.""...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 07, 2011","Aug 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10054335-rules-of-civility

When his cabin goes up in flames, Bright must make his way through Appalachian wilderness in search of salvation, escaping a father-in-law with a vendetta and entrusting his fate to a guardian angel who's followed him home from the trenches of France. It's not a perfect novel——the resolution Henry reaches with the angel in its final pages felt rushed and incomplete—but at the same time, it's a hell of a debut and I found it hard to believe this is Josh's first foray into fiction writing.I have the utmost respect for an artist who can merge this seamlessly from being an incredibly talented musician to being such a promising novelist whose talent shines most in his lyrical prose. Artist crush officially cemented :) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++True story: Josh Ritter is my favorite musical artist. From a musicphile like myself, that's a BIG statement. But Josh's storytelling in his lyrics has always made me love him so much.Consider a few of his songs if you've never heard of him:The Curse (about a mummy and the woman who keeps him -- it's odd, yes, but SO beautiful): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXBI2_...Girl in the War (THIS SONG.

But everywhere I've looked, Bright's Passage has gotten fabulous s.Am I surprised? Maybe a little. But not to hear the good things. Just at myself. I mean, this is Josh.

And yet, these stereotypes fade away at the hand of a talented author like Chbosky.For starters, he opts for a unique way of sharing this particular story: The novel's main character, Charlie, recounts his freshmen year in high school through a series of letters to a friend. For an added twist, we never do discover who said ""friend"" is. We just know, among the reasons Charlie likes this individual, is because he/she ""didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have."" Along with this friend, we learn more about Charlie's life——how he's a wallflower, a listener encouraged by teachers to ""participate"" more——in friendships, in school, in life. He's befriended by Patrick and Samantha, step siblings of the too-cool-for-high-school variety (and I mean that in the best way possible). He struggles to be friends with his siblings, a brother who's a collegiate football star and a sister who's tolerating an abusive boyfriend. And all this time, he's struggling with his own demons, alluding over and over again to an inner struggle to hold depression at bay.What I loved most about this book is Charlie's voice——it's vulnerable and frank and so naively smart. One of my favorite scenes is when his teacher and mentor, Bill, tells him as much (""Charlie, do you know how smart you are?""...So finally I just said, ""You're the best teacher I've ever had."") Without giving too much away, ""Wallflower"" plods along in a seemingly predictable way as Charlie copes with his only friends prepping to graduate as he must stay behind for his sophomore year. And yet, there in the last few chapters of the book, Chbosky ends things with a shocking reveal that explains so so much about why Charlie is as damaged as he is. And makes this book a hard one to forget.This is one of those young adult reads that doesn't read like a young adult novel. That might be the highest compliment I can give it. Favorite scene in the book (and my guess is many others who've read it will agree with me):Sam tapped her hand on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air waves. And I just sat between them. After the song finished, I said something. ""I feel infinite.""And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I said the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. And of course this is gonna be a movie.

Because for anyone who dares to dive in, ""Cutting for Stone"" makes for compulsive reading.Admittedly, there are a few weak spots to this book, namely one too many coincidental meet-ups among its characters. One of these fate encounters ( between the protagonist and the woman who's haunted him his entire life) nearly turned me sour on ""Cutting for Stone"". But it is on this scene —— which takes place with less than 100 pages remaining —— that the entire plot of the book will pivot, allowing you to come to the end with a level of respect reserved for only a truly great book (and author). Yes this is a novel about brothers, Marion and Shiva, twins born of an unholy union between a British surgeon and his beautiful brave surgical assistant (who just so happens to be an Indian nun). But it's so much more than that —— about a love for one's native land (Ethiopia in this case), a love for one's calling (and a calling for surgery runs deep in the Stone family) and the ways we all love and live and let go in our lives.So often while reading this I was in awe of Verghese's ability to easily incorporate his own medical prowess and personal history into the book, providing an overload of rich surgical details that never once bogged down the storyline. The talent and drive to become not only a doctor but to then study writing at the Iowa Writer's Workshop? Then pen several award-winning books, including this one? Literally, it blows me away. For that reason alone, I want to meet Verghese, shake his hand and tell him how much I admire him and this book. How it will most definitely stick at the top of my favorites for a long time to come. Stick this one out, all you die-hard book lovers. I promise it's worth it —— for the story, the language, the medical details and so much more.A favorite key line (one of many, but others would give away too many plot details):""The key to your happiness is to own your slippers, own who you are, own how you look, own your family, own the talents you have and the ones you don't. If you keep saying your slippers aren't yours, then you'll die searching, you'll die bitter, always feeling you were promised more. Not only our actions, but also our omissions, become our destiny."" (Ghosh, pg. 351--I love how this line comes back to Marion on pg. 657)And one final note for those who may not look it up: The title of the book?
