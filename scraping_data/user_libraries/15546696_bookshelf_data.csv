She does share some personal experience and explain a few things and what inspired her to write this work of fiction.Although the protagonist sounds younger than 20 years of age, she is very eloquent and she uses words like collusion, magnanimous, sanctimonious…. Regardless, she also likes the “f” word, which shows up at least 55 times (I have not checked for all of the variations).I was very excited about reading this book, after all I loved Miracle Creek, but unfortunately this one did not work for me. I needed a second POV. I got tired of the protagonist’s voice very fast. She is so annoying. I don’t mind unlikeable characters, but I need a good storytelling or at least a very good writing in order to enjoy a book. Perhaps if this book was written in 3rd person…Also, I don’t read a book with the intention of analyzing it. My main purpose is to be entertained, and this book, in my opinion, failed the simple basics.Now, I’m not an expert on behavioural study or anything related to autism, so I will not touch that subject, which upset so many readers.This book is label as a “mystery”.

I picked Anna Karenina because it is considered one of the best Russian’s literature and acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel.As this book is a work of translation I can’t judge the author’s writing but I can praise the good work by the duo noted above. The language was very easy and full of passion, hence my ratings.I thought the beginning was very strong and interesting but after awhile I was wondering why this book received so many high praises, so I stopped reading and watched the 2012 movie adaptation directed by Joe Wright and screenplay written by Tom Stoppard, which production was astonishing. The screenplay was not bad but the book is much better (no surprise here, after all the book requires at least 14 hours (fast readers) and up to 35 hours to be read). But the movie did help me to enjoy the book a lot more, especially with the visualization.Anyways… back to the book.The storyline is very good, very dramatic and very descriptive.The story centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky.The Russian society in the 19th century has been presented with great precision. The majority of the characters live in luxury and are part of the high society.Unfortunately not one single character is likable and I really did not care whatever happens to them, but I did appreciate their perspectives, and that is what saves the book (in my opinion).The dialogues are excellent and some situations are interesting and sometimes overly dramatic.All these people were so hungry for love and attention and at the same time were oblivious to what they already had.Anna Karenina became a bit pathetic and annoying with her obsession with the count. I did not think that love was involved at all, but lust. Such a powerful lust. It was kind of fascinating and sad at the same time.Overall, although well written, I did not find the story that gripping or extraordinary, but I liked how the author looked at class, cultural and societal norms, and the emotional toll of expectations by family and friends.I wished that I could have felt some sorry for these privileged characters.Paperback: 838 pages, 348k words - divided into 8 parts and 240 chapters (most of the chapters are short)E- book (Penguin Deluxe Edition): 1275 pages (default)Audiobook (Penguin Edition) Narrated by Miranda Pleasence: 36 hrs 59 min (normal speed)PS.

It was so good that it inspired me to read the book. David Lodge, who wrote the screenplay, did a magnificent job.It’s hard to believe that this book was a flop, when released.I absolutely loved it! I did not have a moment of boredom.It was published as a monthly serial between January 1843 and July 1844, so it’s totally acceptable to read it in small doses and savour those moments.Yes, it’s very wordy and it seems plotless, but the writing and the storytelling are delightful and the characters are unforgettable!The story is about greed and moral, dishonesty and change of heart. As the blurb says, it’s a brilliant study in selfishness and hypocrisy. It’s simply brilliant and I was completely entertained, so I cannot rate it less than 5stars.Paperback (Penguin Classics - edited with an introduction by P. N.

As I couldn’t find, I tried ordering a copy from the library but there was a 4 weeks waiting period. At the end I purchased a copy from Kobo, as well as the audiobook narrated by Ben Whishaw, available on Audible.I listened to the audiobook as I read the book. The narration is formidable! One of those voices that you love listening at normal speed. It made my experience extraordinary! As I read each page, scenes from the movie would clearly appear in front of my eyes, as if I had watched the movie adaptation just yesterday.I immensely enjoyed the writing, which I thought was very easy and clear.I also liked the structure and the development of the storyline.The story is set in England, starting in 1898, when Maurice was 14 years old (in the movie he was 11).The main character is not very likeable, but he is shown as being very human and believable. Maurice’s & Clive’s struggles with theirs sexuality were quite touching (the young generation has no idea how fortunate they are now).Differences in social status were also evident among the characters.I praised the author for writing a story based on his own struggles and experiences, and also for not making the story about sex. This book is free of vulgarities.I wonder how this book would have been taken by the society, had it been released back in 1914, instead of 1971.Some readers may be upset about the treatment towards women, but you have to remember when the story is set (only selected women of 30 years old or older were allowed to vote in England starting in 1918, and 10 years later women of at least 21 years of age were finally able to vote).Yes, society was cruel to women and homosexuals were treated as criminals There are differences between the novel and the movie adaptation, and these differences are listed in Wikipedia.

Sexism, classism, xenophobia, racism and other behaviours were common and considered normal back then.It does require some patience, but it’s an easy read.

Simply magnificent! UnfLes Miserables (also published as “The Wretched”)A brilliant modern translation by Christine Donougher.And what a masterpiece! Simply magnificent! Unforgettable characters!For drama’s lover this is a treat.An enthralling story of broken dreams and unrequited love, sacrifice and redemption and a testament to the survival of the human spirit, set during the French Revolution.The night before starting this book I went to the theatre to see the latest musical production of Les Miserables. It was my fifth time and it was so marvellous that I decided to finally face this book.And what a wonderful surprise this was. Much better than I expected. But there are lots of “fillers” that perhaps are not included in the abridged version.I do have to applaud all of those people who worked on the adaptation for the musical/play and for the movies, as they did an excellent job keeping the essence of the original story (especially William Nicholson, Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Schönberg and Herbert Kretzmer who all wrote the screenplay for the 2012 movie adaptation directed by Tom Hooper).I do have several free editions in ebook format, as well as another paperback by Penguin Classics which was translated by Norman Denny.As a simple example, which may give you an idea, see below a comparison between the translations by Donougher (1) and Denny (2):(1): “Still hidden at the corner of Rue Mondétour, irresolute and shivering, Marius had witnessed the first phase of the fighting.(2): “Crouched at the turning of the Rue Mondétour, Marius had witnessed the beginning of the battle, still irresolute and trembling.”(1): “Some time after the events we have described Boulatruelle had a severe shock.”(2): “Some time after the events we have just related, Sieur Boulatruelle experienced great excitement.”My favourite part of the book was the opening “Fantine” (Part 1). There was a lot of heart in this section that left me emotional (and how I hated the Thénardiers! In the musical they are hideous but hilarious).e-book (Kobo) - Penguin Classics (translation by Christine Donougher and an introduction by Robert Tombs): 2011 pages (default), 623k words - unabridged Paperback - Penguin Classics (translation by Christine Donougher and an introduction by Robert Tombs): 1456 pages, 366 chapters - unabridgedAudiobook narrated by: Adeel Akhtar, Natalie Simpson, Adrian Scarborough, Emma Fielding, John Owen-JonesLength: 65 hrs and 41 minsUnabridged AudiobookRelease date: 2020-04-23Publisher: Penguin AudioPS.

Perhaps a good advertisement.Anyways… the main character is so dull and the writing, although good, is on the verge of being self-indulgent or a bit pretentious.For a thriller or suspense this was very underwhelming and did not work for me.To be frank, it was quite boring (except for the last 5 chapters) and I didn’t like the interaction between the protagonist and Livia Bennet, the veterinarian. Some dialogues were creepy (but perfect if the story was set during the 80’s).At least the main character was not given some kind of superpowers or high intelligence. He was just lucky that everything fell into his plate. And the conclusion wasn’t farfetched, like some many other authors like doing.But don’t mind me. There are plenty of good ratings, so give it a try.This was the author’s debut, released about one year ago.The second book, “Death in a Lonely Place”, is scheduled to be published on April 11, 2024 (in Canada).e-book (Kobo) - Release Date: April 13, 2023: 298 pages (default), 92k words (60 chapters!)Paperback (Harpercollins), published January 9, 2024: 352 pages...more",Notes are private!,4,15,1,"Mar 18, 2024","Mar 19, 2024","Mar 18, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/195853499-death-under-a-little-sky

It was so good that it inspired me to read the book. David Lodge, who wrote the screenplay, did a magnificent job.It’s hard to believe that this book was a flop, when released.I absolutely loved it! I did not have a moment of boredom.It was published as a monthly serial between January 1843 and July 1844, so it’s totally acceptable to read it in small doses and savour those moments.Yes, it’s very wordy and it seems plotless, but the writing and the storytelling are delightful and the characters are unforgettable!The story is about greed and moral, dishonesty and change of heart. As the blurb says, it’s a brilliant study in selfishness and hypocrisy. It’s simply brilliant and I was completely entertained, so I cannot rate it less than 5stars.Paperback (Penguin Classics - edited with an introduction by P. N.

A work of fiction inspired (not based, as the author explained in her notes) on the true life and diary of Martha Ballard, a midwife and a healer, set in Maine, 1789, with flashbacks to earlier years.The narrative was excellent, gripping and entertaining. I just wished that the language used wasn’t so modern, regardless, the writing was still magical.I enjoyed the development of the storyline and especially its timeline structure.The main character is very strong and far from being submissive, given the time. Sometimes I wondered if she was really all that strong or if this was just a fictionalization account. But believable or not, I absolutely loved her as well as her husband (she was very lucky having such a lovable man, again, given the time).I wonder if I should read “A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard based on her diary, 1785–1812”, by historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich published in 1990, as recommended by the author.Yes, this story was quite fascinating and the last few pages riveting.The author’s notes answered some of my questions and I don’t recommend reading it before you finish the book, as it contains spoilers.Ebook (Kobo): 434 pages (default), 134k wordsAudiobook narrated by Jane Oppenheimer and Ariel Lawhon (intro and author’s notes only): 15.1 hours (normal speed)...more",Notes are private!,12,22,1,"Feb 11, 2024","Feb 13, 2024","Dec 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112975658-the-frozen-river

As I couldn’t find, I tried ordering a copy from the library but there was a 4 weeks waiting period. At the end I purchased a copy from Kobo, as well as the audiobook narrated by Ben Whishaw, available on Audible.I listened to the audiobook as I read the book. The narration is formidable! One of those voices that you love listening at normal speed. It made my experience extraordinary! As I read each page, scenes from the movie would clearly appear in front of my eyes, as if I had watched the movie adaptation just yesterday.I immensely enjoyed the writing, which I thought was very easy and clear.I also liked the structure and the development of the storyline.The story is set in England, starting in 1898, when Maurice was 14 years old (in the movie he was 11).The main character is not very likeable, but he is shown as being very human and believable. Maurice’s & Clive’s struggles with theirs sexuality were quite touching (the young generation has no idea how fortunate they are now).Differences in social status were also evident among the characters.I praised the author for writing a story based on his own struggles and experiences, and also for not making the story about sex. This book is free of vulgarities.I wonder how this book would have been taken by the society, had it been released back in 1914, instead of 1971.Some readers may be upset about the treatment towards women, but you have to remember when the story is set (only selected women of 30 years old or older were allowed to vote in England starting in 1918, and 10 years later women of at least 21 years of age were finally able to vote).Yes, society was cruel to women and homosexuals were treated as criminals There are differences between the novel and the movie adaptation, and these differences are listed in Wikipedia.

Wright5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ TW: rape, abortion, adulteryThis was another book that I had sitting unopened in my library since its release in 2001. A hardcover and first edition.And I’m very happy for finally feeling that it was time to read it.And what a compelling book it is. I was completely enthralled. Some parts were moving.Not so much for the story (there is no plot but it’s about two small-town sisters and their life-changing experiences on the eve of the Second World War), but for the writing, the storytelling and for its epistolary form, which can be so hard to give depth to a story or characters.The work here is superb, hence my ratings.The flow was perfect, although the year of 1937 felt a bit long and repetitive (the book is divided into 5 years: 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 & 1938), and the characters felt real and were all likeable or believable.This book won the Giller Prize, the Governor General’s Award and the Trillium Award.It’s in my opinion a gem.Hardcover (first edition by Harper Flamingo Canada): 414 pages ebook (Kobo): 492 pages (default), 142k words ...more",Notes are private!,8,19,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 17, 2024","Dec 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/969335.Clara_Callan

It’s not flawless, but I loved it!This was my first book by this author (not including Harry Potter).I only decided to start with this one because everyone said it’s her best. Besides, I find stories about cults a bit intriguing and fascinating. The opening/prologue written in epistolary form got me immediately hooked. I wished that the prologue was longer or that a big part of the book was written in that style. Yes, I have a weakness for that.The concept and the development of the storyline were simply brilliant! I don’t think that I experienced a moment of boredom. It’s quite riveting.Anyways… I don’t want to go on pointing out everything that I liked or didn’t like, except that I thought it could have been shorter (Charlotte’s obsession with Strike was quite annoying, but poor, poor Charlotte). Robin’s experience was heartbreaking.I’m so looking forward to reading the other books in this series, but I decided to do it backwards (yes, I understand that reading in order is better for understanding a character and also to avoid possible spoilers).I had the pleasure of reading and simultaneously listening to the audiobook, which I borrowed from the public library.Hardcover (Mulholand Books): 960 pages (136 chapters)ebook (Kobo): 971 pages (default), 301k wordsaudiobook narrated by Robert Glenister: 34.2 hours (highly recommend, unless the way he pronounces “I Ching” - 136 times at least - is a problem for you - I just got used to it )PS.

As I keep saying, it’s never too late to discover an old book (or of any age).Because of misconceptions I have avoided it for too long. When I discovered (recently) that it was written in epistolary format, it immediately changed my mind (the same thing happened with me about Frankenstein, which was my last book of 2022, closing the year with 5 stunning stars).Yes, I love books written in epistolary style.And here, Bram Stoker did not disappoint me. He masterfully worked around the diary entries, letters and articles, finding the perfect way to balance the story and all main characters.You do have to take into consideration the time that this book was written (Victorian era). This book was originally published on May 26, 1897.How I wished that I could have seen the readers reaction or the first s at that time. I know that it was the subject of much controversy upon its publication.I asked the same question after reading Carmilla, by Sheridan Le Fanu, which was written 27 years before Dracula.I have said in my reading updates (Goodreads) that I love reading a book without having any expectations about it.And this one was a terrific surprise.I loved the writing and the structure.There are some sensual scenes (or at least I found it sensual) that made me want to scream “yes, take me!”.I was surprised that this book was free of gory or even scary details. Still, the atmosphere created by the author was simply awesome.I do recommend the audiobook narrated by Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, Katherine Kellgren, Susan Duerden, John Lee, Graeme Malcolm, Steven Crossley, which I listened as I read the book.Paperback (Penguin Classics), revised edition: 512 pagesE-book (Kobo): 711 pages (default), 193k words (by Penguin Classics, revised edition)There are lots of free different editions of the e-book that you can download from your favourite retailer.

Although it’s a slow burn, I found interesting and had some theories (too many) of what could have happened. So, yes, I was intrigued.The development of the storyline could have been a lot stronger if it wasn’t for the romance element, but I guess it makes everything feel more human.Anyways…This book could have turned into a great mystery, if the author had taken the direction of investigating the background instead of simply wasting valuable medical resources.I confess that I was disappointed with the conclusion. Was the revelation shocking?Yes it was, but I was expecting something sordid. As for the finale, I thought that it was a very easy way out.I do respect the author’s choice, after all it’s her work.Was this piece extraordinary?I don’t think so, but it was entertaining, engaging and a nice break from crime fiction and bad language.I thought that the author evoked the era perfectly.PS.: If you are going to read this book, please keep in mind that it’s a historical fiction set in the 1950’s.Homosexuality stopped being a crime in England in 1967, but that did not stop homophobia.

And for children!What an awesome accomplishment!I was taken by surprise. I particularly have never heard of this work until recently, because someone recommended it.The concept, the imagination, the structure and development of the storyline is superb!And of course, the writing. It’s no surprise because Koontz has proofed us that he is an incredible storyteller.This book has all the right ingredients to keep you interested, but to truly, fully enjoy it you must read the Ebook in a coloured device while simultaneously listening to the audiobook. The ebook has wonderful illustrations and the audiobook is simply terrific, thanks to an amazing narrator who used his heart to portrait all characters. The audiobook is not just someone reading for you. It’s fully performed. And what a great performance!I don’t remember having an imaginary friend while growing up. I guess it’s because I had a twin brother, with whom I was very closed until our second year of school, but after that we became distant because he ended up 3 years behind me.The idea of creating special toys to support special kids in need of moral support is so touching. Toys that comes to life just for you. That toy that becomes your best friend and who will never deny you anything. It’s so touching! How endearing!There is so much more in this book.The dialogues are quirk and amazing. The characters are adorable and so alive.I just can’t praise this book enough.
