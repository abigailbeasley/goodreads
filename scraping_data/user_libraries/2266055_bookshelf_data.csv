And occasionally, I run across an obscure contemporary writers that are just as amazing in capturing reality in words.But MacDonald was the first, and by luck, was probably the perfect gateway. The Travis McGee novels are mostly detective-mysteries, but MacDonald was never shy about diving deeper into the human psyche. He has a talent for taking seeming superficial acts and behaviors and relating them to seemingly universal human preceptions…""Maybe everybody at some time or another feels the strong attraction of something rotten-sweet enough to guarantee complete degradation."" Darker than Amber is indeed just another Travis McGee novel, but this journey with Travis brings us a step closer to the mentality of the cold and calculating person who instils confidence in others for the extraction of money: the con artist, the grifter. While this novel was written some 60 years ago, these types of people never cease to exists. Sometimes, they show up as bible salesmen.In this novel, McGee finds himself on a moral journey to rid the world of one particular operation. But along the way, the rewards of moral weakness appear and tempt Travis time and time again. It’s this struggle and its effect on McGee’s moral vision of himself that gives Darker than Amber its complexity and its place in reality....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 25, 2024",Apr 2024,"Mar 25, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43935.Darker_Than_Amber

As such, the book is almost 50 years out-of-date with our present-day scientific luxuries and discoveries. It is for this reason that the book is not that interesting, even if Sagan wrote it. At best, the book allows the reader a chance to make comparisons between what we knew then and what we know now. One of the more interesting topics is Sagan’s critical assessment of scientific charlatans. While the actual charlatans of Sagan’s time are now all but forgotten, the fact that they goaded Sagan into strongly condemning them gives rise to the conclusion that there will always be con artists and victims living among us. It only requires a vague scientific view of present-day society to see them operating in all aspects of life, science included but especially politics.Along these same lines, a chapter towards the end of the book discusses religion from the perspective of scientific skepticism. This is probably the most timeless aspect of the book. However, the content is mostly an overview of his more thorough book on the subject, The Demon-Haunted World. Nonetheless, reading Sagan’s contemplations of religious beliefs is inspiring for those that love reality. There are other comparisons that can be made with Sagan’s time including the relatively basic state of the scientific explorations of Mars and other planets, the total absence of the Hubble and Webb Telescopes, and the numerous planets that have since been discovered orbiting distant stars. While all of this helps to bring Sagan’s time into perspective, it also left me wishing that I was reading some other book of a more contemporaneous nature....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Mar 15, 2024","Mar 22, 2024","Mar 15, 2024",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/485812.Broca_s_Brain

The first is Fake or Fortune and the second is Art Detectives. Both shows take relatively obscure works of art and investigate them to determine or verify the artist that painted them. There’s usually only a suspicion of greatness, but only provenance, science, and expert opinion secures an actual attribution.Attribution follows the same motif as the two television shows and it captured my attention from the start. The plot focuses on a young post-graduate student who follows the trail of a suspected 17th century work of art that is suspected of being painted by the famous Spanish painter, Diego Velázquez. The process of attribution is explained as the story progresses. Moore does a good job of raising investigative questions that are universal to many works of art that surround us today. At the end of the process, humans make various interpretations motivated by a host of human factors ranging from the sincerely honorable to the purely selfish. All of this makes this novel a worthwhile endeavor.The flaws in Attribution are typical of art-based novels. While Moore may have chosen an academic theme, there must have been some concern that such themes on their own do not make bestsellers. To spice things up, she adds in a sappy romance and inter-character conflicts that don’t add very much to the story. Also, the attribution process is a bit watered down and glossed over. And to make matters worse, the plot is propelled forward by the mother of all coincidences. In fact, it’s such a big coincident that I envisioned some diabolical plot twist that would remove the tarnish of writing about something that would never actually happen in real life.Nonetheless, its an entertaining novel for those that enjoy art. It provides an opportunity to tour a handful of Diego Velázquez’s works online as they are mentioned and described in the book. They are truly beautiful paintings that capture life.

Project Hail Mary is among the best in the genre. The novel is founded upon two supporting pillars. The first is that Andy Weir is enamored and mesmerized by the actual workings of the universe. He writes about scientific concepts as if he were describing miracles that personally affect him. In doing so, he makes science real. He makes science a viable basis upon which life can be evaluated and evaluated correctly. All of that translates to truth and realism, and any book with those qualities is worth reading.The second thing about Project Hail Mary that places it above most of the rest, is that Andy Weir is a crafty writer. He may not create characters that exude the depths of their human emotions. But what Weir lacks in depth he makes up for with humor. Sarcasm is his speciality, but self-deprecating humor and nerdy utterances are also his thing. This aspect of Weir’s writing endears his main character to his readers. We are so entertained by the humor that we feel the kindness of his heart and miss him once the curtain closes on his story.Both aspects of Weir’s writing make the story a worthwhile science fiction experience. Alien life, near-light-speed travel, and distant solar systems are all put forth to contemplate in a serious way. Closer to home, elements of climate change are included in the story, which places the issue into perspectives that may not have been previously contemplated. And the overall plot is filled with challenges that demand creative and realistic solutions. As a final thought, it’s difficult to ponder the future of Andy Weir as a writer. In their skeletal forms, both The Martian and Project Hail Mary are essentially the same novel: marooned astronaut uses science to define his environment and survive in isolation, all the while keeping his spirits up by laughing at his own predicament. I suspect that Andy Weir, much like Ernest Hemingway, is his own main character in every novel he writes.

Cheney’s writing is crisp and damning and gives no quarter to those that directly participated or encouraged the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. In the future, as other books by historians come into being, Cheney’s account will hold its own and serve to passionately depict her patriotism and her present belief in the rule-of-law.However, for as thorough, comprehensive, and critical of Trump that this book is, it leaves out any discussion regarding a critical piece of evidence that speaks directly to the cause of the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Cheney supported Trump’s candidacy for president in 2016. She defended Trump after he enthusiastically bragged about assaulting women while multiple women claimed he did just that; one of whom has twice proven her case in courts of law. Cheney was silent after Trump referred to the violent white supremacists in Charlottesville as ""very fine people."" She must have never read the violations of law that were included in the Mueller Report, and she voted against impeaching Trump over his attempted extortion of the Ukrainian president. Cheney helped to raise funds for Trump during his 2020 reelection bid, accepting as acceptable the thousand of lies told by Trump by that time. And on page 86 she admits that she ""wanted"" Trump to win reelection in November 2020.What’s missing from this book is any sort of examination of how Trump achieved the position of power and confidence necessary to carry out the January 6th attack. There was an obvious escalation of Trump’s moral depravity and lawlessness that Cheney and her Republican colleagues repeatedly enabled and encouraged for four years. In 2016, what made Cheney think that an accused and self-admitted sexual predator would have the courage and character necessary to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States?""By the time of the January 6th attack, Trump was more confident than ever that the Republican members of Congress would not only look the other way but also serve his needs. Cheney’s exclamation of ""you did this!"" made towards Congressman Jason Smith as the rioters were attempting to batter down the doors to the House Chamber, failed to recognize that she did this too!In the absence of examining this systemic cause of the January 6th attack, Cheney’s book and her warning are both incomplete.

Therefore, it’s not surprising that a writer would jump into the scientific tone of the time and write about a highly controversial subject from a literary-scientific perspective. After all in science, any subject is fair game for study as long as the study is rational, objective, and open minded.Là-Bas presents the occult of Paris in 1891 and carefully compares it to similar practices that took place in the mid 1400s.

This is probably the best aspect of Là-Bas. In addition to this perspective, however, Huysmans insists on being scientific and objective about about his observations. This is where the book bogs down. It is filled with ramblings through religious texts, doctrine, and practices; so much so that only the scholarly-religious would find Huysmans’ commentary enlightening (or understandable).Overall, it’s an interesting book on a subject that seems unique in mainstream Victorian literature. Essentially, Hardy, James, and Verne were Huysmans’ contemporaries.

It’s a world where all the machines have stopped working. They reside in a state of ""arrest.""One problem is that the novel focuses on a story element that disproves Lethem’s own premise. It’s clear that machines do work in certain cases, which prompts the question: why do some machines work while others do not?Investigating the root of that question creates a significant distraction. Apparently, gasoline is out, but human-generated methane works. Nuclear power does not work, but then again it does in one particular case. Fire is still allowed and is used to power steam engines, but their widespread use to solve bigger problems has never been contemplated. This all leads to a conclusion that the randomly working machines are matter of convenience to Lethem’s story. Without working machines, Lethem’s world would be devoid of a story.Another problem is Lethem’s depiction of a world without (most) machines as a sort of utopia. His characters live their new green lives like happy Amish folks on a communal farm. The reality is that there are numerous people in Lethem’s isolated community who would need to survive the disfunction of basic social health services.

His intent was to investigate the government’s suppression of Catholicism. The government of the time was heading towards socialism and wanted the Roman Catholic citizenry to focus on the needs of the State rather than those of the Church. To this end churches were closed and defaced, practices were outlawed, and Catholics were jailed and even executed. The practice was not consistent throughout the country, but two Mexican states, Tabasco and Chiapas, enforced these acts to the extreme. Hence, Greene focuses on these two states for the core of his journey and the book has a very Catholic orientation.The book is outstanding to a point. When it comes to Greene’s sensory observations, his mastery of writing puts those things in words that are anchored to reality. His travels by car, boat, airplane, train, and mule though undeveloped Mexico are exceedingly interesting. They allow the reader to be transported to a time when travel in such a land was a matter of chance and hardship. Greene shows the physical makeup of 1930s Mexico for what it was.But Greene was born at the height of British Imperialism and his education at Oxford was without a doubt steeped in British pride founded upon the notion that the sun never sets on the British Empire. It is this pride, embedded with feelings of British superiority over the rest of their colonized world, i.e. racism, that influences this work and makes it distasteful in today’s world.When Greene applies his British-borne judgement to his observations the narrative takes shameful turns. Most things to Greene are labeled as ""hideous."" The art, the food, and especially the people. He indicates that the native Indian population still ""belonged to the caves."" His description of ""the dumb brown eyes of Mexicans"" applies to all whom he saw. He was undoubtedly writing from his personal perspective of superiority as well as to his belief that his readers see the world in the same way.But yet, one last positive element exists in The Lawless Roads and it’s of an academic nature. Greene’s journey served as the foundation for his novel, The Power and the Glory. It should be pointed out that the novel somehow sheds most of the negatives that plague The Lawless Roads. It may be that Greene’s allegiance to his characters disallowed his own personal judgements of them.

In the decades prior, life seemed to be constant and certain. The power structure started with the land owners and filtered its way down to the cows. By 1910, however, change was inevitable and life was speeding up. The Return of Kid Cooper demonstrates that change does not necessarily bring out the best in people. Rather, it brings out the dominant inclinations of people’s true nature.The novel is a slow burning Western that sorta moseys along through its plot like a cow headed out to pasture.

The low key feel is further enhanced by characters who all posses Western genre characteristics including stoicism, being slow-to-speak, and being of very few words.

The end result is a novel that canonizes Pino Lella while leaving multiple frayed threads that radiate outwards form Pino Lella’s pedestal.There is a real story here, but only Mark Sullivan knows it. It may be a story that centers upon the absence of justice during times of war. It may illustrate that any search for justice during such times will only result in illusions and self-satisfactions.

In many of these stories, the visiting aliens are necessarily advanced in their technology. As such, they possess the power to remind us of our petty differences and inspire (or force) us to broaden our perspectives. But what would happen if we were the ones visiting other civilizations? At some distant point in the future it may be us (Earthers) that journey out into the stars and we may indeed visit civilizations such as our own, as it exists right now. It would then be humanity that holds such power and our use of it would define us in the eyes of those we visit.This reversal of alien roles is the idea that Damocles explores. And while this idea may not be unique, (Ref. The Twilight Zone, ""The Little People"") S.G. Redling writes Damocles from her perception of what humanity just might be, at least that part of humanity that decides to venture outwards past the point of no return. The specifics of the story support Redling's perception of humanity. Communication between species is front and center, which it would have to be. This was a brave book to write and a brave book to publish. Redling takes the realities of having no foundation, no clue, for even a single word in common and takes the reader through the process of developing rudimentary speech between alien races. The reader struggles through the dialogue, feels the frustrations of communication, but ultimately feels the small triumphs of mutual understanding as they happen along the way. It's creativity in writing at its best. Beyond communication, the selfless attributes of compassion, trust, and a mutual desire to learn from each other illustrate the best parts of humanity; the likely parts that would be sent outwards on a mission of pure exploration. And then we have humans as spiritual beings and our propensity to believe in reasons that do not exist, especially during moments of disappointment and stress. We cannot escape this irrational part of us and Redling makes no attempt to diminish it.It is Redling's steadfast depictions of humanity, the selfless and the irrational, that gives Damocles a firm foundation in realism on a planet a billion years away at some futuristic point in time....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17790336-damocles

Through my mother’s family, my ancestors reach back into Mexico through unknown generations. I was raised as an American, but my life has been steeped in Mexican culture. It’s from this perspective that Michener’s novel comes across as disappointing.To start, Michener made up a substantial amount of Mexican history. He creates an idealized Mexican town, a fictional native tribe, and a fake bandito revolutionary. Michener also ignores certain facts, like the massive loss of indigenous human life that was caused by European diseases. After 600+ pages, Mexico remains a poorly understood land.Historical fiction in the absence of history becomes nothing more than a fantasy. Michener presents Mexico as a tourist attraction where Americans can witness a different culture without a need to understand it. His writing caters to predominant American attitudes as they existed during the early 1960s (and as they still struggle to exist today). Attitudes which included such absolute beliefs as ""the union of Mexico and Spain produced far more that was beneficial than damaging."" [Pg. 362]As a result of Michener’s fantasy, he fails to reach any sort of genuine truth about Mexico. He fails to reach the essence of the Mexican people which is an ever-present energy that creates determination out of adversity. The novel also lacks any genuine attempt to provide an understanding of prehistoric practices and beliefs of the indigenous people even though they genuinely felt that their practices and beliefs were correct and proper with respect to the world they lived in.It may be that Michener was more motivated by the opportunity to write about bullfighting than he was about Mexico. Most of the book is dedicated to bullfighting. There are detailed scenes of bullfights, its methods, and the lives of the matadors. This aspect of the book is probably the best that it has to offer in terms of factual content. However, in the present day, experiencing the methodical torture of an innocent animal until it’s almost dead so that a matador can hack at it to achieve his ""moment of glory"" hardly seems like a reason to read this book.I have only read one other Michener novel, which was The Covenant. The difference between the two novels is striking. Everything that The Covenant succeeded in doing for all South Africans and their country Mexico fails to achieve. It’s interesting that Michener himself was so dissatisfied with this novel that he put the manuscript aside and forgot about it for 30 years. From my perspective, it should have remained hidden away and unpublished....more",Notes are private!,9,25,1,"Nov 22, 2023","Dec 04, 2023","Nov 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22292806-mexico

This approach is the best kind of science fiction, and based on my searchings through the genre, it is surprisingly very rare; or at least rarely done well.The story takes place only a handful of decades from our present time, and it centers upon our first journey to our nearest star, Proxima Centauri. We’ve newly unlocked the secret to near-light-speed travel. The members of this exploration team are from all over the world. Each has their own strengths and unique characteristics, but they all fit together in the spirit of discovery. The science of this novel is based in truth, which gives Benn a firm foundation from which to extrapolate the future.But the true gold of this novel is its dissection of humanity and its motivations that may never change. Benn uses his adventure to highlight our tendency to act from fear first, and shows that only a deliberate effort will allow reason to be placed over fear. Benn also asserts that corruption is the destroyer of societies. It lives with fear, feeding off of it, and manifesting itself as the crudest form of selfish survival. Corruption will sacrifice the many for the needs of the one, and not even realize it.Stylistically, a few minor issues are present. The story peaks at its midpoint and never truly ramps back up to a spectacular ending. Also, the large number of characters makes each of them less than memorable. There are a few that stand out, but others are only defined by their name and function. Fewer characters with Benn’s writing would have been extraordinary. For a debut novel, Intrepid is amazing, issues and all. Benn’s style is filled with respect for his world. Intrepid assumes a serious and realistic tone that intends to engage and convince its readers of its truth, rather than putting forth a series of cheap thrills and over-played action.

It was a fairly gutsy move to bring to mind the power and force of such a great writer as exemplified through such a great novel before even starting to present his own work. It felt like the gauntlet was being thrown down.To Gwyn’s credit, he holds his own with McCarthy through the first half of the novel. In fact, the similarities in style were satisfying. Like McCarthy, Gwyn uses terse language that speaks volumes of feelings through only a handful of words; and as an added bonus, Gwyn uses punctuation. This first part of the story was indeed about a young soldier’s deep understanding of horses and how that understanding affected his soul and shaped his character.As the story develops, however, the focus shifts from horses and men’s souls to one about the war in Afghanistan. Gwyn maintains his powerful style of writing, but the magic of realism that McCarthy maintained throughout his novel is lost by Gwyn.The problem rests with Gwyn’s depiction of his main character. Corporal Russell is a noncommissioned officer in the elite US Army Ragers and is stationed in a hostile country. But he’s depicted as a soldier who thinks he has free will. He blindly judges his captain (Wynne), disobey orders, and deserts his comrades while under fire. And yes, Russell is Gwyn’s character so he can be anyone that Gwyn wants him to be. In reality, however, by the time one makes E-4 in the Army, the Russell’s have usually been found out and relegated to other duties for the safety of those around them.It was the disconnect between the expectation and the depiction of Corporal Russell that made Gwyn’s story seem more like a story than an actual view into the realities of war.

While it just may be how books were written two hundred years ago, Persuasion is too narration-based for my tastes. When it came to Anne, I kept hoping that Austen would set her free. I wanted Austen to let Anne take the lead with her voice, thoughts, and acts to show us who her true character, especially at the critical moments of the novel.

My perception was wrong. While the book is organized by a series of conservative issues, its message is a jumbled mix of almost desperate persuasion techniques. Stern deliberately avoids or minimizes statistics from other developed nations when it suits his conservative position. Gun violence statistics from nations without epidemic levels of gun ownership are an example of this approach.He uses emotional appeals to garner sympathy for the poor coal miners and Trump’s loving supporters. The former are victims of fossil fuel changes that were forced upon the country and the latter gush visibly moving emotion upon their savior.Stern also avoids many facts and obvious questions so that the conservative position at hand can be stated unchallenged. For instance, evangelicals complain that single-parent households are a detriment to society, but Stern never brings up the topic of abortion when presenting this evangelical opinion. Then there is the ""whataboutism"" that Stern uses when there is no escaping the untenable nature of conservative positions. In these instances, he will raise a loosely related liberal position, not bother to define it very well, and proceed to say, ""see they do it too.""Throughout the book, Stern uses a gimmick of rhetoric where he will present sensational information that would endear any right-wing enthusiast to his message. He then walks those points back with subsequent factual information. I imagine that the intent is one where the initial statement is heard and the latter retractions are hopefully forgotten by the reader. This is especially true with his chapter on poverty where at the end, the true nature of the Republicans’ position on poverty-reduction through government action is revealed.Added to this jumbled approach to championing conservative issues are the times when Stern writes as a liberal. For instance, there appears to be no rational reason for conservatives to deny climate change, support creationism, and buy into fake news. During these passages, I did not feel the ""love"" that was promised by the title of his book.By the end, the thought occurred to me that this book may actually be a satire, written by a liberal, to make fun of conservatives. It’s such a jumbled mess of writing, positions, and contradictions that it actually reflects the substance of many conservative views.

MacDonald fishes out the literary hero of my youth from some small core of dead synapses located in my middle-aged mind. With Bright Orange for the Shroud, Travis McGee once again reminds me that emotional maturity, a rational perspective, and a sympathetic attitude are all qualities of a decent human being.The Travis McGee novels are all off-center from the typical crime/mystery/detective novels. McGee is a salvage expert. His baseline mode of operation involves the recovery of things lost for a payment of half their value. He is guided by a duty to the moral good even if law and order need to be discarded to achieve it. But most of all, McGee will typically end up recovering the dignity of the person that has experienced the loss. The money becomes secondary to McGee as his connection and sympathy with the victim grows. Bright Orange for the Shroud is all the above, but it’s also probably better than most McGee novels. With this being the sixth McGee novel, MacDonald must have felt comfortable with McGee the man and felt that he could take his readers deeper into his attitudes and philosophies. Therefore, MacDonald provides some truly insightful passages. MacDonald illuminates McGee’s psyche as he encounters and experiences the human predators that plague the swamps, cities, and towns of 1960s Florida.My one complaint has to do with the ending.

The story takes place in near future so a lot of our present-day scientific knowledge is used and extrapolated by one or two generations into the future. This makes Morris’ setting and plot work in ways that are intuitively relatable to our own time. Of special interest for me were his depictions of artificial intelligence, prolonged manned interplanetary space missions, and space propulsion concepts. Additionally, Morris incorporates the theories that speculate about life on the icy moons that exist around other planets in our solar system.The second element that I search for in every science fiction book is a genuine talent for creating human characters. This is probably the most elusive attribute in all of the science fiction genre. In this regard, Morris actually puts forth a decent effort. The main character has internal thoughts that are communicated to the reader and emotions are occasionally described and sometimes demonstrated. Morris still falls short of creating people that live on the page, but it is apparent that humans are playing out his story.The action is somewhat typical for space-based plots. Their spaceship, while on its two year mission, experiences half-a-dozen Apollo 13 mishaps but unrealistically survives them all. There are also a couple of ‘loose ends’ that create minor plot contradictions that need to be overlooked along the way. And the end of the book attempts an ‘Arthur C. Clark’ space-mysticism vibe without much effect and some annoyance. Morris, however, does include “extra credit” following the end of the novel by way of a factual article on the book’s content. It’s titled “The Guided Tour of Enceladus.” Within this article he lays out the current science and technology of space travel and gives a report on the actual composition of Enceladus.

Now they have the details of Hemingway’s life in Paris in the 1920s.The content concerning The Sun Also Rises seems almost happenstance. One of the things that I have come to know about Hemingway is that his life is always just below the surface of each of his novels. Hemingway and his gang of Parisian expatriates all lived their lives together, and those lives were transformed into Hemingway’s famous first novel. Lesley Blume, through extensive and thorough research weaves those lives together around Hemingway and consequently tells the backstory of The Sun Also Rises.I found the lives that were detailed in this book interesting but too trivial to stoke a genuine biographical interest. In fact, knowing Hemingway is about the only interesting thing about these people. Following the inadvertent playing of their parts, they all faded back into obscurity as Hemingway moved on in his career. As such, dwelling on these people’s lives was a bit tedious to endure at times.One aspect of this book that I enjoyed, however, was the effort involved in Hemingway’s development of his unique style of writing. Rather than just being an instinct or an embedded talent, he had to work at it. Everybody Behaves Badly tells of his efforts, describes the goal of producing something entirely new in literary expression, and describes the extraordinary amount of work Hemingway had to invest into a relatively short novel.

Maugham creates this experience for you in this stroy.It appears that this story was never published on its own and only appeared in Maugham’s collection of short stories, The Trembling of a Leaf.---02 MAR 24: ""Mackintosh"" ****""Mackintosh"" highlights the strange relationship that exists between people and authority. It’s set in the Samoan Islands in the early 20th century, at a time when the islands were essentially a plantation colony of the British Empire. An island governor, who serves as the focus of the story, has been marooned in his position for a substantial length of time and has essentially transformed himself into god-like being.The story highlights the benefits of having a god in charge of everyday life and it highlights the hell that the wrath of god can rain down upon those who question his authority. It also highlights dependency that can form between a god and his subjects. Contrary to expectations, the removal of a god can be the cause of greater suffering than anything caused by the god during his reign.Mackintosh is the relatively new assistant to the island governor who steps into this situation. He ultimately discovers that his life-long perspectives, born of the real world, don’t apply in an isolated island surrounded by water and ruled by a god.""Mackintosh"" was inspired by Maugham’s 1916 visit to the South Pacific. It was originally published in the November 1920 edition of Cosmopolitan. Following that, it was published in Maugham’s collection of South Pacific stories, The Trembling of a Leaf.---Individual Story Ratings: 04 SEP 23 Through 19 FEB 24Individual Story Reviews: 04 SEP 23 Through 19 FEB 24...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Sep 02, 2023",not set,"Sep 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54275026-the-complete-short-stories

Writers have been tapping into this conflict from the very beginning of the industrial revolution.Underlying the details of all of these stories is the question of how the profits from any business that relies on labor should be apportioned between the two entities. In the times of Steinbeck’s story, the division was settled with the least amount of profit possible going to labor simply because there were numerous other people willing to work for less profit than the person presently employed. “Supply and demand” was the slogan and the means that was used to great advantage by business owners.In Dubious Battle, however, focuses on a secondary but more human question associated with such conflicts. That question is how to keep humans banned together to achieve a common good, which was the only means that labor had at their disposal during the struggle. Steinbeck demonstrates that on its own, a single idea of more profit for labor cannot compete with the myriad of individual notions working against unity. These notions stem from our fundamentally distrusting nature and tap into fear, greed, and jealousy. Steinbeck asserts that additional forces are necessary to keep people focused and banned together in order to carry out the collective acts that can lead to success. The absence of such forces dooms the collective and makes the battle for a common good dubious from the very start.Present Day ThoughtsFrom the 1920s to now, the struggle between owners and labor has continued, but it has evolved. Society, partly for its own survival and partly for altruistic reasons, has incorporated a number of reforms and improvements. These range from the creation of formal unions to giving government checks that can be used mange the struggle between owners and laborers. Even with all these changes, however, the individual notions that work against unity are still there working against equitable outcomes for laborers.The FutureAs society moves into its future, there will come a time where automation will virtually replace labor. As we approach that time, it would behoove us to recognize that society is predominately comprised of laborers. Furthermore, society will need to realize that profits from businesses are only possible due to the structure and stability that society provides. At such a point in our future, the struggle will be renewed, but business owners and society will then be the antagonists in what will hopefully be, by then, an indubious battle....more",Notes are private!,2,21,1,"Aug 26, 2023",Sep 2023,"Aug 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18684232-in-dubious-battle

Their collective intent is to establish a never before attempted colony of free humans on Mars. This is all done in response to a oppressive societal government that strives for the control of its citizenry. This is nuts. There is just no way to believe that the sum total of wisdom, intelligence, and lifetime experiences possessed by the elders would conclude that sending kids to Mars would be the solution to any problem. In fact, as the story shows, the cohort of elders had access to considerable resources and technology including the ability to manipulate governmental assets without detection. They could easily have used those abilities to establish a resistance movement in some remote place closer to home (and with breathable air).But that was not the book that Glenn Damato wrote, so within his context we have kids floating through space on their way to Mars. As to be expected, there are numerous problems along the way all of which need to be solved for there to be a story on Mars. Then on Mars it’s more of the same, or there would be no foundation for a sequel. These problem-based action sequences were appreciated for the distractions that they provided from the main storyline.On the way to Mars, the kids decide that freedom is going to get them all killed. Therefore, a little societal oppression is found to be in order consisting of laws and obligation to their collective selves. Then on Mars, they end up with a sort of dictatorship. In many ways, these transformations serve to undermine the supposed quest for freedom upon which the novel is founded.Along these same lines, the story fails to recognize that freedom and society always exist together as complementary values, and that societies are always oppressive to freedom. Oppression equates to a corresponding amount of freedom. In other words, to exclusively claim that a society is oppressive is to deny the freedom that one actually has at hand. In Damato’s world, it’s stated that an advanced education is provided by society. Those that excel at furthering society’s goals are rewarded with greater wealth and privileges. And surfer dudes are still able celebrate accomplishments with shots of Jägermeister. Therefore, if both attributes, oppression and freedom, are examined together, one might find that societal change can be affected by means that are far more effective than sending kinds into space....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jul 29, 2023","Aug 03, 2023","Jul 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48711826-the-far-shore

During WWII they were the Navy’s speedboats and I’ve read that their engines were equivalent to those used in battleships even though they were only a fraction of a battleship’s weight. Their missions included close coastal attacks, escort duty for convoys, and screening missions for the more valuable capital warships. While a relatively small ship, destroyers were capable of operating independently for extended periods of time.If you are curious about what life was like while serving on a Navy destroyer during this time, then research will probably lead you to William P. Mack, former WWII destroyer captain. His career culminated with the command the US Seventh Fleet and his final post was serving as the Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. Mack’s first two books on the subject of destroyer life were unique and spot-on. Which brings us to Checkfire!, which is a tremendous step in the wrong direction. Checkfire! is very much the typical pulp fiction war novel. Rather than realistic views of destroyer service, Mack gives his readers the impression that only a handful of officers make or break a destroyer’s success. On occasion, one of the 100+ enlisted men will make an appearance in Mack’s story to serve up some uncouth comedic color. The women of Mack’s world, though professional in their careers, appear to drop everything to satisfy their officer suitors upon first sight. And the war action is depicted without clarity or historical context with the sole intent to drive suspense.Overall, this is a shell of a story when compared to Mack’s two earlier novels that focus on destroyer life during WWII.

It was a view peculiarly his own. It was a yardstick by which he measured all things which came to his notice. By it he focused the characters he drew, the thoughts he uttered. Because of it his work was sane, normal, and fresh. It was something new, something the world wished to hear. It was his, and not a garbled mouthing of things the world had already heard.It has been my experience that many contemporary writers simply move their characters through their plots. They have a story to tell and they tell it. To a lesser extent, some writers will also let us into their character’s thoughts. However, very few writers allow their readers to understand the human perceptions, the philosophy, behind those thoughts, and thus, allow us to understand their characters.The inclusion of Saroff’s own philosophy in Paper Targets makes this novel an enjoyable rarity. The main character, Enzi, possesses it and in subtle ways it adds significant depth to the novel. Beyond philosophy, the novel walks us through the formative periods of the main character’s life. The story reminds us of how pain from our past can influence our present. We are prone to overachieve and overcompensate in our attempts to somehow erase our past suffering, especially if that suffering was at the hands of those whom we imagined as perfect. This overall theme resonated with me and my past, which pulled me into the novel.Saroff’s style of writing creates suspense from the potential acts of his characters. He does not hold anything back. By the end of the novel, you are fully aware of everything that has taken place and suspense is placed in the hands of the good and evil forces that tear at us all, every day, in response to living our one and only life.There are other notable qualities to Paper Targets involving art, computer programming, and simple good folks.

These are the people that go to Trump rallies dressed in Trump garb and waving Trump flags. They profess their admiration and love to a man who promises favored status for their loyalty and dedication. They defend Trump to the point of stupidity without knowing that their defense is nonsensical. These are the loyalists, the cult members.Of the 74,000,000 people that voted for Trump in 2020, however, how many are in fact these cult worshippers? In my estimation, they probably comprise an ineffective component of the whole. On January 6, 2021, for instance, only a relative handful showed up for a mindless assault on our nation’s Capital. If they were the only source of Trump’s political power, then Trump would not be a concern. As such, the relevancy of this book as it pertains to the greater Trump phenomenon is not that meaningful.One benefit of this book’s narrow focus was that it brought about my realization that the Trump voters that I know are not cult members. They are simple and single-minded people. They don’t want to consider the various perspectives to complicated problems because life is simpler that way. They are people who have no desire to look beyond their established set of beliefs, which were tantalizingly stimulated by Trump’s messaging. It is my perspective that these people represent a more significant portion of the 74,000,000 Trump votes cast in 2020.Beyond the Trump fanatics and the simple minded Trump voters there are other contributors to the Trump phenomenon. The most prominent and inclusive is the Republican Party. The Party has traditionally been comprised of a consolidation of various cults or cult-like groups that have routinely circulated below the Republican umbrella. When Trump came to light and offered each of these groups their own political miracles, the leaders of these groups aligned their members under Trump’s influence. The Republican banner has in one hand continuously promoted ignorance, racism, and sexism, so that capitalism in can thrive in the other.Therefore, The Cult of Trump is a book that inadvertently overemphasizes a small aspect of the larger Trump problem. There are indeed Trump fanatics that have been indoctrinated into a cult organization. And for them and their families, this book is a credible source for help.

First, an imaginative world needs to be created with physical context that can be related back to actual reality. And if that isn’t difficult enough, the strengths of a talented writer are also needed to bring characters to life within that world. There are only a few writers that I’ve come across that have achieved both in their work.With Lex Talionis, R.S.A Garcia does a good job in creating characters, at least those characters that are central to the story. She knows that characters have thoughts that are often times more honest than the words they speak, and she does a good job at letting her readers know what her characters are thinking. This sort of attention to character depth is a rarity in science fiction where most writers in the genre use their characters as pawns, moving them from point to point through their action-packed plots.It’s the first half of the equation where Garcia’s writing suffers. Her world lacks the depth given to her characters. Most of her aliens make cameo appearances with descriptions of their looks and behaviors and then fade away without consequence. She also fails to provide any sort of real physical relationship between Earth and the other planets that she creates. And the science part of her science fiction novel is heavily glossed over without any connections to science.My last criticism is that the story attempts to manufacture suspense by starting every plot-line in the middle of its arc. Hence, the middle of the story precedes the beginning and concludes with its ending. This is probably an attempt to create an edgy feeling to the start of the storylines, something akin to being thrown into a pool of cold water. However, just like that cold pool, the edginess that this gimmick creates is a bit annoying.Lex Talionis would have been a much better novel if the story progressed in its proper sequence.

The Execution Private Eddie Slovik holds the distinction of being the only US service member to have been executed for desertion since the Civil War. The Execution of Private Slovik is William Bradford Huie’s account of Slovik’s life and the events leading up to his execution. However, the book also veers deeply into speculative, sometimes imaginative, reasons for this single execution.The added content of the book is comprised of Huie’s personal and multiple speculations for the reasons behind the single execution of a deserter over all those years. Many of these speculations are stretches of the imagination. Other speculations are nothing more than open-ended questions that Huie cannot answer. It has been my observation that when one hopes to make a point while having no idea if such a point is true, one simply asks a question and let’s it sit there on the page (or float in the air). Such questions provide no facts, no assertions, and no answers. It’s noise for the deeply biased to listen to.Huie was an investigative report and WWII war correspondent. With this experience, the factual information surrounding Slovik is well presented. He includes most of the written records. He includes relevant portions of interviews he conducted with those involved with Slovik’s life including the friends, family, soldiers and officers who interacted with Slovik’s life and adjudicated Slovik’s fate. It would have been my preference for the book to have been limited to this testimonial and factual information. In that way, the reader could assess this information and decide for themselves as to whether or not the punishment fit the crime.The factual record of Slovik’s case clearly shows that he was guilty of desertion. He wrote his own confession in his own hand. He broke his contract with society (he broke the law) in an attempt to obtain individual comfort at a time when society, by law, required sacrifice. Furthermore, Slovik’s prior breaches of the law were common in his past to the point where the consequences of imprisonment would be well tolerated, if not welcomed by Slovik, if it meant he could avoid his responsibilities.If individuals willfully forsake the contract they have made with their society then of course, the consequences for those violations, as spelled out in the contract, should be applied. If lesser forms of those consequences have no effect on preventing future breaches, then society has every right to apply the maximum consequence as spelled out in the contract. This was Slovik’s fate as brought about by Slovik’s will.I personally see the punishment of death as disgusting. It should not happen in an advanced society in times of peace. But war is also disgusting and is sometimes necessary. The war that surrounded Slovik was one where death was commonplace and often times horrific. On average over 200 US servicemen died each day during WWII. In a world of disgusting realities a disgusting punishment would seem commonplace and commensurate with the world as it exists. And if a member from your own side exacerbates the death of your fellow soldiers, then justice would demand a severe punishment consistent with reality.Slovik’s case could be considered one of his continually being the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time. But he did nothing to mitigate or change those wrongs. In stead, he made himself into a victim. He played into his victimhood and ultimately suffered the fate of self-victimization....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 07, 2023","Jun 10, 2023","Jun 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/627220.The_Execution_of_Private_Slovik

It’s not common to come across a writer with such talent.The story spans the history of early Texas from its pre-independence, through statehood and ending around the beginning of the Civil War. It’s historical fiction as opposed to a Western novel. There are no larger-than-life scenes intended to inspire thoughts of adventure. On the contrary, every element of this book is about experiencing the emotional elements of life as they were during that time and place, as it actually happened.Gwyn shows slavery in a light that is matter-of-fact on the part of slavers and horrific on the part of the slaves. Gwyn also brings to light the consequences of ostracization; the loneliness and the self-destructive pursuits of a homosexual man during a time when homosexuality was an absolute abomination. And finally, Gwyn highlights the nature of people who love every aspect of life that surrounds them. These people have a child-like naivete about the evil that lives in others and hate is beyond their comprehension.This was Gwyn’s third novel, and I now have the other two on my virtual shelf.

The plot uses devices that are only superficially examined.

After all, in any theatrical endeavor the script, as it sits on the table, tends to be in the same form as In the Quick. It’s only when that script is transformed into a movie, TV show, or play that the actors, the set, and the props all work to transform a superficial script into a convincing show of real life. Unfortunately, that transformation never happens with In the Quick.The actual story is comprised of a conglomeration of neat stuff about space exploration that has probably captured Day’s imagination over the years. The main character is a young girl named June that somehow knows the detailed workings of chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering. She then proceeds to grow up into a young adult and becomes an astronaut. From there, the story follows a nonsensical path to the end where June becomes a hero.Lastly, Day apparently has a problem with using quotation marks. While there are some writers that can pull this off, in those instances their writing is so masterful that this sparseness of style enhances the experience that they have created.

The novel is presented as Emperor Julian Augustus’s autobiography spanniJulian falls flat in its delivery due to the novel’s approach to its subject. The novel is presented as Emperor Julian Augustus’s autobiography spanning his short life. Julian’s writing is augmented by commentary from two old philosophers who lived during the emperor’s reign.The result of this autobiographical structure is that the novel reads like a history book. The emotions of the events are flattened down to the point where human emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, etc. are all presented as adjectives on the page as opposed to actions by the characters. The old writing adage of “Show, don't tell” is excluded from these pages and makes this novel very dry and unexpressive. Given this scholarly feel to the novel, it seemed a bit wasteful to read a fictional history about Julian Augustus when factual accounts, told in the same historic tone, must certainly exist.In reading Julian, I kept remembering a similar work written by John Williams (of Stoner notoriety) that was entitled Augustus. In William’s novel, he presents the fictional biography of Caesar Augustus, Rome’s first emperor. In addition to the similarity in subject, Williams also used first-hand manuscripts to tell his story.The contrast between the two books, however, is striking. While Julian is dry and slogging, Augustus reflects the human elements of life that surrounded Caesar Augustus. The difference is that Williams told his story with manuscripts that were never intended for publication such as letters and journal entries. This approach begged an intimacy in writing while the self-written autobiographical format of Julian does not.The main point of the novel may have been Vidal’s desire to offer criticisms of Christianity and religious beliefs in general. Vidal points out Christianity’s inherent contradictions, hypocrisies, and its blatant borrowings from the pagan rites that preceded it. For emphasis, Vidal transforms Julian into a pagan equivalent of Jesus and proceeds to highlight some of same criticisms made of Christianity through Julian’s actions and pagan beliefs. These points are interesting but they are extremely diluted by countless characters, places and events that have no actual bearing on the story. The overall effect is that the interesting elements are lost to significant disinterest in mostly everything else in the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 07, 2023","May 26, 2023","May 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8719.Julian

I mean, all she has to do is defend herself, and if she’s a girl of normal strength and her attacker isn’t some kind of superman, she’ll be able to fight him off. So when a rape happens, it’s either because the girl is paralyzed with fear, or else because she secretly wants to be raped. Besides, I don’t remember hearing you scream.”In moving forward from that passage, it became the central question in my mind as to how this view enhanced or advanced the plot. Upon finishing the novel, I concluded that it was a weird, chauvinistic expression of Silverberg’s own views on the subject and he must have felt compelled to insert it into his story. The passage served as a distraction throughout the novel. It called into question Silverberg’s ability to realistically imagine human society 400 years into the future, which is major shortcoming for a science fiction writer.If that passage had not been included in the novel, the story would still have been unimpressive.

First, each of the characters possessed a high degree of individuality. Count Fosco perspired personality, Sir Persival exuded plotting wickedness, and Lady Fairlie personified demure kindness. They were all very well developed and upon completing the novel, their names alone were enough to invoke memories of them as unique individuals. In my experience, anytime characters are given the words necessary to bring them to life, the mystery of those lives interacting is worth reading.The other creative element was the changing perspective. With contemporary fiction, I often find this in books where the writer uses this motif as a gimmick with the intention to impress. There's no real reason for it, but the reader is forced to live through the mind-snapping reality of different characters assuming the role of narrator throughout the book. Credit is due to Wilkie Collins, however, for moving forward with what was then something that was mostly experimental in literature. The effect works with this book and keeps the narrative moving forward in real time with the events.One of the negatives is what I find to be typical of the three-volume-novel construct of the day: the story seems to sit on the same plot points for extended periods of time. The novel is nearly 700 pages long but I felt that the same plot could have been told, with greater intensity, in half the number pages. The other negative was the use of coincidence as a plot device. A statistician could turn this book into a project by calculating the extremely wee probability of this book ever having the possibility of actually happening. On this point, it seems that Collins traded reality for an easy path towards creating his story.Upon completion, I find The Woman in White sitting between its good and negative points.

Bathsheba embodies a force in women that has repeatedly shown itself in the intervening decades since the publication of this novel.The writing in this book is a bit better than the other novels that I’ve read by Hardy. Hardy has a propensity for writing long descriptive scenes of nature that touch upon every flower, every color, and every shade of light.

My intent to read a Fleming novel was reawakened with every movie, but I just did not get around to it, until now.With Bond being such a dominate force in movies, the comparisons between book-Bond and movie-Bond spent a lot of time floating around in my mind. It turns out that book-Bond is this real person with a real job. When not on assignment, he goes to the office, does his paperwork, meets with ""M,"" and typically has lunch in the employee’s cafeteria. He lives in a modest flat in London and his martinis do not necessarily need to be shaken, but they must have a slice of lemon peel in them. In comparison, movie-Bond is practically a superhero. He’s invincible with all of his gadgets, devices, and tricked-out sports cars. Movie-Bond is Batman in a suit and tie.Moonraker, the novel, is not much more than a typical mystery-spy novel. It moves along through its chapters revealing itself bit-by-bit through Bond’s deductive reasoning and spying skills. The story capitalizes on the public’s fascination with the then-emerging science of rocketry and its marriage with nuclear weapons. The first successful test of an ICBM came about two years after Fleming’s depiction of the one described in this book.Gender depictions in Moonraker were an interesting snapshot of the 1950’s. Fleming’s women were made to exhibit unassertive brilliance while maintaining their attractiveness to men. In hindsight, this is something of a stepping stone on the long path towards achieving equality with men in society. Men, in contrast, were depicted as the masters of society who required ten packs of cigarettes on any given day to cope with life’s pressures.The relative mediocreness of the novel and the bland nature of the James Bond character indicate a situation where the movie franchise probably perpetuates Fleming’s novels. Without movie-Bond, Moonraker would probably be relegated to the countless other dime-store paperbacks that find themselves for sale on eBay for only a $1....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 27, 2023","Mar 04, 2023","Feb 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3750.Moonraker

It covers the typical key players and it provides some interesting trivial details about a few of the main events. Given the targeted focus of this book’s contents, I would not recommend that it be the reader’s first book on the subject.The contents are mostly standard history: Washington was constantly retreating yet won, Franklin charmed France with his rustic American mannerisms, and the US Constitution was developed through a series of compromises. However, there are a couple of subjects where Fleming seems to look at facts with a bias towards supporting his own opinions about history. One such subject is the assertion that the typical American colonist was well-off. To support this assertion Fleming cites per capita statistics. This approach fails to capture the disparity in wealth that existed between the Founding Fathers and the common colonial farmers, laborers, and slaves. This opening chapter of the book tries to unify the American Revolution around a common goal of wealth preservation, but in reality, this goal primarily existed with those that had wealth to preserve.Another subject involved the prosecution of the war by the commander of the British forces, General William Howe. Fleming asserts that Howe went to great lengths to avoid crushing the rebellion due to his sympathy for the American cause and his own anti-war political views.To make his point, Fleming highlights Howe’s decisions to not pursue Washington’s army at various times during the conflict without pointing to any corroborating evidence that these ""failures"" were acts of leniency. An alternative, and possibly more plausible explanation, was that fighting a war in a distant land, with reinforcements 4 to 6 months away, engendered an abundance of caution and sought to avoid the possibility of excessive casualties. Both reasons for Howe’s actions are possible, but Fleming chose to strongly emphasize the former, possibly because it adds a small taste of intrigue to the well studied conflict.Overall, this book is an airline flight collection of history created for those that would rather read The History Channel than watch it.

Within our complex human nature, there are times when The Other Woman takes on the disconnection that exists between emotional and factual realities. Within our complex human nature, there are times when emotional truth is absolutely real to us. We feel the greatness of an imagined future. That greatness then becomes an absolute truth that drives us forward. The problem arises when our imagined greatness is forced to confront actual reality. The Other Woman focuses on this problem in possibly its most sever form. Certain young women, barely older than teenage girls, imagine themselves being loved by the boys that turn their heads. While not intended to be a generalization, I have seen this at work with the young women of my own family. They venture out with the reality of their imaginations in their minds and they end up burdened and repressed by what the real world gives them in return. Only occasionally is the storm weathered and a wisdom born from the experience. Bohman makes these realities known by placing her readers inside the mind of her young female character.

I have always suspected that the real Mexico, the real Mexicans, were located mere steps from my beach-front resort or cruise ship pier. However, I never wanted to venture those few steps and see what Mexico was truly like. But more importantly, I am Mexican, born from a second-generation mother who spoke only Spanish when she started elementary school. On the Plain of Snakes took me across the street and showed me the life of the Mexicans from which I come.Beyond the personal impacts, Theroux performs a more universal service. He destroys the stereotypes of the last decade that have demonized an entire nation of people so that others in our own country could be manipulated through fear. Theroux's observations allow his readers to see typical Mexicans throughout this veiled land and shows them to be virtuous, hardworking, family-loving, and pragmatic. The irony is that conservatives of our own nation default to their demonization while in truth, the cultural kinship shared among Mexicans in their own communities is the conservative vision of neighbors helping neighbors in the absence of government. And yes, there is indeed some real danger. It was once pointed out to me that Mexico could serve as the ideal model for American-conservative-capitalism. Business is pure and workers are free agents devoid of any social protections. It’s an economy founded purely on supply and demand. Even government is a part of this dream. After all, a bribe, at its core, is just another business transaction. Again, the irony is that pro-business (anti-socialist) conservatives in the US demonize people that are living the life of their advocations.The demand for drugs, primarily US demand, activates the raw capitalist mechanisms in Mexico. Entrepreneurs harness that demand and transport drugs to the border. It’s this capitalist activity and its inherent violence that allows our own conservative politicians to cast the taint of drug dealing on to all Mexican people. Paul Theroux stops this disillusion.

With most modern historical fiction works, the relationship between the past and the present are at least half-way understood. But with Ivanhoe, this relationship is obscured by the years since it writing.My interpretation is that Scott used this story to reflect upon religious irony between the two time periods. He depicts medieval religion as self-serving, power hungry, and especially antisemic. It may have been Scott’s hope that the depiction of such deplorable behavior 600 years ago would have created a place where these acts could be contemplated in isolation from Scott’s present world. The hope being that a condemnation of people in a fictional 12th Century England would carry subconsciously into judgements of similar behavior in Scott’s 19th Century world, where all of these afflictions still existed. To this end, Scott shows his cards with a single solitary line in the novel: “Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!” Anything more than that would risk breaking the seal between Scott’s fictional world and Scott’s reality where humanity actually lived.The overall story is typical 19th Century writing. Long narrative passages that tend to overly stretch out the story. The writing is filled with vocabulary that is seldom in use today. Making matters worse, is the 12th Century dialog of the characters, which amplifies the antiquated English. But at moments, Scott does a good job bringing knights of the medieval England alive. He even brings the legendary Robin Hood to life, which may have been anticipated by his readers due to time period.

At the beginning of WWII, William P. Mack was There are relatively few WWII naval war novels that have what Pursuit of the Seawolf quietly possesses. At the beginning of WWII, William P. Mack was a gunnery officer on board an old WWI-built destroyer (the subject of this novel), and by the end of the war he was captain of a modern-type destroyer in the Pacific. He was a career naval officer who eventually commanded the 7th Feet and was appointed the superintendent of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. He retired at the rank of Vice Admiral. Simply put, Pursuit of the Seawolf possesses credibility.I would characterize this novel as a time capsule that contains the lives of those that served on board destroyers in the Atlantic during WWII. At the time, destroyers were relatively small ships made quickly and en masse to deliver destruction to the U-boats that were decimating merchant shipping. They were commanded by young officers who were given something resembling autonomy in difference to their unspoken expendability. The destroyer’s crew took on the characteristics of a family, depending solely on each other in times of crisis.This novel packages life in this setting into a complete composition. This novel possesses truth in the same way that a painting comprised of fictional elements can depict life as it was in a past moment in time. While the plot includes submarine attacks, explosions, and tragedies, this is not the point of the novel. Mack intended to impress his readers with reality. To this end, depictions of a destroyer repeatedly voyaging out on escort cruises in the Atlantic and then returning to port may not be thrilling, but it is real.All of this makes Pursuit of the Seawolf, and Mack’s other destroyer novels, important.

My twenty-something self experienced the extreme fun of making numerous all night turn-a-round trips to Las Vegas with my best friend. We jumped into his junker Ford Pinto and headed out for the free booze and the belief that we would win big at blackjack. Those adventures seemed like the pinnacle of adult entertainment, but I grew up. In Sideways, Jack and Miles take a similar trip to the Santa Ynez Valley where their pre-middle-aged selves demonstrate how pathetic the immature human male can be, especially when money is available to fuel a childish lust for fun.The cringing that comes about by their acts is part of the fun. Rex Pickett knows that human behavior that hinges on pure desire can be very entertaining. Spontaneity that leads to stupidity is the stuff that captures our primate-formatted minds and holds our attention.And then there’s the wine. I think that many people pick up this book in the hopes that it will be a theme-based wine novel. While there are occasional wine descriptions, both serious and snarky, the wine element is more of a device to reinforce the true nature of the men involved in the childish antics. These are not young adults who are out to drink some beer and bag some babes. Rather, these are older adults of a certain age that have lived enough years to develop an appreciation for the sophisticated experience that wine can be, and still want to bag some babes.Along the way, however, Pickett gives us the dawning of an epiphany wherein the two man-children awaken to how the world works. They learn that adulthood is a collective of the responsible who only, and just barely, tolerate the immature among us. It’s this witnessing of growth that also captured my attention.All of this comes together, sort of like a taste of wine on the pallet.

Included in the story are sleep hibernation chambers, a doomsday comet heading towards Earth, and of course, action and suspense. The surprising thing was that The Ark managed to hold my attention for the duration. Coates’ new twists on the old sci-fi themes kept me entertained through to the end.It was the the writing that pulled this novel through. Coates uses what I would call “command language,” which consists of concise communications between the characters as well as between Coates and his reader. An example of this type of language would be a room full of military officers giving a briefing to their commanding officer. This writing style maintains the intensity of the story. Things happen quickly and I found myself reaching the end of the novel almost unexpectedly.One drawback of “command language” is that the characters become something like tin soldiers. There’s no room to convey complex feelings or emotions about the end of the world. It’s also difficult to segue into detailed descriptions of the science behind the fiction. Coates never explains how such a unique comet could come into being. There were also other detractions. First, the impossible: the characteristics of such a deadly comet could never remain undiscovered until the day of its arrival. Such a intriguing interplanetary iceball would be studied by private institutions around the world. It would be photographed by telescopic instruments that were designed to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum and its nature would be be discovered independent of the US Government. Second, the improbable: It is improbable that the US Government could maintain a cover-up of the magnitude described for a period of three years. And finally, the trivial: the stars worn by US Army generals are not gold.Overall, this was an enjoyable science fiction novel. As Cotes’ first novel, I would suspect that he gets better and more original from here.

The story is told once, working its way through all of its key events while withholding relevant facts to manufacture suspense. Then, in the final chapter, Hardy tells the same story over again but he includes the relevant facts so that some sort of sense of the story can be made.

He is unable to resist the temptation to constantly oscillate between hope and despair, and as a result, this novel becomes an annoying roller coaster of near-death experiences. In contrast, the good dystopian novels slow the oscillations down. During the intervals, the characters are made human, the science that is relevant to the premise is explored, and the setting is made real. By the end of Solitude, the main characters appear to be walking miracles and the mystery behind the creation of the dystopian world is used as the bait to entice the reading of the sequel.In detail, the characters are one-dimensional military types. The are made to laugh, cry, and curse upon command by Cole. There is no background to them other than a few lines of explanation and as a result, their feelings are never fully empathized. They also expound a sense of humor that is often found in the military world. It’s a sort of gallow’s humor that makes light of the danger. The premise of the book, however, self-implies that whatever the danger, the two main characters must survive. Therefore, the gallows humor becomes a sort of double-irony: “My god, this could toast my arse! (but if it did, the story would end).”The science of the dystopian Earth is left completely unexplained with just a few hints to suggest something to do with gravity and micro black holes. Even though one of the characters is a theoretical physicists with a LOT of time on her hands, that time is ceded over to the next scene of danger from which escape would normally be impossible. Even when science is used to escape death, the details of the science are ignored in favor of the heroics of the characters.Overall, Solitude was entertaining in a shallow sort of way.

At the same time, it also tells the story of a modern-day descendant of the wife who finds herself in the same home in 2001. As a result, the story moves along two timelines.In the 1662 timeline, the wife of the merchant sits for a portrait by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (or more commonly known in modern times as just Rembrandt). Rembrandt finds himself by happenstance visiting Hull during a period of financial hardship. In the modern 2001 timeline, the wife’s descendant, who is also an artist, struggles to find a solid footing in her life. She moves from place to place painting pictures as opportunities permit.Embedded in both timelines are themes that center on the art of painting. Davenport sifts through the mind of Rembrandt so that we can see the workings of his thoughts, which produced such beautiful paintings. My online searches of Rembrandt’s paintings gave this novel an expanded feeling of presence. Within the modern timeframe, the 2001 artist expresses her intent with her paintings and communicates how her creative urges are possibly the only thing that is calm and constant in her life.The main characters in this novel have an unpredictability to them that maintains an interest in their lives. While there is a mystery surrounding the acts of one of the main characters, that particularly mystery is not the focus of the book. Rather, The Painter is a mystery about growth and change, and illustrates how such mysteries have existed throughout time. Reading this novel to the end reveals who the characters become through their experiences.For all of its great artistic and human content, The Painter is somewhat low-energy. The story has so many great themes and yet it never reaches the intensity necessary to make the pages disappear.

He brings into focus the naval air arm of the British Armed Forces during WWII. It was interesting to learn the extensive nature of their training. It was also interesting to learn that the United States played a significant role in providing that training, even before the US entred the war. As a textbook account of Hanson’s life during WWII, the book is complete.In reading memoirs about wartime experiences, however, I have learned that combat is complicated and varied. Combat happens in any environment be it on land or sea or in the air. The one thing in common to all types of combat is the tragic and sudden loss of friends. It’s an inhuman occurrence that typically demands questions and rationalizations; it may also bring into question the purpose and need for such violent sacrifices. The truly “greatest” of memoirs explore these questions and insights. The shortcomings of Carrier Pilot is that the book suffers from a lack thereof. Whether it’s due to a staid English upbring or the traditional emotional detachment typically displayed by naval officers in command, Hanson expresses very little emotion. He loses friends and fellow pilots, many of them due to mistakes or mechanical failures. But each tragedy is glossed over with a few euphemistic words and the next day’s events are quickly brought into focus. Hanson never questions the need for their sacrifice and he certainly never contemplates the value of a friends life as balanced against the necessities of war. It’s this coldness, this lack of thought or consideration in the face of human tragedy, that makes for a very dry account of Hanson’s wartime experiences....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Jun 2022,"Jun 10, 2022","Jun 01, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33117854-carrier-pilot

The story is filled with cameo characters that all have their own personal problems and we get to hear about each of them throughout the book. Marius Gabriel attempts to generate interest in these problems by giving them to well known figures of the time. Igor Stravinsky, Arturo Toscanini, and the Kennedy’s, to name a few, are all crammed together on board the SS Manhattan.For good measure, Gabriel attempts to add excitement to the mix. He depicts his imaginary voyage as a “last plane out” situation. There are countless refugees wanting to flee Europe before being overrun by Germany at the start of WWII. Fears are stoked through visions of the Holocost and the brutalities of fascism. Aslo included is a bit of U-boat terror in the North Atlantic.The voyage ends before the book‘s ending, which sets up the last quarter of its pages as follow up chapters. These last chapters are far more interesting mostly because the focus switches from people’s problems to people’s destinies. Unfortunately, there are far too many gaps in the story during these final chapters, which makes for a choppy ending.Overall, Porter’s Ship of Fools has been remade with fire and brimstone, and we get glimpses of the characters after their voyage ends.

Great mystery novels are those where the writer keeps the reader honestly guessing at the central questions of the plot up until the end of the book. In my experience, I have read only one or two great mystery novels, and Lady Audley's Secret falls far short of greatness. It is likely that most readers successfully guess Lady Audley's secret before the ""big reveal"" occurs later in the novel, and the final mystery of the book is not much harder to glean than the secret.And yet there may be a message here from Elizabeth Braddon in an age when women were oppressed by a male-dominated society. Braddon may be suggesting that oppressed women will find ways to work within the system of oppression in order to turn the tables on their oppressors and come out on top. And if working within the system does not work, beware of the oppressed woman who strikes back. They may do so with complete abandonment of the societal rules that oppressed them from the start.For a Victorian novel of the late 1850s, I thought the writing was somewhat unique.

His style uses concise and simple words to stitch together images of the American West that are reminiscent of an impressionist painting. Each word is its own brush stroke and when taken as a whole, the image comes together as a scenic moment in time. Dorn of the Mountains is filled with these images, which are the best parts of the novel.It’s unfortunate that the same style of writing does not work well with Grey’s human characters. Beautiful landscapes are of the moment. In contrast, humans are far deeper than what we see on the surface at any given time. This depth is lost to Grey’s characters. They essentially remain true to their original makeup throughout the novel and its only Grey’s narrative that drives the plot. Another element of Grey’s poorly crafted characters is the constant use of racism against Mexicans. Rather than developing conflicting philosophies and motives between the characters, Grey simply rests on racism to fuel the fire. Derogatory terms such as “greaser” are used to define Mexicans and only the “bad” characters include Mexicans in their mix. With racism established, more important issues that should be more relevant to the characters and the plot are left poorly defined.The complete package is a novel that is simplistic with respect to the reality that was the Old West. While the backdrops are beautiful, the story that takes place out in front of the scenery is childish and foolishly deceptive in its simplicity. Furthermore, anyone who is fooled by Grey’s story may be inclined to think that Mexicans are nothing more than drug users, criminals, and rapists, which makes this novel a disgusting thing in today’s world....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 07, 2022","Apr 20, 2022","Apr 07, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18801311-dorn-of-the-mountains

All we want is for life to somehow be like we was.

This style is not a favorite of mine mostly because the writer tends to keep the story in his own court. Ideals are communicated in a constant flow of thought that shifts in timeframe, character, and experiences all within exceedingly long paragraphs. Along these same lines, there are only two chapters in the novel. There is very little room for the reader to contemplate what’s been said and to form any sort of relationship with the story.In this particular case, however, the style works with the story. It makes the main character’s uncontrollable spin through grief relatable and real.

But if we go one step further, it could be said that desire and obligation are the only two forces behind our decisions. The Mill on the Floss is George Eliot’s artistic thesis on this deeper notion. Eliot artfully moves her characters through lives filled with desires and obligations. She illustrates how humans, endowed with the unique ability to think, will often forgo using this gift while evaluating these two forces. Instead, they rely on beliefs that have been developed through a long history of the same ignoble process and end up reinforcing a confidence in a flawed reality.Another intriguing aspect of The Mill on the Floss is Eliot's style of interweaving generalities of life with the specific actions of her characters. She challenges her readers to accept or reject her notions of human nature while using her characters to enact her ideas. It's this use of the general along side the specific that makes this book so enjoyable. It made me think about reality and in doing so, made the book feel real and relevant.And lastly, Eliot created in my mind one of the most memorable characters in 19th century literature: Maggie Tulliver. From the precocious child that brought her imagination forward into her reality, to the intelligent adult that recognizes how desire and obligation can be jumbled together, clouding the way forward towards right and wrong decisions.

The merciful events that serve as the focal point of the book’s synopsis and also decorated its cover comprise only a small portion of the book's content. A Higher Call’s true nature is a biography of the German fighter pilot, Franz Stigler, from his initial days of flight, through his fighting as a fighter pilot during WWII, and concluding with his post-war years. Therefore, it felt like I was deceived into reading Stigler’s biography.According to A Higher Call, Stigler was a German fighter pilot credited with shooting down 45 allied aircraft during his 400-plus combat missions. He probably killed more than a hundred enemy airmen and continued to fly missions up until the very end of the war. He advanced in rank from corporal to first lieutenant in the span of his three years of service. This was a person who, at best, was fully committed to the killing that was required of a German fighter pilot; or at worst, was fully indoctrinated into the Nazi Party.Contrary to his military record, however, Adam Makos portrays Franz Stigler as someone who is other than what the facts of his military service would suggest. He made Stigler into a victim of the Nazi Party, a victim of his conscription into the Air Force, and a victim of the war. Makos molds Stigler into consistency with his single act of mercy that he granted to an aircraft that he thought would perish anyways. Essentially, Makos transforms Stigler’s lapse in military judgment, which was probably due to prolonged fatigue, into a moral decision that was supposedly a natural part of Stigler’s character.

Over the centuries, the written works associated with pirates have been built off of tall tales and have evolved into fantasies. The truths about pirates and their lives are completely obscured due to a lack of real information about the people that entered and departed notoriety over the span of mere months. It may have been that the only way for Dolin to have set the record straight was to write the record as it minimally exists, and this is exactly what Eric Jay Dolin does in Black Flags, Blue Waters. It’s a marvelous source for purely factual pirate history.It’s the dryness of this work, however, that limits its enjoyment. Most of the factual information about specific pirates consists of names, ships, and dates. As such, these three facts, as they relate to the great number of pirates covered by Dolin, all blur together into a cloud of data as the book progresses. It was nearly impossible to see each pirate as a unique individual or to recall their specific activities as I approached the end of the book.

Williams' piraPirate Spirit suffers from Jeffrey Williams’ obvious love of literature and religion, which he infuses into his ideal pirate creations. Williams' pirates roam the high seas while reciting verses from Dante, Milton, and John Donne. And for good measure, moral points are made throughout the book with quotes from the Bible.During my reading of Pirate Spirit, I found myself researching the life of Anne Bonney. My conclusion is that virtually nothing is known about her life, and much of what is known has likely been sensationalized or made up to enhance her mystique. In fact, it is likely that the only real information that exists on Bonney are contemporaneous reports from her trial for piracy in 1720. Given this information, Williams' book could have taken virtually any direction in fictionalizing her life. Williams’ chosen path for Bonney was one that emphasized a continuing conflict between a middle class teenage girl of a religious and moral upbringing, and the life of a pirate with very little regard for the life and property of others. However, one of the few factual things we know about Bonney was that this conflict did not exists during her marauding days as a pirate:“Captured sailors reported that after their vessels were taken by the pirates, it was the two women—Bonny and Mary Read, the latter who had joined the crew by then—who urged their crewmates on to greater acts of bloodshed and violence. Some of these sailors testified against her at her trial.” - Christopher Minster, Ph.D., Professor of Latin American literature and history, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador In summary, it is a bit of a stretch to call Pirate Spirit a work of historical fiction. In my mind, historical fiction should check into the facts that are relevant to the story while creating a world around those facts that is as real as possible. The end result should be plausible, if not believable. As it sits, Pirate Spirit  is a fantasy of Anne Bonney’s life that has only the most tenuous of places on the shelf of historical fiction novels....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Dec 31, 2021","Jan 07, 2022","Dec 31, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1937040.PIRATE_SPIRIT

I collected and read each of them as I found them in swapmeets or used book stores. The color mentioned in each of the titles made each find a part of a themed collection. In this re-visit of the genre I began to think about why I liked the Travis McGee novels so much all those years ago. The simple answer was that Travis McGee was something of a loner. He also spent a lot of time in his own mind, thinking through things and presenting their meaning. And yet, he listened to others, acted upon a faith in knowledge, and believed in integrity. He lived a life that enjoyed a quiet modest comfort. Travis McGee worked when he needed to (usually resulting in another novel) and enjoyed what he called his incremental retirement between jobs.After all these years, I now see how Travis McGee shaped my love for the books that took his characteristics to the next level. Writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Graham Greene took Travis McGee to the next level with their characters, but rather than solving mysteries, these writers attempted to solve life itself.Based on my recollections, The Turquoise Lament is better than most McGee mysteries. The plot is relatively expansive and covers a diverging set of topics and locations. Along the way, the Travis McGee introspective never stops. The topping on this particular donut, in the box of donuts that comprise the McGee novels, seems to have a bit of extra flavor in it.The one consistent flaw in MacDonald’s writing of the McGee novels is his inability to capture feelings of kindness and love. Yes, he writes them into his novels, but stoicism wins out over deep emotions every time. The noir mood, the philosophical introspective, and the tough guy McGee cannot communicate the full depth of his feelings for people. This dryness in emotion holds The Turquoise Lament, and every other McGee novel, back from being works of literary art....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 19, 2021","Dec 28, 2021","Dec 19, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18914993-the-turquoise-lament

She then added those thoughts to her own with the end result being this second and last novel. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was published a year before her death at age 29 showing once again that only the good die young.If I were to boil this wonderful book down into its simple elements, I would be passing by the remarkable composition that is experienced when this book is considered in its entirety. Nonetheless, Wildfell Hall stands as an example of how subjugated women were in a man-made society as it existed over 150 years ago. It stands as an example of how far women's assertions for an all-inclusive society have taken them. And in seeing such progress, one can see the the distance that is yet to be traveled. That is why this book is timeless and will continue to be so: the past, present, and future will always be contained within its pages.But Wildfell Hall is so much more than just social commentary. The story was extremely well written, especially when compared to my only previous Brontë encounter, Jane Eyre by her sister Charlotte. The novel possesses creativity in its delivery and a genuine sympathy with the human condition.

Bell who, at the time, was a naval officer and captain of the destroyer USS Grayson (DD-435). Therefore, a few words about naval captains could help place the tone and content of this book in perspective.To start, naval captains are conditioned through a long tradition of unforgiving responsibility. This usually manifests itself in the form of a God complex, merciful if satiated. Next, naval captains and their ships are one in the same. If a ship undertakes a mission, the captain of the ship is the one undertaking the mission. The crew is perceived by the captain as the biological components of the machine he drives. And lastly, naval captains are trained to be deadpan serious while in command. They speak in a calm serious voice and they write as they speak. All of these traits set the tone, mood, and content of Condition Red.With the above in mind, Condition Red comes across as a mundane naval captain’s report on how he spent the initial months of the war. The destroyer actions recorded by Bell are not that unusual and can be found in other books about destroyers during the war that have much more color and energy. Overall, Condition Red seemed to be mostly intent upon impressing Bell's fellow officers, informing junior officers of their future responsibilities, and contributing to the tradition of creating naval captains in the image of God....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 25, 2021",Dec 2021,"Nov 25, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35608436-condition-red

To think about it is to arrive at the conclusion that the stars may not necessarily be out of human reach due to the vast distances between them. A star that’s 1,000 light-years away would require only six months of an adventurous astronaut’s life to reach it at that speed. All we need is technology and humans are an inventive lot. Of course, the down side to this realization is that the astronaut would never come home. He may indeed make it back to earth, but his home would have perished soon after his journey began.This is what makes Tau Zero such a wonderful book. It takes the above fact and tells the story of its practice. It places human characters inside a spaceship and sends them on an adventure that is not that far off from being possible. Substitute a bit of imagination for technology and Tau Zero becomes real. This aspect of the book was relished and it is quintessential science fiction.As for the book’s weakness, it appears that Anderson loved science more than people.

However, Francine Prose elevates the story by making it about human desire. When we see something that we very much want, desire can guide our actions without any consideration about the future. Whether it’s an extra serving of desert, an expensive piece of jewelry, or an illusion of youth, rational thought can be completely absent, or bent into an accomplice, during our acts of indulgence.Francine Prose accomplishes her story by doing something that I relish in novels. She constantly probes the human mind of her main character so that by the end, you know who he is. She creates a character with the ability to decisively act in contradiction to his rational thoughts, or to act in the absence of rational thought altogether. In truth, Blue Angle reveals the person of Ted Swenson.The supporting characters, if not as well defined, are just as craftily written. They exist with the definition of the main character’s limited understanding of them. After all, if we were there, the most we could hope to understand of these people is what we could see from a distance. Prose uses the light of the main character to contrast the shadows surrounding the supporting characters.In Francine Prose, I may have found a writer of the likes of Greene, Maugham, and Leonard. These are the writers that know that the thoughts and actions of their characters are equally interesting things. They feed off one another, support one another, and oftentimes contradict one another. And these writers use this dance to create stories that reach far deeper into the human condition than stories of simple action alone.

The wealthy lived their lives like there was no conceivable end to their money, and everybody seemed to be reveling in the relief that the Great War had come to an end. The Glimpses of the Moon is steeped in this atmosphere.As for the main storyline, the book is about the fragility of the love that is developed and shared between the two main characters. It illustrates how love can become diminished when our individual notions for a perfect world are in opposition to those of the ones we love. Additionally, Wharton explores some of the side effects of all that 1920s exuberance. The book contemplates the value of living by one’s own wits and means. The book also looks at the hangers-on, or the entourage, who always seem to collect around the wealthy and it questions whether their dignity can be preserved while also performing sometimes unsavory favors for their patrons.While all of these themes make this a potentially wonderful book, the brevity of the book’s content obscures them. Wharton never dives very deeply into the hearts of her characters.

They are all stereotypical in composition.Lastly, the style of the book is atypical for a novel.

Governance by the all-white National Party came to an end and a national election plIn 1994, South Africa underwent a remarkably peaceful transition. Governance by the all-white National Party came to an end and a national election placed power in the hands of the African National Congress (ANC). Along with this transition, the remaining legal constructs of apartheid were abolished. For the majority of South Africans the struggle for freedom had been won, but the hard work of transforming a nation into a just society had just started. After Freedom makes a determined effort to define the attitudes and opinions that spanned the societal spectrum of South Africa some twenty years after the 1994 election. The approach used by Katherine Newman divided South Africa into seven socioeconomic groups. She then chose a representative member from each group, and studied that person for approximately two years.The study of each representative consisted of periodic interviews with the designated person as well as their family, friends, and acquaintances. After Freedom is essentially a report on the successes and failures of ANC governance as perceived by Newman’s selected group of people. Additionally, Newman provides various statistical facts that support, supplement, or at times contradict her subject’s observations.The end result is a book that should be cautiously read. The impressions of South Africa that are imparted are the impressions of an extremely limited sample of people. These impressions may extend to a great many people, or they may be limited to the unique experiences of the individual. By the end of the book, I found myself relying more on the footnoted facts about South Africa than on the opinions of the individuals to form my own impression of life in the new South Africa twenty-plus years after its remarkable transformation.From my perspective, After Freedom illuminates a new South Africa that is still extremely new. It's somewhat meaningless to look at the country at this stage in their journey. It is unquestionably good that apartheid was eliminated, even if the overnight removal of such a power-and-control structure resulted in their current problems with social uncertainty and large increases in crime. To this end, the ANC has been deficient in ensuring that access to education is universal. Law enforcement could also be expanded and focused on the worst elements of crime in the country. However, good governance is about priorities and with so many people living in abject poverty at the start of majority rule, those priorities have centered upon alleviating starvation, bringing clean water to poor communities, and providing basic sanitation. These are not flashy things that broadcast success to the outside world, and they are not easy things that can be accomplished quickly. But they needed to be done, and the government is achieving measurable and commendable progress.The world’s perception of South Africa as being the safe and modernized country at the tip of the African continent will likely return, but when it does, the citizens of the entire nation will share in that success. However, that is just my opinion based on the contents of just one book; and my hopes for a country that I found truly enchanting during my visit in 2002....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Sep 13, 2021","Sep 26, 2021","Sep 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18248505-after-freedom

He provided four possibilities, and to his credit, one of them actually happened. While I watched the transformation, my perspective was from halfway around the world and far removed from having an actual vested interest in it. The South African transformation, indeed, seemed like a miracle.As a reporter covering South Africa for the Financial Times of London, Patti Waldmeir's credentials want for nothing. Before and throughout the transformation, Waldmeir was in South Africa and the adjoining African countries that housed the African National Congress (ANC) in exile. She interviewed the leaders, negotiators, and people on both side throughout the decade-long journey that was the actual transformation. The result of her diligence and dedication is this book, and for a recounting of history, it doesn’t get any better than this.As for the miracle that's dissected by Waldmeir, it's comprised of the South African nation. Blacks and whites were proud to be South African and more importantly, they respected each others claims to the land of their heritage and home. On the whole, all of the people of South Africa deeply wanted to be free. It's obvious that the oppressed wanted their freedom to determine the course of their future, but the oppressors deeply felt the burden of their subjugation. There is a quote in the book from Nelson Mandela that sums up this idea perfectly:A man who takes away another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness...The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity. The oppressor must be liberated just as surly as the oppressed. - Nelson MandelaThis want of freedom was the motivating, moral and ethical force on both sides. South Africa was fortunate to have produced two leaders, Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk, who both had the wisdom and pragmatism to feel their way through a murky path. From my US perspective that path seemed impassable. Their accomplishment is shared and obvious. The path, however, was indeed filled with traps, pitfalls, and decisions that were rooted in a blind faith in their better angels.As for the future, it is uncertain. The book was published in 1997, just after the transformation, which leaves me once again in search of an ending, at least as it exists today. However, Waldmeir provided her hope for the future of the New South Africa with her passage:South Africa, A land of intolerance, and despair would deliver itself a miracle. Like every miracle it had its antecedents...it was less a gift from God than a gift from men to other men. Perhaps there is a chance - just a chance - that such a man-made miracle can endure. - Patti Waldemar...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 04, 2021","Sep 11, 2021","Sep 04, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1265463.Anatomy_of_a_Miracle

Many of them were written as an excuse to sell books that capitalize on the stereotypes of the genre and include an abundance of gunslinging and arrow-shooting action. With this in mind, it's somewhat unique to find a book that deals with the subject seriously and realistically. Where the Lost Wander is such a book.Amy Harmon approaches her Western from the perspective of her two main characters. John is a person that I can fully relate to. He was born in one culture and raised in another, and he goes through life never truly belonging to either. Naomi is assertive and intuitive which makes her wise beyond her years. They find themselves facing the harshness of the journey, which brings them closer to their families and friends, and closer to each other. The love story between John and Naomi feels natural and it's in harmony with setting.Along the way we see a much more probable interactions between the migrants on the trail and the Native Americans. For the migrants, mild forms of arrogance and mistrust are born from their interactions with an unknown and seemingly strange culture. The Native Americans view the migrants with trepidation and a vision of their fate to come. It’s this depiction of both cultures coming together that makes Where the Lost Wander a novel that is more than just another Western.My only issue with the novel is its construction. When I mentioned that the story was told from the perspective of its two main characters, that was a literal statement. The first person narrative switches between John and Naomi throughout the story and at times it was easy to lose track of who was actually narrating. I also thought that this approach limited the depiction of other perceptions. It would have been nice to have been more fully immersed into Native American culture while such a realistic opportunity existed, but with John and Naomi filtering all that happened, this broader view was an impossibility of the book’s structure....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 16, 2021","Jul 23, 2021","Jul 16, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51815479-where-the-lost-wander

By the early 1910s the industrial revolution had fully worked its way into society and options Sons and Lovers is a complex book from a complex time. By the early 1910s the industrial revolution had fully worked its way into society and options for living were opening up to the generation that was coming of age. The farmer’s son no longer needed to become a farmer and the coal miner’s son no longer faced a lifetime of mining. But the newly found opportunities were accompanied by a great amount of turmoil. There were many choices that had to be made and none of those choices could ever be fully correct. It’s one thing to know without question that your father’s farm will one day be your farm, but quite another thing to have found a love for math, science, art, and farming and know that by choosing one you sacrifice the others. Lawrence gives life to this conflict through the love interests of his characters.The parents of the young main character represent the previous generation. They are bound to tradition. Choices, even when seen by them, are considered illusions. The son, in contrast, is bombarded by choices symbolized by the women he courts. In choosing one path to love, he is faced with excluding other opportunities. To him, his choice represents potential regrets for the path not taken and a compromised form of happiness.Permeated throughout the book is the world itself. Lawrence includes vivid descriptions of sunsets, oceans, and green hills of the Nottingham region of the England. Flowers are often present and beautifully described during most of the scenes where the characters are experiencing the frustrations associated with this new era. I see this aspect of the novel as Lawrence’s way of asserting that the world remains a constant regardless of how society changes within its sphere.The problems with this book rests in its length. It could be seen as a bit ironic that Lawrence was trapped within the method of previous generations of writers that required novels to meet certain requirements for length and artistic merit. George Gissing highlighted these requirements in his 1891 novel, New Grub Street. As a result, Sons and Lovers is filled with beautiful scenes and drawn out acts. In contrast, just 10 years later writers such as Fitzgerald and Hemingway would transform the way novels were written. Those writers would go on to write about similar conflicts between lovers and the complexities of the modern world in much more powerful and concise ways....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 26, 2021","Jul 10, 2021","Jun 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32071.Sons_and_Lovers

However, Gladwell’s conclusions assert that one factor, opportunity, is more important that every other factor in reaching outlier status, and that opportunity is related to some random condition that is bestowed upon the outlier independent of conscious effort. Therefore, one cannot become an outlier of success like Bill gates or Steve Jobs based on one’s own innate abilities.I was a bit trepidatious while reading Outliers mostly because Gladwell comes across as being very pretentious in his conclusions. He picks examples that fit his conclusions, expounds upon those examples in detail, and fails to suggests that other examples may exist that work against his conclusions. He’s also very quick to reference scholarly studies that support his premise but very few of those studies support his premise directly, and again, if those studies ultimately cast doubt on Gladwell’s conclusions, the reader will never know.It is in this light that I think that Outliers is deserving of some open and critical thought after reading it. Given the complexity of the world, and in opposition to Gladwell’s desire to be an authority on the subject, I think the finding of a self-made rags-to-riches story that is devoid of random opportunity is easily achievable.

Missing from its pages are space battles, galactic greed, and exaggerated bravado. Also missing are the countless sequels that rehash the same old sci-fi ingredients. What is included, however, is the real point of science fiction: to explore issues relevant to all of us in a way that removes those issues from the emotional baggage of the near and present. At its core, this is what Simon Fay does with Icon-Violet.The focus of the novel centers upon an instinctive trait that is as old as our sentience. In the early days of our clan-based existence, the shortcut of defining friend or foe was embedded into our reactionary minds. Simply put, those from the outside were feared. The outsiders were those who were not from within, and the more afar they appeared to be, the greater the fear.In the intervening millennia, this fear, like most of our ancient instincts, has stayed with us. It has only been through our conscious efforts to employ the greatest of our abilities, rational thought, that we are able to catch ourselves and change. In the absence of rational thought, we see this ancient fear dictating actions that result in the gravest consequences.Within Icon-Violet, Simon Fay transplants this fear and gives it new circumstances. He explores it through actions and dialogue of his characters, and shows that it can be overcome if we are brave enough to communicate with each other.This book is very near perfect to my tastes in science fiction. Simon Fay clearly has a grasp of the human condition and wonderfully expresses this grasp though his writing. This is rare ability among science fiction writers.

It’s a topic where the middle ground can be distinguished as a grey area that separates mostly facts on one side and mostly emotion on the other. On the pro side of the argument, past experience has shown that illegal immigration works with our economy. We all enjoy the benefits of a vast unskilled labor force. On the other side of the argument, and at the heart of the matter, there are those that see ""replacement"" as the main argument, even though that argument cannot be voiced directly. As such, the con argument mostly consists of generalized lies that are intended to fuel widespread fear and hatred of these fellow humans.When discussing such political topics, the old adage that there are ""two sides to every argument"" does not hold true. In such circumstances, there is a moral obligation to the truth and the acceptance of generalized lies as the other side of the argument should never be condoned and should be confronted. This is where Francisco Cantú failed in The Line Becomes A River.Within The Line Becomes A River, Cantú writes on the confrontational topic of illegal immigration in a non-confrontational way.

The scenes of naval conflicts are conveyed with a natural continuity that preserves the chaotic and horrific details of men fighting each other with cutlasses, on the decks of ships made of wood, and moved by canvas. He’s also familiar with the humor that permeates naval life either in the form of the antics played on fellow seamen or in the irony associated with naval commanders trying to shift blame away from their own shortcomings. Beyond the sea, Marryat instills reality into his characters. He constantly brings forth small universal truths that support the actions and behaviors of his characters, which adds a greater depth or deeper meaning to his story. And while some of these truths are a bit outdated, there is a sort of contemplating fun in bringing them forward 200 years to see if they have indeed changed or if they still hold true. This all shows that Marryat thought that reality was an important aspect of his writing, probably more so than his contemporaries including Scott and Cooper.But contrary to the realistic writing, the plot suffers from being too episodic. Each chapter or two covers a single event in the life of one of the main characters and once that event has passed it is seldom mentioned again. As such, there is no sense of learning from past experiences that I think makes a novel about a life worth reading.Overall, Marryat’s sensitivity to his own contemporaneous surroundings results in a book that feels right while reading it, but does not come together holistically. Previous s have reported that The King's Own is not regarded as Frederick Marryat's best work. There are some that say that that honor belongs to a book entitled Mr. Midshipman Easy. As such, I’ll probably have another go with Frederick Marryat the next time I wish to return to the sea....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 15, 2021","Apr 26, 2021","Apr 15, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21357371-the-king-s-own

He's become a one-dimensional patriotic figure that can be consumed by enthusiasts without a need to ever consider that he was human, and by definition, a loving, brilliant, vengeful, and flawed individual. My Dear Hamilton plausibly humanizes Alexander Hamilton and restores to him a likeness of the person that he was when he was a person.To this end, the factual history in this novel is told by his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, and takes place in the background of Hamilton’s family life.

They must have read through countless letters, journal entries, and news articles of the times to complete their work.

The end result is indeed a likeness of the man that could have been Alexander Hamilton.As for Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, she too is made human, but probably more in a way that serves to create Alexander Hamilton rather than trying to be true to who she was at various moments in time.

I had questions concerning the truth of the story and tUpon finishing Charles Nordhoff's Mutiny on the Bounty I had an uneasy feeling about the book. I had questions concerning the truth of the story and the defamation of Captain Bligh. There were subtle contradictions in the story that irked me to the point where I needed a factual interpretation of the historical record so that I could move on. Hence, chosen mostly by chance, I read Richard Hough's The Bounty.Hough presented the record of available information regarding the voyage of the Bounty, Bligh, and the mutiny. I found it a relief to know that portions of Nordhoff's novel were manipulated for his purposes. It was also a relief to know that while Captain Bligh is mostly to blame for the mutiny, his faults do not rest with the long-term tyrannical unhinging of Bligh as depicted by Nordhoff.There were a host of circumstances that contributed to the mutiny some of which can be attributed directly to the Royal Navy in their planning of the voyage. Other circumstances rest with the hypersensitive Fletcher Christian, who overreacted with the mutiny in response to the strictly verbal punishment imposed on him by Bligh. However, Bligh's shortcomings in knowing how to command sailors at sea are where most of the circumstances lie.In US Navy terms, Bligh was a mustang. He was commissioned as an officer after working his way up from an ordinary seaman. I think that this limited Bligh’s exposure to more nuanced methods of command and the various processes needed to maintain unit cohesion. At that time, discipline during Bligh’s career was maintained by harsh punishment, which is what Bligh used on his men when required. Bligh was actually very brilliant in all that he did, but he was only brilliant to the limits of his abilities. As such, he probably never realized his shortcomings which contributed greatly to the mutiny.I can see why Nordhoff would find a bunch of nuanced circumstances difficult to work into a swashbuckling novel. But therein rests my foremost issue with Mutiny on the Bounty. Nordhoff wrote a falsification that's more satisfying than real life, and in doing so, he's almost pushed the truth out of the way of actual realization. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 07, 2021","Feb 12, 2021","Feb 07, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45438710-the-bounty

I believe that anytime the word ""mutiny"" is spoken or read, the Bounty is the ship that flashes through the mind. Given this widespread notoriety, I was disappointed with its actual content.I thought that Nordhoff overdramatized both sides of the mutiny. The crew were turned into victims for having to suffer the norms of an ordinary seaman’s life. And the integrity of an accomplished naval sea captain was sacrificed so that he could appear to be unhinged and blamed for the events that transpired.The book also reaches its peak fairly quickly with the mutiny happening in the first third of its pages. This leaves the balance of the book filled with sometimes interesting but mostly uninteresting storylines. This issue is not helped by the fact that there are far too many characters who are so underdefined that Nordhoff’s post-mutiny references to them by name become practically meaningless.Within the historical fiction genre, I think the best books do a remarkable job at using history as the framework for a human story.

He served as a junior officer on a destroyer at the beginning of World War II. He knew the mannerisms and attitudes of those that surrounded him, and he knew the operational characteristics of a US destroyer at sea. The overall result is one of convincing naval realism. In my mind, South to Java presently holds its place at the top of the naval warfare genre sitting alongside another great book of the class, The Cruel Sea by Nicholas Monsarrat.The place and setting of the book contribute to its intriguing content. At the beginning of WWII, our South Pacific forces were essentially echoes left over from the Spanish American War nearly forty years earlier and were only minimally upgraded during and after WWI. These relatively isolated forces were required to fight the full force of the expanding Japanese empire, and as a consequence, they were repeatedly defeated and pushed back to safer areas where they were required to hold the line as best they could. South to Java places a WWI-class destroyer and its men on the front line of this aggression.My criticism of this book may be a consequence of it being Mack’s first novel, or it may be a consequence of a 37-year military career where interactions with peers must have always been somewhat guarded. Whatever the reason, the characters all exhibit a sort of inner stoic restraint that did not allow for their deeper thoughts on life and death during times of war to be explored or expressed. However, I do hold high hopes for Mack. By the end of this first novel, he started to breach this final barrier.

In the post-apocalyptic aftermath a group of kind and determined Aryans band together to rebuild Germany in the shadow of the destruction. Along the way, the Aryans suffer hardships and give each other hope. That is the story of Outlander Chronicles: Phoenix.The Long Review...(view spoiler)[There is a lot of good writing in Outlander Chronicles: Phoenix (OCP). C.H. Cobb demonstrates a nice balance between exuberance and restraint that makes his writing credible. I enjoyed the mentorship between the two main characters: wisdom imparted from the old to the young. There are passages with horses that Cobb captures with an obvious sensibility towards these beautiful animals. And the tactics of the armed conflicts were objectively portrayed even though these types of scenes can get far-fetched in the hands of writers.But There is an issue with OCP that haunted most of the reading experience. In explaining the reasons for the apocalypse, Cobb asserts that a belief in God is essential to preserving our ability to make moral decisions and form moral societies. Should we decide to sideline that belief, we are destined to bring the apocalypse upon us.The fault in this reasoning is that there have been many moral societies that have existed for centuries and millennia in the 2+ million years of human existence before God. God is simply another codification of moral behavior and a society that believes in their moral code (regardless of its manifestation) will avoid the apocalypse.Furthermore, societies that embrace God have no guarantee that Cobb’s apocalypse will not be visited upon them. The Roman empire collapsed some 150 years after Constantine the Great embraced Christianity. And an extrapolation of the vulgar immorality that was exhibited throughout the Trump presidency could also serve as an example. Corruption is the true crime against societies that causes their downfall; always has been and always will be.Cobb’s reasoning also found itself in conflict with the thoughts and behaviors of his characters. These descendants of Cobb’s Godless and immoral society all exhibited moral behavior when naturally appropriate. They exemplified the net-good in humanity, sans God. It’s this net-good that is ultimately responsible for guiding us throughout a predominantly Godless history and delivering the present-day moral societies that exist around the world. The characters themselves represent the biggest contradiction to Cobb’s premise.But then we hit Chapter 25 and all doubt of the propagandic nature of this novel is swept away. OCP reveals itself to be the telling of the demise of Christian-based American and European culture. To blame are swarms of Muslim immigrants and their foreign beliefs, and their rabbit-like desire for reproduction. American liberals also play a critical part in making America weak. And as an added bonus, the believing reader will now have a reason to justify the inhuman extermination of the Native American population by the Founding Fathers.This has been a difficult book to . In many ways, Cobb’s writing is mostly benign, but that’s how threats to the Christian Right, White Nationalists, and the Alt-Right are expressed for their consumption in mixed company. They use subtleties, innuendo, implied meaning, and victimizations all wrapped up in a mainstream statement where one could very nearly conclude that there were ""very fine people on both sides."" The fact remains, however, that Cobb uses his underlying premise to express distrust, prejudice, and paranoia towards an entire religion, even if only briefly.We no longer have brown shirts or men in white hoods marching down the street, but what we do have is exactly the contents of this book. Even if the intent was not there, the meaning needs to be pointed out for what it is.

It provides insights into how the Republican Party co-opted racism and bigotry in order to keep their ever-slipping grip on power. It acknowledges the white nationalist movement’s shifting image from one of aggression to one of being a victim of the willful genocide of the ""white race."" Both of these maneuvers served to soften the perception of the white supremacist movement, attract passively consensual supporters, and gave the Republican Party cover for accepting an overtly racist constituency. However, while this aspect of the book is interesting, there are probably books out there that present this subject more concisely.Fundamentally, Rising Out of Hatred is about the conversion of Derek Black from the preordained future leader of the white supremacist movement in America into a real human being. The story is quite remarkable given that his father was Don Black, a former KKK Grand Wizard and creator of Stormfront.com, and that his “Godfather” (the x-husband of Derek’s mother) was David Duke. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent that Derek’s transformation was really a matter of luck. Had Derek’s parents not been so overconfident in their brainwashing of Derek, he would probably have been persuaded to stay immersed in their bubble of stupidity rather than allowing him to go off to college. Had Derek been older than he was, his white supremacist ideas would have probably been solidified in his mind, rejecting out of hand more realistic ideas. But, I’ll take luck, if that’s what it takes to make humanity whole again.As Rising Out of Hatred continues towards its end, it becomes clear that Derek is not the hero of this story as the title might suggest. He experienced no epiphanies nor made any self-possessed efforts to realize truths about humanity. A small group of classmates befriended Derek. They are the true heroes. Each one of them saw Derek as human first and ignored his race in their quest to present reality. They are the ones that walked into the fire and extinguished the flames.But in the end, Derek Black worked for contrition. He did not simply fade away into retirement. He actively spoke out against the irrational ideas, the stupidity, and the realities of white nationalism. And for that he earned my forgiveness....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 19, 2020","Dec 24, 2020","Dec 19, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39706735-rising-out-of-hatred

It’s a book that looks into the inner mind of a brooding first-person male character, Joe Lampton, who is trying to make sense out of the life that he thought he could plan out completely and the life that he ends up living. Joe’s struggle for understanding is further complicated by the early 1950s setting when men saw themselves as anointed for success while women had no real choice but to live in subservient roles. As a personal preference, I like novels with a first-person perspective. The writer practically steps aside and lets his character directly tell his story. It echoes other books of a similar style written by Graham Greene and Ernest Hemingway; two writers that fill their pages with insights. I enjoyed hearing Joe’s inner voice contemplating and comprehending his experiences. It all felt very human and very real.From today’s perspective, Room at the Top is a time capsule whose time we all keep trying to leave behind.

As an enthusiastic James Bond fan, I went to see it right away. In addition to the great action and intriguing gadgets produced by “Q”, I was also enamored with a line spoken by Bond himself. That line lodged in my 15-year-old head and it ultimately developed into a point of thoughtful consideration over the years. On occasion, it’s been taken out of mental storage and pondered…“The Chinese have a saying. Before setting off on revenge, you first dig two graves.” [James Bond, 1981]At its heart, The Count of Monte Cristo is a study in the meaning of this life-long inquiry. Edmond Dantes (a.k.a. The Count of Monte Cristo) sets out for revenge and in doing so sufferers the consequences. In my ponderings of that Chinese saying, I came to the realize that death can be partial as well as complete. The killing off of a portion of one's moral center is a sort of death that requires a grave for such a loss to be hidden. Dantes may have tried to escape his fate, but philosophically speaking, a part of him died nonetheless.If that were the sum total of this book, I would find myself in that fulfilling place where a book has spoken to my personal ponderings. But unfortunately, this book is vastly too long. It waters down its own message with Dumas' desire to tell stories. Each of the 117 chapters has its own quasi-storyline and it's only the conclusion of each chapter that moves the reader one small step further along a relatively short journey. As a result, a lot of reading is required in order to just lightly realize a very intriguing theme.In addition to the diluted plot, Dumas practically gift wraps and delivers the targets of Dantes’ revenge straight to Paris after twenty years of estrangement. This as well as other aspects of the book are all a bit too conveniently and coincidently contrived for my tastes.It’s also a bit too imaginative to think that the people who knew and lived with Edmond Dantes would not recognize him after a gap of twenty years. Granted, he has the element of surprise, but the victims partially deserve what they get for being so obtuse throughout their prolonged, Dantes-induced downfalls.And lastly, the entire premise is a bit hard to imagine as true. Edmond Dantes is an escaped prisoner who stumbles upon incredible wealth. Under the threat of capture and return, I would think a more natural course of action would have been to live the rest of his life in luxury, out of the way of the people that could end it all with the simple recognition of who he is. Such a course of action would have also saved Dantes from having to dig that second grave....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Oct 08, 2020","Nov 24, 2020","Oct 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo

And whileIt's difficult to label this book as anything other than what it is: a biased rant against colonial power in Asia and specifically in India. And while Rabindranath Tagore puts forth many observations concerning the character of the colonial powers, he does so by generalities. The nations of the West, with a capital ""W,"" are the great evil who’s peoples, regardless of the nation to which they belong, have all sacrificed their moral souls in order to press Asia in slavery. And because the invading colonial powers are individual nations, those nations must be wholly immersed in nationalism.I tend to treat such generalities with skepticism, because such generalities fail to dissect the ""great evil"" into specific issues and problems. Completely absent from such rants is an acknowledgement of the benefits that came with colonization or the identification of problems that can be constructively solved. Granted, there was indeed much evil associated with colonialism and I agreed with many of Tagore’s assertions, but I agreed in concept subject to details while Tagore asserted absolute truths.Another shortcoming in this book is Tagore’s reflections on the path that lead to his generalized form of nationalism. The people of the west have abandoned their societies that were originally founded on a moral and spiritual construct, where the moral consciousness of man dictates the actions of the nation. At one point, he suggests that this type of society existed during medieval times in Europe. My observations of this period of European history do not support this assertion. Additionally, I doubt that such a society has ever existed given that pure moral truths never exist as uncurruptable beacons of guidance. Tagore fails to realize that nations cannot go back to a state of existence that never existed.Lastly, Tagore attempts to place India’s internal suppression of its own people, its caste system, into a positive perspective. At one point he states:“...what Western observers fail to discern is that in her caste system India in all seriousness accepted her responsibility to solve the race problem in such a manner as to avoid all friction, and yet to afford each race freedom within its boundaries.”It was at this point that my skepticism turned into a conviction that Tagore was perpetrating the same defects attributed to the colonial powers. He manufactured half-truths and untruths, persistently misrepresenting others, and continually brewing evil menace towards neighbors and nations other than [his] own. This is when I recognized this book for what it is.

For the first Update, 11 July 2020, The Movie:Shawn Slovo was the screen writer responsible for transforming Bernières novel into the two-hour movie. For the first two-thirds of the movie, in a manner very similar to the novel, Slovo does a remarkable job of boiling the book down to it's main theme of impossible love. It's the final third, of the movie that Slovo could not come to terms with. The movie quickly degrades at this point into action sequences that make little sense and an ending that is also less than captivating.---Book Review 2 July 2020:There are countless books like Corelli’s Mandolin: boy meets girl, love ensues, and consequences abound. But Corelli’s Mandolin goes much farther in its embrace of love than most stories that follow that simple path. Corelli’s Mandolin is a story about the vastness of love. It brings to life the power that love has over humans who were created to heed its call. Bernières depicts love as a force that pushes us forward on multiple paths as we move through our days. We propose to one another, we go to work, we fight wars, and we take revenge all because of love. All of this is included in Corelli’s Mandolin, which provides an opportunity to think about love in this larger context and to ponder the reasons for our own acts and the acts of those around us.The flaw in this book is that its intensity runs out long before the book actually ends. Bernières spends 350 pages in developing a story about love that truly reached my heart. This main part of the book delicately covers a handful of years during WWII in a remote corner of the war under strangely unique circumstances that were endured by wonderfully unique characters. Then those years come to an end. Had the book ended at this point it could have captured the power of this story between its two covers.But unfortunately, the book continues on for another 100 pages and does so with a change in both tone and time. Gone are the intricate interactions between characters. Decades of time rush by while contemporary Greek history is half-heartedly covered. Bernières then delivers his real ending that’s a bit insulting to reason as well as to the power of love; and by that time, the magic of those first 350 pages has faded away....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jun 16, 2020","Jul 02, 2020","Jun 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3388.Corelli_s_Mandolin

The story is told in a meandering roundabout way that seems to bank on Maugham skill as a writer to write interesting things even if those things have very little to do with the plot. Maugham leads us through the minutiae of his characters, albeit with a skill that reflects his greatness as a writer, but at times I had to stop and wonder about the point of it all. It may be that Maugham was living in some episode of his past while he was writing in his present.The heart of the story is actually very sweet. It tells of a coming of age story of a shy boy in his youth and his reflections on his youth in his later years. It tells of a girl that we could all judge as being loose or promiscuous, but Maugham manages to raise her above the judgments of his readers and his characters. She is the stated reason for Maugham’s calling this book his favorite, and given the tenderness with which he treats her, I suspect that he had the privilege of knowing this girl at some point in his life.Three starts is a bit harsh, but four would be a bit much....more",Notes are private!,1,18,1,"Jun 08, 2020","Jun 14, 2020","Jun 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/191793.Cakes_and_Ale

For some time, I’ve longed for a sci-fi novel that invested as heavily into its characters as it did in science and the future. In this way, this ideal sci-fi novel would achieve a balance between characters, plot, and setting. This book does just that.The Songs of Distant Earth is a human story. Its message speaks to who we are and its contemplations speak to who we may become. Clarke engagingly tells us that we can indeed control our destiny and that all the -isms that plague us as a species are not necessarily inherent in our makeup. But he also warns us that changing who we are absolutely requires a conscious choice that can only be made by a universally informed decision. It’s these rich observation on humanity that create an intellectual depth within The Songs of Distant Earth that adds to the fullness of the story.And the story takes the time to let us know and understand its human characters. They live and breathe in the human worlds that are (or were) their homes and they give a fundamental meaning to Clarke’s overarching observations on humanity. They are indeed precious and Clarke makes them so. In the end, I wanted to know them better and I wanted to know their futures.Finally, the science presented in this book is a staid type of science that keeps its feet in reality. As a result, the science becomes amazing when Clarke reveals its potential. In Clarke’s introduction, he calls out Star Trek for being a fantasy because it takes science beyond the possible. I see that as a form of courage in sci-fi writing, and it set a challenge for Clarke before the first chapter even started.

Most of the way through, it seemed atypical of his work. It was every bit as engaging, but it was almost too stayed, too calm in comparison to some of his other novels. But then the final chapters come into play and Leonard shines like a beacon of human unpredictability.The best way that I can describe Leonard’s writing is that he creates characters that we, the readers, will never be. He creates characters with values, hopes, and dreams that differ from our own, and he does it so well that their decisions fall in line with who his characters are while at the same time, causes us to gasp. And gasping through the words of a writer is a wonderful thing.The ending is perfect, complete with that feeling that comes when you believe you’re smarter than everyone around you only to find out that someone else saw right through you.

I would consider The Valley of the Moon to be such a book in that the nature of its two main characters, Saxon and Billy, are honestly preserved. For the last hundred years, they have been frozen in time, coming to life in the eyes of the reader every so often.And the reason why I think this book’s characters are important is because of who they are. They are the result of a limited education that has been structured with a form of white-pride patriotism that's been shaded favorably towards capitalism. It left the winners of capitalism multiple hand-holds with which to manipulate masses of people with feelings of pride and honor while working away their lives for subsistence wages. It shut out the idea that capitalism may owe something to the society that allows it to flourish. And it blamed other cultures for problems that such a limited education brings upon itself.Sound familiar? When London wrote this book, he was immersed in an American culture that accepted these human characteristics as the norm. That is where the value lies in The Valley of the Moon. We can compare London's norm with the present-day. When we do, we can see that we have come a long way in realizing the benefits of cross-cultural interactions and the advancements that an education based in science and reason, rather than one filled with emotional hand-holds for others to manipulate, can achieve. But The Valley of the Moon and our present-day political climate in America also shows that America still has a long way to go to leave London’s norm behind.Given this window into the past that still illuminates our present, The Valley of the Moon holds its relevance. It is indeed a bit drawn out in later chapters and the solution to the plot's main problem seems to be served up on a silver platter. But until America can put the Saxons and Billies behind us, The Valley of the Moon is an honest look at the worst that America (Americans) can be, which makes it an interesting book for the foreseeable future....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 07, 2020","May 21, 2020","May 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1382920.The_Valley_of_the_Moon

Yes, the main character is a young adult, but all that happens to young Julia Reyes is exceedingly important to everyone, young and old alike. Julia’s life intersects with many social forces including poverty, crime, healthcare, and racism. But most importantly, her life struggles with the importance of family.The story centers on a family of Mexican immigrants where the mother and father have the force of will to give up all that they knew for the pursuit of all that they imagined a life in America could bring. It’s within this strong family environment that Julia struggles to find her identity. Her parents see the value of self-sacrifice but Julia has yet to learn that the strength of a family, reinforced by hard work and sacrifice, can empower its members to accomplish far more than they could ever accomplish on their own. It’s hard to say if Julia ever fully learns this lesson but Sánchez shows its validity throughout her story.Sánchez’s writing is an outstanding example of realism. Overly emotional passages, possibly something that I would associate with a YA novel, are avoided in favor of giving all that happens its proper emphasis. This is a modern-day example in the best tradition of writers that try to capture life in words rather than enhance it. The major difference, at least in this book, is that Sánchez chooses hope, rather than despair, as the ultimate mood of reality. On a personal note, I could relate to the main character, Julia Reyes. She and I are both US citizens who originate from a Mexican culture that we have never experienced beyond the idiosyncrasies of our families. In our travels to Mexico, we find a warmth that fills a void in our lives, but at the same time we do not fully understand what it means to be Mexican. On many levels, from a joy of reading to a sympathy of being, I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter was a fulfilling experience. It’s remarkable that this is Sánchez’s first novel and I am looking forward to her second, which I hope leaves the YA label behind....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Apr 23, 2020",May 2020,"Apr 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29010395-i-am-not-your-perfect-mexican-daughter

It’s exciting in all its calmness with the spotting of an occasional dolphin, the blue saturation of the blue ocean in all its nuanced states, and the feeling of the ship slowly moving towards the next port. I think it suits the engineer and the naturalist that live inside of me. To date, I’ve been on more than two dozen cruises.With that said, Rachel Rhys gets it right. Rhys captures the details of cruising on board the SS Orontes in 1939 and subtly uses those details to weave an shipboard atmosphere. She allows her characters to live in this environment without undue focus or unnecessary elaborations. Her writing subtly gets very close to the actual feeling of cruising. The details of the ship are constantly in play, but life while onboard is lived around these details.The story is something of a mystery novel, which is usually not my preference. But it's more of a mystery of character development rather than one of ""guessing the killer."" As such, the characters are slowly revealed as the ship moves through the sea, which creates a sort of synchronicity between the characters and the voyage. The need to keep reading is propelled by a desire to see who her characters actually are and not necessarily what they did (or did not) do. I think this approach gives her story a sense of reality rather than one of extraordinary circumstances. Overall, I would highly recommend Dangerous Crossing for anyone who is a cruising nut like me. Additionally, if you are considering Ship of Fools by Katherine Anne Porter as your next read, then Dangerous Crossing is probably a better choice.

About a third of the content in Vast must (hopefully) rely on the content of the two previous books. The characters are sketchy, they make references to past experiences that are vaguely explained, and the plot seemed to appear fully formed out of nothing. Never again will the enticing words of a sci-fi er prompt me to jump into the middle of a series.Another negative is that Linda Nagata’s writing was an obstacle to enjoying the story. When unique points in the story were reached, Nagata could not deliver the words to adequately describe the scene. Her descriptions all seemed to float within her vision of her created world, which is expected, but they failed to link back up with my mind residing in the real world. And I think that such links are an important part of making science-fiction relevant.On the positive side, there are a few passages with insightful contemplations on what it means to be human. At some point in our existence, the development of digital data and processors will be so complex that storing every synapse-connection in our brain will be possible. At such a point, the human that is us will continue to live alongside us in digital form inside a processor. And yet, should our human form pass, will the digital us still be us? It would have added some needed psychological depth to Vast if this philosophical question were made into an actual stress point in the plot.About half-way through, I found myself reading Vast with the goal of reaching the end of the book. From my perspective, this goal is one step above the goal of not completing the book at all.

Every scene is written to its fullest content resulting in paragraphs that span pages. There are no exceptions: settings, dialogue, and feelings are each covered extensively. They make for a relaxing novel because incrementally not much happens during each reading session, and to be fair, I enjoy a relaxing novel every now and again.The novel’s uniqueness stems from its setting and characters. The story takes place in a rural village in the heart of England in 1799. I liked how the book remained focused on this setting for its entire length. It relied on the wholesome nature of the villagers to organically grow the human conflicts that drove the plot forward. Eliot had no need for dastardly villains or greedy landlords or even charming princes, and she has a way of bringing forth a reality that’s long since lost. As such this book belongs to the people and period that she depicts.The most significant annoyance that I have concerns the culminating scenes that lead to the book’s ending. For this interlude, Elliot pulled a rabbit out of her hat. She then used the rabbit as the focus of the story so that some sort of drama could be raised in the plot. It was certainly a disappointment. The entire novel to that point was such a calm and deliberate build to an unimagined ending and then in the space of a single paragraph the book changes to an unrealistic play towards breath-catching emotion. Rabbits, afterall, do not suddenly appear out of hats. There are definite signs when a rabbit is forthcoming that Eliot seems to ignore.While reading Adam Bede it was interesting to discover that Adam Bede’s village of Hayslope is the fictitious depiction of the village of Ellaston, where Eliot’s (Mary Ann Evans’) father was raised. In looking into the geography, Google Maps was used to walk along the actual roads and to see the actual places described by Eliot. And the magical thing about a virtual visit to Ellaston is that it feels just like it was described for most of the book: quite; welcoming to its inhabitants and hopefully as welcoming to its sincere visitors. A more detailed guide to Ellaston was found...here....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,Mar 2020,"Mar 18, 2020","Mar 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20563.Adam_Bede

I wanted to find a western that treated life realistically and treated the environment of the old west with respect for the suffering that it inflicts upon those that enter its desolate landscapes. As it turns out, Death Comes for the Archbishop is a serious western.The story captures the New Mexico territory at the time of its annex by the United States in the 1850s and follows the life and journeys of the territory’s first appointed bishop until his death in 1888. In my life, I’ve traveled around New Mexico visiting friends and it was interesting to see just how much has not changed. The state is still composed of small towns and pueblos that are separated by vast landscapes. And while days on the trail have since been transformed into hours in a car, New Mexico still holds the potential to devour anyone stranded in lands located between places. Where this book shines is in its main character, Bishop Father Jean Marie Latour, who is the fictional representation of the actual first bishop, Jean Baptiste Lamy. Father Latour’s journey is that of a missionary, transplanted from the civilities of France to a land of crude dwellings and where the inhabitants are comprised of a mix of Mexicans, Indians, and a few Americans. The population is mostly Catholic, but the practices of their faith have experienced multiple declines. Throughout his discovery of these aberrations, however, Father Latour holds himself to a course that’s aligned with kindness and thoughtful understanding. He projects a sense of completeness that's anchored in his religious faith. If modern-day religion was the very thing that Father Latour practiced, I would find it hard to resist religion as an institution.Death Comes for the Archbishop is a beautiful book. It serves to capture the realism of the American West through inquisitive, as opposed to judgemental, eyes. In doing so, It lends a small sprinkling of credibility to the entire western genre and makes every western novel just a bit more real no matter how ""shoot-'em-up"" or ""ride-'em-out"" they may be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 23, 2020","Feb 02, 2020","Jan 23, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/545951.Death_Comes_for_the_Archbishop

Scott pulled me back to the early 18th century and The most inviting aspect of The Pirate is the sense of place that Scott instills within his story. Scott pulled me back to the early 18th century and placed me in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. At the time, these islands were located on the edge of civilization in the far northern reaches of Great Britain. Their inhabitants were Scottish by decree but Norse by heritage and custom. The islanders worshiped God but also believed in medieval myths and superstitions. All of this served to create the feeling of a mystical land that was far removed from the mainstream world.The character named Norna was written perfectly as a sort of dark reflection of these remote islands. She personified the mysticism and beliefs of the island’s inhabitants. Scott made Norna into mystical being while keeping her tragically human. Her story, her journey, on its own is worth the read. Along these same lines, the entire novel is a great example of knowing how to build a world in words while also knowing the point at which that world would fall apart in the mind of the reader. Scott admirably walked this line.My interest with The Pirate started when I came across a comment made by James Fenimore Cooper, author of The Last of the Mohicans, that was critical of the book. Cooper, having served as a merchant seaman and as a midshipman in the US Navy, considered the novel to include a less-than-true depiction of life at sea. His displeasure was such that it prompted him to write The Pilot: A Tale of the Sea, which was published two years after The Pirate in 1824.After reading both books, it seems a bit picky for Cooper to have made such a comment and for it to have prompted his writing an entire novel in rebuttal. Both books actually spend very little time at sea. However, if there was a break in Scott’s world, it was indeed during the few chapters that featured ships, pirates, and the sea. For Scott, it was all about the land. In contrast, these same few corresponding chapters in Cooper’s book were far better than the balance of his story. Thus, I think that Scott wrote the better book.The difficulties with The Pirate reside in its age. Of course, early 19th century English is something of its own dialect that can be difficult to follow. Along these same lines, the 19th century dialect of the Shetland Islanders, as phonetically written by Scott, is at times all but impossible to understand. Additionally, Scott may go a bit too far in setting the mood of the islands by freely including verses of poetry and songs in his prose. While a few of these inclusions were essential, most tended to be distracting.Overall, The Pirate is a touching love story that evolves from the life and struggles of its participants. Human complexity and dichotomy are realistically depicted. The characters are not sure-footed creatures that make their next move as a matter of course. But most of all, The Pirate captures the feeling of a remote land, isolated in time, and brought to life through Scott’s words. Anyone considering future travels through these islands would be well served by reading this book, preferably by a fireplace on a rainy day looking out upon fields of moss-covered peat that drop off over cliffs that rise up from the sea....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jan 03, 2020","Jan 22, 2020","Jan 03, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6486.The_Pirate

It's been touted as a means to obtain insight into the segment of socieIn contemporary times, this book has surfaced more than once in conversations. It's been touted as a means to obtain insight into the segment of society that is apparently blind to the chronic contempt for the legal, ethical, and moral principles that is being perpetrated by our current president here in the United States.While reading They Thought They Were Free I indeed found threads of commonality between the Germans of Nazism and the Americans of Trumpism. There existed then, as exists now, various psychological behaviors common to both -isms: the need to be accepted by peers, the apparent collapse of class in favor of a common cause, and the creation of a hero-figure that embodies ideas of self-perfection. These behaviors all played a part in the spread of Nazism throughout Germany of the 1930s and they translate well to Trumpism of the present day.However, this book also does a good job in bringing to light a powerful difference. Mostly all nations of the 1930s, Germany included, lived in a world where foreign interaction, information, and social relationships were relatively static. Access to education in Germany was severely limited. And Germans lived in a relatively closed society that was isolated by language as well as by a technological inability to widely distribute and receive information.Americans of today, and people all over the world, live in conditions that are just the opposite of those of Germany in the 1930s. They have direct access to science. They can evaluate credentials, judge integrity, and compare sources. Americans have no excuse but to know things and to be responsible for the things they know.Today, the tools to evaluate the detriments to society that were caused by Nazism are easily obtainable. While in the past almost all Germans may have served as useful idiots to the Nazi regime, the present American contemporaries of Trumpism are eagerly practicing willful ignorance, which could be considered the final perversion of the legal, ethical, and moral principles of society.The above comparisons and contrasts are mostly included in the first part of a three-part book. Beyond the transition of Germans to Nazism, the second part of the book explores the geographical position of Germany within the European continent and provides reasons for Germany’s aggressive behavior over the centuries. While not as pronounced as the parallels presented in the first part of the book, parallels can be drawn between a 1930s Germany that was surrounded by multiple militant nations and the American ""heartland"" surrounded by the populous east and west (left) coasts. If Germany became tribalized and militant as a result of these pressures, then conservatives in the heartland may find similar reasons to pursue similar paths.The third part of the book is predominantly relevant from a historical perspective. It covers post-war Germany and the pressures applied by the victors of WWII on the losers; especially under conditions where communism was a constant danger during the Cold War. Given that the Cold War has come to an end, relevance with today’s political climate is limited.Lastly, there is a school of thought that frowns upon comparisons of Nazi Germany with anything current. The thought is that the Nazis were such a aberration in history that any comparison is a violation of the logical fallacy of reductio ad absurdum (Latin for ""reduction to absurdity"") or commonly identified as an ""appeal to the extreme."" While this may be valid when considering generalities such as Trumpism will lead to Nazism, specific comparisons should indeed hold valid.Nazism was an absolute dictatorial and authoritarian system of government. Thus, the quantity of accurate comparisons that exist between Nazism and Trumpism should serve as an indication of society’s relative distance from the absolute. After all, we Americans still think we are free....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Dec 20, 2019","Jan 02, 2020","Dec 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/978689.They_Thought_They_Were_Free

The people that Peter knows change as they move around Peter through this episode of his life. Peter's wife, his working acquaintances, and even God all change their perceptions of Peter as they approach and depart and approach Peter once again.Faber uses science fiction to emphasize this fundamental message of human change in that everything alien is essentially unchanging. The alien world is a constant with its unchanging landscape. Its aliens are rooted in their way of life as it has become upon Peter’s arrival. Even the days and nights of this world remain constant for prolonged periods of time.

While Verne was calling out latitudes and longitudes I was plotting them on a map of the world. It truly was an adventure. To be at sea and know precisely where I am at awakes something that is fundamental to my nature. Beyond the voyage, it would be easy to become enthralled with Jules Verne’s depictions of futuristic submarines and other mechanical apparatuses that celebrate the technological prowess of humankind, especially if one were reading Twenty Thousand Leagues at the time of its original publication. However, in my reading of the book in the present, I saw this as a work of desperation.In 1870, Jules Verne was witnessing a world being transformed by technology. The world was being compressed and the feeling of remoteness for even the most far away places was being eliminated. By 1866, steam ships were increasing their range to such an extent that travel between New York and the South Pacific was on the brink of becoming routine and plans for the Suez Canal were rapidly moving forward under the sponsorship of Verne’s own countrymen in France.With this in mind, I think that Verne perceived the end of Earth’s mysteriousness and Twenty Thousand Leagues may be his ark of sorts. It was his attempt to put the mysterious wondrous world into a bottle before it became a simple platform for man to trod across in pursuit of riches.

The whole ""series"" thing has always raised questions in my mind as to why many modern sci-fi books never seem to stand alone. Why did I need to read three separate books just to make it through what could be characterized as complete idea? I have a feeling that I was played for three dips into my pocketbook even though a single novel could have resulted in a greater sci-fi gravitas and more serious contemplations.Adding to the discontent of having to make my way through the series is my perception that this was the best book of the three. The ""file"" issue that hindered the depth of the characters in the first book, and improved with second book, was mostly resolved with this third try. The entire series could have benefited from the writing that was employed in this third book had all three books been edited and published together as a single novel.Apart from the series thing, Only Human allowed for the contemplation of our own world outside of itself. It transferred our problems to a fictional setting and then stoked the fire like only science-fiction can do. If you think that a democratic society only improves with science, education and intelligence, then this book will give you something to think about. Only Human also provides a look at nationalism that is mostly removed from today’s political issues, which provides for a somewhat isolated examination of this collective belief.The characters in this book actually develop into people that feel real, although the things they do fall a bit short of realistic. However, on the whole, Only Human exhibits that special kind of literary power that I crave in science fiction. It provides an elusive opportunity to agree or disagree with ideas without having to agree or disagree on anything real. Some may think that that process is a waste of time, but I personally think it's at the very heart of our collective past and our collective future....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 18, 2019","Oct 23, 2019","Oct 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35820656-only-human

Unfortunately, this second book is a bit of a rehash of an old theme that has entertained time after time since the inception of science fiction writing, i.e. the alien invasion.As another handicap, the first book, Sleeping Giants, suffered from poorly defined characters. The organization of the plot into interviews (or ""files"") prevented the communication of all the quirky details that make written characters feel human. That same issue was somewhat lessened in Waking Gods but it was still present. While Neuvele expanded the scope of his ""files"" to include a broader selection of records of a more personal nature, the format still kept me at a distance from knowing the characters.I still enjoyed the book, but not as much as the first book in the series. The alien invasion theme has a few science-based twists that make it interesting and there a touch of social commentary that takes Waking Gods in a direction that I like sci-fi to go. However, as a work of literary fiction, which I believe all writers regardless of genre should aspire to, it falls short.So here I am.

It plays out the ideas that we are not the only intelligent species in the galaxy and that our prehistoric understanding of ourselves is exceedingly limited. It’s a book for those that like to ponder what-if scenarios that are plausible as well as serve to extrapolate real-world consequences. It’s also a book for those like me who crave discoveries.The book is written as a series of ""files,"" which serve as chapters and chronicle the depicted events. Each files primarily consists of an interview between one of the characters and the person in charge of advancing our understanding of the story.I felt that the file format had its benefits. For instance, the story moves quickly given that the files focus primarily on the facts. Also, the brevity of the characters’ statements allow the reader’s imagination to fill in much of the setting and action, which personalizes the experience. The overall format imparts the feeling that the reader has found an official account of events, like finding a lost box of government documents or an abandoned thumb drive, which reinforces the discovery theme of the story.The one shortcoming of the book was that the characters never made it off the page. Neuvel tried to work in emotional ties between the characters, but there was just not enough bandwidth in the file format to make those emotions feel true.

Not only are we too belligerent and crewel to one another, but our own biology serves to kill each other off. The only thing that has saved us from ourselves, that has provided us with some breathing room and has allowed us the space to mentally subdue the dangers of the crowd, is science. And by science, I really mean to say truth. The absolute kind of truth that serves as an absolute rock in a world largely devoid of such solid and immovable objects. As with the other Sinclair Lewis novels that I’ve read, Arrowsmith covers a broad span of years in the life of its main character, Martin Arrowsmith. It’s a life that touches the heart of my own life in that Martin has a love for the truth. He wants to know things, but he wants to know them with certainty.As a young disciple of the truth, Martin turns to science, or the common outlet for science: medicine. He searches for truth throughout his long career as a doctor and constantly runs into its compromised existence. He finds that truth is constantly assailed by all the forces that comprise humanity. Things like friendship, love, greed, jealousy, and compassion serve to dilute the substance of pure truth and serve to render it inept. Martin also finds that actual control over society is often contrived from this diluted form of truth. Along the way, however, Martin meets the love of his life and her name is Leora. In many ways, Leora is the human embodiment of truth, which is why I found her so endearing as a character. Even though her presence is something of a side note to Martin’s life, she offers a glimpse into what a useful and meaningful truth in society could ultimately look like: absolute fact blended with an imperfect humanity but tempered with reason. But getting to that sort of future will only be possible if we can all bring ourselves to care about the truth, and know what the truth is, in this imperfect world....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Sep 21, 2019","Oct 05, 2019","Sep 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11389.Arrowsmith

My mom loved wildlife shows like Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom and especially National Geographic. As I recall watching these shows, I realize that most of the footage was dominated by nature and the narrator was there only to provide relevant information. That was it. There was no dominating sound-track to hype the action of a chipmunk being bitten and then swallowed whole by a snake. That’s what learning was all about back then. Nature was presented and the viewer was given the opportunity to explore the full spectrum of their human reactions and ultimately understand the complexities, the sorrow, the joy, the necessity, and the reality of the scene. In the present day, it seems that the need for drama has invaded even the sanctum of TV documentaries. Exhilarating music needs to accompany the run of the cheetah as it races towards the gazelle. To this same extent, the quiet objective nature of history has also fallen to this need for dramatics, which is what I find distasteful about The Twilight Warriors. Robert Gandt gives no room for reflection, no alternative to the thrill of war, no pause for reflection.Therefore, if you like your history to be a one-dimensional thrill ride, The Twilight Warriors is probably a book to consider. The language is exciting with combatants being “mowed” down and their heads “splattering like melons.” The text is unburdened with footnote numbers so there are no pesky distractions to Gandt’s version of history.

To start, it’s a bit of a travelogue covering life in Paris, the French countryside, and the small towns located in the heart of France. The book creates a mood that one would feel if the reader was actually there. The seasons, weather, roads, and dwellings all play a part.The book is also erotic, but the eroticism has a purpose. It's intended to give the full depth of the human relationship between the two main characters, Phillip Dean and Anne-Marie, as they journey from their initial physical attraction through the subsequent phases of their relationship. Each scene is representative of a small transition in that relationship and advances the plot in a way that is more convincing than if it had been excluded.But the most interesting aspect of the book is its story within a story. This is the atypical aspect of the book that should be kept in mind from beginning to end. The true main character narrates the experiences of the two lovers from his first-person perspective. He’s a photographer, an artist, and he embellishes the story to enhance his own idealized desires. He’s a bit twisted in a subdued way and is sexually frustrated by the failings of his own sexual pursuits. In some ways, this unnamed narrator reminded me of a younger version of Lolita's Humbert Humbert; at least it's fun to think so.The result of placing the narrator between the reader and the lovers is a sort of vindication of the erotica. The reader is free to accept it and to feel its enhancing effects on the lover’s story without being directly a part of the lover’s acts.

A small group of cowboys from the United States finds themselves in eastern Russia, moving a herd cattle to a village in Siberia while being escorted by a group of Russian cossacks. While in transit, the many differences between the two cultures makes the story interesting and the occasional points in common make the story universal. The story then enters its middle half with a transition towards what I would consider to be a more traditional western novel. While the cross-cultural theme is still present, the focus shifts towards manly-man games and mano-y-mano standoffs between men who all think of themselves as having the biggest balls in the competition. Huffaker seems to delight in giving the play-by-play of each contest even though they become repetitive. Its during this portion of the book that the chapters become watered down, and if one were to skip over Chapters 11-20, the best parts of the book would be intensified and improved.The end of the book, picks up where the beginning leaves off. The cowboys and the cossacks are on the move again and that movement brings them in contact with hardships that must be dealt with. Its during this portion of the book that human suffering is proven to be universal and it is also shown that cultural differences can be a vast source of strength when dealing with common problems.Overall, the first and last quarters of The Cowboy and the Cossack project to present-day realities. We are all human and Huffaker shows that joy, sadness, hardship, and pleasure are very much the same in Russia as they are everywhere that humans reside. The isolation associated with the 1880s setting of the book brings this point home and makes The Cowboy and the Cossack worth reading; and if you like scenes that require cojones grande, then you’ll probably find the middle of book enjoyable too.

As chance would have it, the occurrence of the unbelievable coincidence is a key facilitator in every turn of the plot.

Cooper then proceed to write The Pilot: A Tale of the Sea, which was published in 1824. Then Dumas enters the picture. Dumas felt that “the pilot” in Cooper’s novel, the famous John Paul Jones, was left mostly undefined as a character.

The book is filled with heart, and at times, I felt the soul of Paton’s main character.I would like to say that Cry, Beloved Country is set at a critical point in South African history. However, it’s more of a snapshot in the continuing European and Afrikaners oppression of the native population. While the mid-1940s did offered the British colony choices as it moved forward towards its own independence, the choices that were made by those in power were no different that the choices made at every other point in their prior history.Cry, Beloved Country, however, does provide insights into the human nature of native South Africans. It shows them to be overwhelmed by the aggressiveness of the transformative process of invasion and as a result, resigned to their oppression. Yes, they have repeatedly fought back but their lifestyle and culture left them completely unprepared to resist the cruelty and complexity of the invaders. Their periodic struggles resulted in repeated catastrophes.The plot of Cry, Beloved Country is simply that, one more native catastrophe born from a tragic inability to deal with the invaders. And to know what this tragedy is like, what it actually feels like, one must feel the souls of those who suffered....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Aug 2019,"Aug 08, 2019","Aug 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6150.Cry_the_Beloved_Country

My  simply reflects a different way of searching through the genre for something that may not have been intended, but in actuality, is a great work of fiction.With that said and in spite of my usual distaste for mysteries and especially ghost-mysteries, I was impressed with the first half of Daughters of the Lake. At the top of my praise is Webb’s ability to write about human interactions. She handled them very subtly, but also in a way that communicated the deeply shared emotions felt between people. She depended on my reaction to her writing to complete the experiences being played out between her characters.Beyond human interactions, the initial half of the book also put forth the hope that it would not be typical of the genre. Her handling of the spiritual aspects of the book seemed to be unique and pleasing. Her ghosts were subliminal, almost psychological, while at the same time making their presence known to the reader. Had these strengths been worked into a complete story, Daughters of the Lake could have been exceptional within a genre that usually fails to deliver.The story then moves into its second half and the plot starts to degrade into what I would consider a stereotypical ghost-mystery. Webb draws upon the power of spiritual machinations, ignores what would be considered the natural tendencies of a journalist, and invents psychoses in her characters, in order to manufacture suspense and create her ending. Most of the things that Webb implies and suggests throughout this portion of the book can be reasoned away when looking up from the page. And the human aspects of the book, which were so heartfelt in the beginning, also fall away as Webb moves the plot towards its end. The actual ending was a prolonged experience.

It has a bad habit of changing timeframes and perspectives on a whim while placing key events in the current timeframe on hold. It seems like he was attempting to create a mood in which the story could take place but the end result is a book that reads like a Picasso painting.Llosa’s numerous characters are somewhat homogeneous. While unique nicknames are used as marks of distinction, only a few of them grow into distinct characters. And again, the rotating perspective does not help to differentiate them.The subject of the book covers a classic example of institutional behavior of pre-adault boys that are supervised by military caretakers that rule through harsh acts of corporal punishment, intemidation, and abusive power. The Peruvian military academy where the story takes place is virtually a storage yard for these kids, who are bound together as a matter of mental, physical, and social survival as peers. There is no room for any sort of true friendship.The book brings to life the primitive and tribal state of existence that can develop under conditions where an individual's sense of self is so far stripped down that one’s dignity and honor are compromised as a matter of survival. From a personal perspective, I spent eight weeks in Navy bootcamp, and while uniform behavior was the goal of my Navy instructors, they also valued the individual person, keeping guard of one’s sense of dignity and honor. This makes The Time of the Hero a study in social constructs and keeps the book interesting.Beyond the insights into tribal behavior, the book also brings the reader into Peruvian society and their culture. In my reading adventures, it’s not often that I have an opportunity to step outside my own norms of American/European society. The Time of the Hero sets the reader down in the heart of Peruvian neighborhoods and invites us into their homes. And during these explorations, I was becalmed to see that families are families regardless of where they reside.While this is probably not Llosa’s best work, I enjoyed the strength of his writing. He took on difficult subjects without shying away, which is the mark of a good writer. In fact, this may be his worst piece of writing (it is his first novel), and I feel compelled to give Llosa a second try at some point in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 09, 2019","Jun 23, 2019","Jun 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41828302-la-ciudad-y-los-perros

The protagonist is a 14 year-old girl who sets out for vengeance against the man that killed her father and to this purpose she is nearly perfect. She negotiates like a used car salesman, she manipulates people like a lawyer, she has the creativity of an engineer, and is hardened towards violence and fear like a soldier returned from war. Her wisdom is that of a sage even though her life story is that of a 14 year-old that has lived what would have to be considered a safe and sheltered life.All of this perfection gets blended into a story that is not that remarkable. It’s a western with good guys and bad guys. The plot moves forward quickly and provides its own solutions to what should be complicated problems. The only interesting thing is that the good guys, who remain good to the cause, have a sorted, and sometimes bad guy past. In the world of western writing, there are better stories.In light of all the great ratings I’ve seen, however, I find myself searching for the reasons behind my own disappointment with True Grit. In thinking on this, I realized that True Grit. is a story about a 14 year-old hero, a role model, in whom larger than life abilities and admirable characteristics are packaged. It’s a book that speaks to aspirations where I am a person that would rather read a book that deals with life with all its flaws, struggles, and joys. At my age, I have little use for interest in heroes, but I do relish characters that struggle with a life that is relatable to my own observations and experiences....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Mar 19, 2020","Mar 25, 2020","May 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/989263.True_Grit

Some elements were simply glossed over and required automatic acceptance. Other elements, however, were thought provoking. Heppner’s treatment of faster-than-light travel and its effect on trans-galaxy communications, for instance, rested in harmony with the way humans and have traveled and communicated from the beginning of our existence. This was the best part of the book.Overall, The Lost Starship could have been a much better book.

They do things based on temptation and opportunity, and while their decisions may sometimes seem crazy, their actions are understandable.The Bounty Hunters, as Leonard’s first published novel, was interesting because the instability appears in macro form. Leonard applies it to groups where shifting desires (or loyalties) can be explained by a group psychology that is, coincidently, also based on temptation and opportunity. The book is a sort of a p of his writing to come where he will eventually hone down the group into a set of individuals.But group psychology lacks the mystery (or craziness) of the individual decision making process.

These are some of the genuine human pleasures that D'Annunzio brings to life throughout this novel.Layered upon that feel-good notion, D'Annunzio also illuminates pleasure as being an emotional commodity. While pleasure can be exchanged to the mutual enjoyment of those involved, if taken by one, the deficit of pleasure experienced by the other is among the most painful experiences in human existence. It’s D'Annunzio’s insistence on including this pain in his story that keeps the novel grounded and true.And throughout the novel, D'Annunzio gives us one more dimension to pleasure. In this form, pleasure manifests itself as something that’s synthetic, almost counterfeit or fake. This type of pleasure can be had with personal achievements such as buying a coveted item or creating something with pride. However, D'Annunzio also points out that this type of pleasure is fleeting. It seems to dissipate almost as soon as it’s experienced leaving behind the desire for another hit in its wake.All of these nuances of pleasure are explored by D'Annunzio in this novel that’s titled with that one solitary word. Considering that the completed work is a seamless tapestry of life, D'Annunzio’s study of this emotional concept is indeed a work of art....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 04, 2019","Apr 17, 2019","Apr 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16171201-pleasure

Bedford essentially seeks out her own kind (middle-class European/Americans) and thinks that finding them is an adventure. Once found, her expatriate acquaintances confirm the stereotype of the lazy Mexican who is poor due to an inherent lack of initiative and a savage upbringing.Bedford tells of a country that lost its opportunity to thrive under the European installed emperor, Maximilian. To this end, the most favorably depicted Mexicans are those of Spanish descent (e.g. Don Otavio) whose families were established in privilege by colonial acts of favoritism. Most of the book is devoted to her stay with Don Otavio, who treats her with the somewhat royal respect that she obviously thinks she deserves. Missing from this story is any reasoning as to why the depicted stereotypes of the greater Mexican population exist. There's virtually no discussion of the exploitation of the native Mexicans by colonial rule. The book is devoid of contemplations regarding the effects of the concentration of wealth in the hands of the appointed few. There is no consideration that the series of revolutions may have been ploys that were not in the best interests of the greater Mexican population.Yes, I am way off the mark in my expectations. After all, this is simple travelogue. But it’s important to note, especially in present times where those crossing the border are subject to similar impressions, that this book should not be considered a resource for an understanding of the Mexican people and their culture. The end result is a book that keeps the faith and viewpoint of a ‘superior’ Western European culture. If this book is still in print today, it is possibly because there are still those among us that like that feeling of superiority....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 17, 2019","Mar 31, 2019","Mar 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/71686.A_Visit_to_Don_Otavio

During Ludovico’s lifetime he One of the more popular periods during the Italian Renaissance is the reign of Ludovico Sforza over the duchy of Milan. During Ludovico’s lifetime he saw his father, Francesco Sforza, transform Milan into a regional power, lived through his older brother’s assassination, and served as regent to his dead brother’s underage son. For the twenty-five years following his brother’s assassination, while regent over his nephew, Ludovico succeeded in consolidating power over Milan and in doing so, he brought a period of stability to the region. It was during this time that he married a young bride, the fifteen-year-old Beatrice d’Este who in her own right became a force of charm over Ludovico and wielded as much power over Milan as a woman could have at that time. It was through Ludovico Sforza’s patronage of Leonardo Da Vinci that Leonardo became famous for his art and engineering. Ludovico sforza finally survived his nephew’s suspiciously early death to become the Duke of Milan in his own right.All of the above are facts of history, but Karen Essex, in Leonardo's Swans, achieves the difficult task of breathing life into this history. She takes the events and figures and weaves them together into a homogeneous story filled with human emotion. Yes, her words are supposition and at times speculation, but they serve to turn history into a painting of life where history alone provides only a sketch. While Leonardo's Swans may not be a means to learn history, it is certainly a way to feel the life of the history that you already know.However, in addition to giving life to history, Karen Essex also imparts observations on the artworks of Leonardo Da Vinci. In equal focus with the characters, Essex gives insights into the Leonardo’s portraits and the people that they depict. This artistic commentary gives depth to the story and provides an excuse to explore Leonardo’s portraits and his famous altarpiece entitled Madonna of the Rocks. And given that the interpretation of art is everybody’s domain, Leonardo's Swans is a bit of a history book, all on its own....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 04, 2019","Mar 16, 2019","Mar 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40127.Leonardo_s_Swans

By the time the story joins the Delilah, The USS Delilah is intended to represent one of the first-of-class American destroyers built mostly in 1899. By the time the story joins the Delilah, she is serving in the South Pacific just prior to WWI with a crew of about 70 men who live in close quarters. It’s worth noting that Delilah is not a typical naval sea story. Yes, the novel features a naval destroyer, the fictional USS Delilah, but there are no sea battles, submarine hunts, or daring attacks on enemy positions.Marcus Goodrich uses the USS Delilah as a means to examine the social divisions that exist in such an intimate and intense environment. The South Pacific setting isolates the destroyer from the larger American society, which give focus to the examination. In concept, the book is quite contemplative. Many issues of social division are explored including the Captain’s isolation associated with his command, the division that exists between the officers and enlisted men, and the divisions that exist between the various personalities that comprise the crew. On this last point, the book examines the process wherein the crew tends to subdue their own personalities down to the least common denominator in order to live and work in close proximity to one another. Also examined are the divides that separate an arrogant Western culture and the humble natives of the South Pacific. And religion does not escape scrutiny with the examination of the divide between those with a perceived religious mission and those with a more holistic view of life.In reality, the book failed to capture my imagination. Goodrich makes all his points but dwells on each one long after it ceases to be interesting. The result is a book that moves rather slow. Also lacking are the personalities of the characters. Goodrich tends to narrate over his characters rather than allowing them to communicate directly between themselves. As a consequence, the characters never develop into individuals, which makes it hard to distinguish one from another.Overall, Delilah was a great idea for a book. Goodrich intended to write a thoughtful book about a petri dish floating on the sea, but the end result was a sluggish read that took more than its fair share of time to complete....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 13, 2019","Mar 03, 2019","Feb 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/377750.Delilah

The elements of Klimt’s paintings and how they might have reflected his unique thought-process as an artist are avoided, and the boldest elements of Klimt’s life are softened and smoothed over. For instance, the fact that Klimt is known to have fathered numerous illegitimate children is avoided and in its place is a suggestion that Klimt was a type of new-age free spirit that could not be bound by the restrictions associated with love as defined by society.The overall experience is not unpleasant. Elizabeth Hickey writes an engaging novel. The name-dropped characters and references to Klimt’s paintings provide information to explore and admire outside of its pages.

The book favors entertainment over contemplation, which is contrary to what I look for in a sci-fi novel. The underlying theme of the book is the collapse of society. It vaguely alludes to some of the same issues that brought down the Roman Empire and transfers those issues into the distant future. By doing so, Asimov illuminates present-day society.During the course of societal failure, Foundation presents another parallel with the Roman collapse where the Catholic Church ended up being the repository of knowledge during the Dark Ages. Foundation asserts that the spiritual needs of humans can be co-opted to preserve some semblance of control during the ensuing anarchy and in doing so, preserve a framework upon which society can be reconstructed. But again, if you are hoping for fascinating details and insightful observations that bring these societal parallels into focus, be prepared for disappointment. The parallels in Foundation serve the action but not much more than that.The characters in Foundation tended to be heavily scripted. Asimov leads them from scene to scene and they all fulfill their purpose without undue emotion or conflict. While they are all a lot of fun, they certainly are not interesting or surprising.And finally we have the Foundation Series. Another four books follow Foundation and then there are two additional books that serve as prequels, for a total of seven books.

The words and sentences have a kind and inviting feeling to them that exudes sincerity. This allowed the plot to move emotionally from happy to sad while always keeping the tone serious and real. There was no over-exaggeration or manufactured excitement. Urrea is simply telling his story.On a personal note, I am Mexican by way of my mother’s family. And the Mexican part of me has always felt partially out of place. I was brought up as ‘American’ as my mother could manage. She is a US citizen but she could not speak English when she, as a child, started elementary school. She wanted her son to avoid the stigma that she felt. As such, my only real connection to my heritage is a passionate love for Mexican food as prepared by my mom and my grandmother.But Into the Beautiful North seemed to reach into me and strike at other, mostly hidden nuances in my Mexican self; things that were probably embedded in me while being around my Mexican aunts, uncles, and grandparents. Urrea's Mexicans all seem to possess an inherent kindness. They also possess a sort of built in stoicism, an implied humor based on thinly veiled sarcasm, and a fatalism that allows for the enjoyment of reality given that they’ve already anticipated the worse that can happen. While these things may not be exclusive to Mexicans, they certainly resonated in my heart and it felt like home.The story is a bit kooky but it is also deadly plausible. It provided a means of expression of current political climates. And through this expression, the personal elements of political concepts were brought to life. It truly is a masterful approach akin to Orwell or Huxley, but done in a much more subtle way.

Trump. In the specific, this comment was intended to degrade and insult, but in the abstract, it makes a point. After all, heroism is ethereal. For it to exist at least two people, and oftentimes more, need to acknowledge its presence. If it’s not an agreed upon belief, the hero ceases to exist.The brilliance of this book is that Maugham surrounds the idea of heroism with his characters. They find it and see it and thus leave it up to the reader to make it real, or to dissipate its presence. The magic happens when you start to see both sides of the story at which point the idea of heroism becomes both real and imaginary. Maugham makes his point.The Hero is obviously one of Maugham’s more obscure works. However, I found very relevant to today’s political climate. The book serves as a lighthouse of sorts. It casts a beacon over a century’s worth of time and shows us, the time travelers of civilization, the distance we have traveled. Themes such a war, patriotism, and education are contemplated by Maugham. One possible conclusion is that we haven’t traveled that far, but we cannot deny that have progressed nonetheless.

I have on occasion acquired a recorded performance or two from various sources. But I tend to like the short story format of the genre as opposed to the full-length novel. As such, I found How Not to Fall to be too much of a good thing.Form a critical point-of-view, How Not to Fall is an imbalanced book. It’s impossible to believe that Emily Foster’s intent was to write anything other than a story focused on the intricate details of sex. While there are occasional dry witty lines of humor, situational comedic scenes, and brief attempts at seriousness, these elements of the plot tend to serve as the fade-in-fade-out scenes between the sexual encounters. They never amount to anything that could compete with the extended chapters of sexual activity.Also in support of the predominantly sexual theme, the characters are virtually perfect people. They are both medical students, geniuses, and beautiful examples of the human form. She is confident in her sexuality, rational about rejection, and relatively free of self-doubt and insecurities. He is the perfect gentleman who deems friendship more important than sexual conquests.

Even then, those that are singularly remembered are typically those with sweeping powers and responsibility. Their individuality gets merged with the goals of a battle or the policies of a nation.But here resides the memoir of Robert Leckie; a private in the US Marine Corps during World War II. Leckie brings forth the perspective of a common soldier. He represents the life of the lowest class of fighter during a time when he and countless others were needed for a singular purpose: to fight the war with body and weapon.Leckie does a remarkable job in recording his experiences. The pace of the account deliberately follows the pace of the war. He starts with his enlistment and proceeds to tell his experiences with the First Marine Division up to the end of the war. There are invasions, R&R in Australia, smaller missions, and the final fanatic resistance of the Japanese Army during the final months of the war. My issues with the book stem mostly from Leckie’s style in telling of his experiences. He never quite conveys the feeling of a real cutting truth. It’s like listening to a grandfather telling war stories to his teenage grandchild or a veteran telling of his experiences to his non-military friends. The real truth is masked by a dull edge so that that grandchild or the friends can be saved from the savage, sometimes inexplicable, nature of war. But that’s what I want to hear so that it can at least be known for what it is.Along these same lines, the non-combat portions of Leckie’s account seem a bit boastful and larger than life. He is the heroic challenger of authority residing in incompetent officers and an uncaring military machine. One has to wonder why every person in the book is referred to by a nickname. Those without real names cannot dispel tall tales.In total, however, there is truth in Leckie’s account, which makes Helmet for my Pillow a resource for the generations to come. These children of the present and future will be completely detached from the veterans that fought in WWII.

As homo sapiens, beliefs have lodged themselves into the present form of the human psyche for the past 50Beliefs are inherent to the human condition. As homo sapiens, beliefs have lodged themselves into the present form of the human psyche for the past 50,000 years. The vast majority of these beliefs are formed by mixing a meager bit of evidence together with a heavy dose of emotion. They lack a necessary foundation, such as a moral conviction of right versus wrong or the scientific process, to form anything resembling a solid truth. As such, a society founded upon these beliefs cannot grow.Sinclair Lewis strikes at the heart of these beliefs with Elmer Gantry. His story serves to illustrate how arbitrary, expedient, and temporary they can be. Without a stable foundation they easily erode away or worse, mutate into some other belief in service of our own ever-changing desires. And Lewis' means of conveying his attack is through the intellectual path of rich but sublime irony.As for Elmer Gantry the character, Lewis creates a human in the homo sapien image. Gantry is the human instrument who is devoid of any real moral conviction and has no need for the scientific process. As such, Gantry is the conveyor of the feelings associated with forming and discarding beliefs on a whim. At one moment, he is likable and the next he is deplorable, all without missing a step. Elmer Gantry instilled himself in my consciousness and he allowed me to judge his hypocrisy and to feel the pain of his acts. And any book that can achieve that sort of emotional connection rises above the rest.The book focuses on religion in the early 1900s and emphasizes how entire religious institutions were built on these frail beliefs and how such institutions fell due to human capriciousness. By extension, Elmer Gantry’s theme applies to any institution at any point in time be it government, business, or religion. With this in mind, Sinclair’s book is indeed timeless, practically spanning 50,000 years.

She used the magic of words to make paintings come alive so that they could be loved by the reader as they were loved by her main character; just as art has been loved by me from time-to-time. And while the novel was technically a mystery novel, this tired format took a backseat to the power and beauty of art.Almost in direct contrast with The Art Forger, The Collector’s Apprentice flips the balance of art and mystery around. I was hoping for another journey through art, but most of this novel’s focus is on the mystery. Shapiro uses time and story to mask truths that are predestined to be revealed at the end of the book.

The love stories, however, are not giddy nor do they exist in timeless moments of passion. Rather, it’s the kind of love that strikes both the mind and the heart at the same time. It’s the type of love that is exciting but calm, brooding but real, and possessed of a deep understanding between two people. Given the volume or romance novels out there, a book about love that is more about exploration than it is about entertainment is somewhat unique.

During the course of my life, I managed to shrug off the preconditioning of my parents, progressed through political correctness (which is a good thing, by-the-way), became accepting when I realized that gay or bisexual people were a part of my life, and hopefully, I have developed an understanding as friendships and acquaintances have continued throughout my life.But still, that understanding comes with limitations. There are aspects of their lives that I will never know about, which is the beautiful part of Aciman’s book. It allowed me to glimpse that which I have always suspected, that love is love. The details of the people are irrelevant. People all have the same desire for intimacy and affection. We all have the same emotional attractions to beauty and the same hopes for recognition by those we adore. Aciman allowed my understanding to grow through his sincere and frank stories.

One book is a fictional account of WWII centered on a little-known aspect of the naval war fought just off our eastern shoreline by the Coast Guard. The other book is comprised of an informal interview between a granddaughter and her grandfather fifty years after the war. The grandfather is the main character in the first book. The structure of the overall novel is very good with a sort of fading back and forth between the past and the present that creates a pleasant sense of nostalgia.The first of the two books portrays the early part of the war when German U-boats were devastating Atlantic shipping and venturing attacks directly off the eastern coast of the US. The US did not have the military resources to counter this threat and had to improvised a response. This episode of WWII is just one small part of the overall conflict and is practically forgotten. And yet, it represents the spirit of a nation determined to survive and to eventually win the war. This first book is exceedingly good and is well worth the read.The content of the second book is equally engaging in that it provides the perspective of the old veteran looking back upon his life as a young man facing his wartime experiences, sometimes for the first time since they occured. In some ways, this second story reminded me of asking my own questions of my grandparents about their wartime experiences. The most succinct of their responses was indeed the old veteran’s common reply: I did what I had to do because the war demanded such actions; personal sacrifice was just a part of life.My only criticism concerned the old veteran’s occasional opinions regarding present-day American society. His pet peeves included gun control, political correctness, and America’s present inability to commit to a fight. It may be that these opinions were intended to make the old veteran appear old and crotchety, or it may be that Jule Miller was expounding some lightweight propaganda. In any event, I recommend that these opinions be ignored so that the rest of this remarkable novel can be allowed to convey the history and human experience that it intends to convey.

Within these pages is a story produced by a professional storyteller. The characters all have their turn at doing interesting things, they all have an inspirational line or two, and the story is entertaining.But that’s just about all that The Lonesome Gods is: an entertaining story. The characters are shallow and lack the distinctive attributes that make humans come to life through words. Even their names tend to be non-distinct. Finney, Fraser, Farley, and Fletcher were all on the same wagon while heading towards the west coast. Fraser was a teacher so at least he had that going for him. The rest of the “F” Troupe (sorry) were essentially interchangeable with one another, which didn’t matter very much at all to the plot of the story.The plot moves from scene to scene and while most scenes work, there are a few that fall flat and a few that progress into fantasy. It may be that L’Amour’s main reason for writing this book was to name-drop all the people and places that eventually resulted in forming modern-day Southern California. Towards the end of the book, however, the travels of the main character become impossible with respect to the places mentioned and the distances between them.And therein lies the disappointment. I was hoping for the pre-developed California environment to take its place among the characters. I was hoping that descriptions of heat, barren mountains, and seemingly lifeless brush would stir up my own feelings of fear that I felt during my childhood road-trips through these inhospitable places.

This is what Elaine Dundy achieves with her main character, Sally Jay. And the achievement is all the more remarkable, because Sally Jay is a young twenty-something adult. As we may all know from our own early adult lives, happiness is the gold ring that is constantly and often recklessly sought at every opportunity. This is the point in Sally Jay’s life where Dundy deposits her readers and this is what makes The Dud Avocado entertaining.On the opposite side of the praise, however, is the actual character of Sally Jay. I’ve been known to love characters that I should dislike, but this transformation usually involves some sort of growth or evolution in the character’s perceptions. With Sally Jay, she simply exists as she was originally created.Sally Jay is a twenty-something-year-old girl who finds herself in Paris on what amounts to be a perpetual vacation paid for by a rich uncle. If Sally Jay repeatedly finds herself in desperate or miserable situations, she only has herself to blame. She’s pushed away every potential mentor and yet she’s disappointed in her continuing pitfalls. By the end of the book she is more or less the same person she was at the beginning, and I have to wonder about the point of it all.Then there is the structure of the book.

Things do not just happen in real life and the art of writing should imitate life. The lack of continuity is a significant problem with Everything Matters! The constantly shifting perspective from which the story is assembled hinders the development of characters and dices up the flow of time. The resulting experience was like watching a play comprised of multiple acts and intermissions. With each chapter, the stage lights would come on and then fade out, and every act opened with a new set.The story itself, when you are able to approach it during some of the longer chapters, is another rendition of the end of the world. However, it’s also filled with pointless scenes and the end of the book was equally pointless with undertones of nonsense. These scenes did nothing to answer the philosophical question that this book pretends to ask: what matters? And while it may be cute to respond with Everything Matters! In fact, nothing matters when Ron Currie fails to make his readers care. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 02, 2019","Jun 08, 2019","Aug 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6184241-everything-matters

It raises the serious and thoughtful question as to whether or not society should be killing those it deems to be undesirable. After all, we enter into a covenant with society and agree to give up certain freedoms in exchange for certain protections, and the protection of life could be considered one of society’s fundamental duties. And yet, society regularly takes the life of some of those that break the laws within which we are entwined. There appears to be a dire inconsistency between what society promises and what society delivers.The Executioner's Song is a book that forces its readers, its societal members, to look directly at our responsibility. Mailer puts the gun to the heart of the condemned man and asks us to pull the trigger without all of the decades-long, feel-good motions associated with the due process of law. With appeals and judicial s, we are allowed to wallow in the law and, if not feel good, then at least feel nothing or think nothing of society’s underlying responsibility. In fact, fighting a death sentence over the course of many years may degrade the question down to a win-lose proposition where winning is actually an abandonment of society’s responsibility. And beyond the big esoteric issue, there is the condemned man, Gary Gilmore. If anyone could be a poster boy for unredemptive criminality, it’s Gilmore. Crime, including murder, is an urge. It sits in front of Gary Gilmore as an equally considered response to the stresses that life regularly imposes on all of us.And yet, he's still human in the quiet times that make up most of life. Gilmore is an artist by talent, he knows the soul-entwining feeling of love, he is aware that knowledge exists outside of his own perceptions, and he genuinely connects with those that he comes to know. The big esoteric issue becomes a human issue, and a personal issue. No human is purely evil just as no human is purely good. Therefore, the question of killing the good parts of a person must be considered even though it is often and conveniently ignored. Finally, in consideration of vengeance, the ability to perform a lynching by the revenge-filled family member was exceedingly easier than it is today. 100-200 years ago, society needed to provide and enforce an alternative to lynchings in order to preserve the rule-of-law. This simply cannot be an issue today. Custodial measures to prevent such acts have been developed and compounded to the point that busting out an accused killer is practically impossible. Thoughts of such an act would be met with thoughts of futility before thoughts of plausibility. Furthermore, the act of freeing a criminal with the intent to affect revenge has moved beyond the acceptance of society. And if one truly wants revenge, stepping outside the door one morning while thinking of the killer never stepping outside of a 6’ x 8’ cell in such a fashion for the remainder of his life is vengeance. When asked if there are fates worse than death, Gilmore replied, ""I think to make somebody go on living in a lessened state of existence, I think that could be worse than killing ’em.""Aside from the substantial issues this book brings to mind, the writing was somewhat overdone. Mailer must find it impossible to let any detail, no matter how inconsequential, to be left unwritten. As such, we get intimate details of the lives of every character, from those that drive the plot to those that may appear and disappear without affecting any key event whatsoever. And this type of exhaustive writing is applied to trivial events as well. The reason why this book is over a thousand pages long is not because the story required a thousand pages to tell, but rather because Mailer could not resist writing about everything. The effect is somewhat exhausting....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 25, 2019","Nov 17, 2019","Jul 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12468.The_Executioner_s_Song

A suspension bridge, for example, with its thin wire drapery in tension and its bold towers in compression will span any canyon with a quiet beauty.As another example, although conceived for grave purposes, the Avro Vulcan possessed an aesthetic elegance that exceeded its time. In the early 1950s, the Vulcan replaced the gangly WWII Lancaster-type bomber as Britain’s heavy-lift bomber in an emerging nuclear age. The aircraft embodied its specifications but it was also captivating in its appearance. Even today, the Vulcan still looks like it belongs to the future. It was this combination of function and aesthetics that drew me to this book.Vulcan 607 delivered on my desire to know more about this mesmerizing aircraft. The book chronicles the final days of the Vulcan’s active service. After thirty years of looking like a threat from the future, the Vulcans were being retired, but they did not pass quietly from service. On the twilight of their operational existence they received their first and only call to fulfill their intended purpose.In 1982, the military government of Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and the British government responded to protect their almost forgotten citizens. The Vulcan bomber was the only aircraft that could deliver the explosive power necessary to keep the island’s only airport from being used by the Argentinean Air Force.To bomb the runway, however, required a mission that was conceived with audacity. The mission demanded that the RAF pilots fly to edge of their endurance as well as to the limits of their aircraft’s capabilities. And yet this remarkable story is quickly being lost to history. Vulcan 607 brings the Vulcans, the conflict, and those involved back to life once again.As a final thought, this book itself is something of an engineered work of art. It's perfectly suited to convey this story into the future. The book as a whole understands that background, also known as context, is essential to creating an atmosphere that gives life to events.

We do not know about their lives or their passions. We cannot begin to know their problems or share their hopes for the future. They are simply people, walking among us in relative obscurity. Hardy writes through this obscurity to reveal the life of Jude Fawley.This effort of revealing a life of a character may seem commonplace. After all, it’s a common goal of writers to instill life to their characters. But in my experience, the achievement of this goal varies from book to book and from writer to writer. Hardy, however, comes closer to the ideal than many other writers have ever achieved and in my experience, only Stoner by John Williams comes closer to perfection.The Life of Jude Fawley is depicted with a sincere respect for the human condition. Hardy sacrifices the societal conventions of the time so that insights into the hearts and minds of his characters can be told. The result is a novel that echos just as much truth today as it did over a hundred years ago, and more importantly, the novel illuminates thoughts that will forever define relationships between people.Hardy’s style in telling this story is another aspect of this book that makes it exceptional. Overall, the life of Jude Fawley is not that remarkable. He’s an ordinary person that is confronted with nothing more than life itself. But the story reads like a symphony and sustains itself by repeatedly building and delivering on expectations. It captivates the reader with complex intricacies of words, and by changing tempos and moods.

There is very little that is historically interesting or unique that anchors this story with ancient Rome and its environs.Then there’s the historical fiction aspect of the novel. Granted, history of this period can be sketchy, but we do know the whereabouts of especially high-profile people at specific points in time. The Gates of Rome sacrifices these accepted facts.

Mystery novels usually create a feeling of being pulled through the plot, allowing me to look at only the things that promote the mystery, and finally leading me to a predestined conclusion. I much prefer novels where a world is created wherein human nature and chance drive the plot towards an ending that is as mysterious as life itself.Then there is Greene’s writing. Greene at his best can hold a human soul in his hand and put into words universal truths about humanity. This usually results in a dark feeling of human exposure that permeates the best of his stories. The Third Man, however, is lacking in such rich language. The novel tends to depend on a noir setting: day feels like night and the characters seem to walk around with a pebble in their shoes, feeling an unspoken pain with every step. Fans of noir will probably enjoy Greene’s setting, but fans of Greene will be left wishing for more.The best aspect of The Third Man exists in the mechanics of the tale. Greene tells the story in a first-person voice that relates a third-person perspective. This element of the book makes The Third Man a sort of experiment in the art of writing and results in a book that is worthy of contemplation in spite of its shortcomings.

Ward-Perkins’ approach strikes at the heart of our society. For better or worse, we are in the midst of modernity in the very same way that Romans felt that they were living at the pinnacle of their world two thousand years ago. History is repeating itself and Ward-Perkins aptly reminds us of this reality. The book is a no-nonsense history of the fall of Rome and its aftermath spanning from third century to the eighth century AD. Bryan Ward-Perkins is the quintessential professor and gives this history as if teaching a freshman history class. To this effect, he uses photos, illustrations and graphics to emphasize the main points of this period of history. He also strikes at the heart of historical trends by focusing on the economic forces at play in the Roman Empire before, during, and after its demise. In true schollary fashion, evidence is presented and sources are documented. The overall effect is a thoroughly believable text that supports confidence in its stated conclusions.Underlying his assertive presentation of history is Ward-Perkins’ arguments against modern trends by some western historians who claim that the empire experienced more of a gradual, mutually beneficial transformation into Germanic rule rather than a violent fall to barbarian invasions. Thus, this book is a rebuttal to those trying to soften the fall of Roman society for what Ward-Perkins describes as mostly present-day political reasons. In my opinion, Ward-Perkins succeeds in disproving this softer interpretation. And in my personal experience, visiting the city of Venice is proof that at least one segment of Roman society was forced to move their civilization to the middle of an ocean lagoon in order to insulate themselves from the barbarian invaders....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 28, 2018","Jun 03, 2018","May 28, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/68540.The_Fall_of_Rome_and_the_End_of_Civilization

They push them through unbelievable behaviors as if guided by Divine wisdom only to be proven right by the end of the book. Elmore Leonard is the complete opposite of this type of writer. Leonard’s books are usually akin to watching people move through life and reacting to events as they happen. Leonard treats idealistic things like loyalty or duty as negotiable depending on the conditions of the moment. In other words, Leonard writes about people guided not by God, but by Life.To this end, The Switch is a typical Elmore Leonard novel. The reader takes a seat in the bleachers located behind the one-way-viewing pages and watches Mickey Dawson live her life through ordinary and extraordinary circumstances. Along the way, Ordell and Louis discover that being tough and being human can be mutually exclusive, unless your mind is demented like their ""friend"" Richard. All of the events happen as the situations of the story change. It's purely entertaining and the story also serves as an insight into human nature.I don’t think that Elmore Leonard could write a story that I did not enjoy. As such, rating Leonard novels involves deciding the better among the best. In being critical of The Switch, I would say that the characters were more truer-to-form than is typical for Leonard. Often times, Leonard will put these off-the wall dichotomies in front of his creations and make the plot turn upon their mood or a momentary feeling.

The book focuses on the many social and political issues that existed and evolved in Rome throughout most of its existence. The problem with this social-based approach is that each issue spans multiple years/decades and references multiple people/events. When one social issue is wrapped up the next issue is brought forward and the timeline and people are reset back to the new issue's origins. The effect of this approach is a choppy forwards/backwards progression through Roman history. Had I been previously exposed to the fundamentals of Roman history, Beard’s approach would have been easier to appreciate. For instance, my experience with John William's Augusts, and a subsequent biography on the same ruler, provided a foundation that allowed Beard’s overarching observations to be more comfortably received as they passed through this this brief period. Nonetheless, given that R.S.P.Q. possesses a unique perspective of Roman history, it is certainly not without its place in historical writing. For a Roman history enthusiast, I can see where this book would offer another level of perspective that would exist above the simple facts of history. The fundamentals, combined with Beard’s observations would serve to place historical events into a more human-based context of understanding. Lastly, I would caution potential readers that R.S.P.Q. does not span the complete history of Rome. For as thorough as Beard is in covering Rome's speculative beginnings, she was surprisingly silent on the fall of the Empire. It left the ending of the book with awkward questions as to why Beard could not complete what she had started, and it left me in search of another book to see if a proper ending could be found elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Apr 28, 2018","May 22, 2018","Apr 01, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28789711-spqr

Science fiction can explore any number of possibilities but each possibility should be traceable back to the present human condition. Within these constraints, science fiction can illuminate our possible futures. Red Mars is this kind of book.Within Red Mars, Kim Stanley Robinson opens a vista onto humanity’s first colonization of our neighboring planet. And while it might be nice to think that humans would have their act together before venturing out on such a noble endeavor, Robinson reminds us that humans are who we are. We are filled with greed, fear, and hate as our baseline condition. It’s only within our power, not our nature, to achieve more. To be at our best, we must try.Robinson’s characters interact with each other according to their needs whether they are emotional or calculating. The result is a human-based story filled with characters that are individually created and remembered. The setting is pure Mars complete with names and places, purple skies, and red soil. The means of living are linked to our present capabilities with feasible extrapolations. Robinson creates a Mars that is plausible and believable as a place that humans can one day call home.As the story progresses, Mars transitions from a planet baren of life to one overfilled with humanity. A transition in feelings occurs from a beginning that is reminiscent of the melodies of Dvorak’s New World Symphony to an ending that brings to mind Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle. And throughout this transition a two-way reflection is established that contemplates our hear-and-now life on earth alongside our future life on Mars.While the book is a bit wordy and nerdy at times, the it's still remarkable. For a genre that is often times filled with aliens, blasters, and ships that travel at impossible speeds it’s no wonder that the word “fantasy” is often tied to the science fiction gene.

This was not the case in the early 1900s and consequently, Howards End is filled with descriptive writing that spans extended paragraphs if not entire pages.The story, however, is progressive for its time.  It sits well with the transition that was happening; where women were asserting their rights and desires to be respected along side the other half of the human race. Other progressive issues are also covered including considerations of class inequality.  And yet another issue that’s addressed is the conflict that exists between world views that focus on humanity’s worst attributes such as greed and views that see the potential to obtain a universal respect for life in accordance with our most noble attributes.Howards End  moves through its paces alternating between its traditional writing and it's progressive themes.  It’s an overall enjoyable and thought-provoking read, even if it is somewhat tedious at times....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 12, 2018","Mar 20, 2018","Mar 12, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3102.Howards_End

The first story is one of the astronaut program as it was transformed after Apollo A fair characterization of this book is that it tells two stories. The first story is one of the astronaut program as it was transformed after Apollo and operated during the initial years of the space shuttle program. The second is the personal story of the book’s author, Mike Mullane, and his complete lack of consideration for the mere mortal humans that come into contact with His Grace, the One True Astronaut. The first story, as does the second, spans the entire book. Mullane gives a recount of his career from his selection as a shuttle astronaut, progresses through his training, and continues on through three flights on the space shuttle. The story is insightful and indeed contains the very information and insights I was hoping for in any book about the space program.Mullane knows his stuff. When he’s focused on his job he cannot be impeached. He had me completely captivated. There were minor details and major facts that had never been revealed to me previously about the shuttle program. His reports of the Challenger and Columbia disasters were complete and insightful. The first story about the shuttle program is well worth the read provided you can keep your lunch down during the various ascensions of Mike Mullane’s personal life-views, i.e. the second story. Within the periodic appearances of the second story, Mullane has a superiority complex of the worst kind. Women that come into his world are initially judged as incompetent and incapable. They are assigned a mental rating with imaginary numeric cards ranging from 1 to 10 based solely on their looks. If a woman is a 9 or 10 (and is tolerant of lecherous behavior), Mullane might actually become enlightened by her abilities as time goes by, but only because he wants to be around her. His physical attraction towards women provides the time required to form an opinion about their competency.Along these same lines, the astronauts who are academic scientists are also made to suffer his holier-than-thou perceptions of them. What right do scientists have to fly into space when military fighter jocks like Mullane are virtually ordained to do so? While in Mullane’s presence, the astronaut-scientists have no purpose other than to make Mullane feel good about himself by suffering the brunt of Mullane’s stupid juvenile jokes. However, with the passage of time and forced exposure, Mullane sees fit elevate some of the astronaut-scientists to a level of measured respect.And that’s why didn’t like Mullane. In his eyes, everybody who is not like Mullane is someone who is less than himself, not different, but less. Redemption to achieve some value of consideration by Mullane is just that: an elevation by Mullane to a level that resides somewhere below his own god-like self perception. Heaven forbid that a woman or a scientist should present themselves as equals to Mullane based upon the merits of being selected as an astronaut. What Mullane forgets is that his credibility for this book stems from those very same qualifications.I gave this book a punitive two stars where three could actually be due. Mullane is not the right voice for a topic of such universal and human importance as space exploration. There must be other books by other astronauts that can provide the same information provided in Riding Rockets but do not foster the caustic feelings of alienation that are fanned by Astronaut Richard Michael Mullane....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Mar 2018,"Mar 11, 2018","Mar 01, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/311504.Riding_Rockets

I was three years old and they proceeded to place me next toOne of my earliest memories as a child is of being awoken after my bedtime by my parents. I was three years old and they proceeded to place me next to the television set. They then took my picture with their state-of-the-art Polaroid camera next to the fuzzy picture of the Apollo 11 astronauts bouncing around on the Moon for the first time in human history. From then on, my early childhood was permeated with rocket launches and moon landings. It was something that we simply did until we stopped doing it.As time progressed, and I’ve become older, I’ve come to realize how important the moon landings actually were. They depicted the tangible results of science and they commanded respect by just about everyone, even those that had no knowledge of the scientific process. At present, the respect for science has diminished, so much so that those who do not understand the process feel empowered to dismiss it on a mere wim of their own desires. It’s hard to dismiss the sight of astronauts walking on the moon, but dismissing the science of climate change has become routine.As with any book of extensive details, the level of your enjoyment will be proportional to your fanaticism for the subject. My childhood experiences and my observations of science in society as an adult have lead me to this level of enthusiasm for the golden age of space exploration. Plus walking on the Moon is badass-cool. I am a fan.As a collections of essays from the various participants in the space program, Apollo Expeditions to the Moon had the potential to become a maze of information. The individual writers could have produced similar stories of their favorite moments which would have repeatedly overlapped with each other. However, to the credit of the editor, Edgar Cortright has assembled a series of focused essays on specific events by the people that knew their topics well. In this way, the collection of essays comes together as a collective history of the Apollo Program and the details of the work are such that true fans of Apollo space flight will relish the minutia.If you happen to be venturing into this subject for the first time, I recommend that you start elsewhere, with broader accounts of the Apollo Program and manned space flight in general. Possibly warm up with The Right Stuff by Wolfe (movie or book); move into binge-watching the TV mini-series From the Earth to the Moon, throw in a viewing of Apollo 13, and then read a book like Moon Shot by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton. If you are still interested in the subject of manned space flight after that, be rest assured you will be fanatically ready for the contents of Apollo Expeditions to the Moon.P.S.: If you want to read an internet-based version of this book, including the pictures, it can be found here:https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/toc.html...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 18, 2018","Feb 28, 2018","Feb 18, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24566269-apollo-expeditions-to-the-moon

You notice them, they seem friendly, and you walk up and ask, “How did it all happen? What was it like?” This book is the story they would tell.Moon Shot is a book taken from the minds of two people who’s youth culminated in similar achievements. They were both aviation test pilots at the dawn of the Jet Age, when the frontier of space represented the boundary of the envelope. It is from this background that the story is told. It’s conveyed with the pride of fighter-jocks who have experienced the humility of seeing Earth for what it is: a fragile piece of dust floating through the deadly nothingness of space.If the writing is somewhat rudimentary or unworthy of literary praise, then these shortcomings reflect the bravery that was required to tell their story in their own way. To “clean up” their tale would result in losing the truth of their perspective. To present their tale as something that was more or less than it actually was would have been contrary to their lives, which were dedicated to working with reality as it actually happened. Finding fault in the writing is akin to wishing that life was other than how these two explorers actually perceived it.As a book about that seemingly magical era that constitutes the race for the moon, Moon Shot certainly has a place on the enthusiast’s bookshelf. It could stand alone as a general history of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. All the major flights are covered and the particular problems that stressed those involved are explained without jargon and in terms intended to convey the experience. But most of all, this book represent two humans who had an outstanding vantage point while living through that era.

While reading Apollo it felt like Murray and Cox realized that they tried to accomplish too much and then tried to save what they had already done. The result is an informative book, that also leaves many questions unanswered and topics undiscussed. For instance, the Gemini flights that played an integral part in the development of the Apollo program are hardly mentioned. Another example, is the seemingly abrupt closing of the book after covering Apollo 13 as if nothing of interest happened in the time spanning the five Apollo flights that followed. The book’s organization also hinders a smooth presentation of its contents. It frequently flips between biographies of the main characters and the chronology of the program such that both timeline and characters become obscured.

The words Moore uses worked their way into my mind as imagery, feelings, and understanding.

It is filled with hardship, insecurity, and tragedy. In fact, it’s a fairy tale in retrograde in just about every way. Beyond the writing, the story focuses on beliefs. Not the beliefs born out of theory, experimentation, and evidence, but the beliefs that are instilled in us by authority. These beliefs typically serve as shortcuts to happiness, comfort, and moral behavior. Moore establishes these beliefs in his characters and then lets them crack revealing the relative emptiness that lies beneath these authoritative constructs.

However, I think she makes more out of Trump as a person than he really is. She tends to build him up into a mastermind of a movement that has finally reached its objective with the winning of the White House. I think everyone who has watched Trump in action knows that at best that he’s reactionary in almost all things. However, Klein’s book requires a scheming villain worthy of her call to action.Beyond Trump, the book delves into the characteristics of the corporate-based White House administration and the strategies that the corporate world has used in the past to profit from societal shocks such as economic crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and wars. Klein also notes that some of these shocks could have been avoided, but the profit motive pushed them into full fruition, e.g. the Iraq War. These shocks serve to suspend elements of democracy in favor of authoritarian policies, the privatization of the public sector, and increased profits for corporations.My problem with her explanations of the various shock strategies is that they are also presented as being virtually devoid of any public benefit. Her opinions on corporate involvement in the private sector are so one-sided they reveal a bias that undercuts her positions. While I realize that the point of the book is to present conviction, I find that conviction is better served in light of a true and complete version of reality.Then there are Klein’s political beliefs, which are presented in big overarching ideas of a pure public sector operated solely for the public good and allowing corporations to exists and profit for the benefit of the public. While I personally agree in principle with those ideas, those types of big ideas are exactly where we are right now with Trump. Klein’s Ideas are presented without any plan on how they will be achieved and without any details of the steps that will have to be taken in full recognition of the opposition.Klein’s plan is essentially to conquer and rule. The reason why our current president’s approval ratings have constantly diminished since his inauguration is that he has no idea on how to keep his overarching promises after he conquered the electorate (or, uhm, the Electoral College). But even if Trump knew the path to achieving his ideas, the compromises needed would still appear to be a loss to his supporters. In fact, this aspect of the book gives rise to the consideration that a Bernie Sanders presidency would have looked very much like that of Trump’s when is comes to fulfilling promises.This book may present the opposition’s side to the extreme set of circumstances that constitute the Trump presidency. But is this what it takes? rants without due consideration of the positive; direction without any reality of success; a complete abandonment of moderation? If so, then we have indeed drifted away from an Age of Reason....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 08, 2017","Dec 17, 2017","Dec 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35105799-no-is-not-enough

His writing seems to speak privately to the reader’s mind where nothing is sacred and anything can happen. He plays with perceptions. He takes advantage of the human tendency to believe in one’s own righteousness while simultaneously suppressing truths to the contrary. He quietly forces the reader to acknowledge that there is never a ""hero"" in a Leonard book that is completely worthy of that distinction.To this end, Last Stand at Saber River is Leonard at his typical best. Good and bad characters abound, but good is divided from bad based on the breadth of the character’s ability to see reality for what it is. As such, the good characters may perform evil acts, but they also recognize those acts for what they are. And the bad characters are those that simply placate their desires even if their desires produce positive results. This may sound confusing, but it’s not. In fact, the end result is life as it has always been.The setting brings life to an old west that consisted of remote ranches located along remote riverbanks that supported life. This aspect of the book gives Last Stand a quiet and peaceful undertone that is contrary to other books of the genre that are filled with wooden plank towns, their bars with swinging doors, and rowdy brawls that spill out into the muddy streets. Picture instead cobbled streams of cool water fringed with willows and upper highlands of pinyon pines. Leonard paints a landscape and then places his story in the foreground.The only detraction was one of the minor characters, the daughter of rancher that was transplanted from the eastern US. She added color to the plot, but she did not truly fit into the overall content of the book.

At times, passages appeared to be dedicated to the use of words themselves rather than contributing to the content of the book. Things that could have been described once, were described repeatedly with an overabundance of adjectives and similes. It was not unusual to find an entire page occupied by a single, descriptive paragraph. The story was also difficult to find. Other books written in the mid 1800s, such as Moby Dick, Jane Eyre (even though by Bronte too) and A Pair of Blue Eyes, all use the same formalized form of the English language as Villette but they also manage to tell a clear and meaningful story. They all had an arch that spanned from a beginning to an end, and upon upon completion the reader could say that a journey had been undertaken.The journey in Villette just isn’t there. The main character, Lucy Snowe, never seems to evolve or change throughout the book and the purpose of the entire book may be something akin to today’s late-night television talk shows. Lucy is the never-changing host that brings on guests for brief interactions that may span a chapter or two only to be forgotten when the next segment is reached; and Lucy Snowe is nowhere near as entertaining as Johnny Carson.And yet, there is something that can be said for Lucy Snowe. As guest after guest passes through her life, I found that she and I have many things in common. Lucy is quiet, reserved, and cautious. She knows the value of thinking before speaking, and her desire for the truth is what keeps her going. I completely relate to these characteristics and maybe the true meaning of Villette is that people such as Lucy and me should not host late-night television talk shows....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 04, 2017","Nov 21, 2017","Nov 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31173.Villette

History, at least accurate history, is be based on facts while fiction is fiction. Thus, in writing a historical fiction novel, the writer needs to exert a conscious effort to respect history while at the same weaving in untruths. The effort, when done just right, can bring history alive. When done wrong, Hitler can be made to dance in celebration of the arrival of spring. The major historical events that surround and include Octavius Caesar are fairly well defined. We know the year in which the faithful events on Ides of March propelled Octavius Caesar into power; we know the dates and players associated with the ensuing Roman Civil War; and we know the events that led up to the deaths Mark Antony and Cleopatra.But what isn’t well known is the human side of Augustus. We cannot begin to be certain about his expressions of joy, anger, laughter, and pride. He lived in a time, when the recordation of anything was limited to capturing only those things of importance. Therefore, bringing his history to life is a risky proposition. There is a good chance that some of his human characteristics will be wrongly depicted, thus sliding the pendulum of historical fiction further away from the truth.What makes Augustus a creditable work of historical fiction is that Williams finds an effective way to address both the abundance of eventful history and the lack of knowledge of the human that was Octavius Caesar. The format of the book weaves together fictional letters, journal entries, decrees, military orders, and private notes that emphasize the main events of history. But this technique also serves to humanize the main characters, while maintaining a respectable distance from their humanity. After all, who among us can say that we have been truly been captured in the writings of others, or in our own writings about ourselves? Within a conventional narrative, certain acts and feelings may be demanded by the circumstances, but William’s epistolary format gave him the means to maintain a historical distance, which serves reality well....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Oct 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89231.Augustus

Survivor chronicles the Russell's travels and missions through its years of wartime service mostly through the eyes of it's medical officer, Dr. Barry Friedman. My grandfather served on a similar destroyer during WWII, the USS Abner Read. Therefor, reading about the progression of the Russell's missions, which paralleled those of my grandfather's ship up until it was sunk in October 1945, was of great personal interest.The shortcomings of this book are related to the perspective offered by the writer. Friedman does a good job with chronicling dates and events, and generally strives to place the specific activities of the Russell within the context of the larger historical picture. However, as the ship's doctor, Friedman primarily focuses on his medical-based experiences. Consequently, a lot of the wartime experiences of the ship's officers and crew are not included. This approach tends to make Survivor more autobiographical with respect to Friedman than it is historical with respect to the Russell. Friedman's experiences, however, are not to be discounted. His presence on the ship placed him in the line of fire of every attack that was carried out on the Russell. As such, the fear, bravery, and coping that were experience by Friedman can be extrapolated to the rest of the crew. Additionally, Friedman rides the boatswain's chair to other ships to provide medical services, and participates in rescue operations during island invasions. Overall and regardless of perspective, the content of books like this make up the silvery threads of history. In total, when woven together and highlighted to show their best and most important parts, they serve to prove that the larger story of history, as told from the public stage, is correct.

Various forms of censorship and lawsuits worked to keep this work suppressed for a number of years after it’s initial publication. Given this troubled past, it seemed important to consider the elements of the book that lead to this suppressive effort. Were the salacious aspects of the book necessary for the plot, or were they simply inserted into the book to achieve notoriety and publicity?In my opinion, Lady Chatterley’s Lover reaches for an aspect of life that would be unattainable in words without its provocative passages and language: the act of intimacy. Intimacy affects us in ways that often work to suspend our perceptions everyday life and also affects our normal behaviors. Right and wrong become blurred and life seems to happen only in our presence. Intimacy is an escape for those that are intimate. D. H. Lawrence strives to give his readers this aspect of life in words, and to have avoided the controversy would have been the same thing as failing to tell his story. Lawrence further illuminates his main theme by contrasts of various shades. He not only allows for those in love to see the world, but he also allows for those without love to provide contrasting views. Those that are deprived of intimacy, those that suppress it, and those that degrade it all serve to show that the world without this magical feeling would indeed be a cold world where life would be of little value.But for all of this book’s focus on intimacy in its various degrees, it failed to capture me emotionally. Lawrence is rather matter-of-fact in his narrative and his dialogue, even between lovers, tends to be restrained.

In general, I like stories that aim towards the latter, which is why Aurora lives as a remarkable book in my mind.Within Aurora, Robinson throws humanity out into space. Its destination is a star that is relatively close, but still requires several generations of spacefarers living on board an ark-type ship to reach it. The brave volunteers that start out on the voyage are not the people that reach the destination. This scenario allows for a representative sample of humanity to be considered in isolation, free from the more common social pressures that are present throughout our fractured Terran society. Absent are such malignancies as patriotism, bigotry, and ignorance. Within the ship, humanity has been unified in its goal for almost two centuries. Robinson uses this extracted sampling of humans to show that we cannot escape ourselves. When their common goal finally does comes into question, reason is still pitted against fear and decisions are still based on certain amounts of both. This is the type of realism that I search for in science fiction.If there is a disappointing element to Aurora it would be that Robinson tends to dwell on topics especially those of a scientific nature. I get the sense that he is a huge science enthusiast and throughout the book he does not hesitate to explain many scientific processes and theories. While these explanations serve to anchor the plot to reality, their frequency and length distract from the progression of the story. They simply feel out of balance with the overall work.But still, there is a lot here for the contemplative mind to contemplate. An idea is put forth that explains the Fermi paradox; why life among the stars remains silent.

And while this island is built on beliefs, Sagan defines the ingredients of his building materials that best approximate reality and thus, reflect actual truth. It's a good place to be while surrounded by daemons of any kind and/or of copious numbers.In building this island, Sagan makes a couple of points that serve to nourish the survival of its inhabitants. First, Sagan indicates that the effort of disproof is worthwhile; that it represents a process that has done more to advance the human race than any other process. While the task at hand in today’s environment may be arduous, the effort of evaluation and disproof takes us all in the right direction. Perhaps one day we may find that this effort remains as the only 'good fight' that ever was.And equally so, Sagan indicates that those who issue such messages, and those who accept them unconditionally or excusingly, are working against humanity. They would have us reverse course to earlier times and advocate that our simple trust in the messenger or the message is all that is needed for prosperity (regardless of the amount of suffering that is inflicted along the way). Sagan provides an argument that this type of behavior is unethical and immoral.

Evidence, of course, is a part, but other elements of more nuanced (but still valid) beliefs are covered. For those that value the truth and pride themselves in holding valid beliefs, you will find this essay to be a confirmation of a fundamental part of life.The foundation of Clifford’s essay is that beliefs shape society and guide our collective future. Valid beliefs are essential to advancing society in a positive way. Invalid beliefs lead to societal chaos where no foundation in truth exists and thus, no certain path out of chaos can be found.

Moreover, there are countless numbers within our society who believe these falsehoods even though they readily fail to meet the most basic of evidentiary tests.These acts of unscrupulous persuasion and unscrupulous belief wreak havoc on society as well as on those individuals that consider a society based on truth to be of paramount importance. America is a nation that was created during the ""Age of Reason"" and it was founded upon a collection of constitutional principles that depended entirely upon decisions and actions based on valid beliefs. Those that unethically act upon these principles assault the fundamental constructs of America and are therefore anti-American in a most fundamental way.---""The Will to Believe""The book continues with a second essay entitled ""The Will to Believe"" by William James, which is offered as a rebuttal to Clifford’s ""The Ethics of Belief."" This second essay attempts to say that beliefs are a natural part of being human and that we all hold beliefs that are never tested in a manner required by Clifford. James also claims that there are some beliefs that cannot be obtained through reasoning and that the truth can never be absolutely known. Therefore, we are correct to act upon our unfounded beliefs because doing so is simply human.With these assertions made, James proceeds to misrepresent Clifford as a sort of rigid logic fanatic. Indicating that no real spiritual human can operate in accordance with Clifford’s ridgid requirements. James asserts that Clifford requires us to hold and act upon only those beliefs that are absolutely proven to be true. This assertion is a classic straw man argument and it’s also an appeal to extremes.In fact, the points that James uses to refute Clifford are actually acknowledged by Clifford. Clifford gives pardon to beliefs that we hold but never test provided that we do not act upon such beliefs: ”No belief is real unless it guide our actions.” As an example, I may believe that airplanes can fly, but I wouldn’t attempt to build (or fly) an airplane without proving to myself that my belief is true.Clifford also indicates that acts based on beliefs that are not fully proven may be ethically undertaken based on reasoned probabilities provided that evidence towards the truth continues to be evaluated after the action is taken: ”There are many cases in which it is our duty to act upon probabilities, although the evidence is not such as to justify present belief; because it is precisely by such action, and by observation of its fruits, that evidence is got which may justify future belief.” In other words, be open to to changing your mind should the evidence resulting from a present act require such a change in the future.By the end of the essay, James is convincing against the positions that he portrays Clifford to hold. In doing so, James’ rebuttal argument becomes an argument in favor of Clifford. Had James put forth the effort to evaluate Clifford’s true positions on beliefs, James may have found that acting on his own beliefs of Clifford’s positions was a somewhat unethical thing to do....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 13, 2018","Apr 19, 2018","Jun 24, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35556564-the-ethics-of-belief

This is my second time through this collection of Maugham short stories, and in reading my  of the first, I think I was originally a bit harsh. Coincidently, I’ve started reading a book by Carl Sagan wherein he covers my original concerns about racism rather elegantly…Society corrupts the best of us. It is a little unfair, I think, to criticize a person for not sharing the enlightenment of a later epoch, but it is also profoundly saddening that such prejudices were so extremely pervasive. The question raises nagging uncertainties about which of the conventional truths of our own age will be considered unforgivable bigotry by the next.Another change since my last time through this collection is that I recently read a biography of Maugham’s life. This experience added depth to these stories. In my previous  I wrote about the various aspects of love that these stories explore. After reding Maugham’s biography, I could see the personal experiences in his life that informed his writing.Overall, it’s a nice collection of Maugham’s writing. These stories were inspired by his 1916 journey to the South Seas and they are filled with the beautiful imagery of the region. Tropical seas, fiery sunsets, and torrential rains are all brought to life. ""Rain"" is masterful example of literary writing, and the closing vignette, ""Envoi,"" practically waves goodbye to the reader at the collection’s end. ---[First Reading]...The colonial era in the South Pacific was filled with self-righteous imperialists whose own good opinions of themselves were only overshadowed by their racist opinions of the native inhabitants. Maugham, captures this aspect of life and places it up front in every story. I understand that attitudes were different during Maugham’s life, and that Maugham, given his dedication to capturing life as it is, could not write stories that were otherwise. Nonetheless, this aspect of the book makes each story somewhat acidic.The stories themselves range from average to very good. Maugham exhibits his ability to capture life, and, in particular, the imperfections of love. In actuality, these stories are more about love than they are about the south seas. In much the same way that Maugham captured the emotions of love in his book Of Human Bondage, he captures various aspects of this complicated emotion in these tales. Maugham also captures the beautiful setting of the tropical islands. The setting is not overplayed and he uses the setting as a reminder that many times the breathtaking beauty of the tropics is more permanent and lasting then any moment in time experienced by the humans residing among them....more",Notes are private!,3,26,2,"Feb 28, 2024Jun 06, 2017","Mar 09, 2024Jun 06, 2017","Jun 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99661.Rain_and_Other_South_Sea_Stories

Therefore, bringing gay issues to the eyes of Americans in 1956 was bold, but it also required a certain amount of delicacy that somewhat hides the truth of reality. These mitigating factors included the depiction of only a superficial look at gay men even though Baldwin was openly bisexual, advocated for gay rights, and new the culture well. Second, the story was set in Paris. If gay culture was exposed in a faraway place that was only seen by Americans in their imaginations, then they could treat the work as fiction in every sense of the word. But unfortunately and in spite of its boldness at the time of its publication, Giovanni’s Room is losing its purpose. Even though the writing is outstanding, filled with sharp dialogue and personal introspections, the mitigating factors now seem shallow in today’s understanding and exposure to gay society. Gay men are not only those things that were depicted by Baldwin. They are much more. Mostly, they are everyday people living their lives as everyone else, contrary to Baldwin’s depictions. They have close friends and families, and American society has gown such that most of it despises its rejections of the past. There is still room for growth, but today is proof that we are headed down the proper path towards our future.I think that if Giovanni’s Room were written today, it would embrace the present and the future. The story would probably end the same, but the journey would be far more intricate and far more complicated as love often is.As it is, Giovanni’s Room somewhat detracts from our progress.

I was expecting to like this book, but only in a generalized story-telling sort of way. But my experience with Mischief in Italy was contrary to my expectations. The story was imaginative in its execution and while some parts tended to slide back towards my anticipated notions of a romantic comedy, the writing always seemed to save itself with small eccentricities that fit naturally into the story. The characters were well developed and the method used to convey their thoughts and emotions was genuinely original. The characters took turns telling their portions of the story in a rotating first-person perspective. The setting, centered around a warm summer at Lake Garda in northern Italy, was also effectively conveyed without being overplayed.While Mischief in Italy may not have reflected the real world as cruel and unforgiving as it often is, the book offered a break from this type of writing and presented a refreshing and original read in terms of its own genre....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 19, 2017","Apr 26, 2017","Apr 19, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20731349-mischief-in-italy

The word actually means that historical facts and context have been omitted. But history in its varying degrees of detail represents a series of tools meant to be applied to a series of jobs. For scholarship, the word brief will not suffice, but for a casual traveler like me, brief is exactly on point.A Brief History of Venice focuses on the city from an observers point of view. The reader is taken through the significant events that shaped the city throughout its 1,500 years. From this perspective, brevity does not result in a lack of thoroughness. Horodowich knows the history of Venice and presents it in a well organized and thoughtful manner.As for the omissions that brevity demands, I would characterize them as being of two types. First, the personal perspectives of the inhabitants during the various historical periods are missing. The lives of the common, wealthy, and noble Venetians remain mostly in the imagination of the reader. Second, the details of the significant events are missing. For instance, there were numerous battles that took place over the course of Venetian history but the details of these events, the suffering, strategies, and near-failures, are mostly left out of the discussion.But again, if travel is the reason for reading this book, there is an archaeological perspective that I particularly enjoyed. Horodowich frequently closes her chapters by identifying elements of the present-day city that give testimony to the historical events she describes. Be they an obscure bas-relief of a winged lion that that has been carved into the header of a doorway and then seemingly removed by a chisel; or more common items visible throughout the city, Horodowich makes sure that a future walk through the city of Venice will be a historical experience....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 22, 2017","Apr 09, 2017","Mar 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7244936-a-brief-history-of-venice

Images of Commander Adama, on the bridge of the Battelstar Galactica (BSG), surrounded by other characters of remarkably equal similarities, were ever constant. In fact, it was so difficult to dismiss the setting of the reimagined television series that I finally gave up and ran with the imagery and characters of the BSG world. It also brought up the possibility that Webb wrote a full length fan-fiction novel and then edited all the minor details in order to avoid paying licensing fees to the franchise owners.In comparing Constitution to the reimagined BSG series, however, the novel falls short of the content of the series. The book is one constant battle for survival and is written within the confines of military culture. Characters follow orders, put their personal feelings aside, and attack the enemy until reaching their last dying breath. The television series, on the other hand, took time between the battle scenes in order to explore the characters. The series made the characters human and allowed for real human fears and frustrations to guide their actions, even while living in a militaristic world. Constitution may have touched on this, but the next battle scene always cut humanity short.The writing of military demeanor was a strong point. Webb captures the ability of those in command to garner respect. He also conveys the sense of duty felt by those following orders and he humorously provides the sarcasm that shows up from time to time as a momentary release of frustration. Webb also knows how to put battle scenes in space into words.

Dates, places, and facts are interesting, but they also lack in the emotional/human content that probably drove the creation of history as it is.Within the Sforzas' rule of Milan, a brief period in the 1490’s marks the height of that City’s prosperity. A competent ruler, Lodovico (El Moro) Sforza, had usurped power from the rightful, but incompetent heir to Milan, namely his young nephew Gian Sforza. Leonardo da Vinci was on retainer to Lodovico, practicing art and engineering throughout the realm. As for intrigue, the wives of Lodovico and Gian were competing for the spoils of the dukedom while Lodovico had ever-growing concerns of a restoration of his nephew to his proper position. The city-state was in relative peace with its neighbors who, near the end of this period of prosperity, looked towards the riches of Milan as a suitable prize for the taking.The Bride of Sforza capitalizes on this period of Milan’s history and tells the tale of Lodovico’s wife, Beatrice Sforza. The story gives life to those that moved in and out of hers. Miranda Seymour fills in the human personalities associated with the historical figures and uses these human attributes to move each character towards their inevitable fates. She does a good job of both respecting the framework of history and creating reasonable depictions of these people’s lives.The shortcomings of the book reside in its stiff delivery. The story is told in the first person by an onlooker with close ties to Beatrice but somewhat outside of Beatrice’s inner circle.

Mercenary armies and frequent wars were the norm and they were all predicated on the desires of rulers, kings, and the Pope. And yet, there were still traces of human kindness expressed by rulers towards their subjects and Leonardo da Vinci appears in Milan bringing with him artistic and engineering talents.I was hoping that A History of Milan Under the Sforza would serve as a foundation upon which other histories and other historical fictions could rest.

Under these conditions, the two main characters are left to themselves to explore their lives, evaluate their regrets, and make changes during the time they perceive to be remaining to them. The result is a heightened sense of intimacy between the reader and these characters. I felt the loneliness of their lives and could feel the emotions they felt throughout the novel.The premise also offers an occasion for reflection on our need for companionship. The two main characters share a sort of common past that is never recognized between them. They have lived similar lives. However, their outcomes are different. It may be that the final difference between them resides in their ability to know that we as humans are all created with a need for companionship and that without this realization, life cannot be enjoyed to its fullest....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Feb 02, 2017",not set,"Feb 02, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/27405160-good-morning-midnight

It is structured to give a certain impression of the life of some of the men that served in a heavy bombardment group during the war, and all other aspects of life that contradict this impression are ignored or minimalized. As a result, the book has a monotonous feel to it.Every chapter includes multiple accounts of aircrew members’ combat experiences while on missions. The book is so filled with these war stories that it's easy to lose track of any given person even though they would occasionally reappear later in the book at a future point in time. Additionally, the accounts are all very similar in nature. They typically take the form of some plane, man, or enemy fighter being shot resulting in someone dying, being injured, captured, or lucking out. The effect is a virtual blender of combat situations. The other issue with the book stems from the fact that life as a bomber crew member was often filled with other activities beyond those that brought death and destruction. Missing from Stout’s account is any meaningful sense of the downtime that had to be endured between missions or the hours of uneventful flight time that had to be endured while heading into danger. While these other stories would have been devoid of shrapnel and machine gun fire, they would have served to provide a more complete picture of the experience; a truer story.Furthermore, the ground crews that kept the bombers flying are also missing in a significant way. They were equally important to the success and failures of the 303rd Bombardment Group, but their lives are only briefly mentioned. If they are the unsung heroes of the unit, then their contributions still remain unsung.I can see this book as being of interest to flight crew members and their relatives. It chronicles their suffering in combat and enshrines their sacrifices. However, the true story of 303rd Bombardment Group is so much more than the one recorded in this book and so many other aspects of the Group’s history have been left unsaid....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 28, 2016","Jan 08, 2017","Dec 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22522038-hell-s-angels

For this book, the writer, Arlie Hochschild, focuses on the environment and the state of Louisiana, where people have experienced and endured wide-spread environmental damage caused by the petrochemical industry. The other attribute of Louisiana that works well for this premise is that a large portion of its people profess support for the conservative opinions encapsulated by the Tea Party, which differ from the writer’s own liberal point of view.As the book progresses, Hochschild interviews and reports on people that have been adversely affected by environmental damage. She relays tales of people who worked for the petrochemical industry and who have suffered through the environmental damage that it has caused. The air has become malodorous, the bayous are polluted, homes have been rendered worthless, wildlife has died off, and cancer rates have soared.Hochschild then finds that these same people make political decisions that ignore their own stated frustrations with the environment much to the detriment of their own health and safety concerns. As she investigates further, she finds the reasons for this paradox and works to give structure and context to these reasons. She uses her 54 years of experience as an investigator of social issues to define their story and then confirms with these same people that her understanding represents their feelings and beliefs.I was sensitive to the fact that a liberal social scientist from Berkley was the person writing about the beliefs of people that see politics from an opposite perspective. However, Hochschild remained empathetic during her interviews and was non-confrontational. She encouraged people to feel positive and proud of their beliefs. When feelings were expressed that were not consistent with facts she let those feelings stand on their own and saved fact-checking for an appendix in the back of the book. In short, she searched for the true beliefs of the people she interviewed. I am admittedly a progressive person with liberal political beliefs, and I wanted to be challenged by this book. I wanted to say, “yes, I can see the thought process behind the Tea Party movement, and I understand why Tea Party members see themselves as ‘strangers in their own land.’” The end result is something close to this desire. I now have a more structured understanding of Tea Party beliefs. Hochschild walked through a political minefield in a practiced professional manner and reported objectively on what she observed. Had I attempted to do the same, the effort would have destroyed my ability to achieve this same level of understanding.Lastly, others may believe that Hochschild cheated the Tea Party out of a realistic foundation. As such, I am open to suggestions for books that would serve to correct that perception....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 05, 2016","Dec 12, 2016","Dec 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28695425-strangers-in-their-own-land

There always appears to be something forced about the tragedies and the characters seem to be easily trapped by emotions spawned by narrow perceptions of life. I find these manipulations to be distracting form the reality that these writers strive to create.The element of Blue Eyes that is refreshing is that the plot feels organic to the hearts and minds of its characters. Hardy tell the story with a light hand and as a result the characters' actions feel rooted to themselves and true to the moment. This approach may have the effect of minimizing plot twists and avoiding surprising revelations, but it also has the effect of creating a world that is inherently human. Every element of this story is constantly changing and the characters change and adapt as the story progresses.This human approach may have been a necessity for Hardy to tell his story, which is all about love. It’s practically a symphony of love in that every nuance of the emotion is exemplified by its characters. The main characters exemplify how love can be passionate, irrational, fearful, and hateful. The supporting characters act out love in its other forms such as it exists between family members and close friends. Love as a path to happiness, sadness, regret, and deceitfulness is explored. And love’s ability to cross social boundaries is yet another theme.In approaching the final chapters, Hardy takes a few liberties with his characters to set them on their final paths, but then lets them fall towards the ending. The final chapters are enthralling and capture the inadequacy of rational thought to defining the emotion. In terms of its trueness to the emotion, this is arguably the best love story that I have read; and Hardy succeeds with this book where others of the genre have failed....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 22, 2016","Nov 06, 2016","Oct 22, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/898288.A_Pair_of_Blue_Eyes

The novel extrapolates possible long-term outcomes of overpopulation, dwindling resources, and artificial intelligence. And if you’ve seen the movie of the same name, it becomes apparent that these key visions were carefully transplanted into a concise, though-provoking screenplay. Beyond these key visions, however, the story becomes a sprawling romp through the world without much meaning beyond communicating the extent of the chase. The stops along the way are described in terms of the 1960's era during which the book was written.

Writ Williams takes WWII naval warfare beyond the typical scenes of artillery salvos, depth charges, and torpedo attacks. Rather, The Enemy is a book about its characters and their life in the Navy on board a small ship in the Atlantic.What Williams captures so well is that quality of Navy life (and for that matter the military experience) known as the wait. The wait is a period of time that has to be suffered by individuals before a pre-disclosed fate can actually be experienced. If you or your unit has been assigned a task in the Navy, you will have to experience the wait before the task can transpire. And while the wait itself is not that exciting, the effect that it has on individuals is interesting. It brings out the true nature of people while at the same time forces people to repress their fear of the future. It forces people to cope as best they can.Williams takes his characters through the wait. His characters range in experience from the newest sailors to oldest of salts. He also explores a range of personalities and how different people behave under the prolonged stress of not being able to do what they have sent to accomplish. And the ship, old and outdated, experiences its own form of waiting as it steams towards a new war 20 years after being launched too late for the First World War.The Enemy accomplishes what it promises to do in that the characters truly act out life aboard a Navy destroyer during WWII.

And while the specifics may have shifted from its late 1940s setting, the message still holds true today. Racism, whether deliberate or implicit, still exists. It has profound negative effects on entire segments of American society and it creates a hopeless generational cycle. The story uses the 1940s as a time variable. Readers knows that life in that era has long since past which invites consideration of the changes that have occurred since then. While African Americans have transitioned from the sugarcane fields of the south to the neighborhoods of the inner city, the hopelessness of birth, poverty, denied opportunity, and death still exists. In addition to this timeless theme, the book also provides a constant: a young black man in jail. He is just as trapped as any person in the cane fields or the inner-city and his fate is just as set.The engine that has propelled this cycle through time is discrimination.

The oceans are in trouble; the creatures that live in the oceans are not faring well; and the humans that depend upon the oceans are only a step behind.As for the dolphins, they are amazing creatures. The information that is imparted improved my understanding of their behavior in the wild and most of the book focused on dolphins located off the cost of Southern California. The book includes aspects of their social interactions and behaviors. It also provides measured arguments that suggest that dolphins feel emotions. And it discusses their potential for intelligence with examples of how dolphins teach and pass down skills from one generation to the next.On occasion, I have taken a tour boat out of Dana Point Harbor that focuses on bringing people closer to dolphins. My next tour of this type will certainly be more informed because of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 02, 2016","Aug 10, 2016","Aug 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13212126-dolphin-confidential

His writing style felt like it was adjusted to match the dryness of the Arizona desert as well as the solitude of its main character, John Russell. Both, the character and his setting seemed to be intertwined through the pages, serving each other throughout the story. The story is thought provoking. Leonard gambles with the lives of all his characters and in doing so, repeatedly pits the value of one life against another. He makes it easy to fall into this gambit and once inside it’s impossible to climb back out. He makes the end a relief but the end also provokes the biggest question of the book: John Russell.With John Russell, Leonard once again creates a distinct human persona. The intrigue with Russell is associated with his actions, which were the final outcome of a host of personal feelings. Various portions of selfishness, kindness, disgust, and pity shaped his every move creating a complexity that mirrors real life. This complexity is maintained until the very end, when one of the supporting characters, the narrator of the story, thinks he has John Russell figured out, but even now, I still have my doubts....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 05, 2016","Jul 08, 2016","Jul 05, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/835203.Hombre

It may have sOf the many constructs that have been invented by mankind to keep society whole, I see the invention of law as being the most important. It may have started with ancient chiefs and kings dictating their personal, passionate, and biased desires for justice. From there, councils took form, which somewhat normalized its application. And finally, the law became what it is today: words on paper that intend rule society with reason. As with every evolutionary process, there were diversions along the way, but in comparing where we are to where we once were, we have achieved a path of improvement.Anatomy of a Murder is a novel that lives within the construct of law. The book makes no mystery of the killing that takes place. The killer is known and confesses in the opening pages. From there, the plot takes its reader through a passionate search for truth while guided by the law. Evidence is sought and amassed and the story unfolds. Anatomy of a Murder then becomes a book about that evolved ritual of the law known as the trial. The trial phase puts the reader in the courtroom, practically as one of the jurors. Whiteness are questioned and both sides are strategic and convincing in their arguments. The process is guided by a judge, who's sole responsibility is to place the law above any human passion present in the courtroom. At the end of arguments, the case is sent to the jury with all possible outcomes in their charge as well as floating in the mind of the reader. The ordeal is a human process, but one that is governed by the rule of law.I decided to read Anatomy of a Murder because it was recommended as being the book I just described. Additionally, it was not a part of a series. In fact, Robert Traver seems to have written more books on fishing than he has about law. The result is a book that stands alone.

Love is such a powerful emotion that it is easy for such novels slip into the realm of melodrama. This takes place when humans are depicted in ways that step beyond reality. It doesn't take much. The call for a duel between rivals, the admission of love one too many times, or self-pity that goes on and on are all gateways to the melodramatic. Turgenev manages to write about love in On the Eve without such missteps. To be fair, this is a Victorian novel and behaviors are typical of that era. But still, Trugenev manages to stay clear of overly-dramatic love scenes.Turgenev maintains a sense of reality by not overwriting any given scene. He provides what is needed to understand the emotions of the characters and then allows the reader to use their own inherent sympathies to complete their connection to the feelings being conveyed. Turgenev also uses the various settings in the book to further communicate emotions without explicit narration. The abundance of life in nature, the hard coldness of Moscow, and the surreal calm that is Venice, these settings all work to set moods in advance of scenes. From there, the plot moves forward with the reader's feelings already engaged.Believable characters are the end result. While the story focuses on human passion, it's characters do not lose sight of their own self-awareness.

We were not talking about our time spent in the service, but rather, the possibility of my nephews joining the military after they completed high school. My friend was completely opposed to the idea while I thought it would be a valuable experience.For my friend, his experiences as a deployed Army Ranger justifiably precluded the placing of people at the literal disposal of our government and subjecting them to the horrors of combat. While I, who experienced a completely different form of military service, professed the deeper bond with society that results from giving yourself over to its needs. I still think about this conversation and still find each of our arguments compelling given my knowledge of our different experiences.Starship Troopers takes my position to the next level. The book articulates my ideas of civic virtue and personal sacrifice for the good of society. But it also presents a plan for society where full citizenship can only be achieved through voluntary military service. Those that do not volunteer are afforded every benefit of society with the exception of being able to participate in its governance either by voting or holding office. In this way, those in power are those that fully realize the weight their responsibilities.But it is possible that Heinlein is actually presenting the exact opposite argument, the argument presented by my friend, but doing it in a creative way. The creativity resides in the reader's ability to discover on their own that war is not as Heinlein presents it. Starship Troopers ignores the massive tragedy that is war. Friends who are killed simply ""buy the farm,"" they are quickly forgotten and then replaced. He uses the genre of science-fiction to eliminate any human attachment to the enemy. They are bugs; things that humans routinely squish without anguish. And soldiers carry out their orders regardless of the stress that surrounds them.The message within this book may be obvious for those that hear what they want to hear. But the message is completely different for those who know that clear answers should always be scrutinized. This uncertainty placed Starship Troopers in constant state of conflicting ideas and moved the book closer to reality in spite of its actual words. In short, it's a brilliant book for people who love to search for answers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 31, 2016","Jun 09, 2016","May 31, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers

Parker dWhile reading Panama Fever by Matthew Parker, Philippe Bunau-Varilla stood out as one of the key people that made the Panama Canal a reality. Parker described Bunau-Varilla as a man that did not write in sentences, but in proclamations. He was the chief engineer of the French canal effort at age 26; he made a fortune by switching from engineer to contractor before the French effort collapsed; and for many reasons stemming from a combination of greed and inspiration he pushed Panama to revolution. And if that was not enough, he secured diplomatic authority from the new Panamanian government and single-handedly negotiated the treaty (the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) that gave virtual sovereignty of the Canal Zone to America, much to the disgust of the new Panamanian government.With Bunau-Varilla being such a dynamic character I Took Panama presented the possibility of being a dynamic book. However, it fell short. Rather than achieving a brilliant mix of fiction and history, I Took Panama reads like a historical outline that has been filled in with fiction simply to connect the historical bullet-points. The book was still informative and its factual content enhanced the profile of Bunau-Varilla, but the potential to build on such an imposing and real persona was missed.All is not lost, however, if one wants to possibly explore this man of proclamations. The notes of this book indicate that at least two books were written by Bunau-Varilla that cover this dynamic period of his life. The first book, Panama, the Creation, the Destruction, and Resurrection was published in 1913 and the second book, From Panama to Verdun was published in 1940, around the time of Bunau-Varilla death....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 15, 2016","Apr 17, 2016","Apr 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16252475-i-took-panama

TThe U.S. Canal Zone was an idyllic Eisenhower-era enclave where the cultural aspects of life remained in a state of suspended animation for decades. There was no unemployment or homelessness. Everybody worked in support of the conveyance of shipping and everybody was provided for by the fees generated by this activity.For the kids of the Canal Zone workers, their communities were literally as clean and wholesome as anything that could be pulled from the television sets used for Leave it to Beaver or Ozzie and Harriet. There were no real strangers, and the usual threats associated with urban living: traffic, crime, and industrial dangers were virtually non-existent. With parents fully employed and not very concerned about the safety of their neighborhoods, these kids lived a life of adventure outside of their homes.This is where My Paradise Lost takes place. The book consists of a series of stories from the childhood of the author, Brian Allen, and conveys the setting of the Canal Zone in meaningful ways. Each story is a slice of life and lets us know that progress was somehow suspended in Uncle Sam’s sugar bowl , as Allen characterizes it.The issues with the book center on the fact that the stories are a bit flat. After all, life is idyllic in the Zone. It just goes to show that life in paradise can appear to be somewhat dull to those that have to slug it out in the constantly changing world that exists on the outside.I also felt that Allan could not fully commit to his own stories. The most significant event of his life is creatively told in one of his better stories, but it came up short in allowing me to feel its impacts on him and his future.

As suThe science fiction genre, at its best, creates a bridge between present and future; one constructed of the cumulative possibilities of science. As such, a good science fiction story has two sides to consider even if the story is entirely focused on the future. The Stars My Destination brings this aspect of science fiction to light.The year that Alfred Bester published his work, society had a calm orderly appearance. I love Lucy was a TV favorite and Ricky Nelson stole young girl’s hearts on Ozzie and Harriet. Business was conducted daily by the likes of Mad Men. In short, society was white and orderly. But underneath the surface, society was roiling. Those that contributed to society, but not to its apparent norms, were relegated to lesser roles or openly oppressed. This is the society that Alfred Bester extrapolates 500-year into the future.The story serves as a tribute to things that would become a reality just a few short years after its publication. The story serves as a vision of the turmoil that 1957 society was stirring. It was an alarm that the Ozzie and Harriet set were destined to ignore, setting themselves up for a rude awakening. To be convincing, Bester taped into the subculture that gave a voice to the oppressed. He used their slang and captured their vivid expressions of art. As a result, the book has a ‘60s vibe to it, and in a way, we are fortunate that this book exists. It serves as a clue to the chaos that was to come just in case it should ever be denied. After all, history can be rewritten but works of fiction never change.The writing, however, is not that strong. The story starts out brilliantly with the slow development of the main character, Gully Foyle, but it quickly slips into writing that would be more at home in a comic book. Scenes suddenly appear without reason or transition, and subplots are left to die without closure when they’ve served their purpose. I’d call it choppy writing and it’s probably not surprising given Bester’s extensive work in the comic book genre. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 03, 2018","Dec 08, 2018","Mar 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11806617-the-stars-my-destination

While some may have been boisterous enough to have the canal attributed to them by name it still could not have happened without the motivation of thousands of workers, engineers, patriots, and rebels of the Panamanian variety. Thousands of people lost their lives in working to bring this ""thing"" into existence, thousands more lost their livelihood through failed beliefs and investments, and yet thousands more moved some small amount of earth to contribute to its completion. This book tells their stories and transforms a project of monumental proportion into an achievement of monumental human effort....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Mar 05, 2016","Apr 03, 2016","Mar 05, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/3017948-panama-fever

The HuntIt's always satisfying to read stories that not only entertain, but also serve to highlight themes or subjects that reach out into real life. The Hunters satisfies.At face value, Salter tells the story of jet fighter pilot who volunteers for a tour of duty during the Korean War. The ground story takes place at an Air Force base in South Korea where interceptor missions are flown routinely into the North to destroy North Korean fighter jets.The story tells of a unique time in our history with fighter jets, when combat was done at close range with machine guns while traveling at hundreds of miles per hour; when locating and targeting the enemy was a visual process. Over-the-horizon radar and Sidewinder Missiles were still inventions of the future. The Americans flew the F-86 Sabre and the North Koreans flew Russian MIG-15s. Both aircraft were little more than WWII fighters adapted to withstand the forces of jet powered flight. Both aircraft were fairly evenly matched in their capabilities. This part of the story, the war story, is both entertaining and insightful with respect to the history that Salter brings to life.Then there is the greater meaning that gradually takes shape as the story progresses. The Hunters is about success. It's about being the best of your peers. And if you think that success can be achieved through planning, training, or desire, then Salter writes this story to say otherwise. Salter makes the point that success is often a product of chance; it's a roll of the dice. And for this reason, those that achieve success are not always the people best suited to it. Success also finds its way to those that want no part of it, and it is often denied to those that desire it most. Whether it's in everyday life or in a surreal theater of war, success cannot be controlled, anticipated, or willed to happen. Success, for the most part, is simply the proceeds (or the liability) of luck....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 30, 2016","Feb 05, 2016","Jan 30, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/174621.The_Hunters

There was no other way to cross oceans and a voyage could take weeks to arrive at a final destination. And because of this need, the types of people that congregated in close quarters on board a ship at sea was diverse. Ship of Fools captures the mood and diversity of passengers at sea during this bygone era.The book's strength resides in the various mind-sets of its eclectic group of passengers. While they come from different backgrounds, different professions, and different places, they all posses that common human trait that becomes readily apparent when diversity is forced upon individuals for prolonged periods of time: pride, in all of its sad manifestations.There is no escaping the foolishness that pride brings to every passenger. Each passenger cannot avoid seeing themselves in the true light of their own beliefs and their actions are consequently foolish to all but the actor (and those of similar minds). Themes of patriotism and xenophobia are explored alongside more typical human faults such as jealousy, envy, and greed. And while Katherine Porter spares her readers from being judged, the personal guilt of the reader is only a thought away from each foolish act. As the book progresses, however, this strength-of-theme also becomes its primary weakness. The effect of capturing the somewhat monotonous mood of weeks upon the ocean served to create a similar outlook for the book itself.

It places Martin Eden, as well as other books by London, in parallel with London's life and his search for love. As a child, London was mostly a distraction to his eccentric parents and step-parents. In coming of age, this lack of love drove him to idealize love only to be let down by its realities. Then in response, London chose to abandon love to the point where it became a scientific endeavor. And finally, he found a love that was his perfect complement. This entire journey is reflected in Martin Eden, which was written after he found his safe harbor.Martin Eden is required reading prior to spending time with Bain's thesis.

These places are usually free of the complexities and dichotomies that are inherent in human nature.Safety for these books is often found in the -isms: patriotism, heroism, stoicism. From these lofty perspectives, decisions pay tribute to self-justifying ideals and leave inherent questions by the wayside.Stories of our recent wars originate from these places. Directives including ""stay the course"" and ""support our troops"" frame reasons for our involvement in these wars while also stifling legitimate questions. The success of these directives server to explain the success of books about war that live within the -isms. The Tinfish Run is remarkable because it avoids the -isms. It tells the stories of human characters that are thrown together on a small obsolete destroyer under conditions forced upon them due to reasons that are made of human fabric. The ship leaks, characters die needless deaths, and the actions of the characters are a mix of selfish concerns that are compromised against the greater good. It's this selfish aspect of this story that allows it achieve a heightened sense of reality, and reality is a commendable quality when contemplating war.As for weak points, the book is written as a first-in-series. As such, some of the characters are forcefully introduced and over-created. It's as if their potent presence in this book will serve as a reminder of their personalities in future books where they may not be so prominently featured. The ending as well conjures up a sequel.

They rightfully argue that laborers of the time were reduced to a mere organic power source that could be cast aside once its power was depleted. They also recommend that workers engage in a societal revolution in order to put an end to their oppression and exploitation by business owners, manufacturers, and capitalists.One problem with The Communist Manifesto is that it draws too many academic generalizations regarding human behavior. While the middle class may have reduced labor to a commodity, Marx and Engels reduce labor to an army of automatons that have no human component to their composition. They write about the results of their revolution as if labor will be united to such an extent that the actions of one will be the actions of all. In short, they dehumanize the workers of the revolution to the same extent that the capitalists have dehumanized these same workers in their factories.As an example, there is a saying that a man’s home is his castle. This sentence is scaleable. It expands and contracts to encompass whatever possessions someone has, no matter how plentiful or few. The approach to life that is embodied in this saying has contributed greatly to our survival as a species. We keep what we find to be of value, fight to keep it in our possession, and build upon it for the betterment of ourselves (and for the side-benefit of future generations). Humans are selfish for a reason.Marx and Engels ignore this selfish aspect of humanity. They write as if workers have nothing for which they would be willing to fight for and thus, have nothing to lose in the instigation of the revolution. The problem with this perspective is that workers, no matter how oppressed, will continue to guard their possessions and will continue to hope for more possessions in their future. They indeed have something to lose and would be unwilling to give that something up in order to facilitate a workers’ revolution; or give that something up as a result of a worker's revolution.Thus, Marx and Engels' pass over and dismiss what has proven to be the solution over the past 150 years. Progress has been found by humanizing the problem. Capitalists and laborers have repeatedly come together as people to discuss their goals and grievances. Furthermore, governments formed by these people moderate and enforce the outcome of these discussions. While we may still have issues at hand in this country, I can see the progress that has been made along the way; all of which was made in the absence of a so-called workers' revolution....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 27, 2015","Oct 30, 2015","Oct 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30474.The_Communist_Manifesto

Time and characters jump around from chapter to chapter to such an extent that the book becomes a bit confusing. I found myself wondering where I was in time, at times. However, the book still works and the plot is still convincing.The characters that comprise Bleeding London are equally eclectic. They are interesting in many different way. Each character has their own quirky mannerisms and obsessions, but most of all, they are all vulnerable to a reality that is half-manufactured by their minds. But so are we all in one way or another, and from this perspective I found that I could understand their view on life as they saw it. Again, this sounds confusing, bit it still works.Finally, there is London. This book brings London out of the background and makes the city a part of the story. The city exists in maps and it exists in places. At times, the people of the City simmer and vibrate to illuminate certain places that are unique within London and that uniqueness shines through. While I've read many works of historical fiction, this book is something else: it's a genuine work of geographical fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 03, 2015","Oct 17, 2015","Sep 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/381113.Bleeding_London

Under such circumstances, those that do harm to others may not be aware of the harm they are causing. Their ability to reason their position relative to society’s moral lines has been altered to some degree, possibly by some small and forgotten act that happened at some unknown time in their past. But the change occurred, the mind was altered, and their reasoning thereafter is unknowingly affected.It is this perspective that gives Notes on a Scandal its strength. The characters are wonderfully good natured but are deeply flawed. They move through life with ease. They have successful careers, they raise families, and they are generally well-liked by those that hold them at a social distance. But within their inner circles, the lives of these characters are irreparably broken while still believing that all is well. They constantly hurt those that are closest to them and they do not understand the reasons for the anger that is returned. Notes on a Scandal puts this human complexity into words.As a point of weakness, an argument could be made that the book does not dive deep enough into the psyche of its characters. Heller provides a narrative that keeps her readers at a distance. While we are free to observe their acts and to and contemplate the sources of their problems, we never know for sure why her characters are the way they are; which brings us back to way things are in life....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 06, 2015","Sep 12, 2015","Sep 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13258.What_Was_She_Thinking_Notes_on_a_Scandal_

The book provides accounts of people struggling to find their individuality in the midst of countless others who are struggling in the same way. Sometimes luck crosses their paths, but often times they achieve small successes through the diminishing of others.Trying to discern particular characteristics of Londoners that are different or unique, however, is problematic. The effort requires a comparison of Londoners with my own subjective perceptions of only my own surroundings. How can a clear picture be gained while looking through a clouded window? Nonetheless, there is this: Londoners know tolerance. Londoners have been the center of a multi-cultural empire for so long that they have grown accustomed to living alongside other races and cultures. And while all of these different people all have their prejudices of one another, the one thing that prolonged exposure and tolerance seems to have engrained in them is the understanding that those of different cultures are humans first.The result of this human-first distinction allows for human dignity to color thoughts and deeds before the objectification of others takes place. While prejudices still exist, the associated acts or thoughts resulting from those prejudices are tempered by the realization that those being affected are human. And while this may seem like a small difference, it is a rather large difference when compared to the thoughts and deeds resulting from the prejudices that surround me in my part of the world, which is far removed from London....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 23, 2015","Sep 06, 2015","Aug 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12088899-londoners

Beyond Kensington Palace to the west and Greenwich to the east, the rest of London resembles the satellite sprawl of any big city. And that is how this book reads.For virtually every Tube line, Mason begins his walk in some remote, end-of-the-line suburb, describes the sprawl as he approaches the heart of London, and then continues past the city into the suburbs again towards the opposite end-of-the-line. This book reads more like a commentary on satellite neighborhoods than it does on the modern and ancient city known as London. While there is the occasional fact or location of interest, most of the time I struggled to keep my eyes opened. The other issue with Walk the Lines is the tone of the writing. While Mason describes his enthusiasm for his project, he does a poor job in communicating that enthusiasm to his readers. The writing is monologue and monotone, and presents a constant feeling of cynicism regarding most of his observations. The best writing in this book occurs when Mason conveys the conversations he has had with others that are invited along for his walks. It's disappointing to find out that appearances by his guests are so infrequent.Walk the Lines is a book that proves that one person's adventure is not necessarily everyone's adventure.

The characters are just human enough to act out the plot, but lack the humanity necessary to react to it. Action is the key to this book and if a few people die to make that action happen then that's just a happenstance of a war story.The human truth about war is far deeper than anything portrayed in Where Eagles Never Flew. The book is lacking in the complexities of grief that the death of a fellow soldier (or pilot) can bring about. The book also downplays the fear and doubt associated with heroic actions. While the outcome of a fight may be seen as heroic, the basic desire to survive creates far more heroes than actions deliberately taken for the good of God and country.Where Eagles Never Flew also falls short on a national level. The nations at war are stereotypically portrayed. The Germans are arrogant to the point of incompetence; the British are stoic to the point of heroism; and the Americans are so self absorbed that they the see the Blitz as a sort of reality television show. But nations are not homogeneous solids that consistently act in lock-step with how they are perceived, especially within a historic context. Their unilateral actions are often times the result of choices made between the lesser of evils. To view or tell of a nation's actions without regard to the complexities that shaped those actions is disingenuous to reality.One aspect of the book that shines, however, is the method that Schrader uses to depict the aerial dogfighting that dominates the story. She is concise to the action and keeps the repeated theme of bombing raids and fighter interceptions fresh throughout the book. No two dogfights read the same way and her descriptions of aerial maneuvers are simple enough to achieve realistic visualizations of aircraft in combat. Given that there are scores of dogfights throughout the book, I thought that this accomplishment was remarkable.Overall, Where Eagles Never Flew is more about entertainment than it is history. It’s written for those that want to read about battle scenes in the air and for those that take for granted British patriotic themes. For those that are looking for a better understanding of the nature of the Battle of Britain, I recommend that you look elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Aug 2015,"Aug 18, 2015","Aug 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16300784-where-eagles-never-flew

As a person who is half-Mexican, I somewhat know what it is to ""pass."" My upbringing was structured to affect this social illusion.My mother, who speaks fluent Spanish, refused to teach me Spanish as a child. She did not speak English when she started school here in the US and she wanted save her children that distinction. Beyond Spanish, my DNA provided me a light enough complexion that I was seldom, if ever, identified as Mexican. People were always surprised when I volunteered this fact during discussions about Mexicans. I also believe that my initial success in life, as I was trying to get my foot in the door after college, owes some part to my ""passing"" as a white, non-accented, English speaking American male. Another element of ""passing"" that this book explores is the emotional and physical ties that exists and lead back to one's own heritage. For instance, when I'm traveling in Mexico, I am readily recognized as Mexican and people will often speak to me in Spanish first, before I must somewhat embarrassingly admit that I only speak English. And yet, at those moments I have a brief longing to be accepted and on the other side of the conversation I usually sense an understanding.Because Passing explores these elements in terms of blacks in America, there is heightened illustrative aspect to the book that goes far beyond my experiences. Blacks found themselves here, not by their choosing, and were placed at the bottom of a social structure that intended to keep them in their place. We may have made strides to erode this social structure through the years, but when Passing was written it was still the norm. Thus, the experiences of the characters in Passing are more desperate and intense. Lives can be destroyed instantly should certain secretes be revealed. And a certain amount of happiness depends upon turning away from reality. Passing offers readers a chance to explore this type of life without ever having to experience it, or conversely lets some of us know that we are not alone....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Dec 22, 2016","Dec 27, 2016","Jun 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/994065.Passing

The honest answer probably involves a blinding temptation and a mental perception that I'll get away with the crime, be it based in greed or passion. I like to think that such 'opportunities' are a rarity in life. After all, there is no greater threat to temptation and perceptions than that of rational thought.

Sordid affairs have resulted in popular books for as long as humans have had books to read. Rather, the thing that makes Damage remarkable is its honesty. Within her story, Josephine Hart provides no mitigating circumstances, there are no promises of a happy ending, and there are no suggestions of forgiveness. She drags her readers through the experience and makes no apologies along the way. Her writing is a search for truth in a situation that is without reason and she finds it in every instance. At the end, all I was left with was that initial question, more heavily experienced in my mind: where do I fall off the edge?...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 23, 2015","Jun 28, 2015","Jun 23, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/109961.Damage

Everything about this book comes across as serious commentary that can be tossed around in the reader’s head for possible relevance in the present world, as well as contemplations of Fredrik Pohl’s world 40-plus years ago.The tone of the book is reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft (Mountains of Madness) or Stanislaw Lem (Solaris). It’s narrated in the first person by the main character, Robinette Broadhead. As such, everything that comes off the page is filtered through his pragmatic views. There is very little heroism and an abundance of humanism.Gateway is filled with relevant themes that have survived and even intensified over the forty years since its publication. At the top of the list is a picture of space exploration that has been handed over to the private sector. At the time of the book’s publication, mankind had already taken its “giant leap” and the buzz concerning the forthcoming Space Shuttle program was how to make space profitable. Gateway offers such a vision and we’ve taken more than a few steps towards its fulfillment in the present.Other themes that still resonate include our irrepressible drive to destroy the environment and how that destruction will affect food supplies. Gateway also comments on the continued march towards the disintegration of all social support for society. Healthcare is purely a function of wealth and life expectancy falls along the same divide. And immigration is touched upon in terms of the force-of-character that is required to give up everything on a belief that life could be better in a completely foreign place.Gateway is a classic among a mountain of available sci-fi pulp. Of all first-in-series sci-fi books that I have read, only the sequels to Gateway have my serious attention and my commitment to continue living in Frederik Pohl’s world....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Aug 15, 2019","Aug 20, 2019","Jun 01, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/218427.Gateway

Most of the story centers around the game that Ender plays for the development of his command capabilities. His ultimate goal is to win absolute victory in the ongoing war with the “buggers,” a dehumanized enemy of humanity (think Starship Troopers). To this extent, the game is repeated multiple times throughout the initial two-thirds of the book. Therefore, making a movie (and a better book) would involve cutting some significant portion of this repetitive part of the story.The plot is carried out by characters who are pre-adolescent children, which creates a confusing contradiction throughout the book. Card uses his power of narration to repeatedly assert their young age, but then writes their thoughts, feelings, and experiences from an adult perspective. In this way, Card criss-crosses two, mostly exclusive worlds back and forth throughout the book and hinders a full immersion into the story.The positive aspects of the book bring light to some of humanity’s fundamental instincts for war and violence against our enemies and perceived enemies. This aspect of the book allows the reader to question such instincts in the light of our present society and human abilities.

Clarke was limited to viewing the movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey. My thoughts on that movie were that the first two hours were amazing. The movie depicted humanity reaching out into space and HAL, depicted at a time when computers were little more than glorified calculators, brought about provocative thoughts about computers advancing to the point where a sole could be created from code. Then the final scenes of the movie just happened: flashing lights, a space baby, and an old man in a white room. To put it bluntly, it didn’t work for me.Hence we have Childhood’s End with a story arc that closely follows A Space Odyssey. Clarke puts forth a realistic extrapolation of societal evolution that is drastically altered by a visiting race of benevolent but omnipotent aliens. He contemplates a human society that is freed from the troubles of poverty and war. A society that is blessed with an abundance of time which is used to further our knowledge of things that are of a deep personal interest to ourselves. But little-by-little the plot advances towards an end that is rooted in the paranormal. The outcome of humanity’s fate is hinted at, but only Clarke, as the writer, knows what he is writing about.

I was hoping for that magical merging of history and fiction, which gives life to history and historical significance to life. Rutherfurd's book, however, misses this anticipation by a wide margin.London covers almost two thousand years of history and focuses on a few familial hereditary lines throughout that span of time. Each period of history that is selected by Rutherfurd is complemented by stories that focus on these families. But the stories are mostly rooted in domestic issues. Domestic problems such as infidelity, disobedient spouses, and marriage arrangements dominate every time period covered by Rutherfurd. The history is often provided in narrative form along side the domestic tales and, as a result, life and history move forward on parallel paths. These two vital components seldom merged into that powerful combination known as great historical fiction.I'll also add that Rutherford stories tend to be prosaic. While he touches on the harsh conditions that humans have endured throughout history, his characters rarely express their suffering that accompanied these hardships. While narratives and positive happenstances occupy spans of pages, descriptions of the tragic or horrific are limited to brief sentences. While this approach makes for a pleasant reading experience, it does not give justice to the realities of our existence....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 25, 2015","Jun 21, 2015","May 25, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12407442-london

While I believe that moral absolutes exist, life is too complex to allow most people to ever grow close to them except through extreme efforts that seem less than human. For most people, compromises, sacrifices, and rationalizations keep us tossing in the waves of reality and leaving us with at least one riddle: Is a good person that does evil things for good reasons still a good person? That is what this book is about.But it’s also be about loss. About how someone can be such a part of you that if they die, especially suddenly, you become something other than who you were; something less than who you were. And being less human can only lead to cruelty, to a darkening of sorts, to acts that reflect this loss of self. And this diminished state lives in our creations.In between the good and evil and loss, there is a pure peace associated with this book. The setting allows for the moral complexities to be focused. This book abounds with imagery of mountains at sunset, the pure joy of rain hitting the desert floor, laminar streams filled with trout, and tree-filled forests. These passages allow the reader to absorb the weight of the plot and refresh the mind for the dilemmas to come. And the painter paints. His thoughts are transferred to the canvas as abstract bits of objects, motion, and color. Reading about this process offers a creative way for both the main character and the reader to decompress between the more suspenseful moments.And if there is a problem with this book, it seems overshadowed by all that I just described. While Heller writes in a style that is unique and refreshing, his plot has a propensity for hitting all of the remote possibilities. His characters make all the long-shots and they never seem to miss out on random meetings with their fellow characters. Even nature is inclined to act in their favor at times.

Shapiro uses her main character to describe the effect that a powerful work of art has upon her while in her presence. The feelings conveyed by Shapiro are not unlike my own experience when I found myself in front of Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère while in London a couple of years ago: It’s such a magnificent being. So alive, yet more like the sensation of life, rather than how life actually is. Color and emotion pulse from the canvas. Finding this type empathy in a book is a moving experience.After the intense beginning, the story transitions into a mystery novel, which is a genre that I usually find frustrating to read. This frustrations stem from the type of suspense that is manufactured by the writer and usually conveyed through the willful non-disclosure of events that are fully know to the writer. If this were all there was to The Art Forger, a mystery born out of manufactured suspense, it would have been a disappointing book after such a moving start.The Art Forger takes a unique path to presenting its mystery. Shapiro essentially provides herself with two overlapping sources of plausible deniability for manufactured suspense. First, the plot is presented in the first person, which places the conclusion and understanding of the personal narrative naturally at the end of the story. And second, the key event that is withheld happened a century before the events of the personal narrative. Time itself covers the event and leads to questions can never be answered, even by the writer. This combination of mystery born out of an understanding of human decisions and the fog of time made The Art Forger a mystery worth reading.And did I mention that art permeates this book?

The world is nine years into the aftermath of a virus that suddenly and almost completely kills off humanity. Those that survived now try to kill each other off, as if our natural state of survival depends on killing every other survivor that you come across. This aspect of the novel is a bit hard to believe given the vast amount of resources that would have been left behind for the survivors under such a scenario. Even guns, in America, are depicted as being in short supply, but it’s Heller’s world. It’s Heller’s ability to write, to tell his story, that makes this novel special. His prose exhibit the sparseness of Ernest Hemingway. He promotes intimacy with his reader through an abandonment of punctuation, which is similar to the style of Cormac McCarthy. Heller, however, takes this style one step further and occasionally digresses into what I would describe as being poetic. The result is a style that peaks at critical moments with short, incomplete sentences which communicate impact. It worked. It got under my skin and I could feel the action.There‘s also a philosophical side to this novel where Heller explores today’s political divide between people. His post apocalyptic world allows him to remove all the people and in doing so, he removes the countless nuanced opinions on political philosophy. He then searches out the a fundamental source for our present-day strife under his petri dish conditions. The result boils down to a choice between self-sufficiency and community. Heller explores this choice throughout the novel and delivers his opinion as the book progresses.My feelings of discontent with The Dog Stars primarily reside with its ending, which boldly and abruptly broadcasts ""sequel."" Stories that end this way sacrifice their completeness for something that looks and feels a lot like marketing, and marketing is not literature. Additionally, Heller’s love of all things Colorado becomes very apparent with his prolonged and repeated descriptions of the mountains and his love for fishing. Initially, these scenes fill in the backstory of his main character, but they soon become tedious and irrelevant to the plot.In short, The Dog Stars provides great action and great writing, even with its naturalistic indulgences. However, don’t look to closely into Heller’s post-apocalyptic world, and keep an eye out for the forthcoming sequel, which he now owes to his readers....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Apr 29, 2023","May 05, 2023","Apr 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330761-the-dog-stars

This audience would primarily consist of those who enjoy stories saturated in testosterone. To that end, the novel is filled with action sequences, shootouts, military-esque black operatives, and self-centered men who engage in pissing contests at every opportunity. All this hyper-action inevitably leads to scenes filled with eye-rolling implausibility, even when considered within the book's macho-man context.The time travel elements somewhat elevate this novel above its testosterone overdose. Dalton gives reason to think through the plot and to contemplate the physical possibilities of time travel. Ideas associated with encountering other versions of yourself are put forward. Additionally, if the past were changed, those in the future would also change, without ever noticing it. Their physical selves would instantly adjust to their rewritten history. But Dalton’s time travel writing also falters at times. Characters from various points in time are poorly defined as to their purpose or effect, and Dalton’s stated rules are ignored when it's convenient not to have rules.The testosterone in this book, however, is forever present. Whether intentional or unintentional, Dalton creates an environment that excludes women from any meaningful part in the story. When women do appear in the story, they are portrayed as incompetent, grotesque, or helpless. Even if the benefit of the doubt were given to Dalton regarding his intent, his work could only improve by learning to write competently about this particular half of the human race....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 22, 2022","Apr 05, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24789250-and-the-tide-turns

They are felt at times appropriate to the event that prompts them. And while we may feel these emotions in various degrees, each of us understands them in a singular way. Love, however, takes each of these feelings as well as others and applies them all in various amounts to different situations. The result is that love never feels the same way twice and for that reason, love is confusing, irrational, and possibly impossible to communicate in a meaningful way to another person; even to the one you love. It is this impossibility that Alfred Hayes takes on as a challenge in In Love and he succeeds in a very unique way.Hayes captures every instance of his narrator experience of love at the moment it occurs. As a result, we are continuously aware of his thoughts and feelings as complex as they are. Each thought and emotion is addressed as it's experienced, no matter how contrary to the preceding moment or to the next.And while this may sound confusing, it comes across as making sense because we've all been through the same human experience at some point in our lives. We've all done stupid things while in love, even while knowing that they were stupid, simply because of the hope that those stupid things created. We've all, in the moment, thought about and felt each possibility as it relates to someone else; each thought and feeling separated by a comma (and each sub-thought and sub-feeling included in a set of parentheses). Yes, it may sound confusing, but because we know what this is, and because Hayes captures this so beautifully, In Love comes across as genuine, and his book is well worth the experience....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 29, 2015","Apr 22, 2015","Mar 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1289430.In_Love

Leonard's ability to use human complexity to produce a mystery created a desire This was a follow-up book after reading Cuba Libre by Elmore Leonard. Leonard's ability to use human complexity to produce a mystery created a desire to read a traditional mystery novel by an equally prolific writer. It took two seconds to decide upon Agatha Christie.In contrast Leonard's style, Christy forcefully moves her characters through her plot. It's fairly obvious that the plot was methodically planned by Christie prior to writing the book. The characters act in synchronicity with the plot and they serve its twists and turns on cue. They voyage, die, love, and commit crimes just when needed in order to keep the story moving forward towards its anticipated ending. While the same sort of planning may be true of Leonard, he always seems to hold open the possibility that his characters could act differently should their spirit move them to do so, changing their acts in a moment’s notice, and changing the course of the book. Christie is why I usually shun mysteries and Leonard makes mysteries worthwhile.The book itself is a typical mystery novel. While the journey from beginning to end can be fun (as was once depicted in one memorable episode of M*A*S*H) I always feel cheated by these types of novels. Of course the villain did the deed, but the mystery is a product of the plot rather than an outcome of unpredictable human nature. The characters are developed just enough to fit into the plot and their interactions seem silly because they have no human foundation.

As a result, the book takes it’s time with various trivialities, characters that do not contribute much to the story, and sub-plots that are more like side-plots. The book’s own contemporaneous explanation of publishing at the time describes the benefits of producing a lengthy novel. It’s interesting to note that these benefits were only of value to the writers and the publishers of the time and not the readers. Even with all of its wordiness, the main focus of the book is still remarkable for someone like me that loves books. I’ve often think about writers like Jack London, who wrote mostly for money and only occasionally, almost by accident, hit upon a truly good piece of literature. And then there is Hemingway who produced a fraction of London’s work mostly because he constantly strove “to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.” New Grub Street dives into writers like these, explores the consequences of their craft, and places them into perspective against London society in the later part of the Victorian era....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 11, 2015","Jul 30, 2015","Mar 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/782519.New_Grub_Street

It's a concept that occupies our lives anytime our minds contemplate our country. And if you consider its overarching We all know what patriotism is. It's a concept that occupies our lives anytime our minds contemplate our country. And if you consider its overarching ability to co-opt religions, political parties, and regional beliefs, patriotism may indeed be the ultimate religion that controls our collective future. Patriotism may be responsible for more destruction in the world than any other concept that permeates humanity. And yet it seemingly takes us down those destructive paths effortlessly. Patriotism stirs our fears, calls us to love, directs us to hate, inflates our pride, bands us together, and shapes a version of reality that is unified even if untrue. Patriotism may indeed be the ultimate form of tyranny and yet we often give ourselves over to this tyranny time and time again.A Critical Analysis breaks the concept of patriotism apart, contemplates its origins, and explains why patriotism exists. Reidenbach's treatment of the subject is extensive spanning the spectrum of humanity’s evolution and even reaching back to our origins as a part of a stronger multi-celled variety of microbial life. As a defining document for what patriotism is, this book stands on its own and it has not diminished during its 100 years of existence.Even in the area where A Critical Analysis is dated, where it considers a world that was engulfed in the throes of World War I, there is modern value to Reidenbach observations. At the time this book was written, the world was fractured and isolated while the world of today is exceedingly more accessible. The value of Reidenbach's static view lies in the path that it illuminates, stretching between then and now.Beginning with airline travel and blossoming with the rise of the internet, social relationships are continuing to branch out to all parts of the world. Certain realizations about the people of other countries make it ever more difficult to reasonably elevate one's own country above another. The result of this progress has served to diminish unfounded fear, hate, and pride, which are ingredients of patriotic fervor.Lastly, I would venture to say that most modern books on the subject of patriotism are likely mired in subtle or overt secondary messages. If one has a particular flavor of patriotism in mind there is a writer that will fulfill their imaginations. In stark contrast to these modern books, A Critical Analysis was written as an objective philosophical study on the subject of patriotism, with the possible exception of the final chapter. In those final paragraphs, Reidenbach implies his desire for world peace in a world where patriotism is, and always will be, a reality of life.An electronic copy of this book can be downloaded from the following web address.

In fact, I was probably a third of the way through the story until I realized that the story was taking place on another planet and that the characters were other-than-human. Nevertheless, the deception had a purpose in that it allowed the story to slip into its central theme without the distraction of having to understand and visualize an alien setting.The story was first published over fifty years ago but the central theme stretches forwards and backwards from that point in time rather effortlessly. This is probably due to the fact that humans, and apparently non-humans, have a tendency to assert their own personal perceptions of their own perfect societies on other societies that they see as backwards. And if that assertion requires the destruction of the other societies, then that’s just a part of the adage: sometimes to create you must first destroy.The story does a good job in providing the perspective of those being conquered. Given that the United States has primarily been involved with doing the conquering here on this planet, this different point of view could be considered enlightening (or it could simply be dismissed, in which case you would probably not like this story). The story also emphasizes the fact that a society that appears to be backwards is probably just different.

In fact, The Cruel Sea by Nicholas Monsarrat remains my favorite novel about life in the Royal Navy during the years that comprised World War II. HMS Ulysses has many of the same elements as Monsarrat’s novel, but Monsarrat practices control over his writing, he knows that magical point where language needs to stop so that the reader’s imagination can complete the imagery and feelings being conveyed. In Ulysses, Alistair MacLean tends to monopolize the reader’s mind. It’s certainly not intolerable, but he does over-describe things to the point where it feels like one’s imagination has been pushed aside.The action in Ulysses is a bit over the top; as if MacLean is trying to compress the entire variety of wartime experiences into the single mission being chronicled. At times, the action is gripping, but in total it becomes overwhelming to the point of disbelief. For those that enjoy Westerns that feature forever-loaded revolvers and heros that escape death time after time, this story of survival is the naval equivalent of that genre. As war stories often go, the characters tend to be instruments of the plot. Bad things happen to them, but the feelings of the victims cannot be fully realized because much of their background is missing. To make matters worse, the characters are referred to at different times by one of their many monikers. Their rank, position, the acronym of their position, their last name, nickname, and first name are all used interchangeably, which creates confusion and further distances the reader from the characters.Overall, HMS Ulysses is not a bad naval war novel.

His writing is somewhat typical of the times in that long paragraphs abound. However, rather than using these paragraphs to embellish various elements of the story, they instead served to hone in on the succinct emotions being experienced by the main character, Tullio Hermil. The result is a clear understanding of how Tullio thinks and feels during the telling of his tale. At any given moment, a multitude emotions are present and I could feel these complex emotions as his story progressed. The story is about love and marriage and I found the marriage of Tullio and Juliana to be as troubled as many marriages have ever been. However, there is sense that these two people come to understand what marriage is all about: forgiveness and commitment.But Tullio and Juliana are more than a typical married couple. Their station in life has instilled in them the attributes of selfishness, arrogance, and conceitedness. These attributes, when mixed with love's unique sort of reason, work to create a tragedy that is justified in the mind of Tullio; and understandable in the mind of the reader.It's a story that is honestly told with an apparent disregard to the social and religious conventions of the time. If I were told what this story was about beforehand, I'm not certain that I would want to read it, similar to the effect that Lolita sometimes has on that book's potential readers. However, this story's commitment to the emotional truth about people you would probably not want to know in life translates into a powerful reading experience.As for relevancy, this story readily transposes to the present day. While most of Tullio and Juliana's social constructs have been removed, there is still an abundance of selfishness, arrogance, and conceitedness in the world.

With those words I have probably quoted or paraphrased the advice of a countless number of writers. The reason for this advice ""Write what you know."" With those words I have probably quoted or paraphrased the advice of a countless number of writers. The reason for this advice is simple: the lie that is fiction must be perceived as a truth if a book is to stand the test of time. But then we have Winnetou - The Apache Knight. Karl Friedrich May was born in Germany in 1842 and lived to the age 70 without ever having stepped foot in the American West. Yet he chose to write about that unknown place in the absence of any first-hand experience; choosing to rely upon other means, such as travel memoirs, to know this mysterious land. By all accounts, he was a successful writer in his native country and the character Winnetou went on to appear in three subsequent novels.In spite of this success, however, May failed to capture the true nature of the American West. Absent from Winnetou are any meaningful descriptions of endless skies, jagged snow-capped peaks rising from the plains, and distant thunderstorms moving across distant horizons. Writers such as Zane Grey and Cormac McCarthy knew the power of such an unforgiving yet beautiful landscape and they used it to shape their characters, which in turn added substance to the content of their books.May's depictions of the American Indians are equally lacking in scope. The Apache and Kiowa Indians are represented as being simpletons that serve solely to provide the antagonism required of the plot. They are depicted as children when the wisdom of the ""paleface"" is being imparted to them; depicted as maniacal warriors when battles are fought; and depicted sadistic animals in the treatment of their prisoners. There is no complexity in these people probably due to May's ignorance of their culture.Essentially, May played a game wherein he took advantage of the relatively isolated state of the world in his time. The vast majority of May's readers had never stepped foot in America and they predominately communicated in their native German language. As a result, May's fans gained their knowledge of the American West through May's words and created a feedback loop that ensured his popularity for decades after his death.As WWII approached, it is not surprising that the German population, including Adolph Hitler, relied in part upon their beloved German writer to find insights into the nature of the American people. It's been documented that Hitler had 300,000 copies of Winnetou delivered to his soldiers. The Germans naturally reached for a source that was both readily available and readily enjoyed. It was this failure of the imagination, or rather this short-circuit of the imagination, that helped to create a false impression of Germany's future enemy. Winnetou predominately relies upon the action of its hero and his trusty sidekicks. As a result, their actions appear heroic and the actions of everyone else, presumably the average American, seem helpless, rash, and ineffectual. In the same way that May fails to capture any of the beauty of the American West and the complexity of the American Indians, he also fails to capture any of the humanity of the American people. He simply did not know these things, and today, I would hope that the world would know better....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 17, 2015","Mar 25, 2015","Dec 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/944459.Winnetou_The_Apache_Knight

And throughout the book, people find themselves in positions where their decisions affect the lives of others, and each of these characters carry the burden of their decisions in different and unique ways.It's these sparks that have me wondering if a twelve-part series of books might just have more to it than the video game action that so saturated this first installment.

The contact happens during a time when faster-than-light travel has been discovered and humans have colonized nearby stars, all of which were uninhabited. The contact, far from being a universal ephimy of humanity’s existence, is hostile, brutal, and threatens to enslave humanity (or worse).It’s typical for sci-fi series of any length to sustain themselves through action, space battles, over-dramatized drama, and victories against unbeatable odds, and Koban has its fair share of these attributes. However, Koban also possess a contemplative approach to its story. Its plot rests on the strategy and actions of its characters. Will Humanity survive? The answer rests mostly in how clever humanity can be. It is through this means that Koban approaches one of the core purposes of science fiction.The disagreeable aspects of the book involved the characters. They all had their duties and responsibilities, and they all seemed to fade back into their storyline assignments rather than express individual personalities or feelings. There are no artists, or dreamers, or people passionate about anything other than staying alive. As a result, the death of a character is noted but not experienced.The story also had the potential to explore a unique situation within human society with its opening extinction of 90-plus percent of the male population. This set the table for a unique woman-dominated perspective, but Bennett fails to deliver on this theme. Men and their acts dominate the plot with the implication by Bennett, be it intentional or unintentional, is that men are the saviors of humanity. Overall, Koban is engaging with its logic and strategy, but lacking in its depiction of humanity and the humans that comprise it.

In episode after episode, prisoners, outcasts of society, were interviewed and each one told of their crimes (or of their innocence) in an honest straight forward manner. While on camera, they acted like they were talking to their next door neighbor. And yet, during all those hours of Lockup Raw, there was never an understanding of who these people were and the question of choice was never resolved. Why couldn't these criminals simply decide to not do the things they did?Hard Rain Falling provides some portion of understanding into who these people might be through its main character, Jack Levitt. While Jack Levitt was an outcast of society, it was not due to his poor decisions. Jack made the best decisions possible based on the content of his beliefs. It was also not due to his laziness. Jack worked as hard as he could to the physical and intellectual limits of his abilities. Nor was it due to a disinterest in learning. Jack had a hunger to learn and constantly sought to expand his understanding of the world. And it was not due to some sort of pure evilness of heart. Jack pursued love to the point of pain. If Jack Levitt was an outcast of society, then the only real reason for his position in life was the randomness associated with his creation.The strength of this book rests in the intricate development of its characters in the first two parts of the book. Carpenter succeeds in defining characters that are rational unto themselves, while at the same time appearing irrational when viewed from a societal perspective. Reasons for violence and crime abounded in the mind of Jack Levitt even though society would see things differently. This duplicity of perspective was engrossing and it makes Hard Rain Falling into a reading experience.The book's shortcomings rest in the third and final part. After being drawn into Carpenters world of complex characters, the third part of the book seems light and rushed. Rather than achieving a sense of duplicity that was previously relished, the characters in the third part of the book seemed, at times, contradictory. Hard Rain Falling is still a great book, but another hundred pages devoted to the last part of the book would have made it unique....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 20, 2014","Dec 04, 2014","Nov 18, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6553843-hard-rain-falling

If its mysteries could be decoded and understood then the corresponding joy of discovery would be unparalleled.

My general feeling of the book is that Baxter made a remarkable attempt at writing an outstanding science fiction novel. So here are the details.The good...With the science fiction genre is consumed by space operas and their gallivanting, phaser-blasting starship captains, it’s rare to find a story that is contemplative in its content. Proxima is not about shooting wars in space, alien invasions, or mystical worlds. Rather, it’s a story that has one foot in presently reality while taking a step towards what we might become in the future; about 200 years into the future.The story is careful in its science to respect fundamental constructs that are known to be true. The speed of light, the effects of gravity, and our need for a habitable environment outside of the safety of our pale blue dot are all respected. There are no shortcuts when it comes to these hard and fast constraints.Then there are the scientific extrapolations. They allow the reader to see possible futures related to current issues that are destined to grow in importance as time proceeds. Baxter provides illustrative outcomes to the possible effects of global warming, artificial intelligence, and the presence of Earth-like exoplanets. His extrapolations are thoughtful, and show a genuine respect for science and engineering. And beyond those things that are possible lie the purely fictional elements, where the unknown is brought into existence. These elements of the story serve to highlight our potential (or lack thereof). With the discovery of an unimaginable power source that is closely guarded by half of humanity, the book asks if such a discovery will bring us together as a species or will the weakest parts of ourselves further separate us into factions eager for a violent solution.And now the bad...First, Baxter advances two timelines that fluctuate in time separation throughout the book. Some chapters are opened with the year, which helps, but others are silent with Baxter assuming that the date is understood. From my own lack of experience in dealing with relativistic time shifts, more attention to timekeeping by Baxter would have helped to keep me oriented to his story.The next disappointment relates to the characters. They all tend to be interchangeable regardless of their background. Their names serve as their primary distinguishing characteristic. They all exhibit a stoic fatalism with some entertaining sarcasm being expressed from time-to-time, but nothing deeper. This seems to be a recurring shortcoming of the science fiction genre. It’s as if writers that excel in imagining the future have an inability to capture the uniqueness of a human individual.And finally, the plot serves only Baxter's vision of the story. He does not pause for answers to questions that his readers are likely to have along the way. Events transpire that are not explained. Obvious inconsistencies in his imagined technology are not addressed. And threats that would seem easy to neutralize in a technologically advanced world are allowed to proceed as if we were helpless to stop them. Baxter largely ignores (or fails to imagine) the thoughts of his readers who will certainly be living along side Baxter throughout his story....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 19, 2017","Oct 26, 2017","Nov 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17983396-proxima

They dissect their character's thoughts and actions in order to get to the The Heart of the Matter. They work for small bits of truth in a sea of reality and they often succeed, if they are good.But humans do not fall open to scrutiny so easily. Often in life, the person in front of you simply acts without any hint as to the reasons why. There is no narrator speaking from above and their complexity is protected by their skin, their eyes, and the depths of their mind. For what we see, they simply act and it is only after the fact that we can contemplate their actions. But their actions are human because that is what we all are.This is Leonard's approach to Split Images. His characters are complete in their complexity. Their actions are beholden to no explanation other than some mysterious thought process that remains their own. Leonard takes a wedge out the world, puts it between the front and back covers, and lets his readers see life play out on every page. It takes a subtle hand to create such a reality in words, but Leonard seems to know that life is seldom more than the sum total of the actions of the people living it....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Nov 2014,"Nov 08, 2014","Oct 29, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85208.Split_Images

Within its pages were images of English landscapes, country mansions, starched white collars and satin dresses, and a story that sprawls slowly (oh, so very slowly) from place to place, from start to end. In keeping with the times of its creation, it would be easy to picture Brontë showing this work to her peers in much the same way the ladies of the novel took pride in their own artistic accomplishments. It's a delicate and intricate book, whose words prove that the English language can be a beautiful thing.The book's survival for over 150 years, however, cannot be due to language alone and to be sure, there are a number of themes throughout this book that give it its present-day relevancy. Religious enthusiasts will find an abundance of moral lessons as well as multiple scenes of self-deprivation made in the name of God. It's also remarkable how independent Jane Eyre becomes during an era when men and their wealth controlled much of the world. Jane Eyre also serves as a time capsule in that the book brings light to the mannerisms and living conditions of Brontë's era. Finally, the book challenges its readers to take note of the quality of the beliefs that guide their actions. Are theses beliefs founded in reality, or are they founded in faith alone? 150 years ago, faith and reality were practically one in the same, and since that time, not much has changed.Yes, Jane Eyre is all that, which is just a bit too much....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 11, 2014","Oct 26, 2014","Oct 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10210.Jane_Eyre

Yes, it’s been hyped and made into a movie and a lot of people have made a lot of money. But after reading The Martian, I have come to the conclusion that all of that is organic to the writing and to the story.First, there is nerdom. Real science abounds on every page. Not that science-fiction stuff that fades in and out of reality, but true, present-day science, based in technology that spans all areas of practical application. There is rocket science (of course), but the fields of electrical, civil, mechanical, agricultural science and engineering are extensively included in the story. I understand that Weir incorporated updates and corrections that he received from scientists and engineers while this book was being posted on-line, in installments, prior to its commercial publication. This commitment to reality translates as a commitment to truth, which always makes for a great book.Then there is the humor. Deep satirical humor that is fueled by consequences and leads full circle to genuine joy or pain in the heart of the reader. This book is deadly serious but you will find yourself smiling throughout the story. The dry and satirical humor adds a finishing touch to most scenes and it elicits a deeper emotional response to the situations that arise.Minor issues? Yes, the characters could be stronger, more defined. Humans are far more complex than they appear to be. We are never as mission-focused as those depicted in the story. And finally, there is space, where losing a roll of the dice just once typically ends the game. There is a vague feeling that builds throughout the novel that our stranded astronaut is invincible in the face of repeated adversity. But feel free to disregard this last paragraph and tell me to lighten up. The Martian is an fun reading experience, especially for the nerds of this world....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 30, 2015","Dec 07, 2015","Oct 05, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18007564-the-martian

I think most people would agree that limited government interference in one's life leads to an increased ability to survive and thrive in this world. It's and idea that acknowledges that government cannot understand any one person's individual needs so laws and regulations that try to shape the behaviors and actions of an individual are generally a bad thing. Had Lane simply presented this idea, its successes and its failures, there would have probably been widespread acceptance of her book.But Lane passionately and desperately tries to prove this idea in the extreme, which is something that cannot be proven. Present this idea to a dozen people and a spectrum of replies will be received in return. Complicate the presentation with a specific example and those replies will change. There is no correct opinion beyond the mind of any individual and the specific case being considered.In spite of this reality, Lane presses ahead with her efforts and departs from reason. First, she defines all individuals that disagree with her as having a single spiritual flaw: a deep seeded religious faith in their respective Old World Governments (and the word Government is purposely capitalized throughout the book as an allusion to God). After profiling all those in opposition to her as religious devotees, her writing focuses on affecting their enlightenment through education.Lane's educational curriculum is comprised of arguments consisting of half-truths, over-simplifications, and mistruths to support her points. She dwells extensively on examples where she presents elements that are supportive to her assertions while completely ignoring relevant elements to the contrary. American history, European history, and the history of the Middle-East are all subjects that are cherry-picked and shaped by Lane.The Discovery of Freedom was published in 1943 and leaders of the time used similar methods to educate their citizens with their own versions of the truth. Roosevelt used fireside chats, Hitler used his grand assemblies, and Churchill used his oratory skills. Lane's methods are in keeping with the times. The book rings of classic propaganda served up for acceptance as the truth as long as no questions are asked.This propagandistic style creates significant problems for the book. While Lane wants people to abandon their presumed religious beliefs in their Government, it becomes apparent that she is perfectly willing to accept a faith-based conversion to her point of view and to have the newly converted pre-programmed with her spoon-fed Truths. This approach implies Lane's lack of trust in those that would be converted and by extension, a lack of trust, by Lane, in her own idea. After all, an idea that is true should be able to withstand evidence to the contrary.As a consequence, The Discovery of Freedom reads with a continuous undertone of skepticism and Lane's credibility as an educator continuously evaporates along the way. There are passages that contradict earlier discussions. For instance, Lane asserts that individual voting for the president of the United States and our senators is a dangerous thing; that US citizens should have a religious faith in the Electoral College delegates and senators that would be appointed by State governments if it were not for the Seventeenth Amendment. The universal flaw used by Lane against her opponents finally becomes a quality that should be embraced by true believers in the original US Constitution and the government it formed. The irony runs deep. The best part of this version of The Discovery of Freedom is the foreword. I have to give its writer, Windy McElroy, and the publisher credit for not editing out Lane's own opinions regarding The Discovery of Freedom. During Lane's lifetime, only the initial run of 1,000 copies was published and she would not allow a second printing. In her words, Lane said, ""It's a very bad book. I ought to know. I wrote it."" And I happen to agree....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 02, 2014","Oct 11, 2014","Oct 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/906575.The_Discovery_of_Freedom

Therefore, for any given book, the closer the setting, characters, and plot are to what I perceive to be real, the better the chances are that I will enjoy that book.Dark Digital Sky comes closest to realism with its main character, Chalk. While the book is a hard-boiled detective story, a modern take on the classic film noir style, it's the perfect medium for Chalk. He's a manifestation of the undercurrent of society. He has been exposed to failures and disillusionments. His life-experiences have transformed him into a cynical realist who easily dismisses the illusion of hope for a reality that simply happens without consideration for anyone. I believed in Chalk and believed in his beliefs.Dark Digital Sky's plot, however, undermines this realism. While Chalk is true-to-life, the life that surrounds him is not. We simply do not see the events that transpire in Dark Digital Sky happen. Even extrapolations of reality fall short of these events. Today's surveillance grid, as understood through contemporary reports on the NSA, PRISM, and Snowden, would likely stop a rogue militia group before reaching the critical mass needed to act as depicted in this book. Chalk's own technological expertise alludes to these counter-terrorism capabilities but the government is shown to be irrelevant and inept. As a result of this disconnect, Chalk finds himself fighting against a whirlwind of fantasy (and sighs).As a first novel, I think Dark Digital Sky's is an exceptional accomplishment on the part of Alison. Chalk captured my attention and speaks to the talent that Alison has in creating interesting and believable characters.

Boldrewood (or Browne, as that was his actual name) captures the setting and spirit of colonial Australia during the middle of the 19th Century, as it happened. The book captures the feeling of that remote colony and his writing captures the dialect of a people that worked apart from the Old World to make Australia their home. From there, there is a feeling of kinship that grows from the similarities that exist between the history of the American West and those of this then-distant land. This book is filled with cattle, ranchers, horses, towns, cowboys, ranges and mountains. Had the story been set in Oklahoma the spirit these things would have changed very little. But while the actions that drive this book could have been written by Elmore Leonard or Zane Grey, they weren't. This book, through-and-through, is uniquely Australian.The central theme gives rise to considerations of justice. Does the doling out of punishment that simply fits the crime, regardless of circumstances, truly balance the scales held in the hand of justice? Or are the scales held aloft as a distraction for that other item she holds in her other hand? Society controls punishment and those outside of society have little say in it's application. Thus, mercy is more of a man-made miracle with respect to just punishment and the finger of society forever rests upon the scales.The tone of the book is truly sincere. It's no spoiler to say that the story is told from the first-person perspective of a condemned man and from his narrative the reader grows to understand this man's path towards his fate. The narration is matter-of-fact and deliberately avoids gimmicks such as mystery, suspense, and over-played action. This approach allows the reader to focus on the acts and circumstances of the characters and to better understand the story of the condemned....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 06, 2016","May 30, 2016","Aug 20, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21404263-robbery-under-arms-a-story-of-life-and-adventure-in-the-bush-and-in-the

Should you find yourself in command of a bathroom cleaning crew or a capital warship, everything that happens under your command is your responsibility. And when the weight of that absolute responsibility is combined with the emotions associated with duty and honor, the result is a person that is structured to endure the extremes of human existence for a worthwhile cause.The strength of The Good Shepherd is that it highlights this type of person in terms of Commander George Krause. Krause is an average naval officer that by chance finds himself in command of an under-strength group of destroyers tasked with the protection of a transatlantic convey from U-boat attacks. The story moves Krause through the spectrum of human endurance and demonstrates how his own combination of absolute responsibility, duty, and honor work under impossible conditions.Beyond Krause's demonstration of good naval conduct, however, The Good Shepherd reads as a superficial story. The crew appear as a rotation of ranked and named individuals that have no personal characteristics, a past, or a future. Their actions either please or displease Krause and after a while they become a jumble of extras that are confusingly ignored. The story as well, becomes tedious. There is only one way for a destroyer to hunt a submerged submarine, which is to attempt to chase it down. This process of hide-n-seek is continuously repeated throughout the book. The sub hunts become a jumble of rudder commands, course headings, and reports all of which are acknowledged by the tried and true naval phrase, “very well.” The book also assumes a fair amount of knowledge of the naval environment which, if not present in the reader, could further serve to isolate the story.There is not much here to enjoy beyond the celebration of duty that is exemplified by the captain and I found that reading The Good Shepherd required a bit of Krause's own ability to endure in order to make it to the end. But then again, this may have been the point.Note: C. S. Forester spent time on board the destroyer, USS Abner Read (DD-526) in June 1943. My grandfather, Edwin Villines, was a machinist mate on board at the time. The Abner Read, with my grandfather, would eventually be struck by a mine in August 1943 during the Aleutian Island campaign and ultimately sunk by a kamikaze strike on November 1, 1944 while in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands.

The galaxy he creates in Revelation Space strikes at the heart of what I would realistically imagine our future to be as we head out into the stars. Humans are still imperfect, we are still selfish, and our love for the integration of technology into our lives is taken not to its conclusion, but rather to a realistic step along the way. He weaves in scientific facts that are explained to the point of consistency with his story such as his respect for the vast distances between the stars and the effects of time when traveling close to, but not faster than the speed of light. Additionally, Reynolds creates a humanity that is in the process of fracturing into different cultures due to the colonization of new worlds that are extremely far apart. This part of Revelation Space was worth the read: 5 stars for a thought-provoking setting.A great book, however, is more than its setting. Outside of his galaxy, Reynolds struggled with the creation of realistic characters. While human, the characters fail to display any convincing human emotions or provide human reasons for their actions. Reynolds 'tells' of his character's actions rather than 'showing' them. As a result, tales of love are told with mechanical accuracy, freedoms are denied without frustration or anguish, and anger is expressed through the occasional expletive. The characters are simply a means to justify the existence of his version of the galaxy.The plot suffers as well mostly from a lack of cohesion caused by its gratuitous use of forced suspense. While the book consists of 39 chapters, each chapter contains two or three shifts between storylines in order to make the reader wait for that next tidbit of information no matter how minor. The plot also suffers from scenes of pointless action. Things are blown up, shot at, or destroyed with exotic weapons, which provides Reynolds the chance to lecture his readers on their sci-fi composition and function. These two gimmicks, suspense and action, attempt to hold the reader to the book. However, after 300 pages the novel becomes tiresome and it was somewhat of a relief to have finally reached the last page....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 17, 2014","Sep 08, 2014","Aug 13, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89187.Revelation_Space

It accomplishes what so many books in the genre surprisingly fail to do, which is to raise questions about our collective future based upon our past and present conditions. For those that want to consider far reaching ideas about our long-term societal and human evolutionary paths, Galaxies Like Grains of Sand  has no shortage of such ideas.My issues with Galaxies stem from its structure. It attempts to be one complete text that presents fragments of Earth's history through countless millennia into the future. To accomplish this structure, the book is comprised of several short stories that are tied together with brief prefaces that focus on the book's historical theme.Aldiss' approach fragments the characters and the setting of each story while the central them of Earth's history is carried through to the end. Consequently, the characters and settings of each story serve Aldiss' purpose, but they fail to elicit any lasting sympathy. The characters simply vanish as the next fragment begins.The end result feels more like a recital of Aldiss' version of Revelation, and the human implications associated with Aldiss' visions are left to a sort of faith in him as the all-knowing writer. In the absence of sympathy, there is no way to feel a sense of truth in Aldiss' words.I think science fiction is capable of a literary story; complete with characters that communicate the nature of their existence, a setting that extrapolates realistic speculations on science, and a plot that strikes close to a human understanding of life. But so far, such a book has been elusive....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 09, 2014","Nov 17, 2014","Jul 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/384589.Galaxies_Like_Grains_of_Sand

The science fiction setting was only central to the writer's need to use imaginary nouns with techno-babble names. Otherwise, substitute rival gangs/factions/countries for rival alien species and the plot would not need to be changed. Whether past, present, or future: swords, guns, and blasters are all one in the same. Furthermore, the characters are so thin that re-writing their surroundings to match any point in time would be an easy thing to do.And therein lies the dissatisfaction with this book. Since fiction should have a purpose beyond having fun with alien races and scripting battle scenes in space. In this instance, we have humanity isolated to a point where our true human nature, devoid of history, could have been explored. Are we inherently cruel and selfish, is a society based on reason obtainable, does history repeat itself even in the absence of history? With AMP Messenger, simply look around you today and that is the society of Arseneault's future. Maybe that simple present-day observation answers those questions, but if so, Arseneault missed an opportunity to explain why he thinks our future will remain unchanged from our present, or more likely, he had no intention of doing anything other than exactly what he did.

On one side, there’s the main character, Lily Bart, and her high moral bearing. Lily is contrasted by the gluttons of society: those created from the slop of excessive wealth. While Lily initially views the gluttons with envy, she gradually learns that their world is one that is set apart. It a world comprised of its own rules that allow for morals to be twisted to fit rationalized acts, no matter how immoral those acts are. The struggle that ensues between Lily and the gluttons highlights the ineffective power that is imparted to those with high moral standards. When doing the right thing is pitted against those who are threatened with the loss of wealth, Lily finds that good moral intentions are no match against immoral acts that are supported by power and wealth. Thus, the need for morals as an absolute construct in one’s life is questioned throughout the story.The negative aspect of the story is that the human characters are a bit distorted to fit into their respective camps. In spite of a fundamental human desire for justice, it was convenient that all of the gluttons, even the couple that cared for Lily, were all of one mind in their desire to remove her from their company. Similarly, Lily Bart could have obtained vindication but decided that such an act of justice was in conflict with her moral convictions.

In addition to the bad things that happen, there are a countless number of disappointments, twists oBeing victimized is an ever-present risk in life. In addition to the bad things that happen, there are a countless number of disappointments, twists of fate, and accidents that happen regularly. Every time one of these things occurs, we feel a sense of injustice and from there we can fall into a state of self-pity: ""why me?"" ... Or, we can move on without ever having addressed the problem. We then exist in a state of denial about your own victimization, which gives rise to other deep-seeded issues as life goes on.Rebecca reads like a tribute to victimhood. The main character tells her story in the first person and every event is something that weighs heavily on her poor poor soul. She seems to constantly be operating in a state of self-despair. I'm feeling rather faint just thinking about it. Maxim, on the other hand, fails to confront his problems and becomes so self-absorbed through most of the book that he jeopardizes the tings he holds most dear in his life. There is a third option to victimization, however. Rather than feeling that sympathy is due or trying to deny that anything bad ever happened, one can examine the events that transpired, reason with them, and try to understand them. It is through this approach that lessons can be learned, causes can be identified, and forgiveness can be found (especially for yourself). It is through this approach to tragedy that tragic events can be put behind you, catalogued as simply the way life is. It is this third option that is frustratingly lacking in Rebecca.On the positive side, I enjoyed the layout of the mystery, which is one of the main drivers of the plot. My usual problem with mysteries is their typical approach where the writer simply keeps an obvious bit of information off the page. In Rebecca, du Maurier subtly drops obvious elements of the future plot along the way. In stead of ""Ha! I got you!"" the experience is more along the lines of ""Why didn't you see this coming?"" and I did, once or twice....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 15, 2014","Jun 29, 2014","Jun 12, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17899948-rebecca

The first lens is fixed aIn reading historical fiction novels, I’ve noticed that the story is always affected by the placement in time of two lenses. The first lens is fixed at the time of the writer. Its location is measured by the time that has elapsed from the historical events depicted in the novel. As history fades into the past, the facts that comprise it become obscured and they degrade. Society also changes with time, which can change the writer’s interpretation of history.The Second lens is set in the time-frame of the reader. If a great distance in time exists between the writing and reading of a historical fiction novel, then the two states of society can become at odds with one another and the story can degrade into nonsense or fantasy. With The Pilot, the lenses are optimally spaced. The fifty years that separated the Revolutionary War and Cooper’s words give this novel a wonderful focus. The mannerisms and behaviors of the characters are nicely preserved. And Cooper is close enough to the war to let us see that it was in truth a British Civil War and that the 'South,' in the eyes of the British, actually won this internal struggle.As for the placement of the second lens, that of the reader, a little less patriotism in our stories about the Revolutionary War is exactly what we need in our present-day society. I thought it was remarkable that the attitudes of both sides were expressed so evenhandedly by Cooper, an American writer. It was actually refreshing in terms of today’s political climate, where simply hugging the flag is enough to gain a surprising amount of popular approval.The story itself twists and turns quite often but each curve comes in its own time. This leads to a tale that is easy to follow, which is a good thing given that the English language from two hundred years ago can be difficult to follow.The characters are likable and the distance in time between then and now serves to illuminate a couple timeless aspects of life. One is the supportive nature of life-experience that transcends artificial conditions such as rank and social structure. And another element is that people may see themselves as great, but how we see ourselves has very little bearing on who we actually are....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 27, 2019","May 11, 2019","May 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/453801.The_Pilot

It's filled with perspectives on the purpose of war, the effects that war has on society, and the inhuman expectations that society places on its soldiers. The book also serves to create that same feeling of helplessness that permeates the military experience. Soldiers are all pawns, moved about by powers that stretch so far away from them that explanations for their required actions are never forthcoming.This strength of the plot, however, also represent its weakness. As time moves forward and human culture changes many of the reasons for change are missing or poorly explained. The reader is given the front-material, which explains the story's roots in the Vietnam era and this helps to support some of the story. However, without knowing the story's origins it falls short of standing on its own, and even then, many aspects of the setting are left unexplained. As a former member of the military, I can confirm that this confusion is forever prevalent, but as a reader, it does not make for an engaging story. The military genre, also results in weakly formed characters. The characters come across as transient and fabricated for the scene. This may be an attempt to blend their individuality back into a greater society that is at war, but it also circumvents an emotional bond with the characters. Tragic things happen in war but I did not feel much sympathy as these things occurred. On the science side of the story, Haldeman gets physics right. He includes the strange effects on that relativistic speeds cause. The time aspects of the novel also introduce an interesting considerations about a war between to distant intra-galactic cultures and how such a war would be fought. The side that puts forth an invasion is actually attacking the other side's future. And those returning from such an invasion will return home to a future Earth.The final chapter was the best that this book had to offer. Finally, the questions and issues that could have been addressed along the way were woven into the plot.

From beginning to end, I had the feeling of being on a freight train with an express ticket to the end of the line; all the while sitting next to the engineer who has never in his life operated a train. In addition to the high entertainment, there is also a technical aspect to this story that is commendable: its cadence. Scene follows scene, chapter follows chapter, and the story moves along with intensity. Action scenes peak and then they are dissipated with moments of character and plot development, and then the action takes off once again. The rhythm of the story feels perfect and it enhances the craziness of the crazy world that is Ronnie and Rita's.Lastly, I’ll praise the discipline exercised by Sheldon in her writing. Adding to the intensity created by the action and the rhythm, is the development of the characters. The reader learns what they need to know about Ronnie and Rita when they need to know it, and at times that are appropriate to the story. This approach dials down the suspense and creates a revelatory aspect to the characters.

The book is comprised of alternating chapters of coincidental dire predicaments followed by successful evasions of fate. And so it goes until the most climatic and successful turn of events is reached at the end of the book. Granted, Sabatini may have a point in stating that life is mostly comprised of coincidence, but the ultimate coincidence attributed to Captain Blood, the overarching coincidence of continuous success, is not realistic.In all fairness, however, I was looking for just this type of book for my time in the Caribbean; while cruising from island to island. His writing echoed my real-world views of seas comprised of every shade of blue and ports that were at one time attacked by pirates. Once in a state of suspended reality, the wild adventures of Captain Blood were well received.And therein lies this book's redeeming quality: the writing. If you're looking to read a book about a superhero, then you might as well read one written by a writer who knows how to write. Sabatini captures his setting. He captures the 17th century with language, the lives of the characters, and a few of the historical events of the time.

Did I deserve it? No one answers all of the questions because some of them simply cannot be answered. Big events provoke these thoughts and we all have big events. Our parents die, we have near-misses on the road, and our children may not reach the potential that we see in them. But even the simple things cannot be fully explained and because of their lingering mystery, they must be endured as well.This is where Forth of July Creek lives. It lives within the events of ordinary life, big and small. And it’s hugely impressive that Henderson chose the ordinary as his medium. And while ordinary may not sound all that interesting, it is indeed the stuff that comprises our lives. Forth of July Creek is relevant because it puts our lives on display, but not in the sense that we are looking at ourselves in a mirror. Rather, it’s because Henderson lets us feel those things that we all feel when things must be endured. From this perspective, Forth of July Creek is absolutely about you and your life.Henderson's writing is uniquely his own. This is not a book that was quickly put to paper and sent to market. Whether it's dialogue, narrative, or descriptions of the wilderness, every word has a feeling of relevancy to the moment.

The prospect of the invitReading A Universe from Nothing was like being invited over to Lawrence Krauss’ home for a dinner party with his colleagues. The prospect of the invitation is very exciting, but the conversation at the dinner table does not drop down to the lowly level needed for full comprehension by a mere civil engineer.I appreciated the contents of the book. The journey that the science of our universe has taken over the past 500 years is outlined within the chapters. It was nice to have all the major discoveries touched upon in one place, culminating with the strange and exotic behaviors of seemingly empty space. But this complete journey may have also been the problem. There was not enough time (and probably desire) for Krauss to painstakingly transform the science into analogies that could be understood by the non- astro/particle physicists sitting at the table, which are his readers!Beyond the science, there is also a bit of condescension towards those that would rather look towards the spiritual aspects of our being (i.e. God) for all of the answers to all of the questions that science is trying to answer. In every science-related book that I’ve read, there are always questions as to why humans, with their capability to reason, would choose to not use their inherent gift. Carl Sagan wrote an entire book on the subject with his The Demon-Haunted World. Krauss, however, takes it one step further. While still short of being belligerent, he does cross the line where acceptance ends. While the condescension felt somewhat prickly under my skin, I also thought this could be indicative of our possible collective future. A future where science rises up to become the last religion that humans will ever need....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jul 31, 2022","Aug 05, 2022","Mar 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11337189-a-universe-from-nothing

In particular, Perry Smith worked his way into my mind. Perry was a reader. He knew the value of words. He knew compassion for other living beings, as strange as that may sound. He appreciated the act of learning from those that were willing to teach him in spite of a horrific family situation that prevented Perry Smith from completing the third grade. And he was one of the most dangerous and violent people that have ever walked among us. He was a deeply flawed individual who was afflicted with a multitude of psychological problems that would have probably pointed the way towards his ultimate fate, if they had ever been identified.It is this humanization effect that makes In Cold Blood interesting and contrary to everyday life. It is not uncommon to hear of a horrific murder. We hear of its violence and its particular brand of brutality. However, the murderer is usually just a name. Throw in the human back-story of the victim and were left with a criminal that has been reduced to a thing, an objectified enemy of society that can be morally despised out-of-hand and easily condemned.Capote's human perspective allows us to consider exactly what a death sentence is, which is the taking of another human life. The difference between what we typically know in these types of crimes and what we know about Perry Smith is what makes this book worthwhile. It brings to mind a considerable amount of thought about words like justice, revenge, and capital punishment, and it challenges the reader to place these words into context with respect to one's own beliefs. Does the taking of a human life bestow justice, or does capital punishment feed a desire that goes a small step beyond justice? As a society, do we have an obligation to collectively rise above our needs as individuals? Capote provides more than enough reasons to condemn the killers, but he also forces the reader to know what we are doing when our appointed executioner kills another human on our behalf....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,Mar 2014,"Mar 15, 2014","Mar 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/168642.In_Cold_Blood

The work highlights the grave losses to the desert ecology brought about by mass development and brings to life the unique culture of the desert southwest.Bowden makes the issues facing the desert interesting by refusing to play the injured environmentalist. Rather than presenting himself as a victim of a society that is consuming every natural resource for the sake of profit, Bowden recognizes his own membership in his own society. He takes responsibility for the consequences of society’s existence. It’s this approach that provides credibility to Bowden’s observations and links Blue Desert to reality.My main problem with the book stemmed from Bowden’s writing style. It was a bit jumbled with timeframes jumping from past to present. Bowden also mixed in segments of stories seemingly from his days as a reporter in Arizona. This was presumably done to give definition to the society to which he belonged, but I found these vignettes to be incoherent and a distraction from the main chapters of the book. Lastly, Blue Desert leans more towards the sociology of desert rather than its ecology. Therefore, if the sociology of this region is of interest, this may be a good resource. However, for the pure beauty of this region, Bowden does not come close to the world captured by Edward Abbey in Desert Solitaire....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 03, 2020","Jul 10, 2020","Feb 12, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1040606.Blue_Desert

They contributed to the world, brought us one immeasurably small step closer to our destiny, and then returned to the earth from which they came. From a distance, their lives appear to have been ordinary, but nothing could be further from the truth. William Stoner's existence, had it been real, would have been just as unknown as the countless billions. John Williams, however, provides us the opportunity to approach Stoner's life and examine the details associated with his existence. Williams' writing allows us to relate to the events in Stoner's life so completely, that the bits and pieces of these events reflect our own experiences. We've survived and grew stronger because of the paths that we blindly took during our youth; we've gained wisdom from the dreams that crumbled into reality; and we've instilled a part of ourselves into everything we've done.This is William Stoner and this is who we are, regardless of how inconsequential to history we will probably be.

Weber takes his readers from start to finish creatively and efficiently. Chapter by chapter theOn Basilisk Station is a skillfully constructed story. Weber takes his readers from start to finish creatively and efficiently. Chapter by chapter the story advances and another piece of the puzzle falls into place. Weber's story telling skills makes for good entertainment, consisting of non-stop action and strategy, which is why it's so disappointing to realize how terrible this book actually is.Beyond the story, there are problems with the characters. They are predominately comprised of tin soldiers that have no personality beyond that which is required to fulfill their duties. Their decisions tend to only consider duty and therefore, the results of their decisions all appear to be decisive and assured, as if there are no other options other than to fulfill their roles in Weber's play. In reality, humans in charge of executing conflicts are cursed with doubt, live with remorse over outcomes, and suffer disgust with circumstances over which they have no control. The characters in this book either shrug off such feelings over a couple paragraphs or never indicate that anything other than duty drives their behavior.Then there is the setting. It's problematic to classify this book as science fiction. Royalty has survived our journey to other worlds and dueling has somehow been revived as means of settling matters of honor between individuals. Weber also transplants, through centuries of time, earth's present-day political spectrum. It may be that Weber believes that present-day politics have evolved into their ultimate form. Or more likely, this transplantation serves as a self-made means for Weber to voice his commentary on present-day political beliefs, which he does throughout the book. And finally, there is Weber's suggestion that derogatory references to alien beings are acceptable, if those aliens are different in appearance and less technologically advanced than humans.So is this a science fiction novel? There is an abundance of techno-babble, but there is also these words by Marshall Benton Tymn, a Pilgrim Award* recipient. In this passage, Tymn provides his justification for using science fiction as classroom literature:…because science fiction portrays a multitude of alternate futures, it can provide students not only with a means for evaluating the forces affecting the shape the future may take, but also with extrapolations depicting various directions in which advances in science and technology may lead us. These alternate futures can also provide the perspectives needed to appreciate the possibilities open to society and the human race - a vision not always easy to achieve in our rapidly changing environment.This is not one of those books.* The Pilgrim Award was created in 1970 by the Science Fiction Research Association (SFRA) to honor distinguished contributions to scholarship in the fields of SF and fantasy....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 30, 2014","Feb 11, 2014","Jan 30, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35921.On_Basilisk_Station

We are quick to recall the causes of war and to cite statistics in support of our assertions. But where do these facts come from? In some cases they originate from history books that may have an occasional photograph of a battlefield littered with dead soldiers; or they can be found in statistical almanacs filled with tables of tallied numbers. These are our facts. But truth exists behind all of these facts and as time moves forward, more and more of that truth is lost to time. This truth lived for a bitter moment in the mind of each of those pictured dead soldiers and existed within every life that contributed to the tallies on a statistical page.Moreover, this truth is not fact. It is entirely human, which is to say imperfect and confused, comprised of unique and unequal proportions of fight and flight; forgiveness and revenge; hatred and love. The human mind is where truth lives and dies, which is why the truth is ultimately lost to history, leaving us with just the facts: so many soldiers killed; this percentage a part of that whole.In the pages of Blood Meridian, McCarthy gives us back the lost truths of the individuals captured by choice or by chance in the events McCarthy describes. He brings these individuals to life with sincerity. Their truths are unlike the facts that have been readily recorded, which is to say these truths are indeed human and imperfect by nature.At times, this book is horrific and disgusting, and to hate this book is an easy thing to do. But what I kept coming back to is my desire to know the truth that's been lost to history. There is a sense of gratitude that develops during this journey through McCarthy's hell and it is through this gratitude that I found a genuine love for this book. I could not stop hating this story and at the same time I could not deny my love for it. I think that only a writer of McCarthy's integrity and skill could produce the truth of this history, as appallingly human as it actually was....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jan 12, 2014","Jan 29, 2014","Jan 12, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/394535.Blood_Meridian_or_the_Evening_Redness_in_the_West

Therefore, the plot oscillates. When one passion is satiated, the story settles down and plods along in order to align itself with the next chase. It’s during these plot resets that reading The Red and the Black becomes tiring.There is one positive theme to this book, which is the inference that education has a real power to give mobility to people, even those born into a disadvantaged station in life. The main character, Julien Sorel, dedicates his life to reading, but more importantly, he makes an effort to learn from what he reads. It is through these bits of wisdom that he is able to navigate through an early nineteenth century society that is structured around wealth and power. The book also shows that wealth and power occur by chance, but intelligence is fundamentally human and is therefore fundamentally respected or jealously despised.The larger balance of the book, however, describes French society in the 1820s with all its details. Most of these long-winded paragraphs name names of no consequence, detail political intrigues internal to France at the time, and describe wealth so that it is impressive. It takes a lot of words to string together these images. For an 1820s novel, it’s probably to be expected as books, and their words, were the mass-media of the time. But reading this novel in the 2020s makes for a somewhat trudging experience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jan 23, 2022","Feb 06, 2022","Jan 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14662.The_Red_and_the_Black

He writes in terms of feelings and emotions and he understands how these almost-spiritual elements of the human condition can change and coexist all within a moment. And he makes these complexities real by providing the reasons and justifications that his readers need to understand his constantly changing characters. The Ministry of Fear is all this.The story could be considered a simple spy novel that is set in London during the Blitz of WWII. There are agents, and bombing raids and traditional themes of ""us against them."" But to read The Ministry of Fear at this level would be to miss Greene's writing altogether. The spy novel is merely the conveyance mechanism to splay open and explore very human things. Greene looks at pity and selfishness and the ways that these two things dance with each other; Greene explores the ability to love in the absence of loving yourself; and, more typical of Greene, he mixes truth and love in various degrees in an attempt to show that the former may not be essential for happiness in love.

He creates a detailed pLee Billings captures the current state of affairs associated with the search for exoplanets and life beyond our solar system. He creates a detailed picture that includes the history of this search up through its present-day composition, and the final composition resembles a hopeless mess.Past and present, the effort to find life among the stars rolls around on a tabletop landing at various times between the inter-competition of scientists, the bickering of politicians, and a public that loves sensationalism but is apathetic towards the real effort. For now and for the foreseeable future, the search for life and earth-like planets among the stars will remain dormant at the expense of so many other predominately useless things. This effort is waiting for the realization that the initial discovery of life among the stars is something that will only happen once in the history of humanity. Until then, we will need to be satisfied with speculations and theories about grains of dust around distant stars that we will never really see.The subjects covered by this book are amazing. Billings discusses the first attempts by Frank Drake to intercept radio signals from unknown civilizations, the signs of life that will be sought after in the future, and the future spaced-based telescopes that will do the searching. Moreover, each of these topics is covered in detail.Attention is also given to the stages of life's development here on earth and its various bio-signatures. Short of a direct interception of a definitive signal, we only have earth to serve as a certain model for life elsewhere. Other metabolic theories are being investigated but these theories are difficult, if not impossible, to observe and test.Theoretical thought is also given to how much time we have left on this planet and the consensus is far (far) shorter than the total years remaining in the life of the sun. To this end, some discussion is given to greenhouse gasses and their ultimate effect on the planet. This discussion points out the irony of our present-day manmade infusion of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere in relationship to the mechanisms for earth's path towards uninhabitability.As a weakness, Billings' writing may be a bit too passionate for a book about science. I typically read this type of book to find answers to questions and to discover new ideas. I enjoy the process of evaluating situations and considering for myself their relative importance. While the current state of affairs in our search for life is not pleasant, some of the narrative dwells on these unpleasant subjects and results in subtle dramatizations. Additionally, the last chapter of the book goes overboard in its attempts to make a hero out of brilliant scientist. In spite of these weaknesses, however, I cannot deny that Billings delivered the book he intended to write and the book that I wanted to read....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 08, 2013","Dec 26, 2013","Dec 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17707637-five-billion-years-of-solitude

Each subsequent reader takes a turn at assembling a picture that makes unique sense to him or her. For me, The Trial is a book about human suffering, but not about any specific type, cause, or personal affiliation with suffering. Rather, The Trial is about all human suffering everywhere, all at once. It attempts to encompass every hardship and travail in every human life, and then deals with the common effects of suffering as portrayed through the life of Josef K. It's quite an ambitious book, but I thought that its ambition was its greatest weakness.Kafka attempts to idealize suffering in terms of the trial of Josef K., but instead, creates a void at the heart of the book that cannot be felt. Throughout the book, Kafka goes out of his way to avoid providing any specific details of the trial and thus, avoids alluding to any specific type of human suffering. All mentions of charges, proceedings, filings, or arguments are presented in vague and nondescript ways. As such, rather than the trial becoming this powerful force to be feared by humanity, suffering (as symbolized by the trial) becomes an almost powerless force that is somehow suppose to affect us all.The remaining story is about Josef K. and his actions in coping with his affliction of universal human suffering. His journey, however, must also be kept vague and nondescript because he is coping with all of human suffering by coping with his trial. Therefore, symbolism is used to allude to any number of coping mechanisms so that reference to any specific coping mechanism, and any specific type of suffering, can be avoided. My final impression is that this book deals with nothing directly. Yes, it attempts to deal with all of human suffering, but in being so broad-of-scope it also becomes too thin in any sort of real meaning....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 08, 2014","May 18, 2014","Nov 20, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17690.The_Trial

This particular book was prompted by an article written by Hemingway for Esquire in 1935 entitled ""Monologue to the Maestro: A High Seas Letter"" in which he recommends ""all the good Maupassant"". I not sure if Bel-Ami qualifies as ""good Maupassant"" but the similarities in style are not hard to see.Maupassant tells his story with short terse sentences and his dialogue reads like a script from a play. Given that his 1880's contemporaries were James, Hardy, Tolstoy, and the like, this approach to writing struck me as atypical for his time. While Hemingway was probably already enamored with this style of writing by way of his newspaper reporting, Maupassant's style must have reassured Hemingway that fiction could be told in a style similar to factual reporting. Add in Hemingway’s desire to communicate the truth as he knew it in life, and he was well on his way to ""[beating] dead men at what they have done.""As for Bel-Ami, the story is entertaining in that it serves up classic insights into greed, chauvinism, and ambition. The main character, Georges Duroy, never has an opportunity to enjoy life because he is always trying to achieve his own perception of what would be a better life. He is constantly jealous of his own desires and his jealousy prevents him from experiencing any sort of meaningful happiness.The end of this book, however, may be somewhat of a surprise to readers. All that one needs to do to confirm Maupassant’s outcome is to consider the lives of those that have achieved wealth and fame through similar means since the advent of human society....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 10, 2015","Mar 17, 2015","Oct 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/780581.Bel_Ami

In discussing their lives as they existed during these difficult times, they were always staid in their responses, seemingly in direct contrast to the lives and events depicted in Now in November. This is not to say that Now in November is not true to history. In fact, the stoicism expressed by my grandparents while describing their experiences may point out why Now in November is so important to history.My grandparents survived and lived through this period under the protection of their parents. They then lived as young adults through WWII and experienced their own struggles in raising their five sons in the years following the war. If their responses to my questions were casual, then those responses serve to show how benign history can become over time and how obscured history can be in the moment.Now in November is straight-up realism. There is no way for the history depicted in this book to diminish over time and the history it depicts is true to life. The characters love the land for its peaceful beauty and hate it for its selfish ways. The meagerness of farming on mortgaged land is in the forefront of the novel. The story stresses the futility of imagining a better tomorrow when all of one’s labor is consumed by physical and financial survival. And when survival is all that’s being accomplished, devastation is only a matter of chance. Now in November is all this within a very few number of pages.

They are there, but the little neural pathways that serve as the bridges to my consciousness have been removed. All that is left of these memories are general feelings about their disposition as being good, bad, or indifferent. The Travis McGee novels bring to mind a lot of good general feelings and in my younger days, these books served as a gateway into reading. Free Fall in Crimson was a joy to read. There were certain points throughout this book where those neuron bridges snapped into place and trapped memories came into being as if they had never left. The story is interesting, but it's nothing innovative or original beyond the mystery novel that it is.

She was a young girl who Update - 29 JUN 14Something that I did not mention in my  below was how impressed I was with the character, Raven Lee. She was a young girl who was placed in a life that was filled with tragic events and yet she asserts herself as a strong human force in the book. One detail of her character was that she claimed that Rebecca was her favorite book: ""[I've] probably read it a dozen times already"".But why was it her favorite book? My recent reading of Rebecca revealed that the main character was the consummate victim. In contrast, Raven Lee was a natural heroin. She had to live a life filled with hardship, she had to exercise constant assessment of her situation and maintain a constant grip on reality. The main character in Rebecca possibly allowed Raven Lee to escape while at the same time provided her with a sort of affirmation that her approach to life was necessary and right.---Original Review - 16 OCT 13Provinces of Night is a book that treats life with respect. The experiences depicted in this book reflect our day-to-day existence, which is seldom entirely good, but neither is it entirely bad. Life is comprised of moments.It's unfortunate that the moments that affect us most in life tend weigh upon our spirits simply because we cannot ignore them. The angry client and the random rock into the windshield hit us with their full force and effect as they happen. The pleasant moments in life tend to pass us by. You have to look for happiness and being preoccupied by the unpleasant blinds us from finding the good in the events that affect us, and more importantly, the good in the people that surround us.Provinces of Night walks us through life, one event at a time. It slows down our rapid-fire linear existence to succinct moments. And through it all, we find out that there is indeed plenty of bad, but Gay also focuses our attention on the good. In fact, the good things in life (and in this book) may actually outnumber the bad. But this conclusion is a matter of attention, perspective, and attitude; things that the main character, Fleming Bloodworth, has in abundance.Lastly, I offer up a final thought on the four-star rating. I could have easily selected five stars for this book. However, the South is a place that escapes me. I may feel the South in my heritage in much the same way I recognize my existence in the lives of my young nephews. However, I find it to be disingenuous to award perfection to a book that encompasses a place that is central to its being but not adequately understood by this reader....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 19, 2013","Oct 16, 2013","Sep 19, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/294731.Provinces_of_Night

This approach allows for the mainFounding Brothers focuses on short episodes of history rather than the life of a single person or a prolonged event. This approach allows for the main characters consisting of Washington, Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson et. al. to enter and leave each story as scripted by history and leads to enhanced depictions of the interactions that these revolutionary figures had with each other. No single individual is the focus of the book, which makes the stories feel more complete as each one comes to its end.At the same time, however, the approach or the writing did not bring the Founding Fathers any closer to being human in spite of the fact that the book’s title could be taken to imply the opposite. The key characters of the Revolution all tend to keep their politically deified personas. They moved through each story as the wise men in the Romanesque togas that are depicted on the murals inside the National Archives. Before reading Founding Brothers I was hoping for a more ‘brotherly’ look at the characters, meaning depictions that were closer to being human. The stories did spark a desire for further reading. They brought to light John Adam’s pragmatic realism and emphasized Thomas Jefferson’s utopian dreams. All of the stories suggested a far more contentious political climate at the very start of the nation and illuminated parallels in today’s political climate. It was tempting, after reading Founding Brothers, to conclude that our present-day political conflicts will also pass into history, but the stories brought to light fundamental differences between today's political impasses and those faced at the birth of the nation.

Within The Cruel Sea these extremes present themselves as unimaginable situations; situations that humans must live through in order to survive. Situations where every action, every decision, is absolutely right regardless of the judgments that may be imposed after the fact, in a relative calm, or in a comparative sanctuary of safety.This book focuses on humans that are thrown into war from their peacetime lives. Accountants, bankers, journalists, cargo ship captains, pension seeking peacetime sailors, are all placed in a war that they, as individuals, had very little to do with its inception. From there, the changes in the characters are illustrated through the most extreme of circumstances and the ever-accumulating risk associated with time. Decisions are made and sacrifices are suffered. The enemy becomes transformed from humans with differing points of view into mere objects of resistance: worthy of a hatred that can only be bestowed upon the most inhuman of threats. And the defenders are transformed into machines that are virtually unaware of the hatred that they display.The book serves to bring to life the historical accounts of the war, but it also opens up parallels that exist in our current lives. In the hear-and-now, stresses are also ever-present and they accumulate with time. We eventually lose our peace-of-mind to a constant and continuing struggle.Today's economic participants are perpetually at sea and failure may very well be a sort of virtual death. Our livelihood, which is often synonymous with life itself, can be stolen by seemingly inhuman forces, which are easily hated. Our home ports are but a fleeting reprieve, sometimes despised for the temporary shelter that they represent. And we are constantly cast adrift, at sea, at war, again and again.The criticisms that I have for The Cruel Sea are not numerous. They ride below the surface of the book, but they are still there. They include an inability on the part of Monsarrat to fully hit home with the important themes of the book. He seems too polite and he stops short of making you put the book down, look away, and to say (if I may borrow an appropriate phrase) you son of a bitch. The other shortcoming is distraction. There are subplots that do not contribute much to the story and seem to cater to more popular themes. However, even with these flaws, this book still stands on its own, offering insights into life at the extremes of human existence....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 20, 2013","Nov 14, 2013","Jul 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6661951-the-cruel-sea

It’s a warm blanket that has been pieced together to suit our way of life and our collective needs. Society, keeps us safe, wards off isolation, and also defines the possibilities of our success. But society is not tailor-made. It is lumpy where it’s been stretched and binding in the places that have never been touched. Regardless of who we are, however, we must live with the fit that society affords us or suffer the consequences of living without its collective warmth.From Here to Eternity use the world of the Army as it existed pre-draft, pre-WWII, to recreate a small, deeply personalize model of society. The Army, with all of its politics, vices, egotistical influences, and rules interacts with the two main characters in ways that echo our modern-day interactions with society. And it’s this miniaturization effect that intensifies this theme and brings the irregular fit of their blanket into a modern-day context.The two main characters serve to illustrate the two extremes of human-societal interactions. On one side of the extreme, Sgt. Warden exemplifies the rewards that society bestows upon those that adhere to its rules while also depicting the parts of our humanity that we must give up (or have taken away) while achieving society’s expectations.Pvt. Prewitt exemplifies the other extreme. Prewitt is driven by his personal need to be true to himself regardless of expectations. Rather than try to pull the lumpy parts of the blanket over him to create a better fit, he simply throws the blanket off, accepts the consequences, and lives true to his convictions. Prewitt exemplifies the punishment that society doles out to its non-conformists.Warden and Prewitt; both men know instinctively who they are. Not only do they suffer their individual fates but they also suffer their desires to be more like each other. Prewitt desires the collective warmth but cannot deny his true self. Warden desires to live as his true self but cannot give up the rewards that society has bestowed upon him. By the end of the book, you are left to evaluate the suffering that both men endure and you are left to wonder if we, as individuals, will ever be at peace amongst our collective selves.And so it goes for all of us, from here to the end of time....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jun 30, 2013","Aug 16, 2013","Jun 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/116114.From_Here_to_Eternity

Even when the personWriting a biography about a person that lived 2,000 years ago is a risky endeavor for anyone who strives for historical accuracy. Even when the person is Augustus Caesar, the known facts predominantly consist of isolated events of macro importance or fragments of writing that have lost much of their context. As is the case with Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor, extensive speculation is required to bring a semblance of life to the factual islands that dot the historical timeline.The underlying ambiguity begs the need for the reader keep at hand a small pinch of salt to be taken one grain at a time as they proceed through the book. To Everitt’s credit, he's dedicated his career to writing on ancient people and civilizations including a biography on one of Augustus’ contemporaries, Cicero. He has also written books on the rise of Rome and on the life of one other Roman emperor, Hadrain. From this perspective, it’s probable that Everitt’s speculations are as good as they get. But nonetheless, too many facts will never be known.The impression of Augustus that Everitt imparts is one of measured control. Augustus is presented as the emperor that had the loyalty of the entire Roman army at his command, but recognized the need to rule through subtle means. He had the wisdom to be inclusive of his opponents in the formulation of ideas. And he often took extended periods of time to achieve his goals so that others would have time to recognize the purpose of his policies. In short, his public governance seems to have effectively resisted the absolute corruption that accompanies absolute power (take grain of salt here).As for collaboration, I have no other expert opinions to offer. I read Everitt’s biography in an attempt to verify John Williams’ historical fiction Augustus. Both Everitt and Williams agree on an Augustus Caesar that lead through wisdom rather than force. Then there is my uninformed opinion of Augustus Caesar that was instilled in me during my elementary school days so long ago; that Augustus was the Roman emperor who ushered in a period of peace that lasted 200 years. While I know now that this far from the truth from a world perspective, both Everitt and Williams suggest that this may be somewhat true for the Romans living in the Rome that was transformed by Augustus Caesar (take grain of salt here)....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 08, 2017","Oct 18, 2017","Jun 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/89230.Augustus

Greene was aware that a writer had great power over the worlds he created. He knew that a writer could manipulate his stories and his characters in order to enhance the thrill of the read. So when one reads The End of the Affair they experience a different approach to writing than the approach used by Greene in Brighton Rock. Even though both books are entertaining, the latter is one of Greene’s entertainments because of the obvious manipulations used by Greene to create a film noir feel to the work.Then we have Pronto, which is highly entertaining and had me flipping through pages. Like Brighton Rock the book is character-driven and filled with organized crime figures, hit-men, mobsters, bookies, and a diligent investigator, Raylan Givens. But this is not an entertainment and the difference is Leonard's deep respect for reality.Leonard creates his world, populates it with his characters and then steps back, almost as if to see what happens. By the end of the book, you feel as if Leonard is just as amazed at the ending as the reader.The characters are human, imperfect, and unpredictable. They are just as likely to act upon their emotions as they are their own reasoning, and the results of their decisions are never conclusive. Their lives are interesting and their fates cannot be predicted.

I once thought of Leonard as a solid character writer. Every character that he has brought to life has provided hours of entertainment through their unique characteristics. He has never failed to tell a good story.But I also enjoy books with more than just a good story. I like books that reach out from the page, as Graham Greene often does, with insights to think about and consider:“The truth has never been of any real value to any human being - it is a symbol for the mathematicians and philosophers to pursue. In human relations kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths” -GGThis time, while reading Cuba Libre, I realized that Leonard does the same thing, but he is not as overt. If Leonard wants to convey such insight, he does so. But he does it through his characters, through their actions and dialogue without the need to pause for such commentary. It is this implicit, character-based insight that I found so intriguing in this, my fifth Leonard book. And it is this implicit approach that keeps the characters out in front of the story, where the action is taking place, without a need to pause as Green is known to do. Cuba Libre itself is a unique adventure. Leonard takes time, place and (of course) characters and throws them all together. Each character has a kindness about them that is contrasted with a dark past. Towards the end, each of the characters was capable and suspect of doing the very opposite of their eventual acts. Thus, a mystery was formed, not by withholding some crucial piece of information, but through the depiction of human nature all on its own. In the end, hate, love, forgiveness, and greed swirl around within every character such that anything is possible....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 06, 2016","Feb 25, 2016","May 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1061855.Cuba_Libre

The first is a vivid story of the desert, the harsh yet rich environment that is truly just as beautiful as any other natural landscape including forests, oceans, or meadows. Abbey captures the beauty and the terror of this environment in his narrative and illustrates its effects on Abbey, and by extension, on all of us. The insights and knowledge that Abbey gained while living alone within this very bleak environment brings vibrancy to the endless miles of the seemingly lifeless expanses of heat, rock, and thorns that comprise the American Southwest. It is this aspect of Desert Solitaire that I very much enjoyed.The second aspect of this book could be considered a complete reversal of the first perspective. Rather than a narrative that presents the desert's effects on man, this second perspective presents a narrative on man's effects on the desert and Abbey's own solutions to these man-made problems. It is this second aspect of Desert Solitaire that grates on reason and compromises the continuity of the book.In thinking about why I found this second aspect of Desert Solitaire so grating, I found Abbey's opinions and his solutions to be incredibly simple. He develops plans to solve problems but stops short of addressing any of the concerns of people that do not fit into his solutions. Those people must simply exist without redress, endure suffrage, or get with his program as best they can. Abbey's perceptions and his solutions are as simple and unforgiving as those of nature's. Mankind, however, is anything but simple, and we have learned that to be as unforgiving as nature represents the worst that we have to offer to the world.The best parts of this book, which comprise most of the book, should still not be missed. If Abbey's opinions of society limit his views to the trees, and not the forest, then it is this same focused characteristic that affords Abbey the ability to capture the desert in exquisite detail. His narratives allows people to experience the desert without the oppressive heat, it serves as a geographical atlas of places to explore, it captures the desert's existential qualities in words, and it presents a solid case for why the harshness of the desert is most in tune with the true nature of humanity. Just keep a little understanding and tolerance in mind as you enjoy your adventure through a land that is seldom seen for what it truly is....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 28, 2013","Jun 09, 2013","Apr 02, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/214614.Desert_Solitaire

That was my general impreWhen eating chips and salsa, the chips become a simple conveyance mechanism for the savory salsa to be carried to the mouth. That was my general impression of East of Eden. Steinbeck needed a story to convey the sights, feelings, and environment of his beloved childhood hometown of Salinas, California, and its surrounding countryside to his readers. To this end, East of Eden is an impersonal autobiography of time and place.This autobiographical element, told with writing that simply feels like it is filled with sincere truth, reminded me of the landscapes of California, which are shockingly beautiful and oftentimes hidden. Our freeways often take flat-land routes between major cities, but paralleling many of these routes are the coastal mountains or the Sierra Nevadas. Dare to take any small two-lane road off towards the mountains and Steinbeck’s countryside will suddenly appear over a seemingly ordinary hill. It’s a land filled with golden fields of grass, dried out wooden barns, and an occasional windmill of the old west variety. And for about two months of the year, these hill become as green as Ireland transplanted.My teenage years were spent entering and leaving this seemingly magical California environment as I would drive from Los Angeles to the small goldrush town of Sonora to visit my retired grandparents. East of Eden brought this land back to life in my memories making the setting the best part of the book. This was the salsa.Then there’s the story, which was not that impressive. Steinbeck takes a well known story from the Bible and attempts to make the case that it’s universal. He uses some obvious symbolism in the naming of his characters and then takes them through a story that is made to resemble the original. The choices that his characters make along the way are predestined from the start. This leaves his characters without an ability to rise above themselves and the randomness of life is prevented from interfering in their fate. Again, Steinbeck’s writing is beautiful, but his story has all the flavor of the corn chip in need of some salsa....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 10, 2022","Jul 29, 2022","Jan 04, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden

Bass strives to pull off the layers that life uses to cover itself up. Political rhetoric intended to pacify, positive spins intended to manipulate, romantic sentiments intended to persuade, are all left somewhere outside of the front and back covers of Oil Notes, and what remains are hard little diamonds of reality. At face value Oil Notes eludes to its own realities by describing the geological layers, strata, and formations that trap the elusive prize of oil far below the surface of our planet.

I have a preconception that they will be self-serving, arrogant, and opinionated. What It Is Like to Go to War proved to be an exception. While possibly a bit too spiritual to be realistically applied to the multitude of teens that typically occupy our trenches in times of war, the book was predominantly dead-on serious and true. What It Is Like to Go to War is written in a genuinely honest tone. There is a degree of self-degradation made in an effort to illustrate the true upside-down, inside-out world that was combat in Vietnam. There are stories that are not favorable to Marlantes which were included to illustrate the human condition under extreme stress. There is reasonable introspective on what could be done to lessen the impact to the soldiers dumped back into society after their usefulness in violence and killing has been exhausted. And finally, there is thoughtful consideration of what we, as humans, will ultimately become with respect to the act of war.Overall, we need books like this for the record. We’ve reached a time when the unfiltered personal experiences of Vietnam are quickly fading forever away. When only the history remains of that conflict we will sit in danger of romanticizing it, justifying it, and repeating it. Knowing that this book exists provides some assurance that the raw human experience will be remembered along side the dry facts of history.

There is no physical science associated with Campbell’s assertions but they are based on an understanding of multiple cultures spanning millennia. And his conclusions are based on points in common between humans that lived in relative isolation from one another in terms of both time and geography.The result of Campbell's approach is a book filled with lessons of life that speak to some sort of living center within me. His assertions simply feel right, probably because I am the same sort of human being that has lived on this planet for the last 50,000 years. I think that another GR friend described the effect best by saying that so many of these ideas are just second nature now.Some of the timeless topics that are addressed by Campbell include the harsh realities of life, love and marriage and what marriage is, and the personal fulfillment associated with giving oneself over to the service of a higher cause. There are at least a dozen of other themes that are discussed between Campbell and Moyers, all of which speak to life as it is.This is possibly a four star book given that the transcript style of the book results, at times, in lines-of-thought becoming tangential. However, as a source of wisdom applicable to so many aspects if life, this book is the best that I've read, so far.

Maybe it's because stories such as Dirty Work require the reader to develop deep sympathetic feelings for the main characters. In fact, the impact of the ending of Dirty Work will be proportional to the sympathy felt for the two main characters and every part of this story is geared towards developing those sympathetic feelings.From my perspective, a soldier that comes home as a victim of war is a tragic thing but wallowing in ones own tragedy for years without end is a bit annoying. Does it happen? Yes, but life is so full of opportunities that to focus on only one, the opportunity to forever remain a victim, seems pointless. Brown captures this meaningless existence perfectly, describes the mental distractions that are used to make this type of existence endurable, and serves up an ending consistent with each character’s individual path towards self-destruction.And there lies the best part of this book in that the writing was outstanding. I enjoy writers that capture the heart of an instant with every sentence. Brown not only accomplishes this with the words he uses, but also with the structure of the book itself. He strategically uses the length of chapters to emphasize their importance as well as the movement of time. The setting is also expertly minimized such that the characters and their lives are the singular focus in the here-and-now.I’m not yet done with Brown.

While I seem to be obsessed with searching out that next morsel of wisdom or insight from my next book, I also need to remember that I would not be the book-geek that I am today if it were not for John D. MacDonald’s Travis McGee series and the enjoyment that I drew from those mystery novels. But there is more here for readers that are indeed looking for that next morsel of wisdom or insight. Our country is a diverse place that is comprised of many geographical locations and each of these regions has its own distinct culture. In visiting these places we may be amazed by the food, but eating green chili in New Mexico is only a clue to the deeper feelings and mannerisms of those that actually live there. The same must be true for the South.The Moonshine War illustrates aspects of Southern culture. For those that view the South from afar, like me, the story highlights an approach to life that finds enjoyment in the smallest of things. Things like family, neighbors, serenity, and moonshine take precedence over things like Facebook, ‘those people next door,’ happy hour, and Chivas Regal Scotch. It’s the depiction of this way of life that makes me wonder if more of life can be enjoyed in the absence of everything else that is desired by other cultures in other regions, and contemplation is the mark of a good story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 18, 2013","May 24, 2013","Jul 15, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/288966.The_Moonshine_War

And by 'knowing' these things, I mean that at some point in time we should have imagined these ideas, considered and reconsidered the evidence, consulted the experts, and decided that these things are true (or dismissed them as false).The title, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, may not seem to be a book that would allow someone to know something, but it is. The content is a step-by-step presentation of a truth: that a group of humans who just happened to be in the vicinity of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers at the end of the last ice age, approximately 12,000 years ago, were just lucky. They were at the right place, at the right time, and given that all humans at that time were hunter-gatherers, these particular humans could not have failed to become more technologically advanced than all other humans everywhere else in the world. But to simply state this idea as fact (as I just did) is not enough and should not be enough. Diamond presents his case, questions his own evidence, and demonstrates his conclusions. He formulates a model and demonstrates that this model has played out on smaller regional scales on every continent inhabited by humans. Diamond pulls in pieces of evidence from archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, botany, and other sciences, and by the end of the book, he indeed presents something that everybody should know.The only warning I have to potential readers is that Diamond succeeds in his stated objective. A more exacting title for this book would have been, A Theory on the Evolution of Human Societies (but who would've read that?). Unlike chemistry, where a reaction is confirmed through concise experimentation, history is subjective. Historical theories can gain traction based on the slimmest of evidence. For this reason, Diamond strives to build a preponderance of evidence, which ultimately proves his point, but this also makes for a long and sometimes repetitive book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 15, 2014","Apr 06, 2014","Jun 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel

The Stars and Stripes fly in front of doorways; we’re captivated by red-tinted aerial images with crosshairs lined up on buildings that disappear in silent symmetrical clouds of dust; and if troops are lost in the conflict, then they certainly died in an effort to keep America free.The choice to use our armed forces to enact US policy, however, is far more septic. To begin, our own perceptions of our involvement can be disturbed by the realities of war. Our personal justifications for our nation’s actions must be balanced against the lives of our sons, the extreme costs of deployment, and, at times, changes in reasoning. But more than those things, our justifications should also include a real concern for those that will have to live through our decision to wage war.In my observations of the invasion of Iraq, this real concern was minimized and avoided. Very little attention was given to what our flag would mean to a country of people that have lived through centuries of repeated occupations. Very few among us thought about the plight of the people that lived next door to the buildings that evaporated on our TV screens. And discussions regarding the scores of Iraqis that died for every reported American death seldom occurred.Night Draws Near covers this neglected concern. Anthony Shadid roamed independently through Iraq, completely detached from US forces, and interviewed those that were subjected to the American invasion and occupation. His reports are non-biased and are certainly not aimed at providing positive outlooks. He searched out and interviewed all factions of the population including religious zealots, tribal leaders, Muslim clerics, and the newly-coined Iraqi security forces. Shadid also interviewed a wide cross-section of the Iraqi population, from the wealthy to the poor, from professionals to laborers and to the unemployed. The contents of his interviews are not surprising and in fact, they reveal realities that could have been avoided if we, as a nation, had formulated a meaningful plan for peace following our invasion of this ancient land....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 06, 2012","Oct 15, 2012","May 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4362.Night_Draws_Near

The first half of the book draws you in. It provides some very true reasons as to why individuals go to war. It explores individual courage and base-human behavior while under the stress of potential death from an ever-present, seldom seen enemy. It illustrates how valuable life can be to a bunch of kids who were uprooted from their safe and secure childhoods and thrown into jungle the likes of which where never before imagined. It depicts how meaningless death can be and it describes the collapse in our moral psyche that can occur when life is traded at such barging prices.The book then continues with O'Brien's own mid-book admission that many (but not all) of the details, characters, and events are indeed fictitious. At the same time, many of his stories are told in the first person and refer to O’Brien by name. It's a bit of a mystery as to why O’Brien interjected this fact into the middle of a fictitious book that presents events in a factual way. At this point, subsequent stories were read with a distracting inquiry into separating truth from fiction.

Give me an inch of enthusiasm for engineering and I can throw back a mile's worth of discussion regarding hydrology, hydraulics, and past projects. By opening Pale Blue Dot, the reader might as well be asking Sagan about his career as a scientist. And unlike engineering, Sagan's career has been amazing.For most inquisitors, and probably to the discouragement of Sagan, his reply of scientific knowledge would likely send the casual conversationalist looking for a different partner. However, for a few, Sagan's reply signals an opportunity to discover the truth about our existence and to learn about the realities that surround us. So with the passion of a scientist, Sagan tells us about where we all collectively live and continues with the passion of a human to explain why our days here on Earth are numbered.The result is an impassioned narrative told by man that holds the truth in the highest level of regard. While not an autobiography in the traditional sense, Pale Blue Dot is an account of Sagan's scientific life, boiled down to the essentials that gave his life purpose and the message that he wanted to send forth into humanity's future.As for content, Pale Blue Dot presents a relatively concise point in time. The narrative presents a summary of humanity's knowledge of our home world, our fellow planets, and their moons as we knew them near the end Sagan's life. But more importantly to Sagan, this information is what humanity knew when we collectively achieved the technological enlightenment needed to affect our own extinction.Sagan, the eternal scientist, also presents his hope for our future in true scientific fashion. While the future cannot be known, qualitative factors that could affect our future are presented and weighed by Sagan. He presents the evidence against us but he also presents the ideas needed to move beyond this perilous time in our existence....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 19, 2013","Apr 07, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61663.Pale_Blue_Dot

And for that reason, I tend to stay away from autobiographies. After all, the temptation for the writer to sculpt events and decisions is always at hand. And oftentimes the reader is deliberately (and obviously) led by the writer to understand the writer's life in terms of the writer's own beliefs. I need more objectivity than that in a supposed book of fact.Edward Young, however, manages to apply a certain discipline to his writing. His language is calm and matter-of-fact but he also communicates the nervousness and excitement of his engagements in staid terms. He realizes that the facts of a situation will be more than enough to communicate the emotions associated with the events. He refers often to his logbooks and at times lets events be described solely from excerpts from his logs. And one of the most impressive aspects of his story is that Young describes his mistakes and shortcomings on par with all of the events that transpired during his service.Overall, my impression is one of a competent and complete record of a submariner's life during WWII. Young comes across as an ordinary human doing the best job he could do during a time when humanity was out to destroy itself.And lastly, this is a book fits into a collection of books that provide accounts of humans that journey out beyond the horizon and into the sea. This book fits right into place along side such books as Dana's Two Years Before the Mast and Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea. All of these books depict real life at sea under conditions and times when courses were determined by land sightings, dead reckoning, and sextant sightings on the stars.

The middle class were The quality of life for the typical laborer and his family at the turn of the 20th Century was filled with hardship and strife. The middle class were a select few at this point in history and for the most part, the population consisted of those with wealth and those without much of anything beyond the subsistence provided by their work. By the middle of this same century, unions and government had affected remarkable changes in the structure of society: the unskilled laborer was largely able to achieve an equitable share of comfort and security for his family and the wealthy were (somehow) still wealthy.Alice Adams is a novel that checks in on the middle class transformation as it existed in the 1920s. It examines the struggles of a newly emerging middle class and the difficulties experienced by those that asserted their presence among the old guard of capitalism: the upper class. Due to her father’s tireless work and servitude to a wealthy store owner, Alice Adams feels her potential to achieve upper class acceptance. Her mother, who is mildly manic towards this possibility, relentlessly pushes Alice towards this goal and relentlessly pushes Alice’s father to achieve more towards this end.On the opposing side of the story, there is the upper class. The capitalists who reward servitude and loyalty based solely upon their own perception of fairness. For them, the question of compensation is one of incremental losses, and the minimizing of losses is seen as a principal duty. They will exert a disproportional amount of energy simply to keep crumbs from being taken from their many loaves of bread. And these same perceptions and efforts work to keep the people of the upper class in-step with these traditions.Alice provides a point of light during this struggle. She is endearing because she is aware of the circumstances of her family’s struggles even while participating in them. She anticipates the nature of the resistance to be applied towards her from those that are already at the top of the social ladder, and she also knows the consequences of failure. She is a realist; an active fighter that refuses to be a victim and by the end of the book, I felt a sense of pride for her. The book is appropriately titled.I enjoy books that focus on class struggles. I think that the society we have today and the luxuries that are at the command of the middle class are a result of efforts exerted by those that have faded from prominence and life itself. Alice Adams gives a voice to this struggle and Alice Adams the character serves as a model of the type of person that is largely responsible for what the middle class was ultimately to become....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 23, 2016","Feb 11, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/525818.Alice_Adams

But its uniqueness resides not in its glorification of heroics, but rather in how it illuminates the true human experiences of war in general, and the specific human experiences of war in Vietnam. Yes, there are battles and destruction and gruesome deaths occur, but none of this happens in a vacuum of simple bravery and aggression. Heroism does not exist without fear, or a total detachment from humanity followed by an anguished reintegration. The book depicts the shameful reality that killing the enemy can serve as a sort of release. The common fighting soldiers (and Marines) were thrown into insane situations and the requirement to kill the enemy without pause or responsibility allowed them a mechanism for coping with the impossible while also keeping themselves alive. While this may not be the healthiest of therapies, at the time it was real and true to themselves.Another aspect of Matterhorn is that it captures elements of race relations as they were in America at the time of the conflict, which were subsequently transplanted to the war zone. However, unlike at home, the wartime setting allowed for succinct cessations of racial tension. As soldiers entered the jungle, racism only served to threaten their teamwork and thus, their survival. It was these temporary breaks in racial tensions that allowed for race to be explored as a human condition. Discussions became possible and understandings were reached. And while these understandings tended to disappear as the threat to life diminished, they demonstrated that genuine understandings are possible.From a big-picture perspective, Matterhorn looks at the war's political setting. It's been said that all wars, no matter what side one's perspective may reside upon, are defensive; or at least made to be so by political spin. The American war in Vietnam was no different and required a large dose of political spin to make it defensive. The politics of the conflict, however, extended beyond the national scale and reached the organizational structure of the US military.The military was conditioned by every previous conflict prior to Vietnam to fighting wars against a defined enemy at a defined location. Territory once won was kept. This was not the case in this conflict. This new environment of warfare made the traditional methods of measuring the success of military operations obsolete. As a consequence, the military needed to rely upon political spin to make successes seem real, not only for the military as a whole, but for the commanders that needed successes to advance their careers. Thus, those who had no interest in advancing to the upper levels of a military career, i.e. the common draftees, the low-level reserve officers, and obedient career soldiers, found themselves fighting a political war for political reasons put forth by those in charge of its execution. This aspect of the Vietnam War is another construct of the time and place that is captured in Matterhorn. Matterhorn is a complex book that looks at a complex reality. And yet Marlantes weaves these complexities into meaningful entertainment from beginning to end. I think that every war has its novel; that one book that captures the heart of the conflict. For me, for now, Matterhorn belongs to Vietnam....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 27, 2017","May 13, 2017","Feb 10, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6411016-matterhorn

The air we breathe and the water we drink have been shaped by the desires of millions of people into the relatively clean and healthy stuff that we need. As we examine this force, we find that it scales down with our efforts. We find that it is inescapable and that its bonds are ever-present. Even between two perfect strangers passing each other on the street there are obligations.The Moon and Sixpence is a story that covers the spectrum of this force. It explores our effects on the vast expanses of society and on the smallest, most intimate of relationships. It shows how selfish decisions and actions, no matter how free of evil intent, are often laced with dire consequences for others. As such, The Moon and Sixpence brings to light a reality: we live in an ironically oppressive world.It is ironic that our creativity brought forth this unseen force while at the same time its purpose represses our creativity. We are not free to exercise our ideas without some amount of compromise or consideration. We simply cannot cook meth in our RV as a creative solution to our financial problems, nor can we abandon our families in order to fulfill our creative desires. The force will ultimately intervene and will strive to curb those creative acts in response to our collective needs.But if we made this force, don't we have a right to unmake it, at least our own small part of it? Sometimes, an oppressed creativity leads nowhere. And if we are going nowhere in this world, if we are forbidden to use our minds for what they are truly engineered to do, then living becomes lifeless. Under such conditions, merely existing for a reward as luminous as the moon is meaningless in comparison to creating something for a small handful of pennies.

Not unlike each of us, in our own way, tMerton’s autobiography is the story of his quest to understand life and to give it some semblance of purpose. Not unlike each of us, in our own way, trying to develop a philosophy that will provide us the seeds of meaning to the infinite number of events that will assail us between now and the end of our days. If this was all that Merton accomplished in The Seven Story Mountain, then this would not be the book that it is. In my mind, Merton crosses the line. He selfishly places his quest above everybody else’s and makes his form of enlightenment one that the entire world should aspire to. The problem lies in the fact that no one’s quest to understand life is better or more righteous than the quests pursued by any one of us (except for the axe-murderers among us).This central theme of selfishness is the issue that pushed this book away from me even though Merton’s selfishness may not have been of his own choosing. His mother died at the age of 8 and his father was more interested in his art than he was his son’s life until he died when Merton was 15. At about that time, Merton was turned loose on the world with a trust fund that allowed him to pursue his own interests without a need (or a desire) to contribute to anything or anyone.During the next ten years Merton simply indulges himself in himself and he finds the emptiness that can develop from true selfishness. Then, rather than searching for a cause and cure for the emptiness in his life, he finds a justification and a substitution. Merton simply substitutes a faith in a higher power for the emptiness that encompasses his life, and with this transformation he is free to continue his self-indulgences with a sense of righteousness that is reinforced by the Catholic Church.After Merton’s initial transformation, when threatened with the prospects of service to his surrounding community and when threatened with the possibility of military service in World War II, he yet again searches for an even deeper faith. This subsequent search results in his true calling to the Trappist monastery, where his continued ability to self-indulge in himself is permanently assured.In the end, Merton may have found a way to convince himself that he has made atonements for his selfishness. However, at the same time, he continues to satisfy his own selfish desires. It's this deep-rooted and unresolved conflict in Merton’s character that shows itself as a bitterness that pervades the entirety of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Feb 06, 2012","Feb 25, 2012","Jan 16, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175078.The_Seven_Storey_Mountain

The ones that show Europe being devoured by a spreading blot of black ink seeping into a map. Make no mistake, Hitler was deranged but The Meaning of Hitler defined that derangement. The book presents his various thought processes, defines the mistakes in his conclusions, separates out his accomplishments and success, and details his crimes. By the end of the book, Hitler is rationally dissected into a certain number of succinct ideas that guided his life and his decisions, as heinous as they were.One of greatest attributes of this book is that the analysis is completed in only 165 pages. There is no need to spend weeks inside the mind of Hitler while entangled in the details of Nazi Germany. However, the author does assume that the reader has a casual understanding of historical events during the time period spanning the two world wars. The book is woven into this understanding and very few words are dedicated to explaining key events or the general political settings that existed during this time period. The knowledge required is not vast nor is it essential, but it does contribute to a greater comprehension of the facts that define Hitler.And lastly, it’s been my observation that the myth of Hitler will forever be tied to his name, his image, and his deeds. The mere mention of his name often drives an emotional response that precedes the repulsion that would otherwise takes place based on the facts that comprised the man. I think that there is a danger with this sort of reaction wherein a myth, as evil as it is, determines our behavior. When we condemn Hitler based on myth alone, we disregard the real elements of the myth that are eternal, which are the facts. So much so that our future judgments of others may lead us to conclude that no one could possibly be as evil as Hitler seems, while in fact someone could indeed be as just as evil as Hitler actually was....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 09, 2012","Jul 14, 2012","Dec 29, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4544192-the-meaning-of-hitler

Like all humans that lived through World War IA Soldier of the Great War is the story of Alessandro Giuliani’s life, which spans a total of 64 years. Like all humans that lived through World War I, the Great War, Alessandro’s attitudes, philosophy, and perspectives are dramatically molded through his experiences during that tumultuous time. But other life events occur that shape Alessandro before and after the Great War, and these too are covered throughout this novel.At age 74, Alesando proceeds to tell his life experiences to his young walking companion, the 17-year-old Nicolò Sambucca. Helprin asserts that those that have lived and died within our lifetime achieve a sort of immortality through their continued remembrance. Thus, In his final days Alesandro attempts to secure immortality for all those that he once knew and loved by placing his memories into the mind of his young companion.These main themes make this book a very heartfelt experience, but there were some problems. Alessandro’s life experiences flash in and out throughout the novel. As such, the book is highly episodic and a bit choppy. Alessandro’s stories start mid-course, cruise through their main point, and sometimes abruptly end without transition to the next episode of his life. The stories themselves were well written, but the feeling of a single coherent novel was often missing.The novel is also overly long. Helprin has a tendency to be very verbose in his descriptions of things. His main character is made to be a professor of aesthetics, which gives Helprin free license to describe in great detail just about everything that he sees and experiences. Of the 900+ pages, I estimate that a third or more of these pages are dedicated to these aesthetic passages, which becomes tiring towards the end.That’s not to say, however, that these long passages are completely without merit. There were times when Helprin would spiral down through one of his long descriptions and then arrive at a sentence or two containing a fundamental truth about life.

The journey is reThis marks the end of a 12-year long reading odyssey through every Jack London short story read in the order that they were written. The journey is representative of a walk through London’s life.London constantly sought adventure. At first, his journeys were purposed towards his own survival. Then after his success, his journeys represented his effort to push his human existence towards its limits. In both cases, he seemed to sense that creating reality in words required a level of physical and emotional experiences that far exceeded those of everyday life. Thus, his stories mostly follow follow the path of his life. His first story, ""Typhoon Off the Coast of Japan,"" echoes his time as a lowly seaman working on a sealer in the northern Pacific. From there, the stories continue on through his Northland tales, South Sea tales, urban life stories, and Hawaiian-focused tales. That’s not to say, however, that London did not occasionally jump back to previous themes at the request of specific buyers.The sale of his material seems to have been the primary focus of his writing. He possessed a natural talent for writing, but his early pursuits were spent honing that talent into a marketable product, almost to his own demise. He initially loved writing because he dreamed that it would elevate him out of the abys of poverty. Upon his success, he loved writing because it made that dream come true.The entrepreneurial approach to his craft ultimately made him very wealthy. And occasionally, his talent produced a timeless gem. If I were given the chance to assemble a collection of the best of Jack London stories, they would include these 19 out of the 192 stories that he wrote.184.) ""The Red One""175.) ""By The Turtles of Tasman!""169.) ""A Little Account with Swithin Hall""149.) ""The Night-Born""147.) “A Piece of Steak”143.) ""The Strength of the Strong""134.) ""Aloha Oe""132.) “Koolau the Leper”129.) ""Chinago""122.) ""To Build a Fire"" (v2)113.) ""Finis""109.) ""The Apostate""104.) ""The Unexpected""98.) ""Love of Life""87.) ""The League of the Old Men""52.) ""The Law of Life""48.) ""The God of His Fathers""35.) ""The Wisdom of the Trail""19.) ""The White Silence""Of the above-listed stories, my supreme favorite is ""The Law of Life."" In that story, London captures a harsh reality and places it on the page. There is no sense of moderation for the sake of public acceptability and it may be telling that it was written in the midst of a group of Northland tales that were above average in their content. As such, the story may represent the peak of London’s writing career as an artist. The other outstanding stories that followed “The Law of Life” seem to be more isolated within the bulk of his work.The most noteworthy of the best-of stories would be ""The Red One."" Not only does it focus on the realism of the South Sea, it is also ventures into a light-weight version of science fiction. Add to this its gallows humor and it becomes a sort of monument that demonstrates London’s talent.Then there is the racism that explicitly finds its way into many of London’s stories. This revolting aspect of his writing indeed threatens its long-term virility. As society continually atones for its mistakes, this aspect of London’s writing will become evermore repulsive than it is now. But therein lies the reason for its presence.London’s goal in writing was to capture life as it was during his time. London was indeed a racist, but his views were a reflection of society as it existed in his day. Society bought his stories and London became exceeding wealthy because of it, racism included. Therefore, this aspect of his writing should be used as a measuring point from which society can see where we once were, how far we have come, and where we are headed with respect to this terrible attribute.Fortunately, London’s stories are in the public domain and are widely accessible on-line as individual stories. Alternatively, digital collections of his stories are also available from the mega on-line retailer for very nominal amounts. London is worth reading, and in my mind he sits on a generational path of realists that spans backwards and forwards through time, through him.4 stars for the full body of work, not because of content but because these stories could not be written today, or at any other time in the future. London was so subtle in capturing his reality that he put into words things that could only be captured at the time he lived. Anyone else with the idea to write these stories today would certainly come up short.---Individual Story Ratings: 19 SEP 11 Through 02 SEP 23Individual Story Reviews: 19 SEP 11 Through 02 SEP 23...more",Notes are private!,1,57,1,"Sep 18, 2011","Sep 03, 2023","Sep 18, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175540.The_Collected_Short_Stories_Of_Jack_London

For the foot soldier, these reasons are often close-at-hand: inhuman circumstances, survival, and duty all play their parts.But place the writer 20,000 feet in the air, where the war is conducted almost by exchanges of luck between targets that are miles apart, and that perspective changes. From 20,000 feet, entire countries could be seen and the inhumanity of war was rarely experienced firsthand, and even then not for very long. It is this unique perspective of war that Stiles brings to his readers.From that big-world perspective, while flying missions that sometimes took upwards of 10 hours to complete, a significant amount of time was at hand. Even while anti-aircraft artillery attempted to end their existence, there was not a lot for the B-17 pilots to do other than to try to stay grouped together so that safety could be had in numbers. Stiles used this time, as any human would do, to consider life under these circumstances. Stiles contemplated the ideas behind the war. He tried to reconcile ideas that formed from his vantage point, where the entire world could be easily seen as a single place but the people of this place were killing each other en masse. He tried to imagine the ideas that would prevent this sort of massacre from ever happening again. There is no hatred in his voice. Rather, his voice is filled with bewilderment, confusion, and his desire to accept his experiences. He strives to better understand the world so that he can help to remake it once the war is over.Bert Stiles was killed in action a short time after completing his manuscript, before it was ready for publication. For this reason, it's rough around the edges. It's probably more than it needs to be at times, and at other times his thoughts seem to be unfulfilled.

The book also explores how love can motivate us to perform selfless acts of good as well as drive us to commit malicious acts of selfishness.And if these descriptions sound succinct and to the point, then I’ve done a disservice to the remarkable talent of Nicole Krauss. Love is never clearly defined and it’s never one constant thing. Rather, the emotion is many different things and it’s continuously changing. Krauss captures these dynamics through the experiences of her characters and her story seamlessly ties these dynamics together. The end result is a spectrum that allows the reader to reflect on their own feelings of love as experienced in their own lives and in their own ways. Even now, days after reading the last page, subtleties of this book are still coming to light within the context of Krauss’ spectrum.I also have to complement Krauss on the structure of the book. The physical layout of the chapters and the compression of the dialogue serve to bring the reader closer to the characters and closer to their emotions. By the last page, I felt as if I had just seen a live theatrical production complete with actors and sets.

In The Body, King fills the book with the humanity of four boys who lived in a time and place that afforded them the true opportunity to explore life on their own terms. The setting is rural Maine where downtown offers a few central streets of small shops and everywhere else filled with the possibility of self-discovery and adventure. The Body tells the story of one of these adventures. The characters serve to define the true nature of youthful friendship but they also show how these friendships are affected by differences that become more pronounced with time. While the plot may consist of a long hike to see a body, the story resides entirely within the characters that King creates.I also enjoyed the internal speculation that King’s reversal in style created. Why did he choose to write about four boys, their friendships, and their lives? I think the answer lies somewhere close to the fact that the main character is described as a future and successful writer (not unlike King). And why was the story so good? Probably because it’s simply a story about kids growing up in rural Maine (not unlike King) in a setting where being a kid is best thing in the world to be....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 19, 2011","Aug 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11574.The_Body

I've read the book about the people that were transformed into battery-starved aliens, the one where the family cat was brought back to life, his vampire novel, and others. Then I read Different Seasons, and specifically “The Body,” and something in my mind recognized how books could be a window into the human experience. King continued to publish longer and longer books after Different Seasons and I continued to read them, but the need and the opportunity to better understand life exhausted my taste for 1000+ page books about the flu and the clown that lived in the storm sewer. So with this in mind, if you find yourself in possession of a copy of Different Seasons, feel free to rip out the first two stories, then rip out the last story, and then proceed to read The Body as its own book.As for the other stories, watching Morgan Freeman in the screen version of “The Shawshank Redemption” by far surpasses the experience of reading King's original words. “Apt Pupil” harkens to King’s subsequent works in that it seems like it will never end, and “Breathing Method” is a typical King short story: entertaining with a well-rounded tablespoon of the macabre.Thus, the two-star rating is intended to signify that the whole of this book is worth far less than the sum (or one) of its parts....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 15, 2011","Aug 19, 2011","Jul 15, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/847659.Different_Seasons

It’s a story of one person that did not dare to be different. Rather, Philip Carey was different in heart, in mind, and in body; as am I, as are we all.From there, life takes place as it did over a century ago, but very little has changed since then. Those that love completely with their hearts still have their hearts inexplicably broken. Those with the courage to think about society still discover that there are no absolutes. And those that exist under the eyes of normality still discover that normal is as illusive as perfection. Maugham, with patience and determination, captures all of this in words.The very best of this novel, however, resides not in the story that’s told but in the way that life is experienced. As human creatures, we are driven to look, think, test, and finally tell of the things that we have discovered to be true. Maugham, through the grace of a beautifully told story, guides the reader through this very process and ultimately tells of a philosophy that is literally rooted in the earth and saturated in truth; so much so, that (at present) this would be the book that I would hope to be reading during the darkest of times, should they ever come to pass.

This is a beautiful raw-earth story about forging ahead with one's dreams in spite of challenges and difficulties. And only a character such as John Grady Cole, who had to accept so much of life in his first appearance in All the Pretty Horses, could have the courage and kindness necessary to push through life in this second appearance to make his dreams come true.---First Read January 2015McCarthy captures something magical in Cities of the Plain. He captures a fleeting moment in time in the American West right before the slowly creeping forces of the industrial revolution finally found their way into this vast but remote landscape. Right before the time when the traditional roles of cowboys and their horses became obsolete. It is this theme, all good things..., that McCarthy writes about in Cities of the Plain, in so many words, in direct and indirect ways.It's a beautiful story that McCarthy writes, filled with the pure beauty of places that now only partially exist in our modernized world. There are wide fields of grass and sage, distant mountains, and cattle not in pens but grazing on the land until they need to be rounded up. There are beautiful sunsets and moonless skies filled with so many stars that they too shed a faint light upon the ground. It's not that these things do not presently exist. They indeed happen now if you can find the right place, but they certainly do not happen with the innocent knowledge that they are an endless commodity of life.McCarthy also writes about honesty that is so true it can kill, and he writes about love. In addition to his beautiful story, there is McCarthy's style of writing. It's not enough for McCarthy to simply let his readers read his tale. He wants them engaged and thinking about what he has to say. He starts strings of dialogue by only giving the name of the first speaker, all the while eliminating the use of quotation marks. He initiates scenes in which the identification of the main character is only provided through their characteristics. The result of this style of writing is the feeling that I had imagined this story as opposed to ever having read it....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 11, 2015","Jan 24, 2015","Jul 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40470.Cities_of_the_Plain

The same poignant, insightful, and serious writing that seeks to expose the human condition to the world is prevalent throughout. Also missing from this book is the film-noir and comedic style that plagued Brighton Rock and Our Man in Havana (respectively). Therefore, everything that I love about Greene is here and everything that I dislike about Greene is absent.I found the theme of justice, and how justice affects various people of different classes and positions in society to be enticing. Greene also tackles love and hate and the interplay between these two emotions; a theme that he covers more extensively (and successfully) in his best book, The End of the Affair. Greene also illustrates the inherent selfishness of people who are seemingly united in a cause, but yet focus their efforts to achieve that cause in their own self-serving ways. All great stuff for a book and Greene is the perfect writer to undertake such a serious piece of writing.Greene’s typical books seem average about 300 pages in length and his style of writing (at least in his better books) uses the length of the book to gradually reveal his main characters. This approach is worked to its best effect in The Heart of the Matter, where the reader is allowed to grow-to-know a limited number of main characters, from first impressions to final evaluation. But 300 pages (or in this case 225 pages) does not allow for a multitude of characters, which is the main issue with It’s a Battlefield.The vast portion of life that Greene attempts to cover in this book required the use of many characters. There were at least ten characters, each of which was used to illustrate some aspect of his main themes. Thus, his style hindered his ability to explore any single character or any single theme very deeply.

I think this is due toSecond Reading: June 2021This second time trough, I was amazed at the countless details I had forgotten since my first reading. I think this is due to the overshadowing effect of All the Pretty Horses and Cities of the Plain. Both of these books are human-focused in a brutally honest way. The Crossing, however, is something a bit different. While it’s certainly human focused, it attempts at times to live in that mystic place that exists between what we know and what we cannot explain. If humans are spiritual creatures (and we are), McCarthy tries to explain that spirituality in a universal way, in terms that are fundamentally part of the world that we know.This spiritual aspect to the novel creates a sense of depth. The instinctive behaviors of wolves, the unexplainable cruelty of man, and the peaceful nature of people unencumbered by modernity are periodically explored. It’s this exploration, however, that is drawn out a bit more than necessary at various points throughout the novel.Beyond this slight fault, the vast balance of the book is everything that its prequel and sequel are. The Story of Billy Parham is one of honesty and one of reality. While other writers have also achieved the depiction of reality through words, McCarthy manages to do it in a way that is uniquely and relishingly his own.A Few Comments on the MapBecause an adventure without mapping it is not worth the journey, I attempted to plot Billy’s path through his three journeys into Mexico and the large-area search he performed while in Mexico.The Map: Billy Parham's JourneysThe process involved using base maps of Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico from 1922 as well as a Texaco Road Map of Arizona and New Mexico from 1935. The road map was surprisingly inclusive of geological features. These maps, especially the Mexican maps, were supplemented with detailed searches of Google Maps for villages of the mentioned names. I was surprised to see that the Mexican Maps mentioned places such as El Tigre in Sonora, Mexico and San Diego in Chihuahua, Mexico.On Billy Parham’s second journey into Mexico, where he spends most of his time between the northern town of Casas Grandes and the southern town of Santa Ana de Babícora, these two relatively large towns have remained constant and verifiable between 1922 and the present. The smaller villages (or pueblos) had to be hunted down on Google Maps by ""flying"" close to the ground along the indicated route. Through this means, the pueblos of Mata Ortiz, San Jose (judged to be the existing pueblo of San Jose de Ermita), and La Pinta were located.The location of other mentioned towns, however, were probably fictionalized by McCarthy and possibly placed at the location of other mapped towns that existed at the time. Las Varas was stated by McCarthy to be on the road south from Mata Ortiz and near the river. The one place that met this geographic location on the 1922 map was the plotted location of El Rucio, a train stop in 1922. Boquilla was depicted as being at the end of a road segment aligned in an east-west direction, near a lake, and needing to be passed through in order to reach Santa Ana de Babícora. The town of San Jose de Babícora fit this description on the 1922 map. While these two towns are actually included on the Mexcan map, they are further south making them inconsistent with the narrated journey.Billy’s furthest trek south was to the town of Cuauhtemoc, which was verified as once being called San Antonio. San Antonio is plotted on the 1922 map. Billy’s path to Cuauhtemoc and subsequently to La Nortena, however, are speculative.On Billy’s third and final journey into Mexico, the route is fairly well defined by McCarthy. Therefore, it is confusing that upon departure from Mexico, he passes Dog Springs and then he travels relatively far to the east to Hermanas, New Mexico (presumably without re-crossing the border). Billy then turns in the opposite direction to head west to Hatchita. It’s a long circuitous route that seems intuitively incorrect. However, Dog Springs, Hermanas, and Hatchita are all verifiable locations.The novel mentions other locations in the US where Billy visits. However, these locations were primarily used to establish a sense of time between his second and Third Mexican journeys. Other places in the US are also mentioned during the end of the book, but again, these mentions are more to set the mood rather than serve as an actual part of the plot. As such, these extraneous locations are not shown on the map.---First Reading: June 2013The Crossing is a novel that succeeds in giving meaning to an existence that typically goes unnoticed as we move through our scheduled lives. We may, on occasion, sense this way of life as we force our presence on the physical world. It’s life as it always was but humanity has pushed it aside into a part of the world that now only exists between our beliefs and our actions. It is within this part of the world that life exists, for the sake of life itself. This is where we began, during the time that preceded our understanding of things, before things had names.The Crossing serves as a guidebook to the remnants of this pre-conscious world that still surrounds us. Notions of it can be found in the actions of animals, in both predators and prey. It also lives in the unspoken understanding that exists between those closest to us; the unspoken bond between brothers that allows for actions without words. It can be seen in the swaying tops of trees on a breezy day and in the thunderstorms that momentarily cool the oppressive heat of the desert. But the truth of this world lies in its unmitigated reality. Hate lives on equal terms with love, pleasure is savored and pain is endured, kindness and greed are always at hand; and death is merely one more step in life....more",Notes are private!,0,18,2,"May 22, 2021Jun 11, 2013","Jun 02, 2021Jun 29, 2013","Jun 09, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/365990.The_Crossing

Emma constantly imagined the potentialThere’s an aspect to Emma Bovary’s life that I found admirable, which was her awareness of her own imagination. Emma constantly imagined the potential in life and then acted on her imagination to make her visions of the future become real. In the abstract, Emma invented and then created, and a human that creates is a human that is living life to its fullest.But imagination and creation do not happen together in the abstract. Unfortunately, Emma’s imagination and actions are devoid of moral considerations (or any depth of thought). Emma acts are destructive to herself as well as to others. A moral focus could have guided Emma’s imagination towards a greater good and a fulfilling happiness, but Emma places her desires above any consideration of the consequences.In many ways, this combined message of imagination devoid of moral character speaks across time to present-day events. Today, we have a significant faction of our society moving towards an imagined greatness in the absence of moral guidance, and we may find that Emma’s fate represents a universal consequence to such acts.And one final observation so as to not forget Charles Bovary, Emma’s husband. Charles was as devoid of imagination as Emma was devoid of morals, but his lack of imagination is not damning. His stoic presence reminds us that imagination is not an essential part of being a good person and his moral character reminds us that morals are above no one’s grasp.On the nitpicky side of criticism, books of this era tend to be long-worded at times and Madame Bovary has its prolonged moments wordiness. I’ll also mention that this particular translation from French to English, performed almost contemporaneously with the original publication in the late 1800s, hindered the enjoyment of the book. The English words used were a bit too literal and the intent of the original writing was sacrificed at times in favor of the translation’s accuracy. It’s not that a translator should rewrite a novel, but modern translations of foreign novels tend to bring forth the feelings imbedded in the original words, which helps to keep the original magic of the novel alive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 30, 2018","Oct 13, 2018","Jun 04, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19218751-madame-bovary

I go willingly with McCarthy, but only because I know that McCarthy will be deadpan truthful. There will be no embellishments.  No Country for Old Men  is definitely a McCarthy novel.The story may seem like a one-off rarity but it actually reveals that we live beneath platitudes of chance that make life seem secure and comfortable. This is not to say that violence and crime will certainly be visited upon us. Rather, it’s an enlightenment that asserts that they are an embedded part of who we are. This is what this book is about.By the end of the novel, McCarthy’s mastery of writing became apparent. The story I was reading was not even the story he was telling, but the two stories are so tightly intertwined that either perspective leads to the same end.

To Alfred LambeThere is a truly great story within the pages of the The Corrections; the story of a man and the things that he holds dearest in life. To Alfred Lambert, his life is the sum-total of his dignity as defined through a lifetime of hard work and his accomplishments, and how he protects this dignity by a veil of highly guarded privacy. In Alfred’s mind he is a star burning brightly warming other worlds without the need or desire for help from anything or anyone. Franzen examines Alfred’s dignity in detail so that we might understand how toxic dignity can be, if one allows it to define their life. He tells the story of the origins and development of Alfred’s dignity and also displays the effect that his dignity has on the lives of his wife and children. He shows us that while dignity begets self-respect, self-respect can be seamlessly transformed into selfishness when seen by others. And finally, when Alfred’s star has exhausted everything that there is to burn, Franzen examines the undignified and remaining embers of Albert’s life and makes apparent the family’s realizations that the warmth that they were required to take for granted for so long will soon be extinguished.This was a difficult book to climb into. In fact, its personal meaning to me only solidified in the last hundred or so pages (in spite of some earlier counter-indications). I became so engrossed (or disgusted) with the complete selfishness of the stories of Alfred and his family that I literally could not see the forest through the trees.

However, there’s also a fundamental elegance to whatever it happens to be and it’s through that elegance that I find peace, wisdom, and composure.---Fisrt Review: August 2011To those that would say McCarthy is a dark writer, I would counter that with the premise: happiness is unique only to humans and is not a part of the world that surrounds us. Every moment of happiness is a result of our interpretation of events in a positive light. Outside of humanity, the world simply moves onward through time until one day it will cease to exist. There is nothing happy or tragic in this reality unless we as humans interpret this end as a happy or tragic completion of this world's existence. In my opinion, it is from this very real realty that McCarthy's words originate.I have had several instances in my life that required the exchange of arguments in order prove a legal point. The reality of these experiences is that the most powerful and convincing arguments are those that are anchored to the physical world, as it exists, without happiness or tragedy. It is what it is.All the Pretty Horses is yet another novel by McCarthy that is both powerful and convincing because everything written by McCarthy is a reflection of the physical world, as it exists, without happiness or tragedy. This brilliant style allows for humanity, each of us as individuals, to interpret events within All the Pretty Horses as either happy or tragic or anywhere in between based on the life experiences of each reader. Thus, to any reader that is receptive to this style, All the Pretty Horses will be real as well as something different for each of us.As to specific realities that are included in its pages, here are just a few:• The realization that a son must make his own way in life without the help of his parents.• The relative moment in history when the west, as an icon of the American experience, was dying a merciless death.• The image of Mexico and its people as a country that is unique to the world.• The reality that life is immensely complicated and that the outcomes of our decisions are never certain.• The arid west is comprised of distances filled with almost endless moments of loneliness, desolation, beauty, and magnificence.With each successive book, my admiration (and respect) for McCarthy continues to grow. And I will have to re-read All the Pretty Horses before moving on to The Crossing. After all, I must value what is true above what is useful....more",Notes are private!,0,21,2,"Mar 17, 2012not set","Apr 06, 2012not set","Apr 23, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11618066-all-the-pretty-horses

Other characters that interact with Binx are also mentally dissected to the point where the realities of the story break away from the realities of everyday life. It is within the reality of the story that I found it difficult to find the line between the eccentricities of the characters and that of southern culture. I am certain that this line does not lie very deep. After all, the South is filled with amazing people. However, there is a slight difference. A nuance exists in how someone from the South (or someone from South Africa, Europe, the West, or anywhere) sees everyday life and I could sense that Percy is such a remarkable writer of the mind that this southern nuance was unavoidably (remarkably, expertly) interwoven into his characters.

TOut Stealing Horses is a coming-of-age story that’s been embedded within the main character’s experiences of coming to terms with his coming-of-age. The story focuses on parenthood and the illusion that parents strive to create in the eyes of their children. When that illusion fails, as it always does, children are left with nothing but flawed human beings as their former gods. The see that their parents have selfish desires like everyone else, and that their once perfect heroes closely reflect themselves. For some children, the illusion falls later in life at a time when comprehension is possible, which leads to understanding and a sort of silent forgiveness for both parents and children. But for others, it happens all to soon. Childish opinions are formed into realities and then life moves in and forces further considerations out. Breaking through these childhood realities to hopefully find the truth is what Out Stealing Horses is about. As a book, however, I thought the writing was a bit off. The natural landscape of Norway, while beautifully described is probably overplayed. Also, the characters all seem to fit within a stereotypical role where men are men and women exist as extensions of their needs. To this end, Petterson does not poke very deeply into the main character's male psyche. After all, men just don’t dwell on those things (even though we do). He also fails to give the main female character any sort voice in a break that occurs between the main character, as a boy and his father even though she is partially responsible.

Books such as The Jungle, Sister Carry, and Martin Eden defined for me the societal conditions that existed when the free market was allowed to shape society under near laissez-faire conditions.

Jack London tells of life in London where the vast majority of people, men, women, and children, are treated as a cheap commodity; used for the lowest wages possible and then discarded when their labor can be replaced for a more vigorous person or for even lower wages. The commodity is housed in pits that are filled to maximum capacity in order to maximize rents and is fed with food intended to sustain life while bleeding away the strength of youth.The book is an observational commentary composed by London during his sojourns into the East End of London. He dressed as these people dressed, pursued work as they did, and most importantly, recognized these people as human. London once said that this was his most purposeful book, indicating, “No other book of mine took so much of my young heart and tears as that study of the economic degradation of the poor.""

ThIn the Heart of the Sea tells a story of courage, luck, and misfortune that rivals any similar story that could possibly happen in our present age. The account of the sinking of the whaleship Essex was first written by the ship’s first mate, Owen Chase, soon after his salvation from the horrific experience of being lost at sea for three months in a small open whaleboat; and upon his deliverance to his Nantucket home.The author tells this story with skill. He seamlessly combines known facts with the more famous account written by Owen Chase and a lesser known, relatively new account that was recorded by the fourteen-year-old cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson. Nickerson’s account was written about 50 years after the sinking of the Essex and remained undiscovered until 1960.While the events and the various narratives that are combined in In the Heart of the Sea result in a good yarn, the influences of the tragedy of the Essex on the writing of Moby-Dick is what made this book completely intriguing. The author provides references to the events and the mentalities of the survivors that were ultimately used by Melville. He also describes Melville’s introduction to Chase’s account while on his first whaling voyage 1840 and mentions Melville’s 1852 meeting with the Captain of the Essex in Nantucket, the year after Moby-Dick was published.Overall, In the Heart of the Sea, provides a very enjoyable prequel to Melville’s Moby-Dick, which will forever keep the stories of human fortitude, bravery, and desperation that are associated with the Essex disaster alive.

My previous exposure to his short stories, however, was in the total collection of his short story works. I read through his ""complete collection"" from cover to cover without any thought as to how there were originally collected or published. As a result, I missed out on the purpose or picture that In Our Time conveys as a complete work unto itself.As an image of what the world was and what it had become as we moved through the WWI era, In Our Time is as complete a Hemingway work as any of his novels. The best aspect of this book was Hemingway’s use of vignettes to illustrate what we had become as opposed to the short stories that illustrate what we had been. I thought that the shortness of the vignettes, with all their shocking content, were in sharp harmonic contrast with the longer short stories, which conveyed the feeling of simpler, slower, pre-war times. And as a means of communicating and documenting the effects of WWI, In Our Time may actually be a better book than A Farewell to Arms, when compared with this purpose in mind....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 22, 2012",Nov 2012,"Feb 18, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4652.In_Our_Time

Within The Sunset Limited two extreme points of view are pitted against each other for a debate of words. In doing so, evidence is presented to a jury comprised of the solitary reader. While McCarthy allows free will to decide the ending, the deliberation of the evidence occupies the reader's mind during the silence that exists in the room after the back cover is closed. My conclusions may not be your conclusions. The fact that McCarthy allows for this freedom of thought by the reader shows his acute understanding of how powerful words can be once placed in the minds of his audience and his ability to tap into this source of power makes for one amazing reading experience.As for style, his prose written in ""dramatic format"" probably reach the pinnacle of his apparent quest to communicate the most meaningful elements of life with the fewest amounts of words. Place The Road on a medium heat as if it were a cup of sugar and reduce its volume down to a tablespoon of caramel and you have The Sunset Limited.I would recommend this book to anyone who wished to consider the human condition from both a spiritual and a realist point of view.

I still have the feeling that the final step in Hemingway’s writing process, the cutting, honing, and polishing that is so evident in the books that were published during his lifetime, has been omitted from this novel. However, a Hemingway novel is still a Hemingway novel, and the immersion into his attitudes towards life brings forth certain elements of life that are constant and true.First Reading, January 2012…As a Hemingway fan, there is a lot to like and enjoy about this book. For instance, we’re lucky that it is here in the first place. Being the first of the posthumously published works, Hemingway had no intention of publishing it himself, but here it is. Islands in the Stream is filled with lines that could only come from Hemingway. Filled with his crisp style of writing that leaves so much to the imagination that the story transforms into truth in the minds of his readers.The problem with Islands in the Stream is that Hemingway, presumably, had no intention of publishing it, at lease in its present form. There is simply too much between the covers. Consider that Islands in the Stream and For Whom the Bell Tolls both have about 450 pages. Now consider that For Whom the Bell Tolls addresses virtually every aspect of the Spanish Civil War, from its effects on the Spanish people to the war’s meaning on an international stage. At best, Islands in the Stream covers the tragic relationship that Hemingway had with his sons and supports this tragedy with page after page of symbolic depictions of his failings as a father. As it presently sits, this book is Hemingway’s iceberg, still attached to the glacier, and waiting for a Hemingway that will never exist to carve it into the story that it was intended to be....more",Notes are private!,0,23,2,"Feb 09, 2023Dec 08, 2011","Feb 26, 2023Jan 07, 2012","Nov 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4633.Islands_in_the_Stream

As with the crew of the USS Caine, I recall a few endless pre-dawn mornings where we were instructed to move at full speed from one place to the next only to spend the rest of the day waiting for our next set of instructions. I also served under seemingly eccentric and remote captains that ruled with unimaginable power and did not hesitate to exercised that power on the unlucky individuals that were caught ""pressing the envelope"" of standing orders. The Caine Mutiny brought all this to back to the forefront of my memories and did so with accuracy.The shortcomings of this book are similar to those of many World War II novels in that it tries to capture so much of life in that era that it distracts from the central themes of the book. As it is, it reads like a black-and-white war movie complete with scenes that are over-dramatized. The book also includes pages and chapters devoted to relatively pointless sub-plots. If Wouk had only decided to focus on the matter at hand, the intensity of this book could have been amazing. Instead, I found the book a bit watered down and drawn out. One additional thing that struck me about this book is that the main setting is a small destroyer that has been modified to perform mine sweeping operations. One of the last scenes of the book tells of this destroyer being hit, almost head on, by a Japanese suicide plane. This same scene was a reality for my grandfather serving on board the  USS Abner Read  on November 1, 1944. Only in his experience, the suicide plane dropped a bomb that sailed down the main smokestack and exploded in the engine compartment below the waterline. The aircraft continued its dive and exploded on the aft deck of the ship. My grandfather managed to climb up from the smoke filled, blacked-out passages below the deck in order to abandon ship before it sank. This is a picture of the Abner Read before it went down by the stern 36 minutes after the initial hit.I remember my grandfather’s stories of his service on board the Abner Read, which I received with the excitement of a young boy reveling in the exploits of his grandfather. Since then I’ve grown to realize how serious and traumatic these events must have been for my grandfather and The Caine Mutiny served, in a small way, to bring some semblance of life to these realizations.This is truly a three-star book under ordinary circumstances, but this book meant a lot to me while reading it.

The book brings to life the beliefs of humans, the realities formed out of these beliefs, and their consequences. Specifically, she focuses on the people of small towns in rural America and one young adult who is in search of who he should become while living in a sea of strong-minded family and friends. While the time period is inclusive of WWI, the book only devotes about a quarter of its pages to an actual presence in Europe and of these pages only a handful are used to describe actual acts of war. The war is simply just another tool that the author uses to move her character through life experiences that are just as real today as they were when this book was written in 1922.Other points of merit that flood my thoughts include the writing skills of Willa Cather. She uses metaphor sparingly but effectively; and her selection of words creates pages of narrative and dialog that are intricate and tender. In searching for a past reading experience of equally beautiful style, I keep coming back to Bel Canto, by Ann Patchett. The tempo of the story is also used by Cather to add a sense of feeling to her settings. Life in rural America, where little changes with time, is written patiently; life in transit to an imagined destiny is compressed into a period of days; and the critical scenes of war require only minutes to change lives.Least and foremost, One of our Ours formed a sort of harmony in my mind that brought back the relative melody of two books with more overt plots. The first was Main Street by Sinclair Lewis and the second (of course) was All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria. This harmony created a more complete picture of the worlds that were originally experienced during my prior readings of these two books and will forever link One of Ours to these stories....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 09, 2011","Feb 11, 2011","Nov 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2168148.One_of_Ours

Yet, I did enjoy this book, its characters, and the story more so than would be suggested by a three-star rating.The book itself is a small bubble of 1870 Victorian life, preserved and unaffected by time. The characters may have been melodramatic in their dialog and actions but they were also the wealthiest people of the Victorian era; an era where class distinctions were communicated through language, action, and appearances. Also, as much as I enjoy the sparse writing of Cormac McCarthy and you-know-who, there is much to be said for the full robust style of James. After all, in his day a visual familiarity of distant places and life styles were not experienced by most people as they are today through television and movies. His descriptive writing brings these settings into full view in the minds of his readers and reading through paragraphs that span a page or two is just what it takes to accomplish these depictions. Overall, I found the writing and the characters to be true to their time within the context of time.The specific elements of the book that I enjoyed included the contrasts drawn between the main  American character, Christopher Newman, who was elevated in class by commercial successes and the conflicting European characters that were born into the upper-class by divine right. I also enjoyed the realistic changes in all the characters as they progressed through the story. While their acts may have been melodramatic by today’s standards, their endings were all true to life. Damsels were not rescued from the approaching train, villains did not meet dastardly ends, and life simply moved forward with its full force and inertia.So, a three stars rating does seem a bit harsh.

The result may be plausible but it certainly is not real. And who can blame us? This very mixture helped us to survive. Fact: the lion is stalking me. Belief: if I run to that place, I will live. And so societies are born, careers are made, and we survive all because we acted on the facts at hand in conjunction with our beliefs in an outcome.At times, however, the mixture becomes grossly imbalanced. Our beliefs are transformed into virtual facts within our minds and our actions become distorted. We, as the actors on our own stage, never know the difference, but others (devoid of our own overdose of belief) see our actions clearly. And what they see is often times confusing, foolish, sad, and ultimately comical.Greene uses this aspect of human nature to craft a story that highlights the differences between how his characters see themselves and how they see each other. However, Greene goes a step further in this novel by suggesting that one final transformation is required in order to ultimately see the comedy in the actions of others, that being the loss of compassion.Greene takes a somber and deliberate approach to his work. He creates characters that warrant compassion due to the circumstances in their lives and he lets us see how these circumstances lead to their imbalances of belief. And through this process, Greene lets us know that while we may ultimately see the comedy in the actions of others, the price we pay for the transformation is a bit of our own humanity.I believe that Heller knew of this transformation and used it masterfully within the pages of Catch-22; the difference being that Heller deconstructed comedy and invoked a state of compassion in his readers.

Knowing that he was still alive cast a shining light on humanity's potential. Now that he's gone, it's up to humanity to recognize the hope that he has left behind.---As a three-year-old son of a typical nuclear family in 1969, I was awoken from my sleep, placed beside our TV, and photographed next to Neil Armstrong stepping on to the moon. Through all these years, Neil Armstrong remained a hero that was codified in my three-year-old mind. An image that was forged by extremely enthusiastic parents who took pride in what was being accomplished, in real time, in front of their eyes and next to their son.For the next forty years, I worked on becoming the person that I wanted to be; an engineer involved with making things work and letting others know how these things could be made. As I grew into this person, I realized that pride for engineers is rooted in their methods and not in their results. After all, the results should be a foregone conclusion. While this makes for truly boring dinner table conversations, quiet solitude is the environment for engineering achievements.First Man clearly defines Neil Armstrong far beyond the image of the hero that was stamped in my mind so many years ago. He is truly an engineer and throughout this book, great perspective is gained into his methods, his achievements, and his life. More importantly, however, First Man allows all of us to take pride in our collective first steps on the Moon. We are all heroes and Neil Armstrong lets us know that we should all share in the pride associated with our heroism, equally....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 15, 2011","Jun 04, 2011","Nov 09, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/205589.First_Man

Vonnegut uses one of the most turbulent periods in history to illustrate how human morals can be manipulated to such an extent that good and evil can become completely reversed in the minds of those that give up personal choice in favor of real feelings of comfort and security as provided by a collective group-consciousness. Vonnegut then continues to illustrate the aftermath to the human psyche that occurs after the group is summarily terminated: wars end, soldiers are discharged, agents are quietly dismissed. These individuals are then left to their own devices to recognize that right is now wrong, good is now evil, and that their own realities are now a delusion.

The authors of mysteries, may they be Agatha Christie or Dan Brown, always withhold some piece of key information that leads to the plot twist at the end of the book. Magicians play the same game by performing magic, while in reality, all that they’ve really done is failed to reveal the key pieces of information about their tricks. As once indicated by a friend, “To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages,"" and it’s quite possible that I’ve always been a supporter of this approach to writing.To this end, The Spy Who Came In from the Cold is not much more than a mystery novel. It’s uniqueness stems from the fact that it does not portray spies that have super-human fighting abilities nor James Bond gadgetry. Rather, these are the ordinary spies that you would likely meet in everyday life, but of course you would never know it. While this book is a commendable approach to writing a mystery novel, the lack of Hollywood flash and bling only serve to highlight the trickery employed by the author at the end of the novel.

This is still a fine example of Graham Greene writing.The one addition I will make, is to expand upon my description of the “common man” to include our need for spirituality. Some formalize this need through religion, others through the contemplation of the scientific wonders, and still others through ideas that are greater than themselves. My first  missed this key attribute of the common man, which was a significant deficiency in my initial impressions of this novel. ---First Review: 8/21/10If you are looking for Graham Greene, be assured that a part of him resides within The Power and the Glory. In the tradition of some of his previous works he does not hesitate to perform invasive exploratory surgery on the human condition in order to uncover more than a few basic human truths. As such, there is no sense of Hollywood within these pages.The interesting part of this book is his protagonist. Greene all but creates the common man within his pages, complete with pitiful self attributed pride, fear, humility, fleeting moments of bravery, and self loathing. Everyone at various moments in life can relate to the corresponding experiences of the nameless priest within Greene’s story. The reason for withholding the 5th star has to do with two issues that may hinder the reader from being completely absorbed into the story. The first issue is the story’s setting in southern Mexico. Unfortunately, Mexico is commonly depicted with its sunny beaches in touristy cities comprised of high-rise hotels along the coast. Thus, if you’ve never ventured 10 minutes beyond these tourist spots, you may not be familiar with the poverty that comprises the outlying towns, any one of which could substitute for those described by Greene in The Power and the Glory.The second issue is that the story somewhat depends upon the reader’s knowledge of the beliefs, mysticism, and traditions of Catholicism. After all, the main character is a priest. In the absence of this familiarity, some of the values held dearest to the main character may not be fully comprehended. I was fortunate in that I was halfway immersed into Catholicism as a child, but it didn’t stick. Even so, the grandeur of the religion and its supporting doctrine can be hypnotic and enticing, if not sincere.

This time, Ahab was contemplated in his conflicted state. I saw him as a man that was a natural success. He was made captain of the Pequod after a career of successful sailings only to be struck by a tragedy the kind of which are numerous in his industry and the era. Ahab could not reconcile his hard-won life with the accident and proceeded to blame a creature that could never realize such a responsibility. While Ahab may be seen as simply demanding justice, the true reality is that his inherent assertiveness pushes him in a quest for revenge to the point of functional insanity. The First Mate, Starbuck, sees the truth, but he’s locked into his sworn duty and obedience. Hope is the only thing allotted to him. Stubb, the Second Mate, rejects the contemplative path towards the truth in order to maintain his self identity as an expert whaler. The third mate, Flask, crowds out the truth in favor of his operational responsibilities and busyness. And the crew are left with doubts, suspicions, and superstitions until the end.The end brings undeniable clarity to Ahab. His final acts establish the truth of his personal fight against himself. This is what will stay with me from this second reading. For reference...Hi-Res Map: Voyage of the PequodHi-Res Deck Plan: Whaling Ship Morgan (Pequod)---First Reading [November 2010]The first overall impression of Moby Dick that comes to my mind is its completeness. In much the same way that the ships described by Melville need to be self-sufficient in order to survive, Moby Dick itself is as complete a book as I have ever read. I can imagine the covers of the book acting as a hull of a ship, fully provisioned with contemporaneous information spanning the spectrum of plots, sub-plots, and sketches that were played out on deck. So much relevant information is provided that the story of Ahab, Ishmael, and the whale is allowed to expand beyond mere words and form a reality of consciousness that is supported by structural knowledge.My second impression is one of beauty. All that Melville describes is real and his descriptions of life at sea, sea life, and the ocean are captivating. He creates detailed images of his subjects in much the same way painters of his time worked with beautiful details before Impressionism entered into art. The language may be a bit old-world, but after a few chapters of immersion, it becomes ingrained in your mind and becomes easily interpreted.Of course, all of the noted scholarly content is included. There are enough layers intertwined into this work that careers have been made out of trying to explore its depths. The magic of Melville’s writing, however, is that these layers are very slight and subtle. They add climate and feeling to the conscious line of thought and if you did not recognize many or all of these layers during your journey (like me), I believe that Melville would have been pleased with your experience. After all, art should be enjoyed in its entirety....more",Notes are private!,1,28,2,"Aug 12, 2020Nov 21, 2010","Sep 05, 2020Jan 05, 2011","Aug 07, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/406293.Moby_Dick

They serve to reveal the truths about lives that are lived on only a fraction of their real value and continue to show how others amassed fortunes by claiming the balance.

As such, it’s far better to describe this book as a docudrama rather than as a novel. So much so that I have the distinct impression that Dos Passos made a list of everything that he felt was important about the time period and then proceeded to connect every item on that list with shot fragments of overarching storylines. Since some items on the list were incompatible with others, a few different stories were needed to get all of the items into the same book. Then, in order to make some effort to transform this collection of stories into a novel, Dos Passos devotes about 70 of the book’s 400-plus pages to main character interactions.Also, by the end of the book I was going crazy with the word “and.” Granted, if you start with a list of things and want to tie these things together, then the word “and” can seem magical with respect to your goals. The word also helps to keep the book moving without dwelling on any one thing too long.

Wright then presents his own argumentative statements, supported by the professional opinions. It is through this method that he proceeds to build his case for the historical evolution of God into His present form, one argument at a time.Within the context of the literal title of this book I found Wright’s arguments convincing, if not enlightening. From the dawn of self-awareness to the present day, humanity has always had a desperate need to simply understand our existence within the context of our surrounding. Surroundings that span distances that range from ourselves to points in space located 13.7 billion light-years away. And God, whether in a distributed form as multiple gods or in his present form as the one true God, has provided and continues to provide these simple answers, which are supported by arguments of personal faith. The Evolution of God succinctly traces the history of this commonly accepted answer. Furthermore, no matter how God resides within one’s mind, I believe that the historical case for God’s evolution as presented by Wright is something that every inquisitive human being would want to know.Then there are the shortcomings of this book. In addition to convincingly arguing the historical case of God’s transformation throughout the millennia, Wright continues to argue his personal views of a higher purpose. In the process, he introduces the concept of a Moral Imagination* that may one day grow into a Moral Order. He argues with minimal support that God’s evolution is evidence of a parallel growth in our collective Moral Imagination and calls upon the God of the Gaps for additional support of his opinions. It is these overlying opinions that serve to degrade the credibility of an otherwise well-researched accomplishment.In spite of these shortcomings, I actually agree with Wright’s personal views as limited to the concept of a Moral Imagination. Whether or not we needed gods/god/God to reach this point in our collective Moral Imagination is a question that cannot be easily answered. However, I suspect that Wright believes that a continued growth in our collective Moral Imagination (towards a Moral Order) would not be possible without a continued faith in a God that continues to evolve.

The town of Macondo is the typical anywhere town that begins from nothing and grows through no real choice of its own.

Through Tolstoy’s words, the characters reveal the truths associated with their actions and conclusions, be they honorable or disgraceful. This theme is so timeless that countless writers, before and after Tolstoy, have chosen to use this theme as the central topic of their work. I never grow tired of encountering this theme in the books that I read and every encounter is as enchantingly different as the writers themselves. Then there’s the second theme, which consisted of capturing every detail of the lifestyle and behavior of the Russian aristocracy. Descriptions are given for everything. Descriptions were given of the style of clothes that were worn at parties, for hunting trips, and for travel; descriptions were given of the accoutrement present in bedrooms, drawing rooms, and studies; descriptions were provided of the food and drink that were present at every table; and descriptions were given of bureaucratic debates and political strategies employed in the aristocratically dominated government of the time. The final product of this second theme could be considered an anthropological document for the study of the now-extinct aristocracy. While I found the descriptions of the Russian aristocracy interesting, they served to anchor Anna Karenina to a point in history that is not very historic.

Many times these projections are simply the strongest parts of who we are. The salesman is the quintessential charmer, the engineer is the ultimate problem solver, and the teacher is the giver of wisdom and truth. These projections act as our armor, forged out of past victories and hardened with the knowledge of past encounters; and the armor changes to battle the specific encounter at hand. Olive Kitteridge is a book that exemplifies this complexity of life. At times, Olive’s projection is humorous and at times it's harsh, but in the mind of Olive, it is always true because it has to be. What makes this book stand out, however, is that it does not rest on the humor or the harshness of Olive's projected personalities. Rather, it explores the consequences of the battles that are fought through her projections.As we send out the strongest parts of ourselves to conduct the business of life, we seldom realize that strength is typically dispatched in the absence of compassion. And without compassion we cannot truly know how we affect the lives of others. As Olive progresses through her life she begins to realize that the cost of personal survival is the alienation of her true self from those she attempts to love in the absence of compassion.

With its stark and sometimes horrific setting, and its kill-or-be-killed environment,As expected, The Road is no less than a captivating best seller. With its stark and sometimes horrific setting, and its kill-or-be-killed environment, the reader is entertained by a virtual sequel to any number of TV series that spewed forth survival as their main theme. If The Road consisted of only this, and nothing more, a few vampires would be the only way to make it a better book.Fortunately, The Road is much more than just a best seller. The father and son experiences and their interactions provide points on a moral compass that swings from good to bad at a moment's notice. Under these constantly changing circumstances the reader realizes that good and bad can bend full-circle and that this extreme bending of morals can only be tempered, but not entirely prevented, by the imperfect human will of the ""good guys."" Their decisions in this extremely imperfect world provide clarity to the moral standing of our own decisions in our own relatively near-perfect lives.The best aspect of this book, however, is the writing, which makes this book an all-time favorite. McCarthy strips the story down to the fewest number of words required to convey each event in the story. Even punctuation is selectively omitted in order to eliminate that nanosecond of time required for recognition and understanding of those little marks; thus bringing the reader that much closer to his reality. He creates crisp outlines of the story, frame by frame, and the reader is free to paint in every scene with their own imagination and experiences.This clean and accentuated style brings to mind books written by another Pulitzer Prize winning writer who was referred to (coincidentally?) as ""Papa,"" and the actions of the boy’s father repeatedly demonstrate a certain grace under pressure. To McCarthy's credit, he makes this style of writing his own and creates a story that will likely endure into the future as a Penguin Classic publication.The one point of criticism that sits in my mind regarding The Road is the ending. My cynical observations of this world prevent me from fully believing in the book's final scenes, but I understand why it ends as it ends....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 26, 2010","Oct 04, 2010","Apr 08, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6496926-the-road

Greene provides sharp poignant insights into the soul of an individual who desires above all else to make the pain of living that much less for those that surround him. But in doing so, Greene’s insights become disturbing. Time after time, they bounced off the page and struck very close to the truth about who I am, or at least how I see life. The result is a book that seems to live inside of me.Another aspect of this second reading was an ability to be more critical of the main character. His self-sacrificing nature could easily be understood to be self-serving. After all, within every martyr is a sense of satisfaction. Additionally, the hardships suffered because of his sacrifices may have indeed been proper punishment. The pity that I felt for Henry Scobie in my first encounter with him was a bit more staid this time around, and this more in-depth analysis of Greene’s world made this second reading worthwhile.---First Review: February 2010Greene creates a protagonist that acts on the best of his heartfelt intentions but fails to think about the ultimate results his actions. For a multitude of reasons, the protagonist simply gives into the expediency of his emotions and is then forced to experience the tragic consequences. The novel serves as a reminder that we are ultimately judged by the results of our actions and very little quarter is given for our reasons, be they selfless or self-serving.In parallel to this main theme, the book provides more of Greene's forceful writing as experienced in The End of the Affair. He tells the story in a way that places the reader in a position of full, hard-truth understanding of the actions of the main character.

This is a story about a writer, David Bourne, who is the typical Hemingway hero: sensitive but self-sacrificing, creative, satisfied by simple pleasures, and stoic. David is honeymooning in the French Riviera at a secluded hotel outside of Cannes and spends his mornings writing.If this were all the book had to offer, the story would still be good, but knowing about Hemingway’s life makes this book extraordinary. By having read about Hemingway’s life and his personality I had a perspective that permeated the story. I saw the critical parts of David Bourne as Hemingway, which served to humanize the story. There are also several elements of the plot that reflect back to events in Hemingway’s life.Maybe I’ve been played or conned into a feeling a certain way about this novel against my better judgement. It’s well documented that Hemingway was a master of publicity and many of his exploits are indeed captured by his biographers. Hemingway strove to remove the vacuum that usually seems to exists between a writer and his stories. But still, writing is art and the quality and beauty of art is absolutely dependent on its subject. Therefore, if Hemingway chose to use his life to humanize his art, then that is fair game. His stories represent a kind of self-portraiture.Thus, I loved this story as an episode in the life of David Bourne as well as a mirror of Hemingway’s own life. I loved the parts of the plot that are still edgy today and still challenge social norms. And I loved the parts of the plot that chronicle Hemingway’s writing process. I loved the setting in the French Riviera, and I loved the depiction of the hotel where simple hospitality, simple food, and simple drink created a kind of luxury and escape that money could never buy.Lastly, as an introduction to Hemingway, The Garden of Eden offers an approachable story. As readers, I think we can all relate to the art of writing as well as to the simple release of obligation that a good vacation can bring. Both of these themes exist in this book. Additionally, the ending is somewhat unique for a Hemingway novel. Yes, there will be some readers that will understandably find his style annoying, but others may find that Hemingway’s ability to gently nudge their imagination into alignment with his own intentions to be a different, more enjoyable form of writing altogether....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 19, 2018","Jul 05, 2018","Nov 25, 2009",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40057189-the-garden-of-eden

And by the way, Countess Natasha…YGG! Day 31: Countess Natasha!?! oh my... Day 35: An archeological dig would be a similar experience. Each page that turns uncovers a bit more of life as it was. However, there is no need to get your hands dirty. At this point, all out war (as opposed to peace) is on the horizon. Day 37: Hebrew Numerical Values = “Villines, a Civil Engineer” hmm. Day 42: The trouble with historical semi-fiction, and my own personality, is that once I’m enlightened I keep digging for the truth. I am now contemplating biographies and history books of the era; sorting through the usual sources for the best of these books. If I do not prioritize my time, I may find myself entering into a graduate program in Russian studies. Day 51: Both Napoleon and I were suffering with a cold while contemplating the battle of Borodino and while away from home. Him in Russia 200 years ago and me in Missouri, present day. Day 58: Continuing to create a clear picture of life through the murky waters of history by means of Tolstoy's goggles. Day 62: Page 1000! Looked up the comet of 1812 and found its name to be 12P/Pons-Brooks. It’s expected to return in 2025 according to JPL. Day 69: From insights into the composition of the human soul, to insights that describe the events that affected millions, what an amazing voyage it has been as I relish the last “few” pages of this book. Day 72: ""We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire attention is devoted to it."" Leo Tolstoy Day 78: It seems like Tolstoy recreating the same feeling of retreat that the French felt as they were retreating from Russia.

I say this as a native Californian with roots that reach back into Mexico. Two Years provides a snapshot of one point along my ancestral past.It's truly fortunate that Dana, a member of the educated professional class of the early 1800s, decided to remedy his eye fatigue by taking one of the lowest working class positions of the time: a common sailor on board a merchant ship. He was completely out of his element both physically as well as intellectually. The sea-terms used in his new capacity as a sailor must have been just as foreign to him as they are to anyone reading this book today. And yet, he still found time to record his experiences and produce this book.The history that this book imparts is mesmerizing. It depicts California as a backwater of Mexico and as an unknown frontier of the United States. The ports that it depicts are unbelievably simplistic in comparison to the development that has transpired over the past 180 years. The only export at the time was cattle hides from ranches located in the vast open plains that are now the inland cities of California.Just 10 years after publication, gold was discovered in California and most of Dana's setting was drastically and irreversibly changed. However, if one looks close enough, Dana's past is still easy to find:San Juan [now known as Dana Point]:San Juan is the only romantic spot on the coast. The country here for several miles is high table-land, running boldly to the shore, and breaking off in a steep cliff, at the foot of which the waters of the Pacific are constantly dashing. For several miles the water washes the very base of the hill, or breaks upon ledges and fragments of rocks which run out into the sea...Having nothing on but shirt, trousers, and hat, the common sea rig of warm weather, I had no stripping to do, and began my descent by taking hold of the rope with both hands, and slipping down, sometimes with hands and feet round the rope, and sometimes breasting off with one hand and foot against the precipice, and holding on to the rope with the other. In this way I descended until I came to a place which shelved in, and in which the hides were lodged. Keeping hold of the rope with one hand, I scrambled in, and by aid of my feet and the other hand succeeded in dislodging all the hides, and continued on my way.---First Reading: April 28, 2007This is the uniquely historic view of California as told by Dana prior to the gold rush invasion of 1849. Descriptions of various coastal cities including Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego are provided at a time when cowhides were the only things worthwhile for ships to trade in along the California Coast. The descriptions of California weather patterns are fascinating in that they describe storms that no longer (at least not yet) exist. Also, if you’re looking for good Mexican food, Dana’s account proves that good Mexican food existed in California long before Taco Bell....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"May 04, 2007","Aug 12, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/335397.Two_Years_Before_the_Mast

During the final years leading up to the transition of power, both sides of the conflict carried out heinous acts that are fully detailed within this book.

It is a release of control to someone else based on faith. When that faith is fulfilled, love is ever-present, but if that faith is forsaken there is nothing left of our humanity to give except for the darkest parts that we keep for ourselves: hate. And if that faith should be restored, even if for a moment, this kind of hate can vanish as if it never was. This is what love is and Greene writes it down in spite of a possible denial of its full and complete definition. There is not a dishonest word about love in this book.The End of the Affair then goes one step beyond love and dives into the spirituality of humans. It explores our receptiveness to a belief in God even though such beliefs only become fully realized under times of hardship and distress. Humans pray to God for deliverance from evil; and even when we pray to give thanks, it's generally a thanks for an absence of evil. It's as if evil drives our beliefs in God and God is only needed because we live in an evil world where bad happenstance is commonplace.The final chapters of the book explore the evidence that is commonly used to support our faith in God. If a flight attendant survives a fall from 33,000 feet after a bomb destroys her plane, is her life a divine miracle of God? Sometimes a person falling from the sky will hit just the right tree in just the right way, and then land in just the right place to survive. Greene gives this same sort of evidence for the existence of God and then lets his readers decide: miracle or chance. These subjects drive The End of the Affair towards being a spiritual book. The spirituality professed, however, consists of a reality that is rooted in an irrational world. And under these conditions God is just as likely to exists as not.---First Reading 6/18/09In The End of the Affair, Graham Greene examines the lives of three imperfect, and by definition, human characters. The plot, as denoted by the title of the book, allows the reader to experience the consequences of living in various states of the human condition as the characters grow, if sometimes not deliberately or willingly, to become less imperfect. The characters experience change along lines that transition between hate, passion, and love; acquaintance, colleague, and friend; and atheism, faith, and religion. The human experiences within these themes are passionately and realistically described. Also to Greene’s credit, he presents these experiences without personal judgments as to which state of existence is more or less imperfect. To this end, Greene’s words become introspective to the reader and allow the reader to map out where he or she resides along these same lines of transition....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jul 2009,"Jun 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/394731.The_End_of_the_Affair

The book was recommended to me by a South African associate when I mentioned that I was traveling to South Africa for an upcoming vacation. At the time, apartheid had already died a surprisingly peaceful death and Nelson Mandela had completed a relatively quiet and apparently successful five years in office as the first president of a new government. At the time, I took the book very superficially. After all, the entire content of The Covenant had happened in the past.With this second reading, some twenty years later, my older mind was awed by the mountain of South African history that parallels that of the United States. Both nations overran and subjugated their native inhabitants, both nations established governments that placed power exclusively in the hands of their colonists, and both governments codified their beliefs in white supremacy.The laws in effect in both nations were similar in their desire to repress those with non-white backgrounds. The difference was that South Africa needed to be more draconian. South Africa was repressing a majority of its people while the United States focused on a minority. In both cases, however, the beliefs that drove these injustices were fueled by greed, self-serving religious interpretations, and peer-based circular reasoning.In 1994, more than a decade after the story in The Covenant ends, reality landed in the lap of the white South African government. And to its credit, their leaders cooperated with the majority of South Africans to bring about a peaceful end to their institutional racism. Some may argue that the US did the same thing much earlier. However, the reality is that freedoms in the US allowed for the circumvention of laws by pushing minority repression underground. Racially discriminatory laws were transformed into racially biased unwritten codes of conduct that still permeate US society today.In continuing with the parallels between the two countries, the most alarming aspect of this book is the process that the South African minority used to enact their racial agenda. As white Americans slowly diminish into a new minority, their actions look very much like those of the South African minority of the past. They are using the constructs of government to secure power including gerrymandering control of state legislatures and congressional districts, passing laws aimed at disenfranchising non-white voters, and electing nationalists leaders who display a obvious racial favoritism towards the emerging white minority.South Africa could serve as a tangible model for the new white minority in the US to gain control of the nation. And even more concerning is that the government of the United States still possesses a built in favoritism towards the rural states where most of the new minority reside; a favoritism that is not unlike the one that existed in South Africa prior to 1994.The Covenant, as a work of historical fiction, is very long (like this ). However, the long detailed history imparted by Michener all leads up to the book’s ending at the zenith of apartheid and the beginnings of its downfall. The book gives the reader a true sense of the beliefs and fallacies that were fermented and reaffirmed over centuries in the minds of the Afrikaners who ended up governing the nation, and leaves no room for speculation as to why apartheid came into being....more",Notes are private!,0,21,2,"Jul 25, 2021not set","Aug 31, 2021Jul 2001","Jun 07, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12663.The_Covenant

In a sense, she removes the training posts from the trees that comprise the initially disciplined characters of the novel. She then allows these characters to thrive without constraint, and they proceed to grow in ways that would otherwise be impossible. This is a very subtly written book. If one could transform her writing into a painting, her brushwork would be finely detailed, to the point where the completed image would be a true reflection of the real life subject. The author develops her plot and characters without bold or overt lines, but the overall meaning is crystal clear. The exploration of love, in its many forms, is artfully woven into the fabric of the entire novel.If there is a shortcoming, it may be in a lack of a preface or foreword to better frame the reality of the setting. My crude attempt would be something like this…Though out modern times, groups of the oppressed have struggled against their oppressors. Somewhere between the extreme violence of a battle and a peaceful demonstration for civil rights, every fight for freedom can be placed and defined. As it happens, the definition of the fight can also be used to define those engaged in the struggle.

Co-written by Anna Strunsky, with whom Jack London had a brief affair, this is London’s only collaborative work.The books insightfulness comes from the two opposite positions that Kempton (written by Strunsky) and Wace (written by London) take with respect to love. Kempton explores and defends the position that love is a magical experience that is filled with feeling and emotions that may change over time, but are none-the-less always present in a relationship. Contrary to Kempton, Wace approaches love from the scientific viewpoint. He strives to dismiss the emotional aspects of love as being a hindrance to the real objective of love, which is the propagation of life.The book was written in 1903 and is therefore a bit Victorian in its views and in its style, but the subject is timeless. Therefore, a bit of forgiveness by the reader allows for an insightful investigation of love, which may very well be at the height of the human experience as well as an essential element for humanity’s survival.P.S.

London did not need to invent stories of workers losing their limbs while working for subsistence wages. London did not need to invent stories of children working for pennies in factories where they rarely enjoyed the light of day. He did not need to create Capitalists that profited from all this and professed that they were the source of joy and success in society. So yes, label The Iron Heel for what it is, propaganda, but do not think that in doing so, you've somehow disproven the truths that this book contains.The propaganda aspect of the book stems from London’s overt effort to instill greed on the part of Capitalism while maintaining complete silence regarding this basic human condition on the part of Socialism. Throughout the book, the benefactors of Capitalism are identified as people who knowingly or unknowingly enjoy rich lives paid for by the blood of workers and the souls of children. This is contrasted brightly by the intelligent and wise leaders of the Socialist movement searching for justice for all. In reality, greed is a human condition that transcends every form of societal organization including Socialism.The second point of the book brings to life the plausible way in which the governance of the United States could digress into a government of the wealthy. It highlights the methods that the wealthy would use to control the vast population of lower classes. In this part of the book, London illuminates his Iron Heel. He presents a process where the governing institutions of the US are changed into the tools of a small number of rich authoritarians: the oligarchy. In doing so, he hits upon multiple parallels that will appear in authoritarian governments of London’s future, from Hitler’s Germany to present-day Trumpism in America. London also brings to life the mass carnage of warfare that the world will eventually see in both world wars.The continued relevance of The Iron Heel stems from its truths and its visions. The book could have been better if London had recognized and addressed the shortcomings of his own beliefs. But as it is, for what it is, the Iron Heel still withstands a lot of scrutiny over a hundred years after its original publication.---Bonus Material---Comments on the Claimed Failures of SocialismFirst off, there has never been a purely Socialist state in modern times. There has never been a country where production and proceeds have been owned and shared by all inhabitants equally. There has never been a Brotherhood-of-Man, as Jack London would label such a system. Therefore, to hold up Socialism as a failure is to hold up a political system that is indeed a mixture of Capitalism and Socialism, cherry pick the failures, and label them as Socialism. The claim that Socialism leads to failure is erroneous from the initial inception of that claim.But to carry the argument further, even though Socialism is as erroneously labeled as it is, there are a select number of countries that are held up as examples of the failures of Socialism. Countries such as Brazil, Cuba, the Soviet Union, etc.. These countries are put forth by zealots of Capitalism (erroneously labeled as it is) as proof that Socialism is the all-inclusive word that completely suffices in explaining the failure of these states. Such assertions not only fail to recognize the similarities between the political systems of the failures and the successes but they also stop short at arriving at the true cause of such failures.The true problem with any form of social organization is greed that leads to corruption. I think if one were to objectively look at every failed societal organization that ever existed, one would find that corruption was the key to its demise, far more so than any political philosophy that those societies were trying to emulate. Greed must be recognized and even harnessed at levels that allow societies to prosper, but controlled to levels that prevent (or weed out) corruption. Greed cannot be eliminated and it certainly cannot be ignored.The manner in which greed can be regulated and thus, corruption minimized, is to form a government where corruption will not be tolerated. It’s actually not that difficult. Greed is common and it’s easy to understand. People know greed when they see it, but they are tolerant of its presence. A government where checks and balances exist is a necessary component, and placing people in government with high moral standards is also a necessity. In the United States, we have the former, but we recently experimented with avoiding the latter. Let us hope that we have learned from our mistakes....more",Notes are private!,2,29,2,"Jul 12, 2020not set","Jul 20, 2020not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/929783.The_Iron_Heel

Long ago, the creatures that could accept as fact the suggestions of fear were found to outlive and out-reproduce their more scientific brethren. Hence, humans came into being with the ability to believe as fact things unproven or unexplained. We became spiritual beings. We believe in dreams and we imagine what life would be like, if only if. For any given dream, there is a journey. We set out on a quest towards a vision, but along the way, reality takes its toll. By the time we reach our goal the reality of our dream may in fact be very different from our initial vision. This is what Marti Eden is about: a dream, a journey, and the end of a quest.Martin Eden makes a statement about London's own dreams and their ultimate value as he achieved his success. According to London in some of his letters that addressed Martin Eden, the only difference in the final fates of London and Eden, was perspective. London was saved by his trust in others. Through this trust he was still able find value in the life he achieved even though it was very different from the life he envisioned. I have often considered Martin Eden to be one of London's best novels. And the reason for its strength lies in how closely the story parallels London's own life. He wrote what he knew best and because of his truly personal connection to the story, his honesty exceeds his desire to simply lead his readers through a story. The book is filled with emotions and passions that cannot be anything but his own. It is filled with life as he experienced it, and as a consequence, he documents the human conditions that surrounded him nearly a century ago.---First Rread: January 2005...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 08, 2015","Dec 23, 2015","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/929782.Martin_Eden

Captain Bligh, eat your heart out. London dares to dive into the intellectual makeup of Captain Wolf Larsen, which allows his readers to test the very foundation of Larsen’s selfish acts and behaviors. The disconcerting discovery is that Wolf Larsen, as a person, is absolutely true to his environment and upbringing. It’s only when you consider the world that exists outside of the microcosm of his own small ship that Larsen’s philosophy falls apart.Additionally, the book focuses on the growth of Wolf Larsen’s polar opposite, Humphrey Van Weyden. Van Weyden is a literary gentleman and finds himself suddenly immersed in a seaman’s life of hard work and survival at sea. His transformation illustrates the human capacity to adapt, learn, and overcome in the face of adversity. Included in the story are depictions of storms in the Pacific Ocean and suffering of ordinary seamen at sea. And all of this is told with the realism that makes London’s greatest novels a pleasure to read.But I sensed that there was something more to this story. Through the biographies that I’ve read of London, the thought occurs that this novel may be allegorical to his socialist beliefs. It may be that London used the isolated setting of a small ship at sea as a means of bringing the much larger world of 1904 into focus. The strong and powerful captain, Wolf Larsen, excessively devours his own desires in a way that mimics the oligarchs of the time in their desire to devour every bit of wealth generated by society. And the altruistic Humphrey Van Weyden, weak and powerless, has no choice but succumb to Larsen’s wants. Van Weyden, like a subsistence laborer of 1904, is expendable and is only maintained in life by Larsen while Larsen gains from his presence. Along this same theme, it is through Van Weyden’s education in Larsen’s demagogue philosophy and his learning of the workings of the small world at sea that he is able to ascend above his meager predicament. Ultimately, his altruistic philosophy combines with his acquired knowledge of Larsen and transforms him into a kind and benevolent master of the London’s isolated world. As for Larsen, he ultimately depicts the logical end of the ever ongoing consumption of society’s wealth by the oligarchs.Finally, there’s the love sequence that occupies the concluding chapters of the book. While these are the weakest part of London’s writing in the novel, I cannot help but think that they depict the relationship between London and the woman that he called ""mate,"" Charmian London. Theirs was a unique relationship practically between equals, so I would imagine that their behavior in love was as unique as the love interactions depicted by London in The Sea Wolf.On multiple levels, The Sea Wolf is an intriguing book to read. It’s an engaging, haze-gray sea story with much food for thought and reflection, and its all wrapped up in a package that is dripping with the realism of Jack London’s writing....more",Notes are private!,0,28,2,"Apr 21, 2022not set","May 06, 2022not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43049.The_Sea_Wolf

In the case of this story, the environment is the harsh, hostile, deadly environment of war. While some may be ashamed for the behaviors depicted in the story, one must keep in mind that it is circumstances that creates reality. For the men of this story, and probably for most men of war, death is an act to be performed and/or experienced. It surrounds them. They breath it in with the death of those they know and they exhale it with the death of those who struggle to kill them. The reality of war causes death without conscience.It is a change in circumstances that causes a change in reality. For many, the shift in reality cannot be negotiated. The reality of peace forever torments the memories of a past reality of war. For some, the change in circumstances is ignored and the reality of peace is lost. The most dangerous among us, however, is the one who has lived in the reality of peace and glorifies an imagined reality of war. These are the people the people who carelessly wage war, subject others to a reality in stark contrast with glory, and dismiss as trivial the effects of war on those forced to survive it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2006","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12467.The_Naked_and_the_Dead

And within the context of itself, that is all it's worth. But I found more to this book within the context of what I've come to know about Hemingway, which is just enough to be a danger to my own integrity.By 1950, at the time of Across the River's publication, Hemingway had lived a hard life. He sustained injuries during his participation in three wars and he routinely abused himself through his excessive intake of alcohol. His mornings were set aside for writing and the rest of the day was dedicated to drinking. He must have begun to feel the betrayal of his body and his youthful illusions of immortality must have begun to crack. It had been ten years since the publication of his last book. Was he still relevant? I found these realities to be Hemingway's truths, which were instilled into his main character, Colonel (formerly General) Richard Cantwell.To convey these truths, Hemingway departed from his traditional approach. In his previous novels, Hemingway treated emotions as a burden. It was a product of the plot and it was just another thing that had to be dealt with gracefully by his heroes. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, Maria had to be cared for and then pushed away by Robert Jordan for the sake of duty and the greater good. She was more of a responsibility than a great love.Within Across the River and into the Trees, however, the emotional state of Richard Cantwell is something that cannot be gracefully managed. Cantwell is physically falling apart and he is grasping for youth and usefulness through his relationship with a young woman, Renata. Cantwell's feelings comprise the central message of this book and they had to be addressed by Hemingway. And even though the parallels between Cantwell and Hemingway's real life are clear, Hemingway falls short in his efforts.Cantwell's own thoughts about his age, purpose, usefulness, and mortality are engrossing. But when Hemingway translates these thoughts into to dialogue the story falls flat. Hemingway, always stoic and disciplined, could not find the words needed to express Cantwell's emotions. But Hemingway's downfall in dialogue is what I find to be interesting. Hemingway tried something new, failed, and went on to write a similar book that would win the Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes. In The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway kept and built upon the truths concerning the decay of his body and his usefulness, but he avoided the need for prolonged dialogue about the emotions that such realities instill. He basically used the best parts of Across the River and into the Trees and enhanced them in The Old Man and the Sea. I think Across the River and into the Trees has a meaningful and useful place among the novels that were published in Hemingway's lifetime. I consider it a study, or a preliminary sketch, even though Hemingway probably never thought about this book in that way, until it was too late.---First Read: September 2005...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Dec 05, 2014","Dec 18, 2014","Apr 28, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10778.Across_the_River_and_into_the_Trees

The plot and characters are already known, and the mind has the luxury to pay attention to details and ideas that tended to be overlooked on the initial journey. Re-reading is filled with information that is free to float into the reader’s view. This is my second time reading To Have and Have Not and I would say that this time through was the more enjoyable of the two. My initial reading created the impression of a poorly assembled story that depicted the stereotypical Hemingway hero. Harry Morgan was created by Hemingway to suffer and to bear his burdens with dignity. Of all his novels, this one is probably the most simplistic when it comes to forcing a Hemingway hero to live by the “grace under pressure” code of conduct.This time through, however, opened up the idea that To Have and Have Not was a dedication to the modern-day working poor, the “conches,” of Key West during the Great Depression. Based on my slowly acquired understanding of Hemingway, I believe that he had an affinity for these simple, hard-working people. Hemingway drank cheap rum with them in the clapboard bars of Kew West, and considered their hard work worthy of his respect.The conches grubbed, fished, and smuggled in order to live, and they lived at the bottom of society. They were often times considered as outcasts by an absentee government. They were in the way of an outside desire to transform Key West into a luxury destination populated by the type of rich tourists depicted in Hemingway’s novel. The conches were also on the receiving end of fallout from the political turmoil and revolutionary fighting taking place in Cuba located just 90 miles away.To Have and Have Not is still a poorly assembled novel, but it captures a people in their time. It’s a snapshot of them. Consequently, it captures a people that would have otherwise been forgotten....more",Notes are private!,0,20,2,"Apr 03, 2022not set","Apr 06, 2022not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4630.To_Have_and_Have_Not

I remember that after completing it the first time, I found it to be amazing in terms of style and riveting with regards to the story. Hemingway’s writing was phenomenally different and a fresh change from anything that I had read before. For Whom the Bell Tolls was my first Hemingway and it was the first time that writing style asserted itself as a sort of fourth dimension in reading.The story was one that focused on duty and responsibility, traits that still impress me. The main character, Robert Jordan, was a hero that faced a virtual one-way mission with dignity, clarity of mind, and respect for his cause. He was the personification of grace under pressure and he predated the likes of Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt. But Jordan was better. He was just a simple Spanish teacher before his calling. He was both somebody and anybody all at the same time.Now here we are, after reading dozens of Hemingway novels and stories, and For Whom the Bell Tolls only gets better. During this third reading, the story opened up into a beautiful novel of interesting characters and the war faded into a secondary but influencing happenstance. The novel also takes on a naturalist theme where the scenery and nature of Spain are beautifully captured in almost every scene. During this third reading of the novel, I became aware that Hemingway was creating something more than just a story. He loved Spain, its people and its culture, just as anyone loves a place that is wholly different but welcoming to the kind-hearted. But the civil war destroyed Hemingway’s Spain and I think Hemingway knew that no matter which side won the war, the Spain that he loved would forever be lost. To this end, I believe that For Whom the Bell Tolls is also a sort of memorial. This book is his attempt to capture in words what every memorial tries to capture in stone for all of the future: this is the breadth of my love and the weight of its loss....more",Notes are private!,0,28,2,"Jan 02, 2019not set","Jan 17, 2019not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46170.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls

Our leaders appeal to nonsensical emotion or simply lie to those that are willing to accept the miss truths out of loyalties akin to religious beliefs. They wish to take us down a path that has been traveled many times in the past in order to further secure their power. Today’s condition, however, is promising. Our present farce is a result of technicalities that favored a minority as opposed to widespread political support. We’ve never been more reasonable as a society and we’ve grown since the days of WWI. And while that growth has not been smooth, it is growth nonetheless. Along that path of growth rests A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway presents a critical view of war and questions some of the fundamental reasons why we go to war. He presents a story that examines a duty to reason and compares that with the blind loyalties that permeate war. Hemingway contends that once government forsakes reason, abstract loyalties should be forsaken in the same breath. It is through this individual process of thought that the atrocities of war can be avoided in the future. While it’s obvious that Hemingway was ahead of his time, he was certainly on the right track. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,2,"Jun 27, 2019not set","Jul 07, 2019not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms

In truth, he’s a symbol for any soldier of any war that has served and been deeply affected by combat. I was able to see the pain of Jake’s injury, which is hidden just below the surface of everything that he shows to the world. It all seemed very analogous to the psychological stress of combat that plagues so many of our veterans even though we never see it. Jake moves through life with his silent handicap and in doing so constantly fights a battle between who he wanted to be and who he has become.Along these same lines, I saw Lady Ashley, Brett, as symbolic of the benefits brought about by the sacrifices made by Jake and the veterans of WWI. She is taking the new, war-free Europe by storm and abandoning all the old traditions. She loves Jake but does not offer any sort of commitment to him or gratitude. Her grasps for the moment eliminate any sort of retrospective perspective. She is carefree and symbolizes the spirit of the Roaring 20s.The very end of the novel suggests the incompatibility between Jake and Brett. In doing so, it also suggests the incompatibility between the carefree times of the 1920s and the solemn nature of the former soldiers that survived the war and brought those times into being.---This is my third reading of The Sun Also Rises with each reading being about ten years apart. In looking back, I find that I latched on to a different element of Hemingway’s story each time. In my 30's I loved the stoic code-hero character represented by Jake Barnes. Chaos happens all around Jake. His friends are a personal embarrassment who are all bad drunks. He is a respected aficionado of bullfighting in its native land and yet his fellow Spanish comrades of the sport hold his friends in contempt. And the girl that he loves dismisses him out of hand. Yet, he keeps his cool and never behaves badly. He acts out the meaning of grace under pressure.In my 40's I loved the rustic travel elements of the novel. Hemingway brought to life the simple pleasures of sitting in a cafe in Paris. Where drinks with friends, under an awning overlooking a street, could be a complete slice of life all on its own. The old-world Spanish setting of Pamplona is made real complete with the hot sun, but also tempered with the contrasting coolness of both shade and breeze. And he assures us that staying in a modest but well-cared for hotel can evoke the feeling of being at home in a place that is far from home. Now in my 50's I found the relationships to be my focus. An entire mix of hopelessness, jealousy, raw attraction, and desperation all plague these characters. The men in the novel all take a turn at dancing with the idealized and deeply flawed Brett Ashley. And one by one, their individualized dreams of relationship perfection are all shown to land far from reality. There is one man, however, that ultimately comes to see a life with Brett Ashley for what it would truly be. For him, the sun also rises.The complexity of this novel combined with its brevity shows how hard Hemingway worked to produce his literary diamond; where all the fluff is cut away leaving a book that feels inviting to the imagination. As it is, it seems slightly too long for being so short of a book. As such, I wonder what I’ll find next in it while reading it in my 60's....more",Notes are private!,1,33,3,"Sep 05, 2023Jan 20, 2021not set","Sep 09, 2023Jan 27, 2021not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3876.The_Sun_Also_Rises

I love his sparse use of prose and the imagery that forms in my mind based on the experiences-in-common between the writer and me. Hemingway knew, for instance, that I would have enough life experience to fully comprehend an image of a swordfish leaping from the sea at the end of a fishing line without writing pages of descriptive narrative. After this second read, my first impression still remains in tact but I also picked up on some of the secondary themes within the story. I perceived the tragedy that is old age in that the physical failings of the human body prevent life experience from being brought to bear against physical challenges. The theme of grace under pressure is present as Santiago continuously analyzes and adapts to the ever-changing challenges that confront him while alone at sea. Also, the lines between necessity, pride, and greed are explored. Santiago's blind desire to catch a fish that will revive an image of youthful strength and save himself from working for a prolonged period of time obscures his ability to consider the obvious impossibility of ever bringing the fish to port and to market.As for the symbolism, I believe that Hemingway is simply drawing from common experiences at large in order to develop scenes within the minds of his readers. While there can be no doubt about the intended similarities of Santiago stumbling while carrying the mast of his boat and the story of Jesus stumbling while carrying the cross, the latter is simply a well know image of suffering that occurred after a long travail. This image simply and efficiently works with the corresponding moment in the story. From here, however, an entire fantasy could be constructed that weaves this and other elements from the book into a symbolic story that would be appropriate for the bible.From all the biographical information that I have read on Hemingway, I just cannot believe that an underlying symbolic story would be a preconceived goal for this book. Hemingway approached everything that he did in life head-on. The writing of a book that said one thing in words and imagery while attempting to convey a different story through symbolism would probably be perceived by Hemingway as a cowardly and dishonorable way to write something worth writing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 22, 2011","Jun 24, 2011","Apr 28, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2165.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea

I now see that the younger me fell for the temptation. Huxley made it ever so easy to judge his world. He provided guidance through his characters who pointed out the differences between Huxley’s society and my own. They made it easy to find Huxley’s world immoral and oppressive in comparison to my own. I now see that my act of judgement was misguided in that it fell in line with the judgements that have been made by every self-righteous society gazing upon another since the beginning of societies. The result being that the stronger society kills the weaker one and in doing so, kills something that actually worked. Huxley’s Brave New World works. Its people are happy and want for nothing. Even the outcasts have a home where they are free to practice their beliefs in peace. And while I may view Huxley's world as oppressive, oppression is a matter of perspective and a perspective born out of pure ignorance is still a valid perspective. It's only when the outcasts of society, or outsiders, start to impose their beliefs from without that societies fail and all is lost.At the same time, as a message about the future, Brave New World is marching towards fruition. The existence of independent societies are becoming a thing of the past as our current world progresses towards a unified global society. As this world makes its way towards its destiny, it is important to keep in mind that in order to achieve Huxley’s perfection, we will all have to give up a good portion of our human nature. Therefore, we need to constantly look for better ways to achieve our destiny before it's too late; before humanity is reduced to its lowest common denominators. ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,2,"Feb 03, 2020not set","Feb 10, 2020not set","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World

It’s a book filled with elaborate parties, elaborate At face value, I see this book as a somewhat cheesy love story involving a bunch of rich people. It’s a book filled with elaborate parties, elaborate homes, and elaborate things. Throw in the story of Tom Buchanan's love triangle and this book becomes deserving of a shirtless Fabio, blazing his embrace across the cover of a paperback that will soon be pulped.But look closer, as the gigantic blue eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg urge the reader to do, and you’ll see that this is a book about life, about people, and how people move through life in response to two primary and opposite forces that define our every action: reason and passion. The paper-thin Harlequin Romance cover becomes transparent and the characters transform themselves into the best and worst parts of us all. The Great Gatsby is a book filled with characters that reason, characters that reason incorrectly, and characters that are consumed by passion.But why is The Great Gatsby often referred to as the “Great American Novel”? Yes, there is a rags-to-riches element of the story and the setting captures the life-styles of a range of classes, but other books do these same things and do them to a much greater level of success.So, I’m left with the rationalization that America, as echoed in the pages of this book, possesses a wanting of Nick’s; contains a vast number of Wilson’s and Buchanan’s; has a spattering of Jordan Baker’s who entertain us even though their feats may be comprised of illusions. And occasionally there is a Gatsby; someone who’s destiny was corrupted by his passion, which may indeed speak to the very nature of the American Dream....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 07, 2013","Jan 26, 2013","Apr 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby
