Olga Dies Dreaming author González returns with a fiery, campus-y novel set in the worlds of academia and fine art. In 1985, artist Anita de Monte falls to her death during a nasty fight with her husband, the prominent artist Jack Martin, whose fragile ego is threatened by Anita’s burgeoning success. Jack calls it an accident and carries on like nothing happened, but Anita is determined to make him pay. Flash forward to 1998, when Brown art student Raquel is preparing to launch her senior thesis on Martin, but gets sidetracked when she learns of Anita’s forgotten art—and suspicious death. Raquel admires the work and feels a kinship with its creator, another outsider in the art world. Raquel may hang with the white and rich Art History Girls, but as a first generation Puerto Rican college student, she can’t—and doesn’t want to—be mistaken for one. Plus the ways her own aspiring artist boyfriend’s actions resemble Jack’s are deeply unsettling. Smart and sophisticated (and more than a little sweary), this scintillating sophomore effort was everything I hoped for and more....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,not set,not set,"Mar 15, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127306192-anita-de-monte-laughs-last

Her new novel about adoption is easy to read and hard to describe; I'm so glad we got to talk about her new release live at our Spring Book P event! The story begins with an actress named India, who finds herself at the center of a media firestorm for criticizing her new movie in the press. Her precocious ten-year-old twins, recognizing their mother is living a PR nightmare, take it upon themselves to seek help from a person uniquely positioned to do so: a family member their mother doesn’t know they know about, and whom they’ve never met. Alternating between the present day media fracas and India’s early days as an actress, and moving between LA, Seattle, and NYC, Frankel firmly roots her tale in the world of theater and film, exploring the many forms family can take and the limits of love. With its unforgettable scenes, bold plot choices, Shakespeare and musical theater references, and at least one gasp-out-loud moment, this is a book I’m still thinking about months after turning the final page.

Somerset Maugham came to write his short story ""The Letter,"" which was hugely popular in its time (largely because it was adapted into a widely-seen play and then a film starring Bette Davis). Maugham, who was vastly more successful in his day than I had realized, was known to mine real life for material, particularly the relationships of his friends and acquaintances. Eng focuses here on Maugham's visit to Penang in 1921 to visit an old British friend and his wife. Shortly upon his arrival, he learns he's lost his life savings to a bad investment, and must quickly write another novel to fund his much-desired further travels. With a novelist's ear for scandal, he quickly suspects the wife has stories to tell that he can then re-tell on the page: of her loveless marriage, her relationship with a Chinese revolutionary, and especially of her friend who will soon stand trial for murder. You don't need to be familiar with Maugham's work to enjoy this lush historical look at colonial Malaysia and the disrupting influence of a famous writer on the hunt for material—but you'll likely want to read ""The Letter"" because of it....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jan 17, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215270-the-house-of-doors

Her relationships with her Chinese and Chinese American family members are fraught, and her inability to read cues makes friendship and neighborliness tricky, but her great love for her work is utterly uncomplicated—that is, until her father dies. Her workaholism has always been seen as an attribute in her NYC hospital, but when she takes just 48 hours off to fly to Shanghai and back for his funeral, HR steps in and makes her take some extended time off. Without the distraction of work, Joan is forced to reckon with the things she's been avoiding, in all their complexity and ambiguity. But then COVID-19 enters the story, with devastating effects in her personal and professional life.

(This beginning reminds me of that of one of my favorite novels, This Must Be the Place.) This discovery prompts her to recall a pivotal year in her early twenties, when she met her best friend James working at the bookstore and their lives soon became enmeshed with those of the professor and his wife. A provocative novel with an enticing plot that thoughtfully interrogates themes of power, class, art, and the queer experience; I adored the Irish accents in Tara Flynn's excellent narration....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,not set,not set,"Oct 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63094957-the-rachel-incident

This compulsively readable literary mystery begins when a father vanishes in a D.C. area park—and the only witness to his disappearance is his 14-year-old autistic son, who doesn’t speak and thus lacks the means to verbally communicate with his family about what happened. What begins as a missing persons case quickly develops into an even more ominous investigation. First-person narrator Mia, a college student at home in 2020 due to the pandemic, takes us deep inside the workings of her Korean-American family as she relays all that unfolds during the bewildering three days following her father’s disappearance.

When Charlie enrolls as a new student she's never met another deaf student; her parents had kept her in traditional school for far too long, hoping her issues with hearing would simply disappear once they got her cochlear implants dialed in. Charlie knew that would never happen, and quickly makes herself at home in her new school setting, not knowing the school's very existence is actively being threatened. I knew little about deafness and the deaf community prior to reading this book, and ate up all the details about various facets of the deaf experience deaf author Nović wove into the story. I especially loved the audiobook narrated by Lisa Flanagan and Kaleo Griffith, with the sound of signing over the speech when ASL was being used.

The book has serious staying power, remaining readable and relevant even all these years later, and continues to influence and inspire new works of contemporary fiction. When we meet Tom Ripley, he's engaged in a bit of petty crime in NYC. But then a chance meeting changes the course of his life, and he soon departs for Italy with the task of persuading an old friend to return home to work in the family business and see his ailing mother. At first Ripley admires his old friend, then envies him ... and before long he decides he wants to become him.

The story benefits from Jain's skillful unwinding (and escalation) of the narrative: an encroaching storm heightens the tension, and the multiple points of view are devastatingly effective. (I gasped aloud at one point when the perspective shifted—and I was suddenly inside the mind of the victim's creepy friend, who was about to reveal all the secrets he'd been keeping.) As the police search for the perpetrator, and the whole community tries to control the narrative that explains WHY this crime was committed, Jain examines how each character's fears and motivations are shaded by privilege, race, and, status, and how their best intentions compel them to obfuscate what really happened....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,not set,not set,"Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61319775-our-best-intentions

In the opening pages of this time-travel mystery, a British woman watches in horror from her window as her 18-year-old son stabs a man on the street. A horrific scene ensues, the police take him away, she spends the evening at the station, in shock and agony. But then Jen wakes up the next morning, only to find that it’s not the next morning at all, but the day before the crime occurred. When she wakes up the next morning, it’s the day before that. Jen seems to be living her life backward, and—with the help of a physicist friend-of-a-friend—determines that the only way to break out of the time loop is to “undo” whatever event put her son on the path to murder. To do that she has to go far, far back in time, getting to the roots of her most important relationships.

This historical novel is very much in the vein of Ann Patchett’s The Patron Saint of Liars and Dolen Perkins-Valdez’s Take My Hand. The story centers two young Black women in the 1950s: Ruby is an ambitious high school sophomore in a single-parent family of limited means in Philadelphia; Eleanor is a promising student at Howard University who, despite her working class upbringing, soon fines herself moving in the upper echelon of DC’s Black society. Both women have big hopes and dreams for their futures: they want love and marriage and family, as well as college degrees and satisfying careers. But shortly after each falls in love, big changes happen—and hard choices have to be made. A good story, well told, with a satisfying ending.

Roy and Celestial are young, middle-class, in love, and ""on the come-up,"" as Roy likes to put it. But only 18 months into their marriage, Roy is sentenced to twelve years in prison—for a crime he didn't commit. Roy needs Celestial behind him if he is to survive. She needs to cut him loose if she is to do the same. In his letters, Roy writes, ""I'm innocent."" But Celestial tells him, ""I'm innocent, too."" If everyone is innocent, where does the fault lie?

Now he’s taken a summer job as a fly-fishing guide at a luxe resort that caters to celebrity clientele. He’s lucky, it seems—it’s rare for a guide to leave mid-season, but his predecessor did. Jack is paired with Allison, a country music star born and raised in East Tennessee who loves to fish for the same reasons Jack does—to enjoy the full absorption the sport requires. Jack’s first clue that something is amiss is the camera. Totally fascinating—this was the first book I’ve read that incorporates Covid into the plot in a necessary and artful manner.When What Should I Read Next had its 300th episode, we knew we wanted to celebrate with our Patreon supporters in a big way.

Morrison described it as “an experiment in the removal of all racial codes from a narrative about two characters of different races for whom racial identity is crucial.” It's an ingenious little puzzle of a story about two young girls named Twyla and Roberta; one is black and the other white. They meet in a shelter when they are eight years old, wards of the state because one's mother ""danced all night"" and the other's was sick. They become fast friends during the four months they lived there and their paths intermittently cross during the following decades. Morrison never answers the question she poses, leaving it to the reader to decide which is black and which is white. Recitatif is only 38 pages but your book club could wrestle with the story forever.

That's almost what Alissa Wilkinson is answering in this collection and her guest list is exquisite. The subtitle's reference to ""revolutionary women"" includes names I expected to find, like Laurie Colwin, but also so many others—Edna Lewis, Hannah Arendt, Alice B. Toklas, Maya Angelou, and many more mentions besides as these women rub shoulders with all kinds of people in their places and times. I was especially not expecting to see Octavia Butler. If a small and short deep dive is possible, that's what she's doing in these pages. There's a recipe at the end of each chapter that's indicative of each woman's life and work. What she's talking about here is how she says these are women with strong opinions, but also generous hearts and who make strong arguments because they believe in them, but always do it with grace.

Two weeks before the most important competition of his life, he opens his violin case after getting off a flight and discovers his $10 million dollar Stradivarius is gone—replaced by a white Chuck Taylor and a ransom note. I was hooked! Slocumb then takes us back in time to show us how Ray, a young Black man from North Carolina who doesn't have the family wealth or privilege so many of his classical music peers do, fell in love with both music and his great-great grandfather's fiddle, and came to devote his life to winning the Tschaikovsky Competition—and how he came to own a $10 million Strad! We also experience many painful and heart-pounding instances of the racism Ray experiences as a Black man moving through a space that's predominantly white—and how his Blackness is used against him by those who wish to claim his violin as their own.

Auden, who once wrote that “art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.”...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,not set,"Sep 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50609112-breaking-bread-with-the-dead

This dystopian novel with echoes of The Dog Stars and The Road is set in the not-too-distant future, where fires have ravaged the globe and religious extremists have seized control of governments. This is the story of Lark, a teenage refugee who fled Maine with his family hoping to find sanctuary in Ireland, the last country rumored to be accepting refugees—only to discover upon arrival that the borders have closed and his perilous journey has only just begun. Dejected, starving, and alone, he sets out for Glendalough, the ""thin place"" his mother told him about before she died. Along the way he befriends Seamus, a trustworthy beagle who somehow managed to survive even after dogs were eradicated, and encounters others who wish to both help and harm him.

She's (mostly) at peace with who she is, plus she’s proud of fighting for her clients—even if that same fierceness has always spelled disaster for her love life. But Nora has one soft spot: her beloved baby sister Libby. When Libby persuades her to take a sisters’ trip to the too-cute-to-be-real hamlet of Sunshine Falls, Nora is gobsmacked to encounter her professional nemesis Charlie Lastra, a famously grumpy and inconveniently handsome editor who despises Nora. Soon the sparks are flying—and Nora has to keep reminding herself she hates his guts, lest she succumb to their undeniable chemistry.

As summer begins, we meet three young girls, all about age 11, who've formed a comfortable trio and spend their summer days double-dutching on the hot concrete under the watchful eyes of their neighbors, who have all been alerted they'll soon be displaced and moved (if they're lucky) to a different apartment block. When a new girl joins their friend group the circle, instead of growing larger, is broken, and things will never be the same for any of the four, who are largely left on their own to deal with the escalating threats around them.

The premise is this: Emma and Leo have been happily married for ten years when Leo, an obituary writer, takes on an assignment at work. As an esteemed obituary writer, one of his jobs is to draft advance obituaries for well-known individuals so they're ready, should they be needed. As a noted marine biologist, Emma ranks an advance obit—but when Leo begins researching his wife's life, he quickly discovers the truth doesn't match the story she's told him. He doesn't even know her real name, and she's never breathed a word to him about the first love of her life. The multiple points of view Walsh employed served the story perfectly; I raced through this book to learn the truth alongside Leo. Two notes: I began this on audio, but quickly switched to print, a change I think was for the best.

Eight years later, as students at separate Boston colleges, the pair reunite and bootstrap a Tempest-inspired video game that becomes an unexpected blockbuster, cementing their future as game designers but bringing upheaval into their personal lives. I don’t have much interest in video games but I adored this book, which is ultimately about creativity and ambition, astonishing success and what comes after, and the inevitable hurts and disappointments of a life-defining friendship.

But in a bleak year, there’s a bright spot: Princess Elizabeth’s royal wedding captured the hearts of a nation, and was a beacon of hope to a country on its knees. The people insisted on a real celebration, including a beautiful gown. Robson’s story shifts among three protagonists and spans 70 years, but the common thread is Elizabeth’s gown—and specifically, the women who make it. While Robson has a fine eye for detail, and her behind-the-scenes descriptions of the fine atelier's workroom are riveting, the heartbeat of the story comes from female friendship, secret pasts, and life after loss. A must-read for fans of The Crown, and recommended for all seeking an intimate take on the often neglected postwar era.

Family stories are commonplace in fiction, but I love this one for its intricate plotting, nuanced characters, true-to-life feel, and ultimate hopefulness.

The glory days of a backwater Swedish town are gone—except when it comes to hockey. In Beartown, hockey is everything, and the players on the boys' A-team have god-like status. But this isn't just a hockey story. One night after a huge win, the teens throw a raucous party to celebrate—and what happens there splinters the community.

Set in Gilded Age Atlanta, this YA pick features a strong teenage heroine who gets herself into hot water when her anonymous advice column soars in popularity. Chinese American Jo works as a lady’s maid for the grumpy, privileged daughter of a wealthy white family. But in her scarce free time, she writes an anonymous advice column called Dear Miss Sweetie. Pretty soon Jo's sassy column is the talk of the town, and the fussy society ladies yearn to know Miss Sweetie's true identity, never suspecting the peril that would put Jo and her family in. This engaging novel shines a light on little-known historical events, something I always love in this genre.While this is a YA novel, it can be read and loved by adults (obviously), and I expect many older middle grade readers will also find much to enjoy here. ...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,not set,not set,"Jun 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33224061-the-downstairs-girl

(Weiden is a citizen of the Sicangu Lakota Nation and received his MFA from the Institute of American Indian Arts.) Virgil Wounded Horse is a Native American vigilante for hire: when people can't get justice through the reservation's official channels they turn to him to enact their own. This happens with depressing regularity because of the 1885 Major Crimes Act: certain felonies can only be prosecuted by the federal government, but at their discretion—and they typically decline to prosecute any case that doesn't include murder. Weiden says in his Author's Note—which you absolutely must read—that this circumstance is factual and all-too-real. When Virgil's nephew gets entrapped in a fake drug bust, authorities more or less force the young teen to take a dangerous undercover assignment so they can nail the men who are trafficking heroin on the reservation. While the story is solid, this book shines for its setting, and its powerful exploration of identity. Though this reads as a standalone, Weiden left the door wide open for a sequel; I'm certainly interested in reading more. Though the story is rarely graphic in portraying violence, the novel does begin with Virgil knocking out a child molester's teeth in a parking lot, please be mindful of the associated content....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48678117-winter-counts

I loved this book for its voice: Norah is a remarkable narrator of her mother's story, and I loved the sly way she lets her own story slip into the frame.

But if you're intrigued by the idea of reading about a cluster of characters whose lives overlap in interesting ways over a span of decades, and who all have to find their own way to cope in the midst of a pandemic, this is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,not set,not set,"Aug 23, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52541990-songs-for-the-end-of-the-world

When a magazine publisher weds a handsome reality tv star, she wants her wedding to be magazine-worthy: the designer gown, the atmospheric location, everything perfect to the last detail. But when the guests arrive, including old colleagues, boarding school friends, unreliable family, and untrustworthy friends—things begin going wrong, as long-buried secrets threaten to burst forth at exactly the wrong time. And then they find the dead body. Told in rotating points of view, this was cleverer than I'd expected. An enjoyable mystery that's excellent on audio—to my American ears, the accents were GREAT.(I would have appreciated a content warning for self-harm; a murder mystery is certain to have triggers but that one took me by surprise.)...more",Notes are private!,0,131,1,not set,not set,"Aug 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51933429-the-guest-list

The story begins in France, 1714: a girl is running for her life. She's been warned to never pray to the gods that answer after dark, but she's desperate to escape an unwanted marriage—and so makes a deal with the devil. In doing so, she gains immortality—but only slowly does she realize that she's given up the possibility that anyone will remember her, ever. Not her legacy, her existence, or even her name.

(I mean, I do love me a sweet story that takes place in a small town diner, but I don't want ALL my love stories set in those quaint settings!) And I love how in her latest book, her previous character's MOM takes center stage. If you’ve read Jasmine Guillory before, you’ll remember Maddie, Alexa’s best friend in The Wedding Date and the female lead ofThe Wedding Party. Maddie is a personal stylist, and in a fortunate turn of events, she’s been hired to dress the duchess for the holiday season. She’s going to England, and she wants to bring her mom, who’s only been out of the country once before. And so 54-year-old Vivian Forest, a black social worker from Oakland, suddenly finds herself in England living like royalty—literally. She was ready to encounter new people, and new experiences, but she wasn’t prepared to meet Malcolm Hudson, the Queen’s very handsome private secretary. He begins by showing her around just to be polite, but it soon becomes something more. It’s been ages since she met a man she actually enjoys spending time with, and how strange it is that the man she looks forward to seeing is in England, of all places, and working for the Queen. It’s totally bizarre to Maddie, but it’s also totally happening. This book is fast and fun, and funny, you can fly through the 300 pages, and it will be an absolute delight for anyone who enjoyed Guillory’s previous works or is interested in royal life.

Our heroine is Daphne Berg, a popular plus-size fashion influencer. Daphne’s hard-earned equilibrium is rattled when her old frenemy Drue surfaces after a 7-year absence, begging Daphne to lend her platform and presence to Drue’s high-society wedding to a reality tv star.

The story begins with a shooting: it's 1969, in the Cause Houses housing project in south Brooklyn; a beloved drunk deacon named Sportcoat wanders into the courtyard and shoots the drug dealer he'd once treated like a son point-blank, in front of everyone. After this jolting beginning, McBride zooms out to show the reader how this violent act came to take place, exploring the lives of the shooter and the victim, the victim's bumbling friends, the residents who witnessed it, the neighbors who heard about it, the cops assigned to investigate, the members of the church where Sportcoat was a deacon, the neighborhood's mobsters (and their families).

Yet she’s distraught when the police show up to announce that Diana has died by apparent suicide—and even more so when they reveal that the evidence points to possible murder. As we get to know the family members, we discover each of them had a motive for the crime, and stood to benefit from her death. The story is told alternately from Lucy and Diana’s points of view, so we get to see how badly they misunderstand each other through the years. But is it bad enough to lead to murder?

I'm pleased to FINALLY correct what fell like a major omission in my reading life: I've owned this book for ages and finally pulled it off the shelf. Retired schoolteacher Olive is not keen about the way her small Maine town is changing.

Her gift at illuminating life's everyday moments and then somehow naturally tying these minor occurrences to the major events in a person's life, even if they occurred decades hence, is astounding.

This is the latest urgent recommendation from my fourth grader, who fell in love with Eoin Colfer novels this year because—funny thing—our  What Should I Read Next producer Brenna suggested them. When Brenna recommends books, we sit up and listen. The Supernaturalist is a middle grade standalone novel about a 14-year old orphan named Cosmo Hill living in the dystopian world of Satellite City, where his assigned societal role is to serve as a guinea pig for food and drug testing—which is exactly as scary as it sounds. But then he discovers he possesses a rare gift, and joins up with a team of vigilantes who share his gift and dedicate themselves to using it to do a little bit of good in their crummy world. But their mission changes when they discover they've all been lied to.

The title comes from Martin Luther King, Jr's Riverside Speech, in which he said, ""We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a “thing-oriented” society to a “person-oriented” society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered....""In this book, Wilson-Hartgrove argues that right now in America we need another revolution of values. There was a time—not that long ago—when religious leaders viewed voting rights, equal protection under the law, economic justice, peace, and the environment as moral issues. But those once-esteemed values have been the victims, not the beneficiaries, of the religious right's culture war. In this book Wilson-Hartgrove seeks to shed light on the history of how we got to where we are as a culture right now, and how we might together make a better future. I'm tempted to quote his entire introduction here, but I'll limit myself to this: ""The culture warriors who challenged me to practice my faith in public life were not wrong to suggest that the gospel of Jesus is political. Their error was in believing that the enemy of morality was progressive values and not the genocidal white supremacy and patriarchy that have compromised Christian witness throughout US history. This was not an innocent miscalculation. As this book shows, people of considerable means invested an incredible amount of resources in encouraging this particular lie.... If a multiethnic democracy is possible in twenty-first century America, it will depend on a moral movement that resists the false gods of Christian nationalism and rediscovers a biblical vision for justice and mercy in our common life."" Something I especially appreciated about this book was that while Wilson-Hartgrove writes from the perspective of a religious leader, he explicitly includes a broad range of voices in this work, both Christian and non-Christian, and draws on wisdom from black, native, Latinx, and Asian communities.Highly, highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Nov 30, 2019","Dec 03, 2019","Nov 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50750292-revolution-of-values

I'd like to share a quote from Annie Dillard that captures why this topic is so important to me, and to you:How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing.When we spend our time overthinking, that's what we're doing.Nobody wants to live a life characterized by overthinking. I'm certain you have better things to do. This book is for those of us who, like me, want to live our lives well. And we know living well depends upon thinking well—about the things that matter. We want to learn how to overcome decision fatigue, stop feeling overwhelmed, cut the second-guessing, and bring more peace and joy into our lives. That means learning strategies for approaching both our minutes and our days. Over the years, I've seen how simple strategies and subtle shifts of perspective trigger lightbulb moments that make some aspect of life easier. These small shifts, taken one at a time, are just that: small. But cumulatively, they've transformed life. I wanted to share this information with others, and that's how I came to write this book. As I learned more and more about overthinking, I was shocked by how many facets of our lives overthinking touches—even for those of us who consider ourselves to be decisive! I wanted to write a book that reflects both the far-reaching, destructive effects of overthinking and the not-always-obvious ways we can learn to do better. This is that book. The topic sounds like a downer, but the book is not. It's a practical read, but also a fun one, full of insight, encouragement, and JOY.

(I also want to note for sensitive readers that there’s a brief but disturbing reference to razor blades very early in the book, on page 11 in my copy, as the characters are all in dismal places when we meet them, but want to emphasize that while hard things may happen in this story, the telling is not graphic in any way.)It didn’t take long for the story to sweep me away. I found this to be an absorbing tale of friendship, and redemption, and the extraordinary transformative power of love. I also love Marais’s style: there’s a great Jane Bennet cameo, and brief appearances by real-life historical figures like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jun 26, 2019","Nov 20, 2019","Jun 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42412126-if-you-want-to-make-god-laugh

I enjoy the genre sometimes dubbed fi-sci: fiction steeped in the world of science, and Freudenberger's new release takes place largely in the theoretical physics department of MIT. Helen is a physicist whose professional life is on track: her work on five-dimensional spacetime and black holes has earned her worldwide acclaim. But her personal life is thrown into disarray when she receives word that her best friend has unexpectedly died.

Cut off from her daughter, she cannot leave the grounds and she has no freedom. And she dare not risk what will happen if she tries.

When I shared my book haul on Instagram, readers noticed my mistake and assured me the 1995 Pulitzer winner was well worth my time. The book details the life of Daisy Stone Goodwill, from her eventful birth in a small Manitoba town to her death in Florida eight-ish decades later. There was much to appreciate in this well-drawn chronicle of a so-called ""ordinary"" life—the prose is beautiful; so many sentences shimmer—yet I never felt emotionally invested in the story.

Enter Edith, an elderly stranger Clare connects with instantly, who nudges Clare to cancel her wedding to a man who scares her. Not long after, Clare receives notice that Edith has died, and bequeathed her a strange gift—her house. Clare seeks refuge there after her nonwedding, and soon learns hints of the past role the house—and Edith—played in a “relocation system” that served women fleeing domestic violence in the 1950s.

In this first installment of the Commissario Brunetti mysteries, a renowned opera conductor is found dead in his dressing room, a victim of cyanide poisoning. It's significant to the story that this is a particularly painful way to die. As the investigation unfolds, it's clear the man had a dark past and many enemies, and that the perpetrator wanted to make his victim suffer. But why? I was hooked on the premise and raced to the ending. Maybe it was the poison, but this felt very Agatha Christie to me, but it does have enough of the personal element to land with Penny, French, and Crombie fans.

I'll share a link so you can listen, but here's the short version: This book is all about loving the place you live, which is relevant because so many people in the United States move house every year. (Warnick's description of just how many made me giggle: she calls it ""a national game of musical chairs with 36 million players."") Warnick draws on a great deal of research about mobility, happiness, demographics, and place attachment to guide her readers in what works and what doesn’t when it comes to finding geographical and community contentment, but the book doesn’t have that textbook feel. It unfolds like a conversation with a friend who’s telling you about the stress of her recent move, the perks and challenges of her new community, the actions she’s experimenting with in an attempt to feel more settled.What Warnick found in her research was that people who love their communities don't necessarily live in great places—they might, or they might not. But they ARE extremely proactive about the ways they engage in those communities. This is good news for anyone on the move, or who wishes to bloom where they’re planted, and deepen connections where they already are. Highly recommended for data and planning nerds like myself, and for anyone who's new to their community, or wants to become more attached to it.

The author's husband died just four days after his fiftieth birthday. A few years later, Alexander looks back on their life together, their love, and the impact of that loss in her life. The author is a poetry professor at Yale, which is obvious in the story's richness and language. Her source material is fantastic: Alexander is an American, born in Harlem. Her husband was born in Eritrea, in East Africa, and came to New Haven as a refugee from war. Both were artists—that’s his painting on the cover of the book—and their home sounds like this amazing, vibrant, multicultural extravaganza with food and friends and music and art.

It is a true memoir, not a collection of essays, and certainly not a padded, glammed-up collection of blog posts. And like the author, I grew up in the evangelical church and have a lot of baggage there--especially boy baggage--and I appreciated how the author was able to imbue events that may not sound super-significant on the surface (I dated a guy, he turned out to be a jerk, etc) with the weight they deserved. Typically with a memoir like this, I'd like to see a little more distance between the time of writing and the time of the events. But this was a great read, so I'll give it a pass.

The PCT has only been around for twenty years; it was completed in 1993, a western counterpart to the Appalachian Trail. Through-hikers–those who cover the entire trail–begin at the Mexican border in Southern California and cover 2,650 miles before reaching the trail’s end at the Canadian border. Hikers can’t depart until California’s late spring storms are over, which leaves only six months to make it to northern Washington before the blizzards begin. Hikers need to cover more than twenty miles a day to make it in time.Storey didn’t want to hike the trail in the first place. But her husband, a hospice director, was desperate to hike the PCT while he was in a major career transition, and Storey couldn’t bear the thought of spending six months apart. “The problem is,” she told him, “if you hike the PCT, I have to go too,” I said. “And I’m not.”But she does, eventually won over by the promise of spending six months together on the trail, far from the demands of everyday life.This is not a typical adventure memoir, but Storey is not typical PCT material. Most of the through hikers who tackle the 2,650 mile route each year are twenty-something males. But Storey and her husband are 56 and 52, respectively, when they decide to take on the trail; she calls her adventure her “two-thirds life crisis.”Adventure is no under-statement. I’m a city girl, and was genuinely surprised at how harrowing their journey was: they endure summer storms, pick their way down icy slopes, encounter a mountain lion, and nearly drown crossing a river. It’s no wonder that only half of the hikers who start out each year make it to trail’s end. The hardships of the trail make a community out of the hikers, and my favorite parts of the story involve these friends and the “trail angels” who make their journey a little easier.No spoilers here, but I wasn’t expecting Storey’s journey to unfold the way it did. 900 miles in, something unexpected occurs, and the turn of events improved my opinion of Storey–who had seemed a little self-absorbed up to that point–and the story itself....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 11, 2013","Aug 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16160298-i-promise-not-to-suffer

I heard Rosin speak back in the fall and was impressed by her insights, and found the book to be thought-provoking and compelling. Rosin offers a somewhat contrarian take on where the genders stand today. She examines hook-up culture, educational trends, and the growing chasm between the upper middle class and the rest of America. My favorite chapter was on the ""see-saw marriage;"" I did skip the chapter on increasingly female violence entirely.

Her style will be familiar to anyone who read her earlier work 168 Hours--Vanderkam herself describes All The Money as ""168 Hours, but about money instead of time."" Personally, I like Vanderkam's style, but I can see how not everyone would. I found myself constantly thinking of A Framework For Understanding Poverty as I read, trying to place Vanderkam's worldview within the categories of lower, middle and upper class. Vanderkam is solidly upper-middle class. She is writing for an educated, fairly affluent audience, and not everyone will appreciate her examples of buying expensive houses in the Philadelphia suburbs, or $22 Thomas trains for their toddlers. However, I personally love the pragmatic, no-nonsense approach she brings to money in this book. She is specifically focusing on how to use money as a TOOL to bring HAPPINESS--and this sets her apart from most financial writers I've read. She's tackling the question of how to get the most bang for your buck, happiness-wise--whether you're earning, spending, or giving the money away. 168 Hours and All the Money can be paradigm-shifting books--for the right readers. She may drive you a little batty with her high-end examples, but she may change the way you see the world at the same time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 16, 2012","Feb 19, 2012","Feb 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11797411-all-the-money-in-the-world
