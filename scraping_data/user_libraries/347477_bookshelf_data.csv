I simply didn’t expect a 469 page historical novel to hold me in such a tight grip.Historical facts are historical facts (who went where and why); it’s Fowler’s attention to detail and exquisite prose that make the book an experience. A trip across the Isthmus of Panama is as vivid as any movie; we see the flecks of dandruff in Mary Booth’s hair.A long ago teacher of mine said that there can be greater suspense in knowing what’s going to happen than in not knowing. (Think of the 1975 movie The Hindenburg.) Booth confirms that: Since we know about the story’s grim conclusion, there’s tension on every page, even when the characters are farming, riding, or visiting Niagara Falls. I knew nothing about the Booth family beyond being vaguely aware that the Edwin Booth Theater in New York was named for a relative of the most infamous Booth. Now I know that the patriarch was Junious Booth, himself a famous actor in his day, and Edwin was John W.’s brother. That still leaves another eight siblings to talk about, since Junious and Mary Booth had ten children, six of whom survived to adulthood.What’s most fascinating is how closely knit the family was. Various siblings often lived together, and Edwin rescued the family financially. Two other brothers, June and John W., went on the stage, and the three brothers once performed together. So how does what happened happen? If we knew that, maybe we could prevent it happening again. And again. And again....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Jan 17, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58502673-booth

I listened to it in on CD (remember those?) and I’ll stop for a special “wow…just wow” for Ari Fliakos, the sole narrator, who created a distinct voice for each of many (many) characters, from self-satisfied high school teacher to Norwegian immigrant. Best. Narrator. Ever.I went old school with Wellness, thanks to receiving a free copy from NetGalley. It’s a little less epic in scope, but the same way that *The Iliad* is less epic than *The Odyssey.*Jack Baker and Elizabeth Augustine meet in Chicago as college students. They come from opposite ends of the unhappy childhood spectrum: She, the daughter of old, corrupt money, and he, the son of Nebraska farmers, living out bleak lives on a bleak landscape. (Note: the “bleakness” here is a judgment call from this er, who is herself a “coastal,” if not necessarily “elite,” and prejudiced against the Flyover.) Jack believes he and Elizabeth are soulmates, fated to be together; his belief will be tested in years to come, but Wellness is in large part about the nature of belief itself.Twenty years on, Jack and Elizabeth are living, in some ways, ordinary middle-class lives, working, raising a son, and looking forward to when they can move into their “forever home,” a condo to be built in a new building.But Hill’s gift (I’m tempted to say “genius,” but the term gets overused – let’s put that a temporary hold on that one) is zeroing in on what we many of us deal with every day, from helicopter moms to Facebook junkies to juice cleanses, exposing both the hilarity and the humanity.Wellness never reads as satire, though – just really good storytelling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 16, 2023","Aug 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65650229-wellness

The stunning sentences never get in the way, though, of a tight plot and an original story. Virginia, 76 now, lives with Haru, an AI program she built based on the math professor who tutored her when she was a teen. Haru fills her every emotional need. But in classic “Frankenstein’s monster” form, he’s evolved beyond what she can control.Anything else I say might diminish the joy of peeling back the layers of Virginia’s and Haru’s stories.

In fact, I stay away from such news, because if I admire an artist, I don’t want to find out that they’re jerks IRL. I am a fan of musical theater, though, and I love Randy Rainbow’s videos, in which he creates new lyrics for Broadway tunes, so I took a chance on *Playing,* even though I risked learning that James Corden is a secret pickpocket.Come to find out that Mr. Rainbow only has praise for everyone. (A little suspiciously so, but maybe that’s me. I don’t like nearly as many people as Randy does.) He even became friends with Anthony Scaramucci. As Mr. Rainbow concludes from that episode, “Life is weird.”The book is, in part, a true memoir: Rainbow describes a problematic childhood (with the name “Randy Rainbow,” his parents might as well have written “please bully me” on his birth certificate), but never with self-pity or bitterness. I particularly appreciated his loving portrayals of the women in his life, beginning with his mother and grandmother. He also details the labor-intensive process of putting together his latter-day, highly polished videos. It’s even harder than it looks, and it looks hard.Extra points for his occasional use of Yiddish, including one word that most non-Jews will have to look up.Thank you to #NetGalley and #StMartinsPress for an advance copy in exchange for an honest .

This novel follows much the same format, for lack of a more elegant word: many characters, a lot of backstory and a few secrets. Clegg's writing is elegant, and his insight into complex relationships fascinating. We meet most of the main characters when they're in late middle-age, and it's poignant to share their experiences of looking back, and evaluating (or reevaluating) their lives.For many readers this is more than enough. It isn't for me. I need to want to know what happens next, and through most of *Day* I wasn't all that curious.

He is the single best narrator I've heard in a decade of listening to recorded books. Pittu could mimic any accent with authority, and brings the novel's best character, Boris, to brilliant life. He even made a very convincing female. (That's a compliment, Mr. Pittu!)The book could have been shorter by as much as a third, but when you're reading *or* listening to a good book, what's the hurry? Also, I was pretty darn impressed with Ms. Tartt's knowledge of such a wide array of subjects as antiques, the streets of Amsterdam, the art world -- and of course, the effects of Narcam on a heroin addict....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Feb 2014,"Sep 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

She's been a single mom, a D.C. cop, and now she's the owner of her small town's sole taxi cab.Author Tawni O'Dell grabbed me with Shae-Lynn's voice from the first sentence, and by page 3 I was deep in the story when I learned that the sister Shae-Lynn has thought dead these many years might still alive. From then on the shocks keep coming like the first warning signs of another mine collapse.This is the first book I've picked up in a long, long time that kept me entertained while nourishing me in equal measure. *Sister Mine* is funny, especially in its crackling dialogue and through Shae-Lynn's wry observations, while it also provides a fresh look at an aspect of American life that gets little exposure: the world of a small mining town. I enjoyed reading about men who take pride in doing their jobs well. I'm not ready to go down a shaft myself yet (I suffer from claustrophobia), but it was good to see the other side, so to speak, of a profession that's not real high on the prestige scale.

In fact, you'll miss a lot unless you remember your parents or grandparents dropping some Yiddish words. It seems to me that Chabon took a risky career move with this book, but I admire him all the more for that, and the writing, if possible, is even better than his Pulitzer Prize-winning *Kavalier and Clay.* *Yiddish Policeman* combines alternative history (a la Philip Roth's recent *The Plot Against America*) with noir dectective fiction and throws in a little Isaac Bashevis Singer. The sheer chutzpah of his attempt is awe-inspiring and the results are everything I would have hoped. The Yiddish detective in question is Meyer Landsman, a character strictly in the tradition of Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade, except that this cop is living in an imaginary Jewish settlement in the Alaskan panhandle, a temporary refuge for Jews to escape the Nazis. Where many an interested reader might get lost is in the Yiddish puns and Jewish history not well-known to a new, assimiliated generation, let alone non-Jews.In Chabon's world the state of Israel was never established and soon this frozen tundra, too, will be pulled out from under their community -- the rich subculture that Hitler did, for all intents and purposes, annihilate. I wasn't thrilled with some of Chabon's portrayals either of these Jews or their history: in the first place, many are thugs, and in the second, winning the War of Independence is one of the greatest moments in our history.

I kept postponing it because the premise seemed so off-putting: a gathering of elite international guests are taken hostage in an unnamed banana republic (a small South or Central American country, not the store). Yet once I resolved to get past the grim set-up I was swept away by the author's subtle, inventive and ambitious tale of the Stockholm Syndrome run amok as guerrilas and prisoners work out a way of living together over a period of months while trapped in the vice president's mansion. The book is remarkably (and happily, in my view)apolitical; the story is all about human nature and how it transcends language and culture. The common ground that does bring this unlikely group together is music, and although I prefer the middle-brow Broadway musical form to the more refined opera that touches these souls, still I could feel the passion behind the passion. The book starts surprisingly slowly, considering how many assault weapons are involved, and there are side trips into various characters' pasts that will bore some. But I'm very glad I finally got it off the shelf; I'm a better person for having read it, if not ready to run for office....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Nov 2007,"Nov 25, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto
