Although Faber redefines the notion of a long-distance relationship in interesting ways, the ""letters"" that pass between Peter Leigh and his wife Bea, as they attempt to bridge the light years, are often too simplistic and devotional. The novel works reasonably well as a subtly dystopian tale, filled with lots of peripheral unease and possible menace (aspects which may leave one more drawn to the only partially revealed and uncertain story of Bea, rather than to the more central action involving Peter). Ultimately, despite the promising investments and elements in play in Faber's broad examination of humanity, as well as the novel's admirably respectful meditation on religion and belief (with interesting moments, in particular, related to the transmission and translation of sacred texts), I ultimately wanted more philosophical heft and sophistication. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 15, 2015","Feb 04, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20697435-the-book-of-strange-new-things

We come to know them anecdotally and incrementally, but the process of accretion finally has its way with us, setting us up for a deeply moving conclusion. Throughout, Barbery’s narrative mode of mini-essays turns this into a light but often subtly profound and poetic novel of ideas. The novel tracks an ardent desire for human camaraderie and connection, inquires as to the nature and role of art and beauty in human life, and finds its central figures seeking transcendence from time and the everyday. It is a book that will both make you believe, as Kakuro does for Renee, in “the possibility of a camellia,” and alert to the minor moments of sublimity that are available to us even during our most ordinary and mundane days. Even when we drink a cup of tea, thinks Renee, linear time might be enriched by “a fragment of eternity,” and, “with each swallow, time is sublimed.” It is this kind of contemplation, this act of “placing our hearts at the edge of our souls,” that we must all learn to nurture and savor, and that might allow us to be rescued “from the pale succession of days.” The novel ends with a devastatingly moving and deeply consoling leave-taking, when someone for whom we’ve at last developed real affection learns what it means to die: “when we disappear, it is the others who die for us, for here I am, lying on the cold pavement and it is not the dying I care about; it has no more meaning this morning than it did yesterday. But never again will I see those I love, and if that is what dying is about, then it really is the tragedy they say it is.” She has few people who care about her enough to follow her poignant exhortation to “carry on with your life, and think of me with joy,” but I finished this novel feeling as if I am one of them....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 20, 2014","Nov 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog

Once begun, it was a novel that had to winAt first glance, it might be hard to get enthused about the prospects of a novel about the war in Chechnya. Once begun, it was a novel that had to win me over and earn my trust, in large part, perhaps, because I was skeptical of a young Western writer, not so far removed from his Iowa Writers’ Workshop residency, with no direct connection to the region and its warring ethnicities and sides, venturing into such traumatic terrain. But win me over Marra and Constellation did, eventually even reminding me, in some respects, of a more prose-dense and contemporary version of Ondaatje’s The English Patient. The novel takes time to gather momentum and force, and maybe, as it slides back and forth from chapter-to-chapter to years in the 1994-2004 period, it tries too hard to formalize the disjointed, broken sense of time that ensues from trauma and nearly a post-apocalyptic experience. Marra’s research, one senses, is deeply and conscientiously realized, and in such a way that it never (or rarely) seems to be “worn on its sleeve.” What eventually transfixed me were the evocations of the haunted, wintry, and forlorn landscape, and especially the indelible characters, those spectral individuals still seeking beauty, love, and life wherever (and however partially) they can. At its best, there is a hallucinatory power to this novel, marked by poetic and powerful images of the realities of war: at one point, we learn that Havaa’s parents, “among other villagers, pried toilet bowls from the rubble of collapsed houses and dragging them upside down and two by two gently set them over the unexploded shells.” And dear Havaa is surely guaranteed to linger in the reader's consciousness. At one point, the heroic doctor Sonja tries, haltingly, to comfort Havaa when the young girl asks if her missing father will ever come back. “Probably not,” Sonja tells her, and then pauses to consider her own missing sister: “I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s alive or dead. I know nothing.” Of the lost, generally, Havaa then asks, “‘How do you find them?’ She lifted her gaze to Sonja as if teetering on the precipice. ‘I don’t know, Havaa. I’m sorry. I don’t. Maybe we try to find them in other people. In kindness and generosity; those things don’t disappear.’” It’s a heartbreaking moment, full of deep pathos, and puts Sonja and Havaa at the heart of this novel’s many dreams of happier elsewheres and elsewhens, its many dreams of sanctuaries, of love and life and families restored....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 05, 2014","Nov 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

Nor should any of us turn away from it. Montaigne, after all, believed that it was a good thing to spend at least some small part of each day thinking about death; “let us deprive death of its strangeness,” he tells us, “let us frequent it, let us get used to it.” Montaigne’s urgings are all the more important given the dearth of mourning rituals in the West, a fact that O’Rourke bemoans in her book. Anguished, candid, brave, poetic, smart and scholarly, O’Rourke’s meditations are as universal as they are intensely personal. I learned a great deal from this book and, despite its subject matter, I found myself unable to put it down; it’s the kind of intellectual and emotional experience I wanted and expected from the more celebrated memoirs of loss that have appeared in recent years (I think, for example, of Joan Didion's pair of books). O’Rourke not only provides a spirited and tender tribute to her mother, but she also reflects deeply and movingly on love and loss, on family, on life’s transience and frailties, and on the otherworldliness of grief. She recognizes sorrow as not so much a state as a process; the painful but necessary growth into a new person that the bereaved must enact after a great loss is to be understood, she explains, as “not an emergence from the cocoon, but a tree growing around an obstruction.” And what greater obstruction than one’s “unmothering” – that irreplaceable portal closing, that line of knowledge fading? Such a grief is at first like a fever, according to O’Rourke, but then finally becomes best described as an amputation.O’Rourke leavens her account and her musings with shafts of light, with incremental healing, with reasons to hope. Who can fail to be moved by (or fail to relate to) the author when she describes how “a memory reaches out and touches my mind and I live proximate to it all day long”? Her desperate strivings after consolation and endurance are as honest and tentative as they are perceptive and beautiful: “What if our minds are cameras set to a narrow aperture, unable to perceive the full reality around us, and we are in the midst of a complicated storm, one that is ongoing, dynamic, imperceptible? And what if my mother were in that storm? It was in the haze of such chimeras that I found hope.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 30, 2014","Nov 13, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9499320-the-long-goodbye

Orfeo focuses on the avant-garde composer, Peter Els, and thus finds Powers doing what he does best: writing about music (which reminds me of how impressed I was, in this regard, by his earlier novel The Time of Our Singing). His ability to blend lyrical description with rich historical anecdote might even inspire one (as it did me) to seek out, with fresh interest, Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time and Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, which are both featured memorably in the novel (the former in an evocative ten page sequence describing the composer’s experience in a Nazi prisoner of war camp in 1941, his music seeking transcendence in “the snow-buried barrack, beyond the last twist of barbed wire”). With his own work, Els seeks music that is “thorny and formidable,” that moves decisively away from classical music’s high period when “the harmonies [were] fresh and clear all the way to the horizon,” and towards the difficulties and the “wild forms and fresh sonorities” of the twentieth century; this allows him to connect the experiments of Messiaen and Berio with such contemporary artists as Radiohead and Bjork, even as he remains vulnerable to the realization that sometimes there must be “prettiness,” that sometimes “what the world really needs is a lullaby simple enough to coax a two-year-old to lay down her frantic adventure each night for another eight hours.” Despite the novel’s wonderful moments, however, I never felt fully engaged or persuaded by the main elements of the plot – e.g, the connection between biogenetics and music (which in some distant way reminded me of Kundera’s beautiful notion of “the second infinity” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting) and especially Els’s flight as a fugitive; more significantly, despite the sometimes moving and illuminating efforts to unspool his past, Els remained for me, finally, too distant, too much of an abstraction. Maybe I needed more heart and less head, I don’t know. In any event, those aforementioned expectations are now deferred to Powers’s next novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 06, 2014","Nov 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20663749-orfeo

Black Swan Green is full ofWouldn’t you know it: the David Mitchell novel I’ve been most lax about reading turns out, quite possibly, to be his best. Black Swan Green is full of deep feeling, youthful elan, bravery, fear, humor, and the kind of incisive philosophizing that’s only available to the child’s perspective (“Green is made of yellow and blue, nothing else, but when you look at green, where’ve the yellow and the blue gone? Somehow this is to do with Moran’s dad. Somehow this is to do with everyone and everything”). It’s a novel that alternates between the spirit of Wordsworth’s “Immortality Ode,” with all of its boyish kineticism (“Ran across a field of daisies at warp speed but keep your eyes on the ground. It’s ace. Petaled stars and dandelion comets streak the green universe. Moran and I got to the barn at the far side, dizzy with intergalactic travel”), and the Island of Misfit Toys, with all of its displacement, insecurity, and social awkwardness. (Fans of indie music, by the way, may want to consider Okkervil River’s brilliant “The Silver Gymnasium” (2013) as the ideal companion text and soundtrack for this novel)Anchoring it all is the endearing, funny, and keenly observant Jason Taylor, a “middle-ranking” kid in the social hierarchy, a seeker in the suburbs, an aspiring poet with a stammer. The novel details thirteen months in the life of the thirteen year-old Jason, and although it’s Mitchell’s most conventional and least pyrotechnical novel it gives the impression of being both highly controlled and completely random at the same time. Each chapter reads as a kind of short story, at one time emphasizing domestic unease and fighting parents (whose “arguments’re speed chess these days”) and at another time, in the Bridle Path episode, for example, detailing an adventure story that could be a miniature Fellowship of the Ring narrative. Whether the kids are in the suburban driveways or the mysterious Malvern Hills, it’s always an enchanted geography, an enchantment that’s half found and half created by the youthful imagination.Joining Jason are a memorably diverse group of friends and antagonists who create a kind of Dickensian density to the social universe of the village of Black Swan Green. A sampling from the roll call of names tells a story of its own (and likely carries any reader back to the characters of his or her own grade school years): Ross Wilcox, Squelch, Pete Redmarley, Ant Little, Darren Croome, Grant Burch, et al. The novel evokes youthful elation and rites of passage (trying cigarettes for the first time, fighting war games in the woods, going “nightcreeping” through the village, etc.), the difficult negotiations of one’s place in the social scale, the attempts to neutralize the threats of bullies (“Stupidly, I tried to downgrade his attack by smiling”), who can make our protagonist feel as if “Planet Earth’d shrunk to a bubble five paces wide.” Speaking of shrinking, part of this novel’s power and resonance is its poignant depiction of a world and a state of being that inevitably close behind us, like the battlefields and playgrounds of Jason and his friends, whose “ways in’ve been wired off or walled up by brambles and farmers.” All in all, it's ace....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 30, 2013","Feb 26, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14316.Black_Swan_Green

For wilderness is our first home, too.” This collection of some three-dozen poems (a third of which are gathered up from earlier volumes), capped by the wonderful short essay “Dog Talk,” produces wry smiles and more freighted musings in equal measure, and of course will appeal both to dog-lovers and to fans of Oliver’s clear, insightful, and deeply empathetic poetry; the accompanying drawings of various dogs are essential to the experience, as well. Oliver’s subjects are dogs, generally, and the idea of dogs, but also the various dogs that have enriched her own life, which, predictably, leads to poems extolling the unfailing companionship of dogs (“steadfastness, it seems, / is more about dogs than about us. / One of the reasons we love them so much”) and lamenting the brevity of their “galloping” lives (“it is almost a failure of will, a failure of love, to let them grow old – or so it feels”; “We would do anything to keep them with us, and to keep them young. The one gift we cannot give”). The poems are sometimes delivered from the perspective of the dog and sometimes from the human observer, but always, in their simple yet profound ways, they have much to teach us about physical exuberance, about love and devotion, about partings and reunions, about time and loss, about “the acuity and rapture of the senses” (“It is smell he is listening to,” she writes in the concluding essay. “The wild, high music of smell, that we know so little about”).

Still, / is he gone from us entirely, or is he / a part of that other world, everywhere?” – Oliver’s poems are unified by her concluding questions: “What would the world be like without music or rivers or the green and tender grass?

The terminology related to ballooning (e.g., ballast, being blown by winds, enveloped in clouds, reliant on instruments and “life’s sonar,” etc.) become subtle metaphors in the book’s second section, when Barnes, crossing the “tropic of grief,” suddenly transitions to personal meditations occasioned by the loss of his wife. As the book increasingly cohered in its second half, it attained a deeply poignant and almost harrowing force. Ultimately, Barnes teaches me about the “tone and texture” of grief and mourning, their recidivism, their tendency to reconfigure time and space, and their relationship to memory, “the mind’s photographic archive.” His reflections are fresh and smart and always ring true, in ways that frighteningly transport me to my own future; this level of profound insight is probably what I wanted (and didn’t find consistently enough) in Joan Didion’s two books on loss. Through it all, too, is a profoundly moving love story, which makes all the more lacerating his realization that “'we’ are now watered down to ‘I.' Binocular memory has become monocular.” Mourning his wife “uncomplicatedly, and absolutely,” missing her “in every action, and in every inaction,” Barnes seeks honestly and desperately for the solace of patterns to daily life, and for a moral dimension to grief, “love’s opposite.” Although he finally acknowledges that “pain enhances the flavor of memory; pain is a proof of love,” and finds manifold solace in the awareness of his wife's ""active continuance,"" he nevertheless knows that one emerges from such grief and loneliness “as a gull comes out of an oil slick; you are tarred and feathered for life.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2014","Feb 25, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262198-levels-of-life

If TransAtlantic doesn’t quite reach the heights of that earlier novel – and heights is again the operative word, since we go from the vertiginous feats of Philippe Petit on the high wire in the earlier novel to the bold, nervy 1919 transatlantic crossing by pilots Brown & Alcock in the new novel – it may be because McCann’s preferred aesthetic of narrative cross-stitching is familiar to us: we know now to look for the web as it is being formed, rather than delighting in the realization of it only at the point of being ensnared. But even if the experience and exhilaration aren’t as complete, TransAtlantic is so skillfully put together that the novel ultimately had its way with me; the novel’s final section, which follows Hannah, a 72 year-old woman accompanied only by ghosts and her aging Labrador, Georgie, attains a lovely and devastating emotional power, while also lending a retrospective power to earlier sections of the novel.This is a novel about flight and air and gravity; about horses and carriages, coffin ships, and “the crates of air and wood and wire [pilots] somehow flew across the water; about compasses, charts, and spirit levels; about enduring women and fractured families; about war and peace; about ripples in space, time, and memory; about crossings and crisscrossings (especially of the Irish-American variety); about “the tangled skein of connections” and the “long migratory orbits” of our lives; about the desperate desire for all manner of soft landings. Unified, subtly, by an unopened letter, the novel’s seven sections span three centuries, and invoke such heady historical moments as the American Civil War, the Irish Famine, World War I, the Irish War of Independence, and the contemporary Northern Irish Troubles and peace process. It is split between sections devoted to iconic historical figures like Frederick Douglass, George Mitchell, and Brown & Alcock, and, in its strongest sections, to strong, memorable, fictional women (Lily, Emily, Lottie, Hannah, etc.). The narrative seems inhibited in the Douglass and Mitchell sections, in particular, both because the subject positions of these figures seem uninhabitable, and because, stylistically, the short, staccato sentences come to seem off-putting at times, and to neutralize McCann’s sublime ability, evident throughout his body of work and most definitely in the second half of this novel, to draw us into his wider sympathies and transcendent web of connections. For all that, though, and despite the fact that its real power comes, retrospectively, from the cameo appearance of an aged and grieving Lottie Tuttle, the Mitchell section is fabulous for its small illuminations, fresh angles, and observations about an overly familiar conflict, Northern Ireland’s Troubles. Mitchell, finding himself in a land where “all their lovesongs are sad and their warsongs happy,” must overcome “the mildew in the room where the past is stored,” as well as “the alphabet soup of the terrorists,” who peddle ancient hatreds that “don’t deserve capital letters” (like IRA, UDA, UVF, etc.). Through it all, though, he’s comforted to learn that “Belfast is full of odd people who have hidden away from the Troubles: they live inside tiny spaces and enormous imaginations.” The improvisatory and uncertain nature of those peace talks of the late 1990s has perhaps never been more poetically distilled than in that moment when we’re told of “everyone jumping off their own ledges, sailing out into the middle of the air, developing patterns of flight on the way down.”Ultimately, TransAtlantic, in all its sections, is built around those “enormous imaginations” – they are reckless imaginations, too, in the best and most heroic of ways, linking, as they do, Brown & Alcock’s attempt to “[knock] the war from the plane,” Douglass’s noble search for justice, Mitchell’s and Northern Ireland’s search for peace, and Hannah’s search for solace after incalculable loss. Thus, although we feel deeply what Seamus Heaney so memorably referred to as “the harrowing of the heart” that ensues from conflict and violence, there is finally an indescribable beauty and transcendent quality in the novel’s final sections. We feel so deeply connected to Hannah not only because of the emotional power of “The Garden of Remembrance” section, but also because she reifies the novel’s avowal that “the tunnels of our lives connect, coming to daylight at the oddest moments.” She is the inheritor and carrier not only of that mysterious letter (which, unopened, is all the more powerful because it still contains the “preservation of possibility”), but also of the lives that have gone before her – “that perplexing mobius strip” – and of all of those years of hurt, loss, and only partially realized hopes. Despite it all, she can still convince herself she has seen a vision of her son Tomas coming in the back door in the novel’s final pages, allowing her the solace of realizing that “the world does not turn without moments of grace,” and that, in fact, we have to admire that world “for not ending on us.”...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2013","Nov 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16085517-transatlantic

I’m reminded, somehow, of the transportive glories of the dog’s paw extolled by Hana’s father in The English Patient: “The greatest smell in the world! A bouquet! Great rumors of travel! She would pretend disgust, but the dog’s paw was a wonder: the smell of it never suggested dirt. It’s a cathedral! her father had said, so-and-so’s garden, that field of grasses, a walk through cyclamen—a concentration of hints of all the paths the animal had taken during the day.” Although it doesn’t displace The English Patient as his most sublime achievement, The Cat’s Table is every bit as alluring and satisfying as that earlier novel. It’s also probably his most accessible and straightforward novel to date, a shipboard bildungsroman and a memory tale focused on childhood, rites of passage, and one’s growth in time. Ondaatje replaces one archetypal venue for self-fashioning (i.e., the desert in The English Patient) with another, in this case the sea. Although we live our lives on dry land, we are so often inclined to look to the sea – and specifically to the sea voyage – for our epistemologies and as a metaphor for the challenges and trajectories of our lives. The three weeks of the sea journey on the Oronsay become an occasion for wonderment, for mischief and escaping order (“each day we had to do at least one thing that was forbidden”), for pocketing revelations for a later day. As Ron Charles of the Washington Post has poignantly offered, this is a novel about the “magic of adolescence and the passing strangers who help tip us into adulthood in ways we don’t become aware of until much later.” These strangers are all the more interesting and affecting at the “Cat’s Table,” which may be the least privileged location in the class strata of the ship, but as the children at the tale’s center finally conclude, “nothing of lasting value ever happens at the head table.”The voyage of the Oronsay from Colombo to Tilbury is one “whose clear map and sure destination would suggest nothing to fear and unravel,” and yet, as in life, one inevitably ends up more freighted by journey’s end, and arrives at a destination that’s more complicated than was anticipated. Looking back on those three weeks in 1954 and contemplating his younger self, the narrator, Michael, understands how momentous it truly was and how his self was subtly repositioned, susceptible as he was to “a moved heart that shies away to a different angle, a millimeter or even less from the place where it first existed.” Somehow, despite the fact that his characterizations can be so elliptical and so brief, and that he may, in fact, only write directly about any individual character for some eight-to-ten pages overall, we still tend to feel as if Ondaatje has provided a lifetime’s worth of truths about them. We’re given so relatively little – the glancings, the brief and tantalizing intersections, the near misses, the suggested love between kindred souls meant for more together but always just barely denied by circumstance, etc. – and thus, as readers, we’re asked to imagine and fill in so much. That we accede to this contract so willingly and eagerly suggests how deeply and poetically Ondaatje manages to distil his characters’ lives. It recalls the alternative cartography -- the blurred boundaries between self and other, between readers and characters – suggested by Almasy’s stirring words in The English Patient: “We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves. I wish for all this to be marked on my body when I am dead.” (Reading The Cat’s Table made me, once again, keenly lament the loss of Anthony Minghella, who surely could have brought this splendored novel to the screen. Perhaps we must now turn our hopes to Ang Lee!)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2013","Oct 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11076177-the-cat-s-table

Even so, its vision of a strange and almost tenderly dystopian world (Galway, if that's you I barely recognize you -- or perhaps Bohane is some amalgam of various Irish cities) creates the impression of ambiguously mixed temporalities, and a future that in some ways resembles the past (though much of the Irishness we've come to expect is scarcely evident here): Bohane’s citizens, including its conflicted criminals, are emotionally vulnerable to “images from the lost-time,” and understand that nostalgia is ""a many-hooked lure.” Readers will no doubt savor the novel’s darkly enchanting geography and evocative place names, and consequently will likely spend many minutes gazing at the map of Bohane inside the novel’s cover and mentally visiting the Northside Rises, the Big Nothin’, the Smoketown footbridge, the Dune Reefs, the Back Trace, and, of course, the blackly flowing Bohane River roaring in off the Big Nothin’ wastes. As for the plot, pity those poor citizens of Bohane for having to fend off the “ferocious gusts of the Big Nothin’ hardwind,” to seek clarity amid the thick seafog known as “The Murk,” and to hope against hope that the influence of “Sweet Baba Jay” will cause the city's packs of “aggravators” to find their inner angels.

The overlapping stories stretch from 1775 to 2009, as they traverse Native American folklore, colonial missionary narratives, New Age mysticism, UFO-awaiting cults, drugged and squabbling British rock stars, mysterious vanishings, and critiques of U.S. misadventures in Iraq. The novel’s unity comes from the Death Valley setting (“The Pinnacles”) of many of its most memorable sequences: indeed, Kunzru understands the desert’s grip on the human imagination, its connection to our search for erasure and fulfillment, for pure, ineffable presences and a silence that speaks, for the dissolution of time and space as we confront human finitude. Indeed, the novel’s collection of wanderers and misfits, mystics and would-be prophets, and lost souls seeking new beginnings and new communities is most compelling when paired with the rich connotations of the desert as a kind of spatial nexus. Still, for all its earnest ambition, and despite its smart realization of interconnectivity, Gods Without Men can seem overburdened by its own density at times; this may be most evident in the second half of the novel as the story of the prosperous young Manhattanites, Jaz and Lisa Matharu, reaches a crisis point involving their four year-old autistic son, Raj, and as the New Age’y, cultish storyline involving “the saucer crowd” becomes simply tedious.

Grainier always seems to be trying to catch up with his life, to perceive its narrative, to find a home, and no wonder given that his life – stretching from the 1880s to the 1960s – encompasses the first transcontinental railway, the last battle of the American Indian wars, two world wars, the onset of the nuclear age, and the arrival of the Civil Rights fight; or, to put it another way, Grainier had “started his story on a train ride he couldn’t remember, and ended up standing outside a train with Elvis Presley on it.” The natural world is a palpable presence throughout Train Dreams, and can both soothe and accentuate the loneliness, isolation, and spectral wandering that are prominent in a story that wouldn’t be out of place paired with, strangely enough, such disparate texts as James Galvin’s The Meadow and Jon Krakauer’s Into the Wild. Best read in one or two sittings, this episodic, Cervantes-like, spirit dream of a tale is laced with moments of humor, mysticism, and magic, and James Wood of The New Yorker rightly notes Johnson’s “gift for quick glancing portraiture.” It’s a hauntingly symphonic work, too, filled with “the rumble of trains and the choirs of distant wolves and the nearer mad jabbering of coyotes.” Still, another reading could leave me feeling less charitable, and perhaps dissatisfied both with the narrative’s ellipses and with the oddities of the concluding episodes; for now, though, it whistles to me as a richly suggestive meditation on the early twentieth century American West, a world at once familiar and strange, until for us, as for Grainier, “it all went black.

One could experience it either as a page-turner or as a case study for some applied literary or psychoanalytic theory (or both, certainly).

For some time now it hasn’t been easy being a Mets fan, so, for protection, one’s thoughts do tend to retreat to those dominant, brashly confident (and yet still somehow underachieving) teams of the late 80s.

The best baseball books are surely those that see the metaphorical and human drama dimensions of the game, and that understand, as Darling does, the beauty of a game at almost all moments “shot through with nuance and context.” Noting at the outset that his is “not a traditional baseball memoir,” Darling organizes The Complete Game around representative innings from his career (a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th inning etc.): some of them are full of situational import and peril, while others, on the surface at least, until Darling reveals their hidden narrative and interpretive richness, are seemingly mundane and nondescript. The focus throughout is on the ambivalent venue of the pitcher’s mound, at once Darling’s castle and his remote island: “a major league pitching mound,” he writes, can be the loneliest place in all of team sports, and it can be the loftiest.”...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2013","Aug 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6164063-the-complete-game

The novel cBecause it displays so much stylistic assuredness and so little strain it might be easy to underestimate William Trevor’s Love and Summer. The novel can seem, in the early going, as unassuming as the town of Rathmoye that provides its setting: “Compact and ordinary, it was a town in a hollow that had grown up there for no reason that anyone knew or wondered about”; its deceptiveness in this regard reminds me of John McGahern’s sublime final novel, By the Lake, and Colm Toibin’s emotionally complex novel The Heather Blazing. Indeed, because they are often so beautifully plain, because their novels operate with such quiet power, because their locales and subject matter are so often quintessentially rural, it can be easy, especially outside of their native Ireland, to overlook the towering accomplishments of Trevor and his fellow Irish novelists McGahern and Toibin (throw in John Banville, arguably Ireland’s greatest living writer, and Sebastian Barry, and you really have an embarrassment of literary riches from the Emerald Isle). The world lost McGahern in 2006 and now we find Trevor, almost improbably, in his 86th year, and yet still producing treasures like this gem of a novel. Beyond the flash provided by a couple of its character names (Orpen Wren, Florian Kilderry), Love and Summer moves with a kind of graceful, understated, suggestive ease. Giving oneself over, patiently, to this novel’s beauty involves, simultaneously, submitting to its gentle rural rhythms – marked by the crunch of Wellington boots, the sloshing of milk buckets, the bustling of sheepdogs and the baying of ewes, the peacefulness of crab-apple orchards – and recognizing the compassion, understanding, and pathos Trevor brings to his characters. There’s a beguiling mix of romance and muted tragedy in this story as the principals seek respite from a past “when the trouble happened” and liberation from a present when, in a town where nothing seemed to happen, “time hung heavy.” The furtive love affair with Florian Kilderry that irradiates the life of heroine Ellie Dillahan (“being with him in the woods at Lyre, where the air was cold and the trees imposed a gloomy darkness, or walking among the monks' graves, or being with him anywhere, telling or listening, was for Ellie more than friendship or living had ever been before"") portends heartbreak (or worse) from the outset; even Ellie intuits that “time’s searching wisdom would punish both of them, and punish ruthlessly.” When the summer idyll is finally broken, though, as it must be, Trevor’s elegant conclusion and his heroine’s fateful and humane choice produce an almost inarticulable consolation....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2013","Jul 29, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6450817-love-and-summer

Ostensibly a novel about the left-behind children (brother Dell and sister Berner) of unlikely bank-robbing parents, Canada is finally most memorably and affectingly a bildungsroman of the highest order; it chronicles the birth of a rememberer, a writer, someone who, mindful of Ruskin (“composition is the arrangement of unequal things""), learns “to keep proportion, to connect the unequal things into a whole that preserves the good, even if admittedly good is often not simple to find.” The narrative voice Ford crafts for Dell is compelling and convincing in the most understated of ways: it’s alert and wise without being precocious, articulate and sensible without being too polished or stylized. It’s a voice that presents a pitch-perfect amalgamation of an aging, meaning-seeking man and his younger, teenage self; it’s the voice of a man who learned to appreciate narrative and biographical inquiry only as an adult, and who subsequently sought clarity and release from events a half-century in his past. Dell’s voice is world-weary and suffused with quiet heartbreak (which is accentuated by the lonely prairie towns of northern Montana and Canada in which the action, such as it is, unfolds); when he is taken to Partreau, Canada, following the incarceration of his parents and the separation from his sister, Dell observes “I was now smaller in the world’s view and insignificant, and possibly invisible. All of which made me feel closer to death than life. Which is not how fifteen-year-old boys should feel.” Somehow, though, Dell’s outlook is still fortified by endurance and lifted by hope; aware that “life’s passed along to us empty,” he eventually realizes he must escape his narrowing world and address “the matter of my own remaining life” (417). Canada is both masterfully sturdy and deeply absorbing; its personalities are large and almost mythically haunting, and its landscapes are marked by an evocative and forbidding grandeur. It’s a magisterial work that can sit alongside Angle of Repose or any of the other so-called “great American novels.” And, yes, despite its title, it’s certainly an American novel at its core, even when, halfway through, the narrative moves north of the border. The idea of borders, of course, figures prominently as well: borders between countries and their concomitant identities, between past and present, between older and younger selves, between truth and fiction, between appearances and depths, and, perhaps most especially, between parents and children. Given the events that ensue, there’s deep pathos in Dell’s observation that “we had little to do if we weren’t in school or in the house with our parents, watching them and being watched by them. Being a child under those circumstances was mostly waiting – for them to do something, or to be older – which seemed a long way away.” If his telling has been about, as he says, “seeing our parents more clearly,” it’s hard to know if he succeeds, ultimately: as he concedes later, “you only know a part of each other.” His experiences, though, certainly allow him to see himself much more clearly; even with “the clear path back to the past being cluttered and unfollowable,” Dell nevertheless finds saving grace in memory, introspection, and narrative. That narrative becomes ours, and we’re enriched by accompanying him on his epic and lonely journey....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2013","Jul 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12872236-canada

I've always admired Wiman's writing on poetry, as well as, although I've read little of it, his own poetry. My Bright Abyss finds him mediating -- with a poet's sensibility, of course -- the often unbridgeable divide between secular and religious approaches to life; Wiman recognizes himself as someone with both an ""honest modern consciousness"" and an impulse for some manner of active devotion. And the stakes are high: during his recent battle with a rare cancer, Wiman knows what it's like ""when death leans over to sniff you, when massive unmetaphorical pain goes crawling through your bones, when fear ... ices your bones."" Suspecting ""faith's latency"" in adult years that he had assumed were simply faithless, and seeking an awareness that's true to his intimations of the ""transcendent nature of grace,"" Wiman craves ""the poetry and the prose of knowing."" As a poet, though, he's especially suspicious of organized religion and dogma, and doesn't trust ""the ropes, clips, and toe spikes whereby one descends into the abyss""; he needs and he seeks equipment that's less ""worn and inadequate,"" so that he can feel he's doing more than ""wandering through a discount shopping mall of myth, trying to convince [himself] there's something worth buying."" This is at times a knotty, difficult, and challenging book (in uncomfortably personal rather than esoteric ways), but one that's suffused with ""a sable radiance,"" conducted with candor, and transfigured -- especially in its later stages when he addresses his illness, his wife, and his children -- by poignance. The book often made me think of Philip Larkin's great poem ""Church Going,"" in which the speaker, in contemplating the idea of the church (a building whose shape, for we moderns, is ""less recognizable each week""), asks who ""will be the last, the very last, to seek / This place for what it was; one of the crew / That tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were? / Some ruin-bibber, randy for antique, / Or Christmas addict, counting on a whiff / Of gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh? / Or will he be my representative ... ?"" The speaker's ""representative,"" we infer, is a modern-day seeker, one for whom ""the ghostly silt"" of Christ may have dispersed, but who still hungers for a rediscovered faith and spirituality. Wiman's act of assent, as he calls it, not surprisingly involves realizing a likeness between faith and poetry: ""At some point you have to believe that the inadequacies of the words you use will be transcended by the faith with which you use them. You have to believe that poetry has some reach into reality itself, or you have to go silent."" Wiman's confessional and appealingly episodic style in My Bright Abyss (which includes, of course, lots of arresting and mysteriously beautiful poetry from the likes of George Herbert, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and others) invites readers, too, to move towards ""new ways of understanding that verb 'believe.'""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 26, 2013","Jun 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15793626-my-bright-abyss

The blood and violence are comfortably underplayed in DeWitt's Booker Prize-nominated novel, but what remains is still a lively, humorous (e.g., when it conveys how brushing one's teeth could be a world-changing discovery), and sneakily dark Western. It's also a road novel, a buddy novel, a nineteenth century American odyssey, with striking, short set pieces, memorable characters and character names (Herman Kermit Warm!), and plenty of rogues and misfits (some of them woebegone in pathetic and sympathetic ways). At the story's heart are the titular Sisters brothers, Eli and Charlie; the former increasingly develops misgivings about the duo's murderous endeavors (which finally require a return home to see Mom!), and both are upstaged, at times, by Eli's embattled and endearing horse, Tub. All of this makes for good (and heartily recommended) reading, but ultimately, like a couple other novels I've read recently (e.g., The Age of Miracles), this is a very good novel that probably should have been a great one: it seems a little too thin and sketchy at times (perhaps already screenplay-ready), and the western landscapes are curiously and unfortunately underrepresented. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9850443-the-sisters-brothers

You had a place now. The music had stopped and you'd gotten a chair"").

Because of that tragic past, these characters are aware they're never ""just separate numbers"": says one, ""When you add us up, you always have to carry the one.""

As I think back to being so transfixed, as a teenager, by the Masada miniseries back in 1981, with Peter Strauss and Peter O’Toole in the memorable lead roles (and with that majestic overture by Jerry Goldsmith), it can now seem as if I’ve been waiting all my adult life for this particular novel. The geographical site and the historical moment are simultaneously so elusive and so powerful that not just anyone could pull this off, but Hoffman is up to the task: she writes with sensitivity, with awe, and with love for her subject matter, while always respecting its mystery, its sacredness, its spectral uncertainties. The Dovekeepers is at once epic and intimate, fierce and tender, hopeful and fatalistic. The intrigue and the gendered solidarity are consistently riveting, but the novel’s real power resides in its evocation of the exilic/diasporic memory (“my people had become wanderers”) of the novel’s characters. They flee from Jerusalem into the desert – “the route of the doomed” and “the territory of robbers, and thieves, and holy men” – in a prelude that has a harrowing (and nearly mythic) power, and they’re subsequently haunted by memories of the lost Temple, acacia and olive trees, white lilies, myrrh and coriander, rivers and silver fish, the smell of baking bread. Although they unite and find refuge and an affirming solidarity in the mountain fortress, they’re aware at all times that they’re in the “land of grief,” with little choice but to wish for “others worlds and times”; the poignant laments are sharpened by our knowledge that they can’t elude their fate forever, a fate that “[swoops] through the darkness like the bats in the orchards,” or, rather, like the soldiers of the Roman Tenth legion, perhaps as many as 15,000 troops in all, who kick up a massive dust storm as they arrive to lay siege to the citadel and force the tragic endgame.The novel is not perfect, by any means: its four central voices end up seeming too undifferentiated (in spite of how carefully their respective life stories are detailed), and thus the three narrative reboots can be slightly confusing and even disappointing. The novel is also arguably a little too long, which may detract from the haunting power of the final act between the Romans and the Jewish resisters. But, then again, perhaps that's the point: Hoffman may be less concerned with the part of the story with which we're most familiar, and more intent on imaginatively recuperating the lives of women who have been lost to history.

Having lost a dear companion of my own recently, I appreciate Goldman's 340-page reminder that our response to loss is maybe first and foremost to eulogize, to narrativize, to preserve in words so as somehow to ward off the loss of detail and the weakening of memory. We want not only to keep our loved ones alive, but also somehow to find a way to make the world know how wonderful that partner, that friend, even that dog, really was. Say Her Name is a flawed, messy, undisciplined book in some respects, but one doesn’t hold it against Goldman because he’s being true to his feelings and to his lost love, Aura Estrada, more than to the dictates of narrative shape. He unceasingly finds himself “descending into memory like Orpheus to bring Aura out alive for a moment,” knowing that these “futile little rites and reenactments” bring both temporary comfort and renewed pain; one thinks of Tennyson’s famous lines from In Memoriam A.H.H., when he wills himself into believing, “I hold it true, whate’er befall; / I feel it, when I sorrow most; / ‘Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.” Say Her Name is a literary “quivering” (the old practice of recalling the lives of those who have recently departed), an unspooling of a life so as to replay it, all the while balancing the absurd hope that it might somehow end differently with the knowledge that of course it can’t. Aura is vibrant and alive in these pages, and as the book’s concluding moments approach, the reader finds it hard to believe that she can actually die. The account of the accident itself is harrowing and heartrending, but somehow it’s overcome by the bright comet that was her life, and by the residual light of her after-shine. Even if every day is a “ghostly ruin” for Goldman, “every day the ruin of the day that was supposed to have been,” he (and we) are lifted up by “the memory-sensation of Aura laughing inside [him],” arriving unexpectedly, “as if crossing over from the spirit world.” Goldman knows, finally, that he can only “say her name. It will always be her name. Not even death can steal it. Same alive as dead, always.

Stylistically, the novel is dominated at times by long paragraphs of highly accomplished descriptive prose, and in this sense it's density done well. Those who work in academia will appreciate some of the observations of university life (regarding his office hours, Professor Lee ""each afternoon would carefully stand the door open twelve inches, or the width someone needed to duck in casually and say hi; not wide open, as if in eager anticipation, and not merely slightly ajar, as if he slightly begrudged this time for his students"")....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2010","Jan 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1193230.A_Person_of_Interest

Beyond that, though, the novel didn't have much wisdom to impart, and I never really found the central character(s) appealing enough to care very much about the narrative.

There are moments of real insight and feeling here (about parenting, about our relationships with our children, about time and “life’s most predictable events,” about dreams and possibilities, about memories, etc.), and at its best, Blue Nights finds Didion living in different time dimensions, reaching out for a daughter who was taken from her, inexplicably, after twenty months of illness and suffering – and this immediately after she lost her husband, John, as well. Somehow, though, I found myself dissatisfied with the journey she took me on; it tended to get a bit too insular (even faintly trite) and didn’t teach me enough about loss and life after loss. When I read a testimonial like this I want to feel the lacerating sense of loss more acutely (as in Tennyson’s In Memoriam, A.H.H., for example), or I want to perceive the vivacity of the person who was lost (as in Francisco Goldman’s Say Her Name, for example), and I really didn’t get either in Blue Nights. Maybe Didion just has too much respect for the daughter (and husband) she mourns, or maybe I need to read this as part of a two-part suite with The Year of Magical Thinking in order to evaluate it properly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 18, 2012","Jan 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10252302-blue-nights

Graham Joyce’s The Silent Land is not as stylistically refined and elevated as these other titles, and the dialogue often doesn’t seem to rise to the level of what the protagonists are experiencing, but it’s the type of novel that almost can’t fail to produce a memorable reading experience (which will itself, by the way, considering you’ll be reluctant to put the book down after you’ve read the first five pages, be quite fleeting); further, despite at times suggesting a cross between the films Ghost and The Shining, it ultimately manages to be more profound than it has any right being. It’s hard to know how to write about this novel without giving something crucial away, but in important respects it’s about continuity and the mysterious apprehension of time; it’s about how a strong love can, in the words of the male protagonist, Jake, cheat death by creating “extra time” (to use a sports analogy, the plot operates in something like the equivalent of “45’ + 5”—or “stoppage time”—in a soccer game.) The mystery at the heart of this novel is that it may finally be a story involving twenty minutes, or involving a number of days or months or years, or even involving endless time. It’s a story about time and memory and love and loss, but it’s also about mountains and snow and alpine lodges and burning logs and sex and skiing and candles and the taste of cognac. It’s a tactile novel, a sonic novel (with sounds both big and small), and an eerily-lit novel, as ominously transfixing as those “spruce and pines, all still loaded with snow, [spreading] their limbs in a frozen ballet, breathing a ghostly incense from dark, arid chapels sheltered by their branches.” For anyone who has mourned a pet, the reunion of Jake and his dog Sadie will be a poignant one, and the narrative also pauses for a pair of moonlit and graceful remembrances of Zoe’s and Jake’s respective fathers. Most importantly, though, it’s a novel about marriage and companionship, about the afterworlds (or parallel worlds?) where our relationships continue – or perhaps, as Jake intuits, about the possibility of inhabiting “the place where the laws of physics and the laws of dreams mix.” In chilling but tender ways it’s a novel that teaches us that time is a gift, and that even if you’re aware that “you are nothing on the enormous mountain,” you must relish “living on the gradient” and must carve your turns with focus and joy. The mystery of the plot finally starts to clear in the novel’s second half, and increasingly yields to deep emotion as the reader shares in Zoe’s disquieting sense of “the presence of the wedge” that may threaten her tether to Jake. When the pair find their “precious time” subject to a kind of terrible “centrifuge,” we apprehend the beauty of bonding through stories, as well as the profound import of Jake’s final awareness that “everything, our whole lives, has been a series of delights and griefs that are gone forever; gone unless we remember them for each other.”...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Nov 2012,"Nov 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8719737-the-silent-land

They lead us, at once painfully and beautifully, to contemplation of our last ends—not in a macabre sense, but in ways that make us aware of the mysteries of existence. Luis Bunuel’s quote in the epigraph – “Memory is what makes our lives … without it, we are nothing” – becomes something of a thesis for the stories. One character invites us to recalibrate our journey through time: “Why do any of us believe our lives lead outwards through time? How do we know aren’t continually travelling inward toward our centers?” And, later, we can’t help but share the anxiety associated with the fact that “every hour, all over the globe, an infinite number of memories disappear, whole glowing atlases dragged into graves.” In a much less pyrotechnical and much more emotionally affecting way, Memory Wall recalls David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas: it offers a similar sense of wide-ranging, genre-stetching, time- and space-spanning alchemy, although the linkages across the stories are forged thematically and tonally rather than through narrative ingeniousness. The title story, “The River Nemunas” (which reads like a subtler, soberer kin of Jonathan Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close), and the closer “Afterworld” are the obvious standouts in this collection, but all of the stories are graceful, elegant, profoundly observant, and deeply poignant; this is a book I’ll want, henceforth, to keep close by, to read again (perhaps multiple times, as my own years progress), not merely because of its insights and its operating instructions, but because of its brave and endearing characters, for whom I felt, throughout, great tenderness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 22, 2012","Oct 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7696504-memory-wall

Bloody hurt, familial hurt, canine hurt, racial hurt. But there's also a lot of poetry and, through it all, scarcely recognizable until it suddenly is, there's saving love. I knew little about this novel when I picked it up, which is unusual for me, but which probably helped turn it into one of the most memorable and searing reading experiences I've had in some time. I knew, I think, that it had won some manner of prize (in fact, it was the National Book Award!), but that was about it. I had no idea it was a Hurricane Katrina novel, or, certainly, that I would finish the novel and feel convinced that there will never be a Hurricane Katrina novel as good as this one (or many American novels of any kind as good as this one). That Jesmyn Ward is an amazing young talent is evidenced not just by the overall harrowing power of Salvage the Bones, but by the unforgettable (and utterly believable) powers of observation (amidst the almost tragic dereliction of life in what her family knows as ""the Pit"") of her narrator, Esch. The loss of the family's mother (after giving birth to Esch's brother, Junior) hovers around the sad, scrappy, and hardscrabble scenes of this narrative, and there's no small amount of discomfort for the reader to endure, whether it's weathering the tempests of Esch's father, the grit-your-teeth (literally) edginess of the dog-fighting drama, or, when it finally comes, the soggy, deafening, terrifying -- and, finally, heart-rending (""China White, he breathes, my China"") -- punishment delivered by Katrina. The deep emotions and the pathos are assiduously earned, and when the storm passes and the sky clears, the endurance and hopefulness are, in the way of great fiction, both richly felt and soberingly modest. And through it all is that poetry, and a gathering of acutely realized, cutting details: we get astonishing renderings of the impoverished, rural South, ""through miles of woods, lonely houses like possums in the dark, half caught and then left behind by the headlights""; a father's injured hand ""wrapped up to the wrist in gauze and tape so that it looked like a webworm moth nest wound tight in a pecan tree""; a color-based cartography that finds Esch and her family living ""in the black heart of Bois Sauvage"" and their advantaged neighbors living ""in the pale arteries.""
