The protagonist, little Grace Meadows, is trying to understand the world around her by asking some pretty tough questions of the adults in her life, like 'Why did daddy go to war?'

The story then retreats to six days earlier to see what led to her death. Sebastian himself has been told he has three months left to live by his doctors and wants some of his memories recorded for his family and closest friends. To accomplish this, he has invited a young writer named Nicky Hunter to come stay in the mansion and listen to his stories. She is one of his biggest fans and the two have corresponded for the past five years. And maybe together they can solve the mystery of what happened to Trapp's first wife and son, who disappeared over twenty years ago.

A dystopian novel set 25 years in the future in which the southern US states have become unbearably hot due to climate change and rich entrepreneurs are finding ways to come out on top. One has built a climate-controlled floating island in the sea near Boston. As usual, it is rich people benefitting and poor people doing the mundane dirty work, right? Another project is taking place around Dominion Lake in British Columbia. A famous architect named Meyer is buying up property in the frozen Canadian northwest with dreams of creating Camp Zero, a utopian community. He has hired men he calls ‘Diggers’ to do the work on the building project, managers to oversee them and a group of whores called ‘Blooms’ to keep management happy. There is even a young teacher named Grant for the college Meyer plans to build. For now, Grant will give the Diggers lessons in writing supposedly. (Picture a bunch of unwilling teenagers.)Further north, there is a government installation called White Alice, originally set up during the Cold War as an early warning station to monitor Russian activity. A group of female scientists has been sent there for a two-year stint to conduct various research studies and report back. Supplies are brought in by helicopter. The women get on very well and form a close-knit community.The story is told from three voices: Rose, who is one of the Blooms with an agenda; Grant, the would-be teacher trying to escape the constraints of his wealthy Bostonian family; and for the women of White Alice, the author switches to first person plural, which seems quite appropriate since they are such a cohesive community. Climate change and technology play big roles in the story. The wealthy entrepreneur who created the Floating City in Boston earned his money with his creation called Flick. It is implanted behind the ear of each person at birth and connects them to the internet effortlessly where their likes and experiences can be tracked and their opinions influenced. It’s interesting how Michelle Min Sterling weaves all these threads together and how it all evolves as the structures of normal society becomes somewhat useless.There are very strong feminist undertones to the story, making for some interesting plot twists. So much of the story is about relationships and forging your own future during challenging times: relationships between mother and daughter, parents and child, lovers, clients, workers. The author has created several interesting scenarios for the near-future, something to think about, and leaves the reader with HOPE....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Feb 25, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Feb 06, 2024",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/181541294-camp-zero

This time around, Dreghorn and his partner, 'Bonnie' Archie McDaid, are investigating a series of murders, assassinations apparently, of men who had served in Ireland in the Black and Tans years ago. Dreghorn is an interesting character: 35 years old, a pretty heavy drinker and smoker, haunted by his experiences and actions in WWI, unlucky in love, a fallen-away Catholic who is serving in a mostly Protestant police force. Although he's capable of just about any violence, he's also quite protective of the innocent, women and especially children. His partner Archie is quite a piece of work too. He's huge in size, intimidating and capable of violence himself but a family man and a softy at heart who often tries to act as Jimmy's conscience. The author Morrison really immerses the reader in the mean streets of Glasgow. Things are hard for most everyone during the Depression years but the gangs and violence make life that much worse. This story also brings in the Irish history, struggles between the Catholics, Protestants, and English, much of which was new to me. Do you remember Irish sweepstakes tickets? ""If You're Not In, You Can't Win."" Big jackpot but illegal gambling. Supposedly a fundraiser for a good cause--to help build hospitals. If you enjoy police procedurals, I highly recommend this series for its totally different take and setting. I've mentioned the violence in this story but really there is a lot of laugh-out-loud humor too. The relationship between these two partners is close and special. In general, the secondary characters are also quite well depicted, whether they be the criminals or the other polis. A good look at human nature in all its aspects. And then there's the language: their boss Sillitoe, an Englishman, 'enjoyed applying linguistic deduction to the abounding Scots vernacular and seemed to revel in the rough-hewn exoticness of the words.' I admit I scratched my head over the frequent use of the adjective 'gallus' though. Och! Many thanks to the author and publisher for providing me with an arc of this new thriller via NetGalley.

The narrator of the story is Thomas Fowler, a middle-aged English correspondent who claims to be just an observer who takes no sides in the current political situation. He is a bit of a womanizer which has caused him to be estranged from his wife back in England. He is currently living with a beautiful young mistress name Phuong. She is hoping that Fowler will divorce his wife so he can marry her and take her back to England. Into their lives comes Alden Pyle, a young idealistic American with a political agenda. He is 'impregnably armored by his good intentions and his ignorance.' Later when things have turned deadly, Fowler observes of Pyle: 'I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused.'This is my 'Dusty Bookshelf Read' for February, 2024. A real classic. In his story, Greene gets into the hearts and souls of his characters, what drives them, how far they will go. His description of the setting with all the political machinations and danger is quite remarkable as well. Highly recommend. Reading Kristin Hannah's The Women in January sparked an interest in reading more about Vietnam which led to Absolution by Alice McDermott and now this classic.

There's no science backing up why sugar detoxing is a smart thing to do, so we'll leave it to Dr Robert Lustig and his book Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine to explain all that.Note: We began this sugar detox on 2/15/24 and all the recipes we've tried so far have been delicious and some weight loss has already been achieved.

Some complaints: Most of her recipes refer you to other pages in the book for things like spice blends or making homemade sauces. I'd much prefer that all directions be on the same page. I'd also rather not make a cup of spice blend to use just a pinch in a recipe! Why not just measure spices as you need them in each recipe instead of making a big batch?

Tudor takes a detour into vampyr fiction here and has created an alternate reality where vampyrs and humans live in neighboring remote communities. It's often an uneasy alliance, their existence a favor granted by humans, so when a human teen in Deadhart, Alaska, is found dead with his throat slit open, Barbara Atkins, a detective from the Forensic Vampyr Anthropology Department is called in to determine whether the killer was actually a vampyr. If so, the human community will be allowed to 'cull' the vampyrs from their area. At first, it seems like a slam dunk, there's even video evidence, but a closer look at it has Barbara wondering...So, part mystery/police procedural and part horror story. To me, the basic message here is that humans tend to hate and fear what they don't really understand and so it might seem easier to eliminate what they perceive as a danger to peace and harmony and life itself. Alaska is the perfect setting for this story with the added dangers of the bitter cold and perpetual winter darkness. I enjoyed the characters, especially Barbara, who is refreshingly normal in looks and figure, but has a code she lives by to do her job, based on her own life experiences. I'm happy to see that Tudor has left the door open to a possible sequel. I'm certain I'd enjoy that just as much.

The American presence there at that time was mostly for political and corporate reasons, protecting oil rights, supporting the Diem regime, and of course doing intelligence work for the government. Newlyweds Peter and Patricia arrive in Saigon for his job and settle in. Before leaving America, Patricia's father had told her, 'Be a helpmeet to your husband. Be the jewel in his crown.' And she is determined to do that in this strange land. Almost immediately, another corporate wife named Charlene takes Tricia under her wing, and pulls her into what Charlene's husband disdainfully calls 'her cabal' of do-gooders. Charlene is beautiful, confident and kind of bossy, used to getting her way when she's fundraising for one of her pet projects. She has her fingers in everyone's lives, it seems. She's the mother of three children, including a daughter named Rainey who Tricia befriends. Now, 60 years later, after her mother has passed, Rainey has contacted Patricia to ask about those years in Vietnam. Tricia writes a very interesting letter about Charlene, their experiences, etc. Then in Part Two of the novel, Rainey writes back, filling her in on some of the coincidental things that have happened in her adulthood. And then Tricia writes one last letter about a shocking thing that happened during their last days in Vietnam. This is my first taste of Alice McDermott's writing and I was quite drawn in to her story and characters. To me, Charlene was the main character but we never hear directly from her, only what other people thought of her, observed, etc. Was she amoral, someone who used her good looks, charms and body to get what she wanted? Did she dabble in drug selling and black market dealings? Was she 'an inconsequential do-gooder' or did her compassionate good works really help to change people's lives? Vietnam gets another look in an earlier era where foreigners were living luxurious lives while just blocks away, the citizens were suffering in great poverty. It's also a look at what role wives were expected to play in those days before women's liberation, how they were treated as less than equals, were infanticized even, while the men carried on 'the important work.'

No human being is born with the ability to read. That fact alone is pretty startling when you think about it. And something changes in our brains when the skill is learned, so it's pretty momentous. Did you know that Socrates was against writing and reading? He thought it would lessen critical thought that comes from verbal discussions.

He seldom sees anyone, so a knock at his door rather surprises him. Who could it be now?? It's two policemen from his former office wanting his input on a cold case that has relevance to a new case. At first, Tom refuses but when his former boss drops by to ask for his help, he changes his mind. This story won't be for everyone. It's not a thriller or a mystery that has you turning pages.

They are displaced people in a war-torn world that is also being destroyed by the floods and fires of climate change. Silvia is fascinated by her aunt's stories of her childhood and the folk tales that enriched it. When Ena claims the three giant dogs owned by the old woman living in the penthouse are really three men turned into dogs by an enchantment, Sil sets out to prove it. And so we have a different sort of coming-of-age story--a young girl living under mother's thumb but squirming to break free, being led astray by the stronger personality of a new friend and not really understanding the dangers that could be lying in wait. Sil thinks her mother's insistence that they not speak their old language is just plain silly but this new country is not 'all forests and toadstools and magic violins' like in Ena's stories.

I thought this Swedish police procedural was terrific, keeping me on my toes guessing while introducing a smart and strong main character, Detective Inspector Leonore 'Leo' Asker. Leo is the lead detective in the Serious Crime Command when a young couple goes missing. The case is so high-profile, involving the daughter of a wealthy and powerful family, that a rising star in the National Operations Department is called in to replace Leo, Detective Superintendent Jonas Hellman, someone who just happens to have a personal grudge against Leo. She quickly finds herself 'promoted' to Manager of the Resources Unit, aka the Department of Orphaned Cases and Lost Souls... in the basement. Her small staff is 'a bunch of HR nightmares who've been shunted off to the basement, where they can't do any damage.'Hellman quickly zeroes in on the boyfriend involved in the girl's disappearance and is blind to all other possibilities so Leo pursues some other tantalizing clues--something her predecessor was working on before his heart attack. Is it possible a serial killer is at work? Whose theory will prove to be correct? Leo's or Hellman's? And who will get to the truth first? I really enjoy police procedurals, watching such a clever, insightful investigator dig through layers of information to slowly piece together the answer. Leo is a great new main character with a very interesting backstory that has prepared her for dealing with all sorts of 'crazies'--be they criminals or her fellow officers.

In years past, I shared them with my elderly mother, who really enjoyed them. In this outing, Ms Brown has dropped the dual timelines that she has had in her most recent books in which she explored early Virginian history in the area where her stories are set and has gone back to concentrating on a modern-day mystery. A lot of this story is about state politics. The main character, Mary Minor Haristeen, aka Harry, is a farmer whose best friend Susan Tucker is married to Ned, a state delegate to the Virginia statehouse, the House of Delegates. He has become so overwhelmed with paperwork that Susan has pitched in to help and enlisted Harry's help too. A fellow Democrat named Aidan Harkness is currently at loggerheads with Amanda Fields, a first-term Republican delegate, over her doctrine of fiscal conservatism. Interesting since she has spent $1000 on a very fancy pair of red-soled high heels, which she wields as a weapon when Aidan calls her the b-word during a recent session. Both delegates are gaining a great deal of publicity for their antics. But all that is overshadowed when a young page is found dead with drugs in his system after a car accident. Have drugs invaded the statehouse? The fun thing about these mysteries is that the animals are characters too. Harry's two cats and two dogs watch over Harry and can be quite hilarious as they squabble and debate, just like humans. I found the issues brought up in this story to be quite interesting.

Their displacement takes members of the family to several areas of the world over the coming years: to Kuwait, Lebanon, Paris, Boston. Where then is home? It is not really the houses which can be destroyed so easily, dissolved like salt in water. No, it is with your family, wherever they are, whenever they can gather together.

The plot: the McTavish family of Tavistock, NC, is extremely wealthy from inherited lumber baron money. Their 20,000 square foot mansion called Ashby House sits on a mountain top, just miles from the Biltmore, the Vanderbilt mansion in Asheville. But all that wealth hasn't made them happy or kept tragedy from their door. In 1943, while picnicking in the mountains with her mother and nanny, three-year-old Ruby McTavish wanders off. No trace of her is found for eight months until a family in Alabama admits to having taken her. Later in her life, poor Ruby is involved in more tragedies as all four of her husbands die young and in freakish ways. She eventually adopts a son she names Cameron who is dubbed 'the luckiest boy in North Carolina' in the press. When Ruby dies, he is the heir to the entire estate--much to the chagrin of his great-aunt and cousins, Ben and Libby. Surprisingly, Cam wants no part of that house or the money. He is married now and living in a small house in California, teaching English. So when his cousin Ben contacts him requesting he return to deal with family matters, Cam is at first reluctant to return 'home' but is talked into it by his wife Jules who would love to see the estate. Of course nothing has changed. The remaining McTavishes are still cruel and bitter, treating Cam as an interloper. As the plot unfolds, Ruby's story is revealed in letters she wrote before her death and it's one shock after another. But wait: Hawkins has much more in store. A real page turner!

Grimthorpe, to make a very important announcement. Many of his adoring fans and the press are present. But soon after Grimthorpe takes a sip from his cup of tea, he keels over dead. Who could have wanted him dead: one of his fans or an employee of the hotel? Molly is determined to figure it all out but she's hampered by her lack of social skills and her infinite capacity for understanding things too late. These stories are light, fun and warm-hearted. In this installment, we learn more about Molly's past, being raised by her grandmother who was a maid in a grand house. There's also a bit of romance afoot with her beau, Juan.

It's a big ask because Alison and her brother Ben had a horrific childhood and have the scars, both mental and physical, to prove it. But there were good times too and those memories prompt Alison to agree to take her in. Upon arrival, Mavis immediately begins to charm Alison's husband and her two daughters as well as any hospice workers or friends who stop by.

ReI have to say Peter Heller is one of my favorite writers so I was excited to get my hands on his latest novel set in the Yellowstone National Park. Ren Hopper is a park ranger who loves the park and the abundant wildlife but other humans? Not so much. What I loved about this book were Heller's beautiful description of the park itself and Hopper's emotional reactions to it. As the story develops, we learn his backstory and how that affects his personal relationships to this day. There are many more extraordinary characterizations too--eccentric people who are drawn to the park for opposing reasons: some to protect it and some to plunder it. The reintroduction of wolves to the park several years ago and how those wolves are faring today is a big part of the plot as a female wolf biologist called Hilly goes up against a poacher to protect the creatures she loves. A very realistic novel which highlights the greed and carelessness of man's treatment of our most precious natural resources.A good nonfiction book about the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone is American Wolf: A True Story of Survival and Obsession in the West by Nate Blakeslee....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Oct 23, 2023","Oct 24, 2023","Oct 22, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63249808-the-last-ranger

But in the islands of the Caribbean, slave owners found a way around that--by declaring that former slaves would then become apprentices and have to work for six years more. Rachel, working on the Providence plantation in Barbados, will have none of that and runs for freedom. Her dream is to find the five children who were taken from her and reunite with her family. It will mean walking hundreds of miles and sailing to other islands but if anyone can do it, this fierce woman can. This is an excellent look at slavery's effect on human lives and the deep love that can drive people to do the seemingly impossible.

In Part Two, the story catches up to the current day with Orvil Red Feather and his family who were the main characters of There There. Jude Star, Orvil's great-great-something-grandfather, survived the Sand Creek Massacre, and his son, Charles, survived boarding schools designed to 'assimilate' Native kids into white culture. Orvil's two grandmothers, Jacquie Red Feather and Opal Bear Shield, raised Orvil and his brothers after their mother died from an overdose. Their family history is a story of addiction in its many forms. As Orvil says, their family was 'weakened by the effects of history, colonization and historical trauma...not strong enough to pass down the traditions or language successfully.' With the violent destruction of their tribes, these people became 'wandering stars.'

I think Stephen Graham Jones threw in every single horrific thing he could think of in his final book in The Indian Lake Trilogy. This is Jade Daniel's story, mainly told from her POV. She's back in Proofrock, Idaho after serving four years in prison, and is now teaching a high school history class (thanks largely to her best friend and rich girl, Letha Mondragon-Tompkins). Jade is seeing a therapist (also thanks to Letha) and taking prescription mood regulators (perhaps a little more even than prescribed?) When the feces starts hitting the fan again and the body count starts rising, Jade of course wades right in the middle of it all. She's always looking for the iconic slasher movie Final Girl, the invincible survivor amongst the other strong women fighting this battle of horror, but to me, it's always been Jade herself. She's screwed up, scarred, flawed, damaged but also smart, brave, loyal and courageous. In other words, a total badass. SG Jones really knows how to write strong, intelligent female characters--I really appreciate that about his novels. The opening and final chapters are written from an omniscient point of view which start and end the novel well. And interspersed amongst the action chapters are reports from an investigation service, detailing what Jennifer Elaine 'Jade' Daniels has been up to of late. Read closely--these give a few clues to some of what is really going on. In some ways, I'm sorry to see this series end, to say goodbye to Jade and Letha and the rest. But I'm sure it will be fun to see what Stephen Graham Jones comes up with next. One thing for sure, I know there will be strong female characters in it.

It has left both her husband and daughter with painful wounds which will likely heal but can they recover emotionally? 'The fire has burnt our souls, our hearts. It has turned to ashes the people we once were.' In the aftermath, it is learned that the fire was started by a wealthy man who just wanted to burn five acres of forest on the cliff top where he planned to build a boutique hotel. But the climate has become so dry and the winds so fierce that the fire quickly became an inferno, racing towards the sea in a path of destruction.Weeks later, while walking her dog in the dead forest, Irini discovers the hated man under an ancient chestnut tree. She quickly realizes he is dying from an attempted hanging. Irini runs for help but makes a quick decision that will alter who she believes she is as a person. Part of the story is told in the present day as the people of the village try to put their lives back together. But the other half of the book consists of Irini's journal entries as she details exactly what happened in her Book of Fire. These kind of fires are happening more frequently in the world at large due to climate change but it seems people need someone personal to blame: the man who lit the fire, the police who blocked escape routes, the fire brigades' ineffective attempts to control the conflagration. What good does it do when the lives of lost loved ones cannot be restored? A compelling and evocative novel, told simply, with well-drawn characters.

Tracy Crosswhite IS the Seattle Police Department's entire Cold Case Unit and the Chief of Police, Marcella Weber, has assigned her a tough case to look into: the Route 99 Killer who murdered 13 women 25 years ago before disappearing. It seems the Seattle Times is planning to publish a special anniversary edition about the murders and Weber wants it to look like the police are currently on top of things, using all the latest tools science has to offer to find the killer and bring the families closure.

I started buying these Victorian Christmas novellas many years ago as a gift for my mother and we enjoyed sharing the stories. I believe there are 21 of them now. In this latest one, an elderly woman named Mariah Ellison is invited to travel from her home in London to St Helens in Dorset to spend Christmas with an old friend named Sadie Alsop. When she arrives, the husband Barton says his wife isn't at home and it wouldn't be appropriate to let Mariah in. She eventually finds shelter with Gwendolyn, another old acquaintance in the village, and the two of them try to figure out what has happened to Sadie. Although the plot seemed a bit repetitive, the mystery is quite intriguing and I found Mariah to be a strong character. In keeping with the holiday season, the theme that everyone makes mistakes but can be forgiven seemed quite appropriate. Sadly I've just learned that Ms Perry passed away in April of this year so most likely this holiday tradition will have come to an end. Her stories will be missed.

Workers in Pottstown, PA in 1972, uncover an old well with a skeleton at the bottom, with a mezuzah clutched in its hand. McBride then turns back the clock to the years of the Great Depression, when Jews and African-Americans lived side by side in a neighborhood called Chicken Hill in Pottstown. There, kindly Chona Ludlow runs the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store inherited from her father while her husband Moshe runs a local theatre and dance hall. Chona is approached by Nate and Addie Timblin, who both work for the Ludlows, to hide their nephew Dodo. He was deafened in an explosion and the state wants to put him in a home, a nasty place called Pennhurst Hospital, where all sorts of unspeakable things are rumored to take place. This is a richly detailed, character-driven novel. I have several favorite characters including Chona, Nate, Dodo and the friend he calls Monkey Pants.

It is told in three stories that advance the timeline through the 1970s. 1971: 'RINGOLEVIO' The Jackson 5 are appearing at Madison Square Garden and tickets are impossible to get (think Taylor Swift tickets today). When Ray's daughter May begs him for some, he contacts a fixer to ask for a favor, knowing full well such a request will have strings attached and will lead him back into the crime world he's left behind to go legit. 1973: 'NEFERTITI T.N.T.' A counterculture film producer named Zippo asks Carney to film scenes from his upcoming Blaxploitation movie at the furniture store and Carney asks his friend Pepper to act as a security guard. When the star of the show, Lucinda Cole, goes missing, Pepper is tasked with finding her. 1976: 'THE FINISHERS' Harlem is burning. It seems it's the easiest way for property owners to get rid of dilapidated buildings and collect the insurance money to make way for the new. 'Finishers' are men who are hired to do the job. Carney becomes incensed when the young boy who lives above the store with his mother was trapped in such a building when it was lit up and has been hospitalized for smoke inhalation. What idiot wouldn't have checked to make sure the building was empty first? Carney asks Pepper to find the firebug and whoever hired him. But someone doesn't like all the questions he's asking... Through these stories, we learn more about Carney and his family, his past, how hard he's worked to get where he is, and how things get done in Harlem, exposing the shady side of politics, crooked cops and an underground crime network.

He's been in a semi-coma for months and is as weak as a kitten. When he is well enough to travel, he is sent home to St Louis, where his family had been some of the earliest French settlers. There he learns some grievous news: his sister and her family have been murdered. It becomes John's mission to find the killer and get retribution. But first he must continue to heal and regain his strength. At last, he's ready and sets off on an odyssey that will take him across nearly four hundred miles of the American West, much of it on foot. These are unlawful times and he can't count on lawmen for justice. Along the way, he travels through a wild and beautiful territory that author Jiles describes so well.

In the previous book the Itos have been released from the Manzanar detention center and are sent to resettle in Chicago where they learn their beloved oldest daughter Rose, who had gone there ahead of them, has died from an apparent suicide. Devastated, the three remaining family members struggle to settle into this new life in a strange city. Aki, Rose's baby sister, does not believe her sister would kill herself and seeks answers. During the course of the story, Aki studies nursing and marries Art Nakasone, a local Japanese man from a wealthy family, before he joins the war effort.The second book begins two years later in 1946. The Itos are among thousands of Japanese-Americans who have been allowed to return home to Southern California where they struggle to pick up the strings of their former lives. The Itos are lucky to find jobs and a small house to rent and are happy to learn that their boxed up possessions have been kept safe for them by a local farmer. While waiting for her husband Art to be discharged from the army, Aki is working as a nurse's aide at the Japanese Hospital in Boyle Heights. During one shift, she observes an elderly man who is being examined with suspicious injuries, and recognizes him as the father of her husband's best man from their wedding. Later, when the same man is admitted with a gun shot wound, Aki is determined to figure out what is really going on. But when Art returns home, he is none too pleased with her suspicions and questioning, seeming to have secrets of his own. This is a really interesting look at what Japanese-Americans went through during these early post-war months. The unfairness of how they were treated is front and center. They were fortunate to have a close circle of friends to call upon for support and friendship in times of need. As usual during hard times, some people turn to a life of crime to get ahead and that's where Aki looks to find some answers.

When her 17-year-old daughter Jules goes missing after a night out with friends, nothing will stop her from learning the truth, even if she has to take on the Irish mob.Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the Southie housing projects of Boston and she's already lost a lot: her first husband, her son and now her second husband has left her, saying her hate embarrasses him. She cannot lose her daughter who is her heart. It's a hot summer in 1974 and the tempers of the white people of Boston are heating up too: the courts have ruled their schools must desegregate when they open in a few weeks. All the dark rage of racism is rising up, ready to boil over. On the same night Jules disappeared, a young black man was struck by a train and killed. When Homicide Detective Bobby Coyne investigates, it seems Jules and her friends were somehow involved. Finding out what really happened that night is of the utmost importance--but it might take Mary Pat's unorthodox methods to do it!I've now read nine books by Dennis Lehane and I have to say, he is the master of the taut thriller plot. So much tension, you could cut it with a knife, capturing this turbulent moment of racial struggle so well. You might not like these characters but they are real human beings, portrayed with all their flaws, sins and deep-seated prejudices. They virtually jump off the page of this story.

Delaney Nichols, an American transplanted to Scotland, is sent by her boss Edwin to collect an ancient sword found on the property of Jolie Lannister at her mansion West Rosebud House in Roslin. When Delaney arrives though, she steps into the middle of an argument going on between Jolie and her attorney, Bowie Berry, who has brought an estate appraiser, Gilles Haig, and his young assistant, Alban Dunning, to look over the contents of the old mansion. Ms Berry believes Jolie is showing signs of a mental disorder, exhibited in hoarding disease, and wants these experts to do an inventory of the cluttered contents. Jolie had signed over power of attorney to Ms Berry 10 years ago to cover such a circumstance. Once Jolie convinces these people to leave, she takes Delaney and her driver Elias to the outbuilding where the sword is being kept. Before long though, they hear a man yelling: the groundskeeper Homer has found young Alban murdered. Delaney has been involved in some detecting in the past and has aided police investigations; she does the same here. Who would want the poor young man dead? And why? The situation becomes quite controversial with questions about the ownership of such national treasures as the ancient sword. There's also some old gossip to wade through involving the royal family.

Mobility is Lydia Kiesling's second novel and follows Elizabeth “Bunny” Glenn throughout her life. We first meet her in 1998 at the age of 15. She is currently living in Baku, Azerbaijan, with her father who is a career U.S. diplomat and her older brother, John. Her mother has returned to Texas with the baby brother, Teddy Bear, to help care for her aging mother. Bunny reads all the latest fashion magazines, like Cosmo, Vanity Fair and Vogue, for beauty advice and clues, because at this point in her life, she seems to believe a woman's worth is how attractive she is to a man. Baku is the current hot spot with its developing offshore oil business and has become a magnet for brash young men who want a piece of the action. Thankfully they seem to know Bunny is a bit TOO young to be toyed with. Later, in her 20s, she is still looking for her niche in life. Her parents have divorced and she moves in with her distraught mother who has inherited her family's home in Beaumont, Texas. Bunny's brothers are off busy doing their own things. She decides to sign on with a temp employment agency who send her to work a clerical job at a private oil services company. There she slowly works her way up. The changes in her job seem to coincide with the changes in the energy industry. Quite a bit of the novel is an informative discussion of the structure of the oil industry--who owns what, how the industry is changing. Of course, climate change becomes a bigger factor as the years pass. But also who are employed in these well-paying jobs. Women engineers are few and far between and Bunny finds herself helping organize women to network. I thought a lot about what the title means. Does mobility always mean improvement? You can be upwardly mobil because of receiving an education, through the job or profession you enter, through rising income, by the neighborhood you can afford to live in, and, in some cases, you might even move up in social class through the good fortune of these things. Consumerism rears its ugly head though and you might have to dress the part. Bunny remains obsessed with designer clothes, shoes and face creams throughout her life. As part of a diplomat's family, Bunny has lived in several countries around the world, went to schools in America, and came back to Texas to live as an adult, so the mobility of her living circumstances is part of what shaped her life. Her extended family ends up scattered across the globe and don't see each other that often. Is that a downside to mobility? Mobility is a part of modern life, as humans have the ability to travel across the globe and even into outer space. Gas and oil fuel that and many other of the commodities that make up our lives--electricity, heating, clothing, buildings, even food substances. Can alternatives to fossil fuels be found quickly enough to slow the problems caused by climate change? In the end, it may come down to what we truly need to live and what we can live without.

This book contains three short stories that were previously published separately and deal with interactions between men and women. 1) SO LATE IN THE DAY: We meet Cathal on what should have been the happiest day of his life but instead he gets to spend the day in introspection, thinking about where things went wrong. 2) THE LONG AND PAINFUL DEATH: A female writer arrives at the Böll House writer's retreat on Achill Island, Ireland, for two weeks of gloriously peaceful writing, only to be pestered by a German scholar. 3) ANTARCTICA: A middle-aged married woman decides she wants a taste of sexual freedom before she gets too old. She tells her husband she is going to do some Christmas shopping in the city over the weekend and there she meets a man with darker plans than she could have wished for.A great taste of Claire Keegan's writing.

I'm dating myself here but I went to university from 1966-1971 so I was in the midst of all these things that were happening. Such tumultuous times with the war, the protests, the sit-ins, the marches, the assassinations, the Civil Rights movement, riots. When I was home, my family would watch the war coverage on the nightly news during dinner and my dad and I would argue over it--so much so that my poor mom would run around closing windows so the neighbors wouldn't hear us, lol. And OMG, the music! The sound track to our lives! My husband was drafted (before I knew him) but was sent to Germany to serve. Fortunately none of our friends were killed in Vietnam, but every one of them, to a man, came back damaged in some significant way. But we didn't hear about the women who went to war. Kristin Hannah has created a novel to change that, to show the role played by women in Vietnam. Sure, they weren't in actual combat, but they faced horrors and dangers and worked hard under impossible conditions to help save as many wounded soldiers as possible. Theirs was often the last caring face a dying soldier saw, the last sweet encouraging words they heard. And then to go home to be spat on and shamed. To be told by veteran's groups 'There were no women in Vietnam.' And so to not get the help so badly needed to recover from PTSD, as it is now known. Terrific story told with great heart and understanding. I loved all these characters. What a time to come of age! I received an arc of this novel from the author and publisher via NetGalley.

Mary is a remarkable woman, courageous with strong principles, proud of her Crow heritage. Grissom weaves an intimate story about her marriage and the love that develops between husband and wife. It's distressing once again to read how poorly native people were treated and how their customs were disregarded by the government who wanted them to become assimilated to white society.

The main character, Titus Crown, is a former FBI Special Agent working in Domestic Terrorism, who has returned home to rural Charon County, Virginia, and is currently the first Black sheriff in the county's history.Normally things are pretty quiet in that corner of Virginia near the Chesapeake but then a call comes in about an active shooter at the local school. It's a former student, a troubled young man that Titus knows well, and he has killed a much-loved teacher. The take-down at the school doesn't go well and as Titus and his deputies begin their follow-up investigation, they uncover some horrifying facts about that beloved teacher and his former student but realize there's another man involved in these crimes--a man Titus calls the Last Wolf. This is one of the best police procedurals I've ever read. But be forewarned, the murders are quite gruesome and graphic. Cosby's writing is taut, dramatic and often quite beautiful. The deep-seated racism inherent in small-town America is woven throughout the story and there's quite a bit of discussion of religion as well--especially the hypocrisy of many who call themselves Christians. Cosby's characters are quite well drawn, believable and flawed human beings.

But plants can also kill in this world and the story opens with an apprentice investigator named Dinios Kol arriving at the scene of a horrific murder at the home of a wealthy landowner, Kaygi Haza. The murder victim is Commander Taqtasa Blas of the Engineers who had spent the night in the villa and seems to have been poisoned. Dinios is 'an officer for the Index, the imperial administration responsible for managing the high courts and delivering justice throughout the Empire.' He works for Immunis Anagosa Dolabra, currently the Iudex Investgator of the Daretana Canton. Ana rarely leaves her home and keeps herself blindfolded to avoid too much stimulation. But Din is an 'engraver,' meaning he has been enhanced to be able to remember everything he sees and is told, so he can come back to Ana and describe the scene of the murder in detail and repeat the testimony of witnesses. It is later learned that 10 other Engineers have been similarly poisoned in neighboring Talagray. Their deaths have weakened the Empire's defense system built to keep the Leviathans in the sea from coming ashore and attacking the cities and their citizens. Ana and Din are called in to investigate these deaths as well. There they find lies, greed and intrigue and perhaps more than one killer at work. Jackson has built quite a unique world where danger lurks around every corner which makes for a riveting mystery. The author mentions in his acknowledgments that his reading of Nero Wolfe mysteries inspired so much of Ana, but he 'eventually decided she was more like Hannibal Lecter than Wolfe.'

I have to admit to feeling a little disappointed by this book. It reminded me quite a lot of Rachel Joyce's series that starts out with The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry but her books worked much better for me.The plot has three timelines. It begins in 2006 when Bob Comet, a retired librarian, decides to volunteer at the Gambell-Reed Senior Center in Portland, Oregon. When one of the residents with cognitive problems wanders off, her son has to be called, and when Bob sees him for the first time, he realizes who the missing woman is, someone from his past. The story then flashes back to the years 1942 to 1960 and we learn more about Bob's life--his relationship with his single mother, how he became a librarian and how he met his wife and his best friend. This is my favorite part of the story--it's full of life's crazy situations, sometimes humorous, sometimes heart-breaking. The next section is set in 1945, when Bob is 11-1/2 years old and decides to run away from home. That part didn't work as well for me and I felt it bogged down the story. And finally we return to 2006, when Bob returns to the senior center, this time as a resident. Bob comes across as a genuinely nice man, perhaps a bit too passive and accepting of what life throws at him. I can't say that I felt any real connection to him and I don't think I'm going to take anything memorable away from having read his story. And finally, the ending fell flat for me.

This is my first taste of Susie Finkbeiner's writing and I am totally hooked. Her latest story is set in the Detroit suburbs in 1952 and features the Hardings, a warm, loving, close-knit family. William, the father, is a successful author, often compared to Steinbeck. The mother, Louisa, is an English immigrant who keeps the family and household humming along. They have three kids: the oldest, Patrick, is married to Peggy; then there's Bertha whose big dream is to play baseball; and finally there's Florence, who is 12, a big reader, and quite the outspoken chatterbox. Is that why she has few friends? She is that kid who gets picked on in school. The story is told by Bert and Flossie, in alternating chapters. Things begin to fall apart rapidly for the family when their father is named as a Communist party member by a neighbor. When the very safety of the family is threatened, they move to live with Uncle Matt in northern Michigan. The term 'all-American' can have many meanings. What comes to mind immediately is the jingle 'baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet' but Finkbeiner explores other meanings in her rich and evocative story. The Red Scare was a dark moment in our country's history which brought out the worst in some people. Finkbeiner's characters are so real, as are the misfortunes that come their way but their faith and love seem to help them cope. This was a trip down memory lane for me. Having grown up in a Detroit suburb in that era myself, I felt right at home with these characters. They could have been my own neighbors but I hope we wouldn't have treated them so badly. I was a big Tigers baseball fan and all the neighborhood kids played ball together on a vacant lot--no sexual discrimination there! And most of the books Flossie reads and enjoys, such as Anne of Green Gables, Jane Eyre, Little Women, and of course, Nancy Drew, were my very own favorites. So many sweet memories!I received an arc of this new novel from the author and publisher via NetGalley. Many thanks for the opportunity. My  is voluntary and the opinions expressed are my own.
