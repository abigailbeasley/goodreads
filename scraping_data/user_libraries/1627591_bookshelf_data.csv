He also insists that there is cause for optimism that the United States can, through its democratic institutions, find ways to reduce health care costs and income inequality, build a solid system of pre-school education, find a balance in immigration policy that does not extend the mistakes of the past, pursue an anti-trust policy that Amazon, Google, bank banks, and other intricately constructed monopolists can't outwit, and heal the tribal breaches in the electorate that have led from disagreement to contempt and hatred. I don't know whether I join him in his optimistic--or hopeful--outlook.

He sketches out a form of national politics that isn't ""let's meet in the middle,"" or ""let's cut the baby in half."" His vision is more sophisticated. He explores why working class, Latino, Asian and other voters have drifted away from the Democratic party. He sets the stage for understanding the wildly eccentric and wrathful era of Trump. He argues for a politics in which one group doesn't look down on the other...or feel looked down upon by the other. He challenges the absolutist liberal purity of the highly-educated Democrat brahmins, and he takes a long look at the ways Republican tax policy, particularly from Reagan through the two Bush presidents to Trump, has shortchanged national needs and pumped too much money and influence into the pockets of the the wealthy, the rich, the superrich, and the unbelievably super-super rich. Time and again he points out ways in which countries like Canada, Denmark, and Germany score better in important categories of national performance.This is a very good, very balanced, insightful book.

The story then moves along like a dolphin, sometimes you glimpse its back and other times it is swimming beneath the water. The heart of the novel lies in Conrad’s fantastic characterizations which in turn depend on the impasto of his writing, a smearing on of adjectives and modifications and tergiversations that is heavy but beautiful. Once a character enters the story, he/she is caught under Conrad’s microscope. The flaws and quirks show, the weaknesses and strengths. The secret agent’s family does its best not to know exactly what he is up to, and yet his movements and associations come through, sometimes by candlelight, sometimes by street light. What goes around comes around as the circles tighten upon themselves. We see embassy potentates and high-ranking members of parliament in their hauteur. We see crummy, feckless revolutionaries. We see a fantastic portrayal of a woman betrayed attempting to recover her footing after her fate seems sealed—this portrayal emerging with the delicacy of a hammer striking an anvil. Conrad’s writing approaches overwriting without becoming purple or losing its edge of cynicism. There are sentences that remind you of Lawrence or Faulkner but are distinctively Conradian. I will never understand how a young Pole became such a master of the English language. This is not a book that possesses any particular grandeur other than in its reliably powerful prose. It might be too sour for some because of the sordid tale it relates, and it might be too rich for others in the fine, sometimes amazing, psychological and moral judgments it makes, but contemporary writers of spy stories and the like just don’t have the genius Conrad possessed to write sentences so deeply considered that they make your head spin.....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 09, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Jan 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61941039-the-secret-agent

Why not? Well, Werner Heisenberg's physics and subsequent experiments tell us it is impossible because we dwell in space-time (that is our dimension and reference, if you will) and particles do not. Further, the simple act of our measuring a particle alters it. No one has to tell the particle, ""Hey, I'm measuring you,"" for it to know the measuring is happening. Somehow the particle picks this up on its own, and somehow a particle can adjust/manifest its state faster than the speed of light--the word for this is ""superluminal""-- which is the supreme measuring stick of space-time and, until Heisenberg developed quantum theory, was thought to be impossible. In effect, quantum theory presents us with a physics beyond our ken. This could be called the physics of uncertainty, an epistemological dead-end.Kant, William Egginton states, already understood that some things are, in fact, impossible to know because our reasoning capability sets its own limits, creating the reality within which we think we live. Borges, Egginton notes, captures the essence of our entrapment in fictions that are in line with the paradoxes of quantum theory: Funes the Memorius and The Garden of Forking Paths.Often when a writer tries to combine such disparate thinkers and artists, there is a forced quality to the outcome. In this case, no. Somehow Kant through philosophy and Borges through literature described the quantum experience that Heisenberg teased out of scientific inquiry. Egginton expends a fair amount of effort jousting with the notion that uncertainty might in some way relieve a human being of ethical responsibility. His point is that we have the freedom to complete our reality by the choices we make. We can do the right thing even if, viewed from a quantum perspective, we operate with substantial informational deficits, i.e., uncertainty. This a demanding book, but it's worth reading if you are curious about the limits of what you can know and the possibilities inherent in what you can't....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 03, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63946909-the-rigor-of-angels

I had the impression that Ayer thought he had cornered philosophy and was preparing to skin it by debunking the notion of religious ideas (and all metaphysics) in his emphasis on the limits of language and what we can ""know"" through its use, but since there is nothing about religion in the book, I could only infer that to be the case.Ayer and other logical positivists (empirically minded) philosophers were determined to boil the nonsense out of what we say and think. The present volume takes the reader through a long string of these Oxford philosophers in mid-20th century who read as the product of a Protestant, Little England, conservative ethos, although they would violently dispute the notion that something as vague as ""ethos"" has any meaning at all. Their thrust was toward the particular; ethos is some kind of fuzzy generalization. Ergo, what I have written here is nonsense.Well, maybe so, but as I read through the interdependent biographies of Ayer, Gilbert Ryle, Stuart Hampshire, I did have the uncharitable sense that they were not quite philosophers; rather, they saw themselves as quasi-scientists in the fields of philology and/or lexicography. At best they all seemed to ascribe to a reasonable proposition: Clarity of thought yields clarity of expression. Put another way, I would say that in order to write well, you must think well. This is not really headline news.What was Ayer's book doing in this course, really? I'm still not sure. I suppose the message was that ""religious ideas"" is an oxymoron, similar to ""military intelligence."" But the course professor was more histrionic and exhuberant than clear in what he was up to.

Greenhouse says it was written in a hurry, and that’s evident in various passages that seem redundant or chronologically out of place, but there is a great deal of insight here, and if the book is not a pleasure to read, it is informative.The narrative arc basically tracks the rightward swing of the court as advanced by its most conservative members. To call them conservative may be understating things. Alito, Gorsuch, Kavenaugh, Coney Barrett, and Thomas are a sullen bunch. This account places considerable emphasis on how unwilling they were to testify to their views during confirmation hearings and how often they and the right-wing activists who adore them have strained and pushed in successful attempts to shove religion into national life. Rather appeal to the law of the land in constitutional terms, the activists want to redefine it by repeatedly pointing out how injured they are by not being allowed to place their religious conscience above the law. The aforementioned justices are fine with that. Alito in particular thinks religion, i.e., Christianity, has gotten a bad deal, but the impetus for replanting Christianity at the center of national identity comes from all five. Four of them are Catholics, for what it’s worth, although four of every five Americans are not Catholics. So you don’t have to bake a cake for someone who is gay if it will injure your conscience and if you don’t want a gay couple to temporarily foster a child, you don’t have to permit that, and if you want you child to go to a Catholic school at the general public’s expense, that’s fine. And of course there is antiabortion sentiment and states’ right to govern a woman’s womb.  On numerous occasions we see how picayune the issues brought before the court really are. There is an industry of groups devoted to fashioning and advancing complaints that the court could simply not address but, because of its membership, eagerly does so. It is as if the court were a climbing wall with cracks all over its face that these groups grab at in an attempt to go over the top. They are analogous to lobbyists advancing special interests, sometimes creating special interests, desperately scratching for a place to insert at least a fingernail to ensure that if they don’t rise, at least they won’t fall.Within the narrative arc, we see the Chief Justice John Roberts lose his control over the court’s agenda and decision making. The gang of five have shoved him out of the way. Much as he would like to cautiously advance a conservative agenda, he is trampled in the rush to through caution to the wind.Post-Ginsburg, the three liberal justices are largely left to dissent. This polarization resembles but is not quite as severe as what we see in Congress, but the fact that the gang of five consistently twist and turn to advance its political views through “originalist’ and “textualist” readings of the constitution is cynical and depressing.The court’s astonishing misreading of the second amendment, which occurred before the gang of five came into power, might be thought of as the judgment that set the stage for the many wrong turns that followed. Read the second amendment and you will see that it was written to ensure that an armed militia could be called upon in the absence of formal state police power in the 18th century. Law enforcement didn’t have cars and radios back then. Order might break down. A militia might be needed to hold the fort, or, as often was the case, chase and capture runaway slaves. That’s clearly what the so-called Fathers or Founders had in mind. Any disinterested English teacher would explain the second amendment’s text to you this way. The second amendment is largely irrelevant in a time when the police powers of the state are virtually military-grade. No need for militias. No need, fortunately, to chase runaway slaves. And no need for assault rifles in private hands, either.Ultimately we can best understand the court as an institution caught up in a cultural backlash. Our national identity is changing and has changed, and the present court is a key element of the resistance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Dec 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57499891-justice-on-the-brink

Actually it focuses on the post-Civil War reconstruction of the entire country during the final four decades of the 19th century. Richardson depicts a country in continuous battle over whether the government should remain small and let the cream of society rise to the top or be active in protecting and advancing the special interests of not only former slaves but immigrants, workers, Indians, and women. Her mission is not to take sides in this debate; it is to describe what happened. She argues that the enduring discomfort between the North and South found a pressure relief value in the West, a place where honesty, hard work, faith and family gave Americans a chance to develop an odd kind of heroic individualism which in fact constantly relied upon federal support. She spends a lot of time focusing on the struggle between labor and business, a lot of time on the struggle of women to occupy an equal place in society, and a fair amount of time on the destruction of the indigenous peoples of America. Although she writes a great deal about a variety of Black leaders and common folk, her observations seem somewhat thin. Nonetheless she makes clear that the reaction against Blacks obtaining post-war privileges they previously were denied was fierce and effective. Corruption and White rage undid the best of intentions, and as she presents America, the guiding ethos became the creation of the middle class. Oddly, the capstone figure in this process became Teddy Roosevelt, the Easterner who became known as a Westerner, a man who was both a trust-buster and a Rough Rider. Why he should have been the hood ornament of the middle class is not entirely clear to me, but it had to do with bringing the East and West together…and not spending much time on the South.I found the writing in the book wordy and wasn’t as interested in the long quotes from famous men and women as Richardson seems to have been. I also wondered if the book were not too ambitious; to cover so much ground, Richardson has to make many sweeping judgments. That can be disconcerting at times and dizzying at times.

The writing here is superb. Boyers picks apart human complexity with amazing skill. Sontag was brilliant, mercurial, egocentric and needy. For a variety of reasons Boyers and his wife Peg offered her a kind of safe harbor. She could be exciting to know and she could be a nasty piece of work; she took offense easily, rode a high horse, and could turn on you fast (which she did on Boyers in a memorable tantrum.) Steiner appears as a controversial figure whose wide-ranging interests irritated academics and specialists everywhere but also commanded enormous attention in both the U.S. and Europe.I read pieces and books by Sontag and Steiner for many years. Each had a way of burrowing into the work of others and bringing insights to bear that were astonishingly erudite and provocative. It was never clear to me that Sontag's principle interest lay in communicating clearly. She could be a heavy read, often referring to writers I had not heard of or engineering strange perspectives on writers I did know well. Steiner's range of references was breathtaking. In contrast to Sontag, he was pretty clear, less self-involved in being unique and superior. Why did these two contemporaries dislike or avoid one another? Simple, they shared the same patch of European/American literary soil. Elbows were thrown. Boyers seemed to have been an artful diplomat in maintaining good relations with both of them.One might question how important literary postures and interpretations are, especially now in the soundbite world of digital communication, but even twenty and thirty years ago when Sontag and Steiner were major figures. Fair enough, but if you care, if you find battles over texts between writers enriching and mind-expanding, the question answers itself when it comes to Sontag and Steiner. They taught ambitious readers how to read even more ambitiously.As a literary insider's book, this is one of the best I have read. It goes much deeper than gossip and anecdote.

The first was that I bought it on Kindle when my granddaughter reached over and poked the buy button that I did not intend to poke myself.The second surprise was that after some clunky, forced writing in the first chapters, I expected that I would have to stop reading because it was so amateurish. But as the book progressed, the writing got better and better. This could be because Vertosick became a better writer as he kept writing; more likely, the material, fairly clinical, became more engrossing as Vertosick moved into relating real problems that afflicted real people and required more of him as he progressed up the ladder to becoming a qualified neurosurgeon.The portrait Vertosick paints of the generic neurosurgeon's arrogance--fighter pilot stuff--is not pretty. If you've ever wondered what your surgeon says behind your back, here it is. Much of that blather seems defensive in nature. These men and women live through watching a lot of death they can't forestall, so they tend to step back and disassociate themselves from the human element.Vertosick recounts his own hardening of spirit, but he clearly retains whatever it takes to write a book this candid, realistic, and so full of frustrations. Sometimes his patients survive and prosper. More often, if you need a neurosurgeon, it would seem you already are in pretty deep trouble.As part of his training he spent six weeks in the neurology department of a London hospital. The difference between the practices there and in the U.S. are fascinating. At the time in question, apparently 25+ years ago, at least, the technology available in the U.S. was not readily available in the U.K. U.K. doctors apparently compensated with much more detailed face-to-face assessments; they also took things slow. Neurologists, remember, are non-cutting partners to neurosurgeons, so even in the U.S. Vertosick might have found that neurologists were behind the technological curve. But he ended up doing this part of his training in London, and he gives good account of what he learned, including what he thought was pretty old-fashioned and almost nonchalant.

It's good, clear, and direct if not especially elegant.)I first read Anna Karenina fifty years ago when I inherited the job of teaching it and other Russian classics to some juniors and seniors at a private school in Massachusetts. Pretty soon I found myself sitting on my desk in front of the class and realized the kids were teaching themselves. I didn't have to get my oar wet to push things along. Pretty amazing. Having reread AK just now, I am more amazed, given that I think the book is way too long and in its tight domestic focus lacks the grandeur of War and Peace. Tolstoy apparently wanted to write a ""novel,"" though, and in his mind novels were domestic stories--he did not think War and Peace was a novel, and he said so.Length aside, the two principal characters, Levin and Anna are exceptional figures: Levin because he is so stubborn, unsure of himself, strong, questioning, and emotional; Anna because she tries to do something in having an affair with Vronsky that ""society"" would not allow and succumbs to one of the great literary explorations of clinical/suicidal depressions fueled by guilt, shame, and unfounded jealousy. Her mental deterioration could be used, and probably has been used, in medical schools. In some ways--literary ways--she foreshadows Molly Bloom and other modernist characters from Prufrock to the female protagonists of Virginia Woolf. Tolstoy crumbles her thought process, he turns it into meaningless dust. Undoubtedly he records aspects of his own depressive episodes. I don't know how else he could occupy this wretched psychological terrain.Along the way, as Levin ascends and Anna descends, Tolstoy displays his uncanny skill in depicting the high-born and low-born of Russia at the time. He is satirical, empathetic, objective, and penetrating. There are moments in Levin's experience as a landowner that reflect the satisfactions first--to my knowledge--reflected in the poetry of Horace. He is fulfilled in actions, not talk.At the critical point in Levin's rise out of his own depression he broods his way to two insights that struck me rather profoundly. The first I would summarize in this way: You cannot believe in God by yourself. (Don't you find that interesting?) Tolstoy would have this notion extend through the necessary support of a church to the length and breadth of an entire people. Fumbling along, Levin makes his way past the lonely torture of Kierkegaard's and Bergman's doubters; he comes to believe that it is impossible to know and accept God as an isolated act of reason or psychological force; one must live within not just a community of others, one must also live within the community of the natural world. Levin catches this insight and lets it slip away and catches again. Tolstoy's genius in offering a counterpoint between Levin and Anna at the end of the (long) novel is tremendous.The second insight that emerges from Levin's turmoil is that God's gift to humanity is basically one thing: the concept of the good, or goodness. Otherwise all would be bestial. Tolstoy doesn't single out love, although love could be used here instead of goodness, and he doesn't present it in terms of God loving humanity; he presents it as a possibility to be seized within the other possibilities in human existence.So I ended up thinking back on the amazing stamina and excitement I observed in those teenagers at the Cambridge School of Weston.

The bluI had not heard of John McGahern until I came across this book of stories in my favorite used bookstore, located in Pittsboro, North Carolina. The blurb on the front cover proclaimed him the best short story writer since James Joyce.I don’t believe in awards for writers or declarations to the effect that so-and-so is the best. These are arbitrary and subjective para-literary phenomena. But of the finest Irish short stories writers I know of at work since Joyce, John McGahern belongs in the same class as Edna O’Brien and William Trevor.The stories in this book are stunners. They’re quiet, they’re moving, they’re subtle, they’re penetrating. They unfold with a marvelous pace, they capture family and romantic tensions with the greatest skill, they probe secrets, memories, and desires.McGahern was a master of the form. He knew what Chekhov and Hemingway did with it, and he certainly knew what Joyce did with it. The last story in this collection, “The Country Funeral,” is as good in its way as Joyce’s “The Dead.” Three brothers in their forties, who disliked their uncle, have to go to his funeral after not having seen him for twenty years. Each brother has a reason for bridling over this chore, but their mother, the uncle’s sister, is too feeble to make the journey to a village on the bogs…where it turns out that the villagers adored the uncle. The brothers have to accept and learn from the villagers’ judgment. One, the brother who was born without legs, chooses not to. He remains convinced that the uncle would have put him in a bag, loaded it with stones, and thrown him into the bog when he was a boy. The ways in which he combats his brothers’ conversion to respect, if not affection, for the dead uncle are splendid and outrageously funny. There is a line in this story I think I must have encountered elsewhere, but I cannot recall where. It goes this way: If the rich could pay the poor to die for them, the rich would be immortal. There’s a lot of truth in that, and it perfectly reflects the Irish disdain for class and economic distinctions—notably the distinctions imposed by the colonialist English until they were thrown off the island south of Belfast.I almost never give 5 star ratings.

He expended his prodigious talents and wit to the bitter end on a novel that rides on the voice of Frank Bascombe, a writer now realtor, who lives on the New Jersey coast, has two difficult adult children, has been left by his second wife, and strives earnestly and endlessly to convince himself (and the reader) that he and the world ultimately are going to be all right. Occasionally Frank drives over to Haddam, which I take to be some form of Princeton, where his first marriage ended and his earlier career as a writer petered out. Along the way he has encounters, flirtations, spats, a minor bar fight, a cop stop, a funeral, a surprising conversation with his first wife who seems interested in getting together again now that his second wife has taken off, and so forth. All this is rendered in wry, amusing detail but tends to go, as Frank’s life tends to go, nowhere. He is blessed in what he calls the permanent period of life with no aspirations other than to reunite with his fugitive second wife, but she has to come back first, so there’s not much he can do other than observe New Jersey and its random characters, some immigrants, some ethnically-enriched, some sexy, some near-drooling in the final stages of getting old, and some, like his children, intricately problematic but also permanently so, determined not to be left behind as Frank wanders around, checks in on properties, counsels his Tibetan-American junior partner, and thinks about trying things under the sheets with women other than his first wife. This is a quasi-picaresque novel that goes on and on…and on. Having spent a part of my life in New Jersey, I tip my hat to Ford’s tenacity in squeezing every conceivable perversity and a few beauties out of the state and its people, but his ambitions are superficial, as are his conclusions. This is a book about a man of middle age trying to figure out how to give up gracefully, at peace with how things have turned out for him; he is not down-and-out, he’s doing all right, he rather enjoys the low bar he has set for himself. Toward the end of the book everything goes boom for a while, but then it settles back down, things are resolved more or less safely, and the second wife reappears.Another mid-Atlantic writer, John Updike, produced a series of novels about Harry Angstrom that preceded and are roughly analogous to Ford’s Bascombe novels. The important difference—other than settings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey—seems to be that Updike, also a master of description and detail, compressed his material better and managed to make even relatively hopeless relationships matter more. It seems to me that Ford’s strength lies in writing short stories. Updike had that strength, too, of course, but Updike held his novels together better than Ford. In this novel, Ford is something of a stone skipper glancing off the water in shorter and shorter flights until he just sort of sinks, which is more or less how the novel ends....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Sep 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12372.The_Lay_of_the_Land

He insists on the little hatreds that go along with admiring someone. His protagonist, Pierre, is a marvelous figure, large-hearted, clumsy, naive, wise, and true. Lesser figures are full of vanities and insecurities that mirror his but come in smaller packages. The war in War in Peace ultimately is Napoleon's folly. The peace ranges from high-culture salons to nurseries to the book-lined study of an appalling old count who oppresses his daughter until he faces death and then seeks her forgiveness.Tolstoy establishes a narrative momentum that interweaves war and peace with astonishing ease. HIs story elements shine on each other. I could go on and on.I first read War and Peace while on the job working in a county park in Oaks, Pennsylvania, fifty years ago.

He treats a young American, Nicole Warren, who has been abused by her father and shows signs of schizophrenia. As the novel opens, the Divers are presiding over a party at their house on the Riviera. He is not treating Nicole anymore. He has married her. A very young Hollywood starlet, Rosemary, joins the fun and is smitten with Dick. Over time (years) they flirt before having an affair. Nicole, who sometimes goes off the deep end, goes off the deep end. Dick and Rosemary don't last. Dick has been drinking too much and keeps on doing it. Fitzgerald depicts the descent of the Divers' marriage in painful detail. As Dick dives deeper, Nicole manages to rise a bit and succumbs to the advances of an old friend, Tommy, a soldier of fortune, who has been in love with her for years. It is a semi-civilized split-up. Dick wanders around New York state as a G.P.So...this is an unhappy book that functions, as Fitzgerald says, as a ""romance,"" meaning that the emotions are accentuated and the scale of life exceeds normal, work-a-day existence. Surely Fitzgerald drew heavily on his own alcoholism and his painful marriage to Zelda in developing his characters and a good bit of his setting (the Fitizgeralds lived hard in Europe, partying too much, drinking too much, running around too much.) There are passages that are penetrating and persuasive--most of the book is that way, actually--and there are passages that are overwritten, precious, purple--only a few, but they stick out. Dick is in full crash at the end of the book, but Nicole's relationship with Tommy certainly doesn't look stable and long lasting to me.An issue crops up repeatedly: Fitzgerald indulges in reflections on ""women"" in accord with the judgments of his time, and the judgments of his time were silly, sexist, and beneath him. That stuff could have been edited out to good effect.One strength is the way in which Dick, Nicole, and Rosemary develop during the narrative. This is interesting and well done.For a book that is going to spiral into sadness, Tender is the Night is too long, but it is nonetheless remarkable that a writer like Fitzgerald, who debauched too much, retained so much writerly skill. By 44 he was dead of heart failure and a few other things, I suppose.

Now that I have read it, I come away pleased and impressed. The writing is lovely, the characterizations are even better. Fitzgerald had spent enough time in Hollywood to learn how to mix his fundamental romanticism with the rough stuff of making “movies.” This is an unfinished novel, a great pity, but in an unsentimental sentimentalist like producer Monroe Stahr Fitzgerald captured the tensions between making money and making dreams. Stahr and many other characters, each drawn deftly, clearly know that their time in the dream factory is fully of hypocrisy, guesswork, money grubbing, and talent crushing. The opening passage in which a washed-up Hollywood denizen commits suicide on the grounds of Andrew Jackson’s home in Tennessee is something I cannot imagine Fitzgerald writing in his previous work. It’s sad, sordid, and soon becomes yesterday’s new, and yet it is strange enough to be unforgettable. Stahr falls for a woman who reminds him of his deceased wife just as the woman is finalizing her plan to marry another guy—but having her doubts. She eludes and enchants and offends him; she gives him what he wants and then takes it away; she’s not a bitch; she simply seems to understand that Stahr is too wasted inside to seize the last chance she gives him. I did not expect Fitzgerald ever to write a novel so caught up in the ins and outs of work…any kind of work. But the picture business does get the business here. The Last Tycoon is a good counterpart to The Day of the Locust by Nathaniel West.The edition I read was put together by the indefatigable Matthew Bruccoli, an American academic. There are some blemishes in the text, and it is incomplete. My guess is that Fitzgerald was about half way through writing The Last Tycoon when he died, at 44. It could have become his best. I’m not the first to suggest this, and as I say, I’m not sure why I took so long to read it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 19, 2023","Jul 19, 2023","Jul 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16857.The_Love_of_the_Last_Tycoon

At 27 she is a prodigy who has gone Stella Maris is a novel that consists of dialogue between a self-admitted psychiatric patient and a psychiatrist. At 27 she is a prodigy who has gone off the tracks, her field being mathematics but her knowledge being much broader. She is ostensibly paranoid schizophrenic because she has had visitations from apparently autonomous familiars and considers them real and because she has been on the run, carelessly and recklessly, from her studies, her fellowships, and the tragic demise of her race car driving brother--and her father--and her mother. Tough lifeThe fencing that goes on between the two protagonists is witty, colorful, provocative and fun. The patient has an answer or an evasion for everything. The psychiatrist more or less can follow her. The dialogue generally is pitch perfect although toward the end McCarthy's Faulknerian voice intrudes. A fair amount of the showy stuff the patient trots out--advanced mathematics, heavy philosophy--is more or less local color. Readers will recognize the names, but they may not know much about Wittgenstein or Gödel. The endpoint of her assaults on reality is that it is an invention, much as the weird spiel she offers on what it is like to drown yourself in the depths of Lake Tahoe is an invention. We can take this character as stretched up to the limits of fiction; her redemption lies in the pirouettes she offers when recounting things like falling in love and staying in love with her brother or falling out of love with some of her mathematical heroes.Toward the end of his writing career and life McCarthy clearly had much of the stuff under consideration at the Santa Fe Institute on his mind. Said Institute considers ""complexity"" in mathematical/multi-dimensional ways, ""complexity"" being a non-thing that our patient would note is a matter of pure invention, like numbers. I don't know how much McCarthy really understood about things like topology, which is the study of geometric properties and spatial relations unaffected by the continuous change of shape or size of figures.He might have been parroting stuff. Or maybe he had hitherto unknown mathematical gifts. Some literature aspires to be understood as a form of scientific inquiry and possibly knowledge. Talking about sci/math stuff, however, probably isn't the way to get there. But again, it can be engrossing.Ultimately the joy of dialogue as the core of fiction, or its totality, is the requirement that the story continuously be balanced on a tightrope.

Although written by an academic historian, it reads like something by one of the better journalists who have pondered the Iraq fiasco. Leffler is particularly good at portraying the fissures in the Bush administration that led to the tragic neglect of post-invasion planning. He assigns most of the blame to Rumsfeld, who didn't want troops to hang around in Iraq after toppling Saddam, and he gives Condi Rice credit for trying, but failing, to counteract the consequences of Rumsfeld's views. There aren't many new findings here, but Leffler offers a number of judgments and interpretations that are useful and important.He is clear that this was George W. Bush's war. Bush was not pushed into it by neoconservative voices or by Dick Cheney, who was not--in Leffler's view--a neoconservative himself. (Rather, Cheney was and remains a conservative nationalist.) Bush, Leffler argues, decided on regime change when he saw no other way to eliminate what he wrongly thought were Saddam's WMD assets. He and the rest of his administration were haunted by 9/11, did not want another attack on the U.S., and logically--but again, wrongly--concluded that the defiant Iraqi dictator would contribute to another such attack. Hence the invasion.Leffler's portrait of Bush in general is that of an intelligent, serious man more interested in domestic policy than foreign affairs. This is an accurate but pretty kind way of describing him.Leffler's portrait of Rumsfeld as a cocksure, aggressive, imperious Secretary of Defense is vivid, but not news.George Tenant and company (the whole intelligence community) aren't put under the microscope here. A point Leffler makes more than once is that Bush was operating more from a long series of bits and pieces of intelligence than a comprehensive, thoroughly vetted assessment or a ""smoking gun."" Powell's calamitous UN presentation confirmed the fact that there was no reliable, comprehensive, thoroughly vetted intel assessment. Leffler does not dwell on the misleading way the ""source"" called Curveball was used to hype the WMD threat.In the end Bush had painted himself in a corner: Either topple Saddam or live with the fictitious WMD threat that his own administration had sold the American public. He chose toppling Saddam but had no vision of what would follow Saddam, which was predictable chaos and savagery. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 09, 2023","Jul 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/75619376-confronting-saddam-hussein

One might have suspected that, but then again,one might not have, so when it's revealed, and there are passages that are really grim--long bouts of drinking vanilla, as in kitchen vanilla, for the high alcohol content, for instance--one has, or I had, a sense that the somewhat rubbery persona of this charming person, bouncing along through ups and downs, is something of a mask which places all of her candor--there is a lot of candor-- in an odd light. By this I mean that alcoholics may seem cheery, may seem resilient, but alcoholism--like other addictions--is a terrible thing built on desperate needs and lots of lies. I would go so far as to say that the addicted dimension of a person really isn't the person at all; it's the howling, demanding physiological requirement of more booze, pills, whatever. The person can fall into this black hole or fight her way out of it. Either way, the addiction fights back.Having had these thoughts, I came to wonder why the author's alcoholism wasn't introduced earlier because she must have had trouble with it through all of the downs, and the ups, that she struggles through. There must have been more humiliations, more depression, and so forth that probably should have, in all candor, been mixed into this memoir.

I found the title and the author's photo off-putting, as I did the questionable title, echoing Hitler.At long last I bought a copy of Volume 1 at a bookstore and was surprised by the loping pace of a bildungsroman and all the details, innumerable details, associated with a boy's actions, perceptions, self-doubt, desire, and confusion. In the main these were mundane details; it took me about 200 hundred pages to accept the fact that the mundane was the point. Here is how you learn to play a guitar. Here is how the light hits your bedroom window when you are staying at grandma's. Here is what it feels like to worship and yet avoid your older brother. Here is the sequence of events involved in taking the trash bag out of the wastebasket, pulling its red string to tighten the opening, tying the red string, clumping down the back stairs with it and tossing it into the large trashcan outside, the one parked next to the gray Volvo that had not started for years, probably because of the battery.Why are such things of interest? Why are the descriptions inserted into the tale-telling, the yellow light in Norway in high summer, appealing...even useful in a literary sense.As a writer I would bore myself to death recording all this; I couldn't do it. As a reader, however, I began to find Karl Ove's plight in a dysfunctional family compelling, and I understood that as a boy and then a teenager, he had very little to work with other than the routines of going to school and enduring family gatherings over the holidays. Knausgård's best strategy lies in the way he frames these memories within the context of his first failed marriage and then his second, seemingly viable marriage. This helps convince the reader that so much random recollection will lead to bigger things. Meanwhile Knausgård is embarrassingly honest about being jilted, about his first orgasm, about his crummy guitar playing, about the many ways he tries to make it advantageous that his mother has moved away and his father, with whom he ostensibly lives, has no interest in him.Here is a kid not overdrawn like Holden Caulfield, a kid who fumbles at rebelling, a kid who can be fooled and ostracized without acquiring a kind of stage voice, broadcasting the insults and indignities of growing up.Then comes the powerful, unpleasantly realistic aftermath of his alcoholic father's demise, the physical mess he made of himself and the mess he made of his mother's house when he could no longer manage a house of his own. And Karl Ove and his brother have to confront what their old man has done. This is, if you will, the existential struggle--trying not to be sucked into their father's death.I don't think I will read any of the following volumes, but I am okay with having read this one....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jun 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26145543-my-struggle

But in some ways the writing brings those concerns to the fore. This could be a much better, possibly great novel. Even so, of course, it is very good.Jules is a lawyer in his sixties recently divorced, very successful, and possessed by the idea that he should give away his worldly goods and who knows...maybe disappear into Israel. He gives all this a try, starting out as an amalgamation of Bellow characters (Henderson, Herzog), wanting so much and having achieved so much, unbelievably talented and dominating, and yet feeling ever more hollow...and possibly jumping to his death from a Tel Aviv Hilton balcony. Although he is one of the two characters Forest Dark features, he is the lesser one in my estimation, partly because Krauss insists on fiddling with the idea that he is somehow a descendent of King David.Ruth, a novelist in her thirties, has lost faith in her marriage and can't write. She is lured into traveling to Israel, a second home to her, where she still can't write but runs into a character who invades her fantasy life to the point that she is portrayed carrying around a lot of unknown Kafka material and ending up in a desert-retreat, supposedly as Kafka, unbeknown to the world, ended up (not having died in Europe at all).Ruth's rumination about the nature of the double, her own sense of being a double, Jewish thought and history, is terrific. She anatomizes the failure of her marriage powerfully and convincingly. The problem is borrowing Kafka as a kind of double (more less as Jules seems to have borrowed King David).This means that two intertwined story lines with potentially real guts becomes a post-modern pastiche of not only Bellow but Roth, unreliable, unreal, counterfactual, and clever.At one point Ruth refers to ""Kafka porn"" as if that pertains to the musings of someone other than herself. Well, this is good ""Kafka porn"" but still fills the bill.Kafka would never fall into the trap of providing us with narratives that have the quality of ironic speculation. He made his strange tales stick where he stuck them with no way out. They are hard to read, spare and relentless. Not really the case here. The comic element, if you can believe it given my description so far, is something that gives you the option of waking up from very bad dreams. With Kafka, no.

It is vividly written, full of intriguing background, and relentlessly inventive in exploring the aftermath of two children dying as a result of the conflict. Abir, a Palestinian, falls to a so-called rubber bullet shot by an Israeli soldier. Smadar, an Israeli, falls to a bomb blast. They were, obviously, noncombatants, but that did not matter, given the ongoing violence that strikes anywhere and everywhere in Israel and the Palestinian lands.This is a true story. The girls' fathers bond and manage to form a team that travels everywhere recounting their personal stories, the stories of their daughters, and the story of the wars that have followed the creation of Israel.McCann fictionalizes but also includes a great deal of factual material. The result is that a reader feels the immediacy of the entire saga. He does a splendid job surfacing contradictions and ambiguities without attempting to resolve them. He lets us see the two men struggle with audiences who revile their commitment to dialogue. Rami, the Israeli father, had fought in three wars when he lost his daughter. Bassam was imprisoned for seven years, starting when he was seventeen, before being released and trying to build a ""normal"" life in a completely abnormal situation.The grittiness, the oppressiveness, the paranoia, the hostility, and the hopelessness of the conflict hang over both men, but they persist in pointing out the toll it exacts on innocent children. They don't give in. That's what keeps them going: simply not giving in.McCann's method is to write in numbered blocks of narrative, hundreds of them. He goes forward and backward in time. But it's easy to keep track because all the blocks are so vivid.This mix of fact and fiction does a superb job of plumbing the depths of the conflict without getting lost in the wars and failed attempts at negotiation and resolution. Both sides say no. Israel is a massive security state. The Palestinian side is no match for it. The struggle is asymmetric, which often favors the weaker party because it cannot afford to fight in accord with rules.The fathers know they might be regarded as fools on a mission impossible, but they don't care. Ultimately their goal is to confront as many people as possible with the realities of violence. They don't moralize, they don't get stuck in the muck of debate, they see their job as planting the image of two dead children--two of many dead children and adults--in the middle of higher level debates. If Bassam has one main point, it is is this: End the Occupation. I'm not sure Rami espouses such a broad point. He seems to call for something more basic: Just stop killing children.A very good, chilling, disturbing book.

Karl Rossman is exiled to Amerika by his parents and endures a series of mishaps and recoveries as he finds his way in the general area of New York City. He's a teenager. He has some schooling. Sometimes his luck is good (a rich uncle) and sometimes his luck is bad (his rich uncle sends him packing.) He pairs with a two scoundrels on a road trip; he escapes them; he meets a sweet hotel chef who gets him a job; the job is awful; he is fired; the scoundrels show up again in the company of a fat, rich, lazy young woman; Karl is desperate to escape them again; but he ends up taking a job as a servant to the young woman.In comparison to his later writing, Amerika is pedestrian, full of detail, and vaguely, comically realistic. One can see Kafka's love of vaudevillian humor here. Not much after Amerika is funny. But one can also see the instinct to put his protagonist in ever shrinking boxes from which he can't seem to find his way out. Karl gets smarter through experience but that doesn't help much. He is judged again and again and found guilty--unfairly so.It's not clear why Kafka abandoned Amerika. As a first novel, it is thoroughly rendered. In the terms of the trade, it's ""publishable,' without a doubt. But one can speculate: He didn't know how to end the story, or perhaps feared selling out to a resolution that defied his basic instinct that there is no resolution...ever. He also did not yet know how to scalpel his material down to its menacing elements. Amerika is weird but not other-worldly. Toward the end of his work on Amerika, Kafka wrote ""The Metamorphosis,"" so we can see he was on to something not in the least picaresque, his essential artistic vision: brutal, inescapable, inexplicable judgment. It is as if Kafka was circling the writer he was to become, looking for himself, trying to be a satirical but relatively normal writer, and then it hit him: he wasn't that writer at all; he was something essentially unprecedented; he was a writer of torment and misery, confusion, existential injustice; he didn't need round characters and loose narrative logic; he needed fairly flat victims being torn apart by stories with illogical narrative teeth.Kafka never abandoned his interest in vaudevillian humor, he just made it black. Waiting for Godot is perhaps the best example of how to stage such humor. Kafka's oeuvre is the best way to put it on the page.

My options included Rocks for Jocks and Rat Psych. I took Rat Psych. Didn't learn much. But that's okay. Fifty years later I read Rising from the Plains and undoubtedly learned more about geology than I would have by signing up for Rocks for Jocks.Not that I understood all, or most, of Rising from the Plains, focused on Wyoming and a geologist named David Love, whose life proved to be a western saga Wallace Stegner might have written, or, heaven forbid, James Michener. The problem was the avalanche of names and data centered on Wyoming's epic role in Earth's history, the collisions of forces and permutations of chemistry over billions of years. Fascinating stuff but hard to keep straight. Every chapter should be accompanied by a map. I love maps. And there should be photos, lots of them. Nonetheless this effort in force-feeding the geologically uninitiated taught me a great deal, which I do not, dare not, hasten to explain, starting with the contrast between everything thought to be known about geology and everything yet to be known, the contradictions within plate tectonic theory, for example--how to resolve them...or just live with them-- the anomalies presented by certain rocks located where they shouldn't be, and so on.Much of Wyoming is beautiful, notably the Tetons and Yellowstone. A fair amount is ugly. Now I would look at the ugly parts differently, thinking about how they got to be so ugly.One of my favorite observations in this book concerns lakes, which are described as rivers who have lost their getaway driver. Unfortunately the geology saga goes this way: once upon a time there were field geologists; now there are geologists holed up in offices. Field geologists focus on accumulating facts.

In both the sonnet and Falstaff instances, Greenblatt's reasoning is somewhat oblique, but that is his fundamental thesis about Shakespeare: he consistently approached life obliquely, his preferred angle of attack.The discussions of Hamlet, MacBeth, and Lear are fascinating, Othello somewhat less so. For all their eloquent elaboration, these plays leave a fair amount of motivation in the dark. Other courses of action could have been followed by these tragic figures...but weren't. Shakespeare enhances their magnetism by leaving some of their mystery undisturbed.Throughout Greenblatt makes good use of the work of other scholars and freely acknowledges it.Even if more biographical detail were available, Shakespeare would remain an enigma, of course.

Two are vague, the first two.

In Thirteen Ways of Looking someone takes revenge on the father of the offender, not the offender himself. Said father is developed by quirk, background, circumstance, and diminished faculties, chiefly memory, keeping track of the order of things. This is unjust and fairly well dramatized, but it's one of these outbursts of random demise in Gotham in search of mystery where there isn't any, not in the larger sense of mystery.

His mental life duriI have sometimes thought that a biography of a writer should focus on the thousands of hours the writer spends writing his works. His mental life during those hours are very much his real life. Certainly that was the case of Thomas Mann, a writing metronome, whose four morning hours were inviolable. The problem is, of course, that not even the writer could recount exactly what is going on when he is writing. There is much more than the text involved. Ideas, words, phrases, desires etc. swirl about, some captured on the page, some impossible to grasp. Often Mann yearned to express in words the beauty that is revealed music; he knew what he wanted to do but was not able to do it. This leads us to the term ""ineffable"" -- that which cannot be expressed, at least not directly and not in words.Tóibín deals with the problem of a writer's biography in two ways. It appears that he has done a great deal of research about Mann's life and times. I don't know if he has everything exactly right, and I don't know if he cared about doing that. After all, this is a work of fiction. And as a work of fiction Tóibín also allows himself to record his guesses about and elaborations of Mann's fantasies, notably homoerotic fantasies. Has he excavated these fantasies from Mann's diaries, letters, comments to others who then recorded them for posterity? I don't know. It's not a controversial move on Töbin's part, in any case. Death in Venice gives anyone interested in this aspect of Mann's life blanket permission to explore it. At the same time, Tóbín does a great job examining the lives of Mann's wife and his six children, almost all of whom are more interesting than Mann himself. They are brilliant, enigmatic, noisy, sensitive, gifted, and in a case or two, quite shut down. None of them had the mental life Mann had. Most of them took him as a fairly conventional fuddy-duddy. But he seems to have taken their criticisms with some humor and dispassion--not a demonstrative father, but a tolerant father.Tóibí nspends little time on Mann's books. He writes them, he becomes rich and famous, he wins the Nobel prize. The best insight offered into his work has to do with a sanitarium where his wife, and to a lesser degree, Mann himself, spent time. This is the origin of Magic Mountain, probably Mann's best novel.A great deal more time goes into detailing Mann's troubles with the Nazis, which caused him first to relocate to Switzerland, then to Princeton, then to California, and ultimately back to Switzerland. As Germany's foremost man of letters, he was expected to write and speak against Hitler, which he did, but more was asked of him (and others) than he could provide.This novel is well-written, sometimes brilliantly so. Tóibín range over literary, cultural, German, European, and trans-Atlantic topics is considerable. The limitation at the novel's core is Mann's personality--he was a cautious, reserved man. He valued his privacy immensely. Like most novelists, the most exciting moments in his life undoubtedly occurred during the four hours he spent in his study every morning by himself....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jan 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56897459-the-magician

Three boys--and a few girls--are passengers on a ship going from Sri Lanka to the U.K. in the early 1950s. They're heading toward school and various forms of family reunification. The ship, a large passenger ship, is segregated by wealth (1st class on down) and social status. The boys establish contact with the upper ranks and the demimonde of knock-abouts, artistes, shysters and the like. They have no purpose other than fulfilling their curiosity, and they are fairly gentle with one another. Even the low-lifes aboard demonstrate a kind of compassion for them.But the novel covers more than the boys; it explores backstories and post-voyage experiences involving them and several of the key adults, catching us up with events years after the ship reaches London. The narrator, Michael, recounts the failure of a marriage. He catches up with a cousin who had sailed on the same ship. He limns quite efficiently the social dynamics of the Sri Lankan expatriate community in the U.K. Time and again he offers subtle but penetrating judgments on himself and others.So the narrative moves back and forth gracefully, rounding out subplots and fleshing out character in lovely prose.

Wisely, Smee doesn't push too hard on his framing concept, which is that these (and other) were truly friends who spurred each other onto greater heights with the younger artist typically overtaking and surpassing the older artist. In this account, the eight artists were hothouse flowers driven into social/artistic association that also was fueled by eros, alcohol, and other catalystsFriendship, implying candor and self-sacrifice, isn't found here except in the case of Lee Krasner's friendship for Jackson Pollock.

Competition and rivalry did play a role in achieving artistic fame. At the same time one notes that all of these artist rose to fame in major cities where publicists were on hand to promote them and rich collectors were on hand to buy their works. This isn't to say each of them didn't produce terrific work. It's just to say there long has been an ""art world"" that is essential to being noticed and not starving.This ""art world"" is given its due here in the persons of collectors like Peggy Guggenheim and the Steins and critics like Rosenberg and Greenberg. Then there are gallery owners, abused spouses, and lots of dissolute behavior. Generally the "" art world"" under consideration here would make friendship impossible and rivalry unavoidable, especially during a period when the objectivity of figural, realistic art was being challenged by the subjectivity of abstract, conceptual art. In the broadest sense, these artists were crashing into modernity and modernity was crashing into them. Rules and traditions were being cast aside. Institutions were scrambling to remain relevant. Wars were tearing whole countries to pieces. There was no boss, no lawgiver, no Maecenas who could play king of the hill for long.This led to the grim, distorted figurations of Bacon and Freud, the shattered mirrors of de Kooning, and the inscrutable frenzy of Pollock, who discovered his strength largely because he couldn't draw and had to come up with another approach.

If you are really interested in Bellow, I recommend it. If you are unsure about Bellow, I would sJames Atlas's biography of Saul Bellow is very good. If you are really interested in Bellow, I recommend it. If you are unsure about Bellow, I would skip it. One problem is that Atlas casts Bellow's life as a series of repetition compulsions wherein he reenacts the trauma of losing his mother at a young age by means of marrying women, leaving them, and saying he is the victim because in fact they left him...as his mother did. In fact, Bellow did this 4 times. Finally, in old age, he married for a fifth time and that lasted to his death. Atlas is quite aggressive in pushing his analysis of Bellow. The information he presents largely corroborates his conclusions. Bellow was a difficult character. Recently I saw a PBS show about him in which Philip Roth, Bellow's friend, said quite frankly, ""He was not a nice man.""No, for all his loyalty to the old gang he grew up with in Chicago and his kindness to many younger writers, Bellow was not a nice man and it is often quite unpleasant to read about the ways in which he used his problems with wives and ex-friends as fair game in his novels.I have often wondered if Bellow really had a command of the philosophers and general thinkers who play such a role in Herzog. Atlas's book implies that he definitely read deeply and widely and was quite brilliant in moments of discussion, but I came away with my question answered--in fact, late in life, Bellow answered it himself by declaring, ""I am not an intellectual."" He was something of a hit and run guy, a unique dust storm of ideas and words and human propositions, i.e., characters, that he could bedazzle you with ...and then sweep away, leaving you thinking, ""Hunh? What the hell was that?"" To read and love Bellow you have to more or less get into the dynamics of his personal brilliance. His aesthetic, it seems to me, was an inimitable mixture of perception and expression.This being the case, I look back on Bellow in his times and wonder why he, more than many other writers, was considered the greatest of novelists. As Atlas points out, repeatedly, Bellow didn't bother with plot; he used comedy to slide right past the idea of form and structure. His first two novels--apprentice work, he would call them--were grim; at least that was my impression. And yet because of personal magnetism, good looks and great luck with women, he became ""the guy"" among a select group of New York writers. Ironically, it was when he slipped the traces of 20th century alienation in writing Augie March that he became a success. The people who loved him for his tight little spells of darkness learned to love him much more for his lightness, his spirit, his boldness, his big lungs.The trouble was that even Augie March didn't solve his money and divorce problems, so Atlas cycles through those issues over and over again, and this is a bit, shall we say, wearing. The literary feuds and spats also become tedious as Atlas recounts Bellow's increasing self-confidence, albeit touchy self-confidence, with the successes that followed Augie March. He was quite easily wounded, but he also was fantastically resilient, knowing how good he was and essentially having no choice: if it was morning, he needed to write.Among the healthier relationships, Bellow and John Cheever held each other in esteem, and of course Bellow was devoted to Alan Bloom, subject of his novel, Ravelstein. Bellow's knowledge of literary biographies was great, but he was no fan of the biographies written about him. For facts and insights, this is probably the best of them, but I don't think he'd like it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 06, 2023","Jan 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/457467.Bellow

The first part, focusing on two pilots attempting to be the first to fly over the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Ireland, is a tour de force of research and dramatization. Moving on, McCann follows Frederick Douglass on a journey to Ireland, where he speaks against slavery and carefully sidesteps Irish/British tension. Douglass here is a self-contained, yet eloquent and impassioned abolitionist.The Irish are piqued by him, generally in a positive way.These are ""upstairs"" stories. Pretty soon we read a few intriguing ""downstairs"" stories about a maid who emigrates from Ireland and ends up married to an ice vendor in Missouri and carries on his business successfully after his gruesome death. The maid's progeny give us additional stories about life in Ireland on into the 20th century, where we read another ""upstairs"" story about the ex-senator George Mitchell and his tedious efforts to negotiate, successfully, the peace accords that more or less have put a lid on violence in Ireland from Bill Clinton's time to the present day.Throughout, MCann makes superb use of short declarative sentences that propel these narratives forward and also glitter with beautiful grace notes, notably conveying the natural setting for these human endeavors. Irish writers seem incredibly gifted in capturing the steel in clouds, the flickering light on choppy water, the crack of shotguns and the smell of old dogs.McCann likes to find something other than tragedy in his books--as this one ends, the world goes on--but there is a melancholy throughout TransAtlantic, not the melancholy of doom but the melancholy of resignation and limited expectation.I was stunned to read through his long, long list of acknowledgements.

The protagonist, Dr. Quirke, seems to drift toward the murderer (not whom you might suspect) and the time shifts, backfilling the storyline as he drifts, while well-executed, seem to detract from the narrative momentum rather than enhance it. I suppose the key problem is that the murderer is the least interesting and least developed character in the book.This is the second Quirke book I have read, and I began to understand the limits of genre writing even in the hands of a master writer. There are elements critically dependent on the previous Quirke book that are not really essential to this one. Quirke's difficult relationship with his daughter, Phoebe, lacks dynamism; Phoebe just rejects Quirke at every turn; her risky behavior is credible, but it isn't linked to her anger at Quirke in any detail; the two of them don't really go at it. That may be exactly where a genre piece has to fail: if the focus turned heavily toward Phoebe/Quirke, the ""plot"" would be disrupted; and in a genre piece, a mystery, you wouldn't allow yourself that; suddenly you would be writing a literary piece that responds to its own inner template.For purposes of narrative continuity, two characters, Quirke's half-brother and the widow of an uncle of sorts, make appearances. That's the best way to put it. Presumably Black knows he will need them in later Quirke books. The revelation that the widow ""loves"" Quirke and has come to Dublin from Boston to stay is essentially noted in passing. Again, no development, although Quirke is too frozen for there to be much development. His brief engagement with another woman is much more interesting because of her, not because of him. She wants something; he doesn't.

It was a noir tale focused on a pathologist named Quirke attempting to come to terms with his past by looking into church abuses of unwed mothers in Ireland...so good that I decided to read the book, which is an excellent novel. Black/Banville can't write badly, even if he is masquerading as a kind of mystery writer here and focusing more on plot and setting than depth of character and unique conflicts beyond resolution.I would put Banville in the category of writers like William Boyd, Julian Barnes, and Alan Furst, writers whose stylistic gifts capture scenes fully, their eyes sharp for detail, their narrative control beautifully paced. So he's good. In fact, he's as good as Black as he is as Banville, which raises the question, why write as Black?He said in a recent interview that he actually prefers his Black books to his Banville books because they track the torments of the Irish soul more broadly and are not so wedded to aesthetic innovations. That's an interesting comment. He says he is more free in writing the Black books because he lived them, in a sense, and perhaps only invents the Banville books.The villains in Christine Falls are wealthy Catholics who sponsor the relocation of the babies of unwed mothers in the U.S. They work hand-in-glove with the infamous church facilities known as the Magdalene Laundries. Much high-handed damage is done to these women and children in service to the church's moralistic pretensions. One case, the case of Christine Falls, comes Quirke's way, and he suspects his stepbrother is involved. His mission becomes ""finding out"" what's going on. At this point one might identify the generic nature of this mystery story, but again, Black/Banville writes so well and in such an unrushed way that Christine Falls isn't only a work dependent on plot. There's more to it, even though I would suggest that the depth of character development here does fall short of the intimacies Banville explores in his literary books....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2022","Dec 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/199600.Christine_Falls

The Circle conceived its task as discarding metaphysics as a dominant preoccupation in philosophy--taking with it idealism--and developing a philosophic concept of thought that was more tightly linked to the physical world. This entailed forays into math, economics, language, and society writ large. Great scientists like Max Ernst developed some of the intellectual energies the Circle exploited. On the margins, Einstein exerted a substantial influence, Freud decidedly less so. Wittgenstein cast a spell over the Circle while other major figures such as Gödel and Popper took over as a kind of second wave or flourishing. Post-WWI and pre-Depression, the Circle helped Vienna keep its balance. Once the Depression hit, Vienna toppled and the Circle scattered.Sigmund does an especially good job of explicating Wittgenstein's quirky stance as an anti-system builder who rejected logic itself as a secure pathway to truth. He demolished philosophy, too, or thought he did, grinding his way into positions that were, ultimately, a series of exercises in thinking not infected with hand-me-down assumptions divorced from the empirical reality of things (actually, the term things annoyed him, too, meaning that vague category of unrelated elements the rest of us toss into the things basket, but not as much as the absurd Platonism, ""the thing in itself."") One of the pleasures of the book is the way Sigmund ravages Heidegger. The most disturbing element of the book is the account of how anti-semitism deracinated Germany and Austria much as it deracinated 15th century Spain. If there is a mysterious figure here, working out of the realm of mathematics, it is Gödel with his incompleteness theorems. Once he had established the unprovability of axiom-based thinking, he put the world of thought into a kind of quantum space, where nothing is where it is and moves as fast as it does at the same time. Oddly, Gödel was a mathematical genius, mentally ill, and a Believer. And yet he became, as a man and thinker, kind of a coda to the whole enterprise as well as Einstein's best friend as they walked and talked their way around Princeton,....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"not setOct 21, 2022","Nov 21, 2022Nov 21, 2022","Nov 20, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36359854-exact-thinking-in-demented-times

Then a few months ago I read her memoir about childhood. Now I have gone through this reader, whose sections of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in particular are spectacular and in somewhat better control than the mystical speculations of the final book excerpted here, Holy the Firm.Pilgrim at Tinker Creek captivated me in part because I know the Blue Ridge in Virginia pretty well, having hiked and camped there many times and having lived in its shadows for a number of years. So Dillard's rendering of the Blue Ridge world, her exactitude, her gift for describing clouds, insects, muskrats, the sounds of the wind, the trees, the creek...I can testify that she captures everything and then places it all in a moving theology of scientific pantheism, making her case for the presence of the divine in the multiform intricacies of nature. Weirdly, she finds the general in the specific, the very specific: the insect that eats a frog from inside out, the female praying mantis eating her mate, starting with the head, even as he fertilizes her. Examples like this in the scores drive home the point that such complex diversity underscores the plausibility of some kind of mischievous, endlessly talented god. She cites Christianity often but she does not proselytize. There was a man...and so forth...well, that is one representation of godliness...but godliness inheres also in the stories of Tinker Creek, another kind of holy book, crawling with microscopic hymns, the soil full of them, the water full of them. At one and the same time this is a scientific report and a present day myth. Her reasoning isn't linear; this isn't a syllogism, but as she ties this myth to her perception, she does the same on behalf of the reader. Importantly, she reaches no conclusion. She notes that already there have been many conclusions over the eons. We are witness to only 10% of the life forms that have penetrated and scurried over and flown over the earth since the Big Bang. The divinity in life, she suggests, is its process, its inertial thrust, and it is best worshipped by being known.There are other strong pieces in this reader of lesser scope--an account of the gospel according to St. Luke and a meditation on the styles found in prose fiction. Holy the Firm is a puzzle. Some of it is cast in the style of the Book of Revelation. There are echoes of other mystics and prophets. And then there is a capstone story about a young girl whose face is badly burned and what must be done so that she can be sure she will be loved, an onus that Dillard or the narrator places on herself, culminating in a stunning final sentence, which I won't quote.

His writing is good, his thoughts often fascinating, but as he builds out speculation about the folks who may have played a role in Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of JFK, the pieces of this narrative take on a brick by brick by brick quality. The bit players are a bunch of dolts; they take up too much space. More interesting is the speculation about Oswald, his Russian wife, and his mother. Oswald here is a guy determined to be noticed and to make a difference, but he is quiet about it, which is interesting. His wandering into and out of Russia is interesting. He wants to be understood by fellow Marxists (he wasn't a Marxist-Leninist, he says), but he is not involved in anything for the long haul. He wants pay-off. He does this, he does that, he goes, he comes back. He's hard to keep track of, hard to program, a wild card. That's what works in this novel. The Jack Ruby stuff, the ex-CIA, ex-FBI stuff, the Bay-of-Pigs veterans stuff, lacks graininess. There are hard-headed dopes in those worlds, but it's not a good idea to focus on them per se.

But toward the end, things coalesced more convincingly, and I read the last fifty pages word for word, which is my usual approach.Fortunately, as I nosed around the Oswald story, I happened to notice Norman Mailer wrote a similar book.

Caro obviously beat his copy editor to a pulp and whatever corrections were made, they weren't enough. I would suggest 300 pages instead of 600l After all, we are talking about the lead-up to JFK's assassination and the LBJ legislative triumphs of 1964.The key to the story is this: When he assumed the Vice Presidency LBJ went into internal D.C. exile and became an afterthought and joke. JFK was straightforward in his dealings with LBJ but he gave him very few chores and his staff paid him as little attention as possible. This sent LBJ, master of the Senate, into a funk. But the day JFK died, almost to the minute, the old racehorse ran the race of his life, seizing control of the government, assuring the world of U.S. stability, and developing strategies to see JFK's legislative proposals, which were going nowhere, through to passage.This was a tour de force performance, a performance marked by more restraint and dignity than LBJ was accustomed to presenting. A tax cut, a civil rights bill, and a budget reduction were all set in motion. Labor and African-American leaders came to LBJ's side; he was inclusive, decisive when he needed to be, and humble when he needed to be.The fact that LBJ and RFK hated each other's guts, no understatement, spices this tale to a degree, but when the real action unfolds, RKF is lost in grief. It is no big challenge for LBJ to make sure RFK does not get the 1964 Democratic presidential nomination.Caro's final comments on LBJ's return to power (from Senate Majority Leader to VP t0 President) capture the drama and energy of what was, no doubt, a Shakespearian turn-around. The man knew what to do and how to do it.But this should not have been a book as long as Caro's other books on LBJ and many convoluted sentences should have been unpacked and ironed out....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 14, 2022","Oct 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13049569-the-passage-of-power

This is true of all herThe beauty of Annie Dillard's An American Childhood lies in what another writer, David Abram, calls the spell of the sensuous. This is true of all her writing, but especially so because the sensuous is the magical essence of being a child, of direct, unmediated experience of what the five senses tell us.A bird doesn't fly overhead in Dillard's work, a cardinal does. Multiply that specificity by a thousand, including references to rocks, stars, and rivers, and you begin to understand the constant undertow of her writing, an undertow that takes you into things, perhaps bewildering in their variety, but glistening and beautiful. She describes a childhood spent in Pittsburgh, the oldest girl in an affluent family, and faces the good and bad, including her own bad behavior at times, with no rationalizations, just the facts. She was a gifted child, an extraordinary child, racing from obsessions with drawing to obsessions with reading to obsessions with boys. Pittsburgh as she encountered it was a central city in terms of industrial output. Her neighborhoods were pretty. There were country clubs and dancing lessons and a church where the upper tier of executives gathered in an impressive spirit of humility. Her father had ""an income"" and her mother, clearly frustrated, had a quick wit, sharp tongue and gift for mischief and misdirection. These were the fifties, literally a quieter decade than the sixties. A girl had time for learning to identify pitchblende by sight along with all the other local rocks. Why? This girl simply was curious and had a mind that grew bigger and bigger all the time.Pittsburgh in the fifties could be considered a much dirtier and rougher place than Dillard presents it, but a memoir is personal and this is a book about Annie Dillard the person, her family, her schools, her experiences.I don't know if every reader will respond to An American Childhood as I did because I spent much of my childhood in Pennsylvania in the fifties, too.

He's also a terrific stylist and observer of contemporary life.In the main, Sorry for Your Troubles focuses on people who are divorced, widowed, and pretty much lost. The troubles they confront are difficult, but Ford doesn't overstate them. A woman can tell a man after two years of marriage that she wants a divorce for fairly vague reasons, and he does not have to be destroyed (in this case, he married her after his first wife died before his eyes). A man at a loss for direction in Paris can be made a fool and lose an opportunity with an appealing woman, but again, it's not the end of the world. Another man can recover from his wife's suicide by renting a little house in Maine down the street from the summer rental in which she killed herself and maintain a certain distance and poise despite a fair amount of resistance to his recovery by others. He's a good guy, but no one seems to care.Whimsy and realism are mixed together in these stories. Gin and vermouth also are mixed together. There's a tone of ""Well, I made a mess of things, but I'm still here."" An old girlfriend appears without wrecking a man's marriage, although he seems willing to risk it even though he never was bonkers about her in the first place.Many of these stories have the novelistic effect found in Alice Munro's stories. That's a high compliment, but Ford is a very deft manager of life's complexities. These are stories worth reading.

Glaude interweaves his analysis of James Baldwin's writing on the nightmare of racism in America with his own thoughts. He sees racism as grounded in a lie, the lie that Whites are greater and Blacks are lesser, the lie that the United States is a country more deeply grounded in morality than interests, the lie, in effect, that will not die...not after the Civil War and Reconstruction, not after the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. Trump didn't invent the lie; he just climbed on board.Ultimately Baldwin concluded a few essential things: only Blacks can resolve their torment; Whites will not do it for them; and the solution to racism was for all people to go beyond it and identity politics and find themselves in their commonality by means of love. Since he could not give up on love, he could not give up on the possibility that the United States somehow might find a way to begin again, start all over, which would mean a tremendous upheaval, but, I take it, not a violent upheaval. Realistic? I don't think realism is the point in these men's estimation. I think the reference is religion, specifically Christian faith in being born anew, transformed by means of redemption, submitting to a kind of healing apocalypse. Baldwin did witness earthly reality and document it and so has Gaude and I don't quarrel with their negative assessment of racism in the United States. That's what it makes so difficult to imagine an erasure of the past's hold on Americans, even when confronted by new takes on U.S. history that present, in detail, Black contributions to the country. The White backlash against Obama brought us Trump and brings us censorship, banned books, and an economy evermore skewed against Blacks and other minorities, exactly as Gaude writes. We see change--Obama would have been unthinkable change in the 1960s--but it is not proportionate to the needs of justice.The point Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Gaude and so many others make is that racism hurts everyone. We all are lesser because of it--lesser for suffering it, lesser for imposing itHaving said that, Gaude's book is an important contribution to understanding and confronting racism. It is measured, as Baldwin's journey was measured; thoughtful, as Baldwin's writing was thoughtful; and unyielding, as Baldwin, to the best of his ability as a freelance writer, not a professor at Princeton, was unyielding.Ultimately you can't have morality that isn't grounded in values, not interests.

Krauss does a wonderful job creating central characters (albeit surrounded by thinner characters) and develops their voices, their locations, and their life situations in great detail.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, despite the things I will say now.Looked at as a whole, this is an essayistic work. The essays deal in general with the plight of being Jewish, not just post-Holocaust but post-destruction of the temple, 2,000 years ago. There is a coming together of the essays around the conceit of a magnificent desk claimed by several characters that once belonged to, or was used by, Federico Garcia Lorca, the Spanish poet and dramatist. It's never clearly established if Lorca had anything to do with the desk, however, and at the end of the book, its origins seem to lie elsewhere. Most readers won't know much about Lorca or the predations of the Pinochet regime in Chile, but that doesn't matter all that much. There is a Bronte-like wind blowing through this text that always hurls the reader forward past the desk itself into the dramatic lives associated with it in New York, Jerusalem, Oxford and London. One remarkable segment set in Jerusalem, in which Krauss demonstrates a pitch-perfect ear for male minds and language, seems to have nothing to do with the desk, but the segment does a great deal to explore the Jews' relationship with persecution and death.One weakness in the development of some of the less central characters is a default into mystery. The Chilean poet associated with the desk is just that...a mystery. Two similar characters, who are supposed to entrance us, provide little reason to succeed in doing so. Their father is the intriguing monomaniacal force the in the family. His self-assigned task is to reunite scattered post-Holocaust Jews with the physical culture torn from their lives, so he spends his time hunting down heirlooms. Finding lost people after WWII was difficult. I'm not sure that finding furnishings is all that plausible, but I'm sure Krauss knew of someone who did it.Page for page, though, Krauss pins down telling details, traits, fears, and dreams--especially dreams--in a bravura performance....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,"Sep 06, 2022not set","Sep 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7907782-great-house

US involvement in Vietnam was so badly conceived and executed that withdrawal never would have been easy or ended up with a South Vietnam as a sovereign state.Nixon and Kissinger were determined to get out of Vietnam, open relations with China, and reboot relations with the USSR. They didn't really want to deal with the Middle East, India and Pakistan, or Chile, but they did. As Nixon fell, Kissinger rose. Nixon managed Kissinger fairly well in opening relations with China. That's his accomplishment. The two of them were a team in detente with the USSR. By Dallek's account, Kissinger presided over the needless destruction of Allende in Chile, and by all accounts, Kissinger pushed the Middle East toward peace after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Dallek does an excellent and troubling job in exploring Nixon's tortured personality and Kissinger's relentless ambition. Nixon was much less stable before the Watergate fiasco than I had known. He was no good with whiskey but resorted to it often. He abused Kissinger a fair amount out of jealousy. Kissinger put up with it for the sake of the power Nixon gave him. By the final year of the Nixon presidency, Nixon was flailing and not competent to be president. Kissinger, Haig and others kept this as quiet as they could, but ""Washington"" knew. Dallek details Nixon's demise vividly. There was a heavy toll on Kissinger as well, but again, he rose as Nixon crashed.For me as a former diplomat, I found Dallek's account of diplomacy's grueling costs realistic and persuasive. You spend a lot of time on long flights, eat bad food, can't get your body clock on schedule and know that you are being lied to and resisted up to the last moments of agreement...and sometimes beyond. Washington follows you everywhere. Mischief makers inside and outside any administration abound. Preserving the basic concepts of your positions and conveying those concepts to the media and public is tricky. In some senses Nixon and Kissinger were superhuman with superhuman strengths and flaws. Dallek's book is an excellent exploration of what that meant in terms of U.S. interests around the world....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/152545.Nixon_and_Kissinger

These three so-called short novels (two are novellas, the other a short story) are full of characters in crisis, very well rendered. They focus on death, suicide, infidelity, insecurity, and alcohol's negative impact on one's behavior towards other. In other words, these are grim tales about people face-to-face with their demons and betrayers.The oddly redeeming dimension of these pieces is the somewhat hopeful and not very dramatic suburban middle-class setting in which they play out. A certain rugged normalcy blunts the edges of despair with the exception of the suicide. People have their inadequacies but they also have their reasons. Sometimes, as in the last story, they manage to do more than survive.Bausch is not an especially gifted stylist with the exception of dialogue, at which he is almost perfect. He's not clumsy or awkward but he is rather pedestrian in fashioning his sentences; professional but workman-like. The center of action is a place in the Blue Ridge country of Virginia that he calls Port Royal. I assume he's talking about Front Royal, about 70 miles west of D.C. I have hiked and camped all over that region, so I may have filled in some of Bausch's gaps as I read. Another reader might not understand that his Port Royal isn't a thin sort of place.The pieces here were written decades ago, just as Bausch was beginning to gain recognition.

It also offers an excellent account of the human (or subhuman) dimension of national politics during the same time period. Blumenthal is an excellent writer and he was there, a confidant of both Bill and Hillary. As someone sympathetic to them, his account is sympathetic and offers insights other chronicles overlook.On the Whitewater and pre-presidential sex front, Blumenthal explores the ways in which rightwing Republican funding bought and fueled the scandal. The hero of the rightwing at the time was a man named Richard Mellon Scaife. Look him up sometime. He's not portrayed per se, only the sinister ways in which his money was used. Blumenthal takes apart Whitewater as a legal matter, in which the Clintons had no involvement beyond investing, and he runs through the inflated contributions of the talkative state troopers, Paula Jones, and the big blond who claimed a 12-year relationship with Bill and may only have experienced a one-night stand.The devious Christian moralist Ken Starr is skewered, even more so his associates in pursuing Whitewater. It's interesting to consider how nasty that pious little pie-face was then...and to think about his subsequent tenure at Baylor.The best line in the book is a comment on the worst of all politicians: failed professors. Newt Gingrich and Dick Army are prime examples.Bill's successful tactic of small bites at the legislative apple after the disastrous huge chomp he took at healthcare early in his first term is something Joe Biden should have considered before approving his Build Back Better plan, a collection of mega-bills impossible to get passed. Dick Morris, the political consultant, gets some credit but not too much for this.At points Blumenthal gets too wrapped-up in recounting his war with Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, but his description of Drudge as a sheister, even in the shady world of gossip, is wonderful. In fact, Blumenthal does a wonderful job of not holding back when he assaults villains without damaging his own credibility. I love honest assessments of Washington creeps.Clinton's affair with Lewinsky told me one thing I didn't know: she was, and probably still is, a tough young woman, no pushover. She wanted Bill in a very definite way; she resisted Starr in a very definite way.Republican assaults on Clinton reveal genetic kinship with Trump's assaults on Biden. That is to say Republican fury at governmental programs funded by taxpayers, sometimes even rich taxpayers who couldn't evade their obligations, preceded Trump and of course was and remains more systematic than Trump. Throughout his presidency, Clinton was denounced as an illegitimate president, and of course this came to a head in his impeachment and trial when the Republican assailants, egged on that mad little dervish Starr, were crushed. Great Republican figures of the day like Henry Hyde found themselves practically begging Republican senators to give them a better opportunity to make their feeble case. To their credit, the Republican senate caucus wanted to flush the whole thing down the toilet. They did not want to call Lewinsky, Starr, etc., as witnesses. Meanwhile, Clinton's popularity rose.So I gobbled this book up. I was in Washington in the 80s and 90s and had lots of disagreeable encounters with the Republican rightwing. But I've always held Clinton's failings against him, and I still do, only less so, thanks to Blumenthal....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/84975.The_Clinton_Wars

It concerns a group of people--English and American--who drink fantastic amounts of alcohol in France and Spain, are profligate with money, sleep around (especially a 34-year old named Brett Ashley) and carry a few wounds from WWI. Some of them write novels or work as journalists. Some of them are brutish anti-semites. Some of them get into drunken brawls during the bullfights in Pamplona.That is not a twisted summary of The Sun Also Rises. Excepting the narrator, who was rendered impotent in WWI (but still loves Brett Ashley), they are not an admirable bunch. Their problem, collectively, is that they belong to what Gertrude Stein called ""the lost generation,"" meaning a generation lost as a result of WWI, lacking a sense of direction and self-control.Nonetheless Hemingway's narrator, Jake Barnes, manages to recount their comings and goings in such a way that these people are vivd--Jake's passion for Brett (and apparently hers for him) is handled with incredible deftness; Brett's self-indulgent seductions of male targets are crystal clear acts of cynicism and weakness; the worst spasms of anti-Semitism directed at Robert Cohn, a writer, possess a sophomoric credibility; the jealousy that infects almost everyone featured in the tale is equally credible.Hemingway has Barnes tell the story with simplicity and directness. There's nothing (or very little)stagy or pompous about the prose. It's great prose. The dialogue is great dialogue. The miniature portraits of incidental Frenchmen and Spaniards are splendid.Better to read The Sun Also Rises than to live the life it describes. The hangovers are the one thing that Hemingway fails to present in all their misery. They must have been agony; no hair of any dog could possibly undo their bite. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 31, 2022","Aug 06, 2022","Jul 31, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60101521-the-sun-also-rises

There is a long-time prisoner of the ghastly gulag now returned to ""freedom"" after Stalin died. There is a compromised cousin who never set foot in a camp but contributed to the moral degradation of Soviet/Russian society through compliance, silence, and wary denunciation. There are desperate prisoners presented in the most horrific conditions, dying and freezing and being stacked like logs until the spring thaw permitted group burial. And there is an extended examination of the famine Stalin imposed on Ukraine so that he could use its harvests to finance acquisition of the machines that would advance the USSR's industrialization. Upwards of five million Ukrainians died of malnutrition during that period.Ivan's passage through post-camp reality is tossed in (not interwoven, just tossed in) between accounts of the Ukraine famine and short essays on Lenin, Stalin, and their connection to the thousand-year history of slavery in Russia, which Grossman insists lies at the center of its existence and colors its fundamental hostility toward freedom. He depicts a nation that has learned to abhor itself, yearning to be mastered by men like Stalin and, I would add, Putin, who is the current tsar while at the same time preserving the dream and hope that someday it will be free.There is a consistency between Ivan's story, and other stories related to or spawned by his story, and Grossman's essayistic meditations that gives Everything Flows a kind of unity. It was not ""finished"" when he died in the 1960s, but it's still finished even as it opens up to successive decades. Ukraine remains a source of wealth to be exploited and at any cost. Lies and complicity infect Russian life. Russia continues to insist that it is different while demonstrating its difference through inhumanity toward others...and toward itself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2022","Jul 04, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6646257-everything-flows

There are classics like books by Wayne Booth and Francine Prose and wonderful books about writing in general by authors like Vivian Gornick, but the level of insight and detail here about four great Russians, along with generous personal commentary about his own work, puts Saunders' book in its own category.The problem would be that I find it hard to imagine who would push through A Swim in the Pond... except aspiring fiction writers, fiction writers, and teachers of writing fiction. The material here is dense and multifaceted. The book's single flaw is that it can go on too long in the interests of Saunders reveling in his enthusiasm for Chekhov, Tolstoy, Turgenev, and Gogol.He makes several critical points about writing short stories.Be economical in word count, digressions, and exposition.Be specific, not general.Seek to present actions as drivers of the narrative more than ruminations, analyses, and commentaryValue contradictions within a character and ambiguity in an outcome.Be careful not to damage the spun glass globe of the world you imagine with admissions of its implausibility, i.e., stick to the controlling voice without letting it drift into apologies for what it controls, fanciful as it may be. (Gogol's The Nose is a perfect example.)Recognize the power of patterns/repetitions as they shape stories and fill them with echoes and contrasts.Saunders illustrations how these and other precepts play out in story after story, drawing on twenty years of teaching these stories to graduate writing students. He makes a special point of noting that the fledgling writer who does not learn how to connect one significant action to another may never be published. Other writers prefer to call this learning how to plot a story, but Saunders shies away from the closure that the concept of plot implies. He adores the very light way Chekhov closes the door on a tale--so quiet that you can't even hear it shut.The interest in this book is its specificity, its candor, its well-chosen anecdotes from Saunders' long teaching career to buttress the way he dives into the Russian masterpieces under consideration.He notes that writers often don't know where they are going when they write a first sentence and that revision, revision, revision is the key to successful writing. He adds to that the fact that worrying is almost as important as working when it comes to producing a good story.Quite valuably Saunders encloses his thoughts with the following quote from Einstein (which he slightly misquotes but I'll get right): No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.What does this mean in terms of writing fiction? It means that the first draft generally is a superficial gloss on something that doesn't yet exist and must be probed ever more deeply to come into being. Writing, in other words, entails the writer messing with her mind; that's essentially why writing fiction often is called creative writing....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 03, 2022","Jul 09, 2022","Jul 03, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53487237-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain

Some of these flash fictions are vignettes; some acquire the status of little stories with beginnings, middle/development/ and end/resolution. There's been a lot of hoopla about Speedboat as a daring experiment in the novel form. If you read it that way, you'll tangle yourself up the forgettable literary ideology of the 1970s. I've said what I take it to be; I'm not going to argue the point.The writing often is dazzling; the situations often reflect well on the excitement of being a female reporter in the 1970s riding the wave of the 1960s up and down the streets of New York and interesting cities abroad. There are parties, bedroom scenes, much secret sharing, lots of funny irony and a generally droll attitude toward the slippery surface of modern life. So this is a fun book to read. Even passages about life at summer camp are entertaining. The tales related here are not especially moving because the players are generally unmoved.To a certain extent I detect a similarity between situations presented here and situations worked up in Tom Wolfe's work. I really don't see much that is similar to Donald Barthelme's work except brevity. Here's why: Barthelme didn't spend much time hanging on the branches of reality, the irrelevant if irreverent details, kitchen stuff, boss stuff, what might also be referred to as stage business. His work was more tightly wound around premises that he would twist and twist and not let go until they were wound up tightly, even dangerously, at the end. Adler is a writer who notices things, has fun with them, drops them into the vignette, even makes what she has noticed into the vignette itself. She is in dialogue with her eyes and ears. Barthelme was a touch more in deeply in dialogue with his mind.My star system is 3=good, 4=fantastic, 5=essentially a classic.

It contains essentially everything you might like to know about the Putin era--and a lot about his predecessors going back to the two Greats, Peter and Catherine. Russia, Stent contends, is essentially a continuum with autocracy at its center. There may be a czar, there may be a Lenin or Stalin, there may be a Putin, but to the extent that a liberalizer gains control (read: Gorbachev), he won't be around long.As I write on June 15, 2022, Putin's assault on Ukraine exemplifies his understanding of Russia's history and its fundamental nature. Stent does an excellent job of explaining his methodical approach to reconstituting control over Russia's sphere of influence, if not the USSR or the Empire. On assuming power, he found Russia belittled, attempted to establish a relationship of equals with the West, and then, not achieving such a relationship, he built out Russia's reach to cast a large shadow over Georgia, Crimea (complete darkness), the Ukrainian Donbas, the Great Game countries of Central Asia, and now, of course, as much of the entirety of Ukraine as he can manage. In addition he fashioned better relations with China, became a player in the Middle East by helping Assad turn swaths of Syria to rubble, found ways to get along pretty well with India (selling it energy and arms, Russia's two greatest products) and is fiddling with countries in the Western Hemisphere.Since Crimea, Russia's relations with the West, led by the U.S., have been in the tank and gotten substantially, perhaps irreparably, worse. The thing is, Stent points out, Putin says things for a while and then to the best of his ability, he does them. He is a Russian leader, like previous Russian leaders, who feels Russia needs buffers to protect its security. He will back off sometimes but it's not the same as backing down.This volume was completed before the full extent of the assault on Ukraine was known--it's still not known--but definitely sets the stage. Putin has been in power for some twenty years. He has made a calculation that turning south and east makes more sense than placating the West...so long as he has Ukraine in his pocket. Gorbachev's failure to implement his full slate of reform measures and Yeltsin's inability to manage either Russia's privatization plans or its relations with the West as an equal almost mandated a figure like Putin. He is fueled by resentment and stokes the Russian public with it.

I spent an entire year translating the Aeneid when I was sixteen and now ask myself if my time wouldn't have been better spent reading it as I find it here, thus giving Vergil the attention he deserved. The Aeneid is so different from the Iliad and Odyssey, which I translated during the following year, that these epics should be contemplated separately, despite their overlapping mythologies. Homer is an elemental writer, supreme in an almost effortless and self-effacing way. Virgil is a literary writer, a single craftsman facing an unbelievably difficult task--inventing Rome out of the ashes of Troy. That said, even in his studied eloquence Virgil could transcend literature in key moments. Here, in the Bartsch translation, Dido's disappointment is very human, very bitter. Her condemnation of Aeneas lingers in the mind, regardless of his assertion that the gods made him leave her. And at the end of poem, so blunt, brutal and fatal, Aeneas's decision to kill Turnus, not spare him, conveys a similar authenticity. Bartsch captures this ugliness well, endorsing Virgil's own decision to close things thunderously, not beautifully.Back in my youth, as I recall, we would translate 18-24 lines a night, couldn't manage more. Our focus was on grammar, vocabulary, strange usages, almost incomprehensible word order.

As is typical of Bellow's work--after his first two novels--there is an excess of anecdote (no real harm) and an abundance of quirky detail, accommodated skillfully by Bellow's energetic style, a mix of straight stuff, street talk, and comical renderings of the profound and inscrutable nature of human existence.

Last week I was fishing a pingpong ball out from under a bookcase, rolled there by a cat, when I noticed it on the bottom shelf. So I read it again. Better this time. Vivid, full of lovely contradictions within the characterizations. Ravelstein is a rogue professor of philosophy heavily focused on the Greeks (Plato). He has managed to convince the world that these classical thinkers remain relevant, even more than relevant. In one sense he is conservative in defending them; in another sense, the personal sense, he is anything but conservative--flamboyant, gay, polemical, essentially radical, meaning a person who gets at the roots of things, decorum notwithstanding.So these two guys adore one another and tell each other the truth about themselves. This is a pact. Chick's big problem always has been, yes, chicks. Ravelstein's problem, as it were, is being out of step with twentieth century philosophy--its littleness, its quibbling, its parsing of this and that. What irony that when he finally scores a triumph, he is almost at life's end. So how to enjoy his final days and months? That's about it as far as plot goes. Bloom's detailed critique of modern life is not overlabored here. We see some of his refusal to submit to cultural relativism, which is fundamental, but being a novel, Ravelstein focuses more closely on an old guy wriggling through the throes of life--and the same goes for Chick.This isn't one of Bellow's best novels, but still, Bellow had great gifts as a writer. Nothing so full of vitality could have been written by anyone else. He makes the little dramas life big enough so that they can be seen; he twists the friendship in different ways to reveal its strengths and tensions; humbly enough, he offers a Chick who no doubt is much less an intellectual than Bellow himself....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"May 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/324245.Ravelstein

That's this book, very well written and detailed, rehashing a story those of us who follow the news closely already know, minus a few revelations like Kevin McCarthy wobbling and lying his way through saying he would advise Trump to resign after January 6 and perhaps doing so but perhaps not, never sure he would get away with it, so taking refuge in ambiguity and deceit and spineless posturing. The guy, we learn in greater detail than the newspapers already have reported, is a supercharged mediocrity with a dream of becoming Speaker of the House and no fixed purposes beyond that.Since McCarthy may become Speaker, this is useful to know in all the depth that his superficiality will permit. His Republican colleagues here are pilloried for their subservience to him more or less as he is pilloried for his bootlicking subservience to Trump. There are exceptions, but other than Liz Cheney and perhaps Adam Kinzinger, can you name one? I can't either and I just finished reading the book.Trump herein is the odious Trump, self-interested down to his nuclei.Certain scenes, like Trump's unbelievable behavior during the first debate, deserve much more analysis than we find here, but reporters do have a tendency to move on, perhaps assuming that we all saw it unfold, perhaps having nothing Shakespearian to add to the antics of Bozo the Clown.Biden herein is the Biden we all saw and read about. The authors could have (but didn't) spent a little time on how his rhetoric has changed from his early sincerity about saving America's soul to his ultimate hard-edged critique of Republicans who, as he has said, don't stand for anything.There's nothing new about Manchin and Sinema.The premise that the exodus from Afghanistan blew up the Biden presidency remains firmly fixed despite the fact that less than a year later Biden and company have performed magnificently in building the pro-Ukraine coalition that historians may judge to be much more important than anything else his Administration has accomplished.I would say that the Biden administration's inept handing of the Build Back Better plan actually has been its most damaging failure, overshadowing the huge accomplishments of the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure and Jobs plan. This account pins that failure on the usual suspects: Manchin and Sinema on the one hand and the progressives on the other. Actually, the failure occurred because far, far too much was jammed into a single proposal. Had the Administration tried to advance bills that focused on climate, elder care, kids, etc., much more could have been achieved. A single omnibus bill was exactly what ensured opposition from many different angles. Again, we'll see what history has to say, but the fact is that we're all the losers. At different points the author do spotlight Biden's loss of realism on this matter, and that's to their credit. The trouble is that reporting on the recent past isn't terribly useful if it lacks analytic insight.The recent past doesn't even have to be very recent for reporters to succumb to their journalistic tradecraft. The book about Jim Baker, The Man Who Ran Washington, is well-written and interesting (to those of who are interested) but another exercise in notebook-mining. The next step down is the category of political memoirs. Presidents don't reflect on their time in office; they blow up their time in office like balloons, huffing and puffing and cheering their ghostwriters on.Well, political junkies (and I'm one) still read these things.

Robert Conquest traces Stalin's sly, conniving and vicious path from GeorThis is an excellent primer on the worst of the USSR despots, Joseph Stalin. Robert Conquest traces Stalin's sly, conniving and vicious path from Georgia to become one of Lenin's top aides and ultimate successor. The book is concise and yet vivid. It has never been clear to anyone exactly why Stalin was complacent about sending millions of people to their death, including all of his rivals for power, but the record speaks for itself. To a degree Stalin was following Lenin's lead in crushing all enemies as a way of fulfilling the almost puritanical purity of Communist ideology but Stalin went far beyond Lenin. It is no exaggeration to speak of the millions he destroyed. That's not loose talk. At the same time that Stalin was acquiring the power to do this, he also managed to wreck the USSR's economy (with uninformed grand plans) and military (by executing its higher ranks).For those of us who are always interested in a new take on historical figures and periods, Conquest's study is worth reading, even if it is quite old (published in 1991). The reason I reached for it is that I wondered where Vladimir Putin found a historical justification or precedent in Russian history. He evokes the figure of Peter the Great, but that's fantasy. Putin's assault on Ukraine mirrors much of Stalin's brutality toward Ukraine. His indifference to human life is Stalinesque. He seems to be thinking that destroying a country will be good for it...and good for Russia, of course.Putin no doubt would reject any comparison to Stalin, but would Stalin have done something like this were he the leader of Russia now? I have no doubt he would. And I do wonder if a disastrous scheme such as Putin has contrived could possibly have been put into action without some sense of alignment with the Russian past that goes beyond fantasy. Read this book and remind yourself that Putin's slash and burn form of political agriculture most resembles Stalin's hideous rule. There are many, many ways in which the analogy between the two tyrants is imperfect, but for callous cruelty Putin really is Stalin's 21st century twin...and he is having the same horrendous impact on Russia itself that Stalin had. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Apr 26, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52141.Stalin

They are intriguing and quite moving. The entries here are what Wittgenstein kept these notebooks, three of them, during his military service in WWI. They are intriguing and quite moving. The entries here are what he wrote to himself in private code on the verso (left) side of the notebook. They have not been published before. (The entries on the recto (right) side of the notebooks were his thoughts leading to the Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus; these entries were published long ago.)Two major elements of his personality and thought emerge via these brief, pungent commentsPersonality: At age 25-27, Wittgenstein volunteered as a kind of test. He seems to have wanted to know how he could mesh with other soldier/sailors and what his reaction would be to the perils of war. Although he was born to a wealthy family and inherited great wealth as a consequence, he was a humble person and a courteous person. This didn't help him get along with his shipmates on a river patrol boat. They were bores and oafs and apparently picked on him and annoyed him incessantly. So he withdrew to the best of his ability and circumstance. The problem was that he did have homosexual urges that made him quite lonely, and in wartime he could hear little from loved ones via letter. So he monitored his masturbation in these notebooks and he alluded to shore leaves that involved visits to ""baths."" Neither activity seems to have given him a lot of relief. But this aspect of the notebooks shouldn't be overstated because Wittgenstein had an ascetic streak that was driving him to discover how he could shed his sense of self altogether. This led to hazardous duty and consideration of suicide. He seems to have been sincere in wanting to bait death and either prove his courage or succumb to his cowardice. This desire complemented his evident religiosity. He wanted to leave himself in God's care and wrestled with the idea of God all the time.Looking at these notebooks on a philosophical plane, we can see important outcomes. Through war and deep thought, Wittgenstein was cultivating detachment and accepting the limits of what we can know...or affect. It's easy to see the influence of Schopenhauer (and thereby Hinduism) on him. He developed a notion of existence as illusion and fate as a force beyond the ken of mankind. In particular he seized on the idea that the fundamental illusion is what we tell ourselves with words.The challenge of Wittgenstein has been that he entered into the realm of pure thought via logic but he never shed his deep feeling that a spiritual or quasi-mystical understanding offered better, if frustrating, results. He was a man in self-conflict, as these notebooks reveal (and as his entire biography reveals). The fact that Wittgenstein often presented philosophical findings enigmatically, through results that were not bolstered by an accompanying explanation of the methods that led him to these results, may perhaps be attributed a kind of self-cancellation. The ideas that he explored were hard won and powerful but if the truth about existence is that it is an illusion woven of words and his ideas were ultimately conveyed by words, what were they worth?Later in life, after the war, during his long tenure at Cambridge, Wittgenstein devoted intense energy to philosophizing for the benefit of his students on the spot, as it were. Perhaps the quirkiness of his long silences broken now and then by philosophical eruptions can be traced back to his military service. I say ""perhaps."" I don't know. But for Wittgenstein the value of ""now"" in wartime was immense. Anything can happen now in wartime and little that happens before or after now signifies much. Let's say the past and the future are inexistent when you are under fire and add the thought that the past and the future are illusions of almost no value. Let's go beyond that and place the wartime truth that you are not in control of your fate in the context of Wittgenstein's larger conclusion that you are not in control of your fate at any point. Schopenhauer would have said the same. Nietzsche tried to go beyond Schopenhauer, but Wittgenstein was drawing the conclusion in these notebooks that nothing self-based matters. Nothing. One could not even wrap oneself in the Divine with the confidence that this would lead to good. It might lead to evil. Ethics, he writes here, is a nonstarter. How does he explain that? He doesn't, but I am trying to do so here based on the fragments recorded in three little books that were overlooked, never published, until 100 years after they were jotted down by a lonely man on a boat, in a barracks, occupied for most of his day by tasks that should have been humiliating for him but weren't either because he wanted to be humiliated or he thought no one can be humiliated since humiliation is just another illusion....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Apr 11, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/58506504-private-notebooks

First, there is the Didion narrative voice, bestowed upon Grace, a woman who has become owner of most of a Central American country's land. Grace is dying of cancer and gets to the point; the point really is the demise of her acquaintance, Charlotte, a woman who has been married twice, once to a wretch who still pursues her, and once to a pretty good fellow who cannot help her as much as she needs help, particularly in saving her daughter, who has participated in a radical bombing of the Transamerica building in San Francisco.Back to the voice: it is deadpan, ironically understated (and often funny), and comprehensive in its judgments. Once Grace categorizes something, it stays categorized with the exception of Charlotte, who is a mass of paradoxes and contradictions, subservient to men, 1000% onto them, dull, conventional at times and at other times a quick-thinking expert in odd matters, like effecting a tracheotomy. Charlotte's protean quality is no doubt why Grace is drawn to her as an object of contemplation, but even as Grace has to push to document all of Charlotte's quirks and passions, she does so magisterially. You wouldn't argue with her in part because she wouldn't argue back. She wouldn't think it was worth the effort.So on the surface, read for its stylistic pleasures, this novel is a bravura performance. To go beyond the surface is contemplate how silly the whole thing is. The narrator possesses preposterous wealth, even by Central American standards. She's is in treatment for serious cancer but has the energy to tell this tale. Her son is a jerk who plays no real role in the story except being a jerk and playing at the idea of some kind of revolution. Whatever revolution he or others have in mind is unclear.Charlotte's daughter is caught up in some other sketchy revolution in the States. Charlotte's first husband is a freeloader with an endless list of ""friends"" he exploits and alienates as he pursues and abuses Charlotte in tedious self-pitying harangues. Charlotte loses what seems to be a baby fathered by her second husband--more melodrama. And Grace's brothers-in-law go in and out of running the country, or exploiting it, at will--yet more melodrama.I'd like to think of Didion laughing to herself as she threw this or that element into the soup.

There are magic pills that don't turn out to be so magic. There is a commitment to the vague, symbolic nature of existence, meaning the mysteries of computing and search for meaning via ashrams and teenagers who are too smart for their own good -- doubting everything, and rightfully so.The weakness of this novel is that keeps trying to turn a fundamentally comic approach into more than it is. DeLillo is nothing if not suggestive. He starts fires to make a point and then lets them burn out before the meal is cooked. Major case in point: The protagonist is chairman of a department of Hitler studies at a small college. The guy doesn't speak German. He says a few things that reflect some understanding of Hitler, but these comments are throw-aways. We wait for him to give a welcoming speech to a Hitler conference in German that he has painstakingly prepared. We spend time learning about his very odd German instructor. We go to ""class"" with him. In the end, the prepared speech and the conference blow by with little impact. It's hard to say why DeLillo bothered with this empty joke. And it's hard to say why the protagonist finally decides to shoot a guy who has been messing with his wife. Not because he doesn't value his wife (seemingly the fifth of his wives) but because we haven't been dealing with a killer kind of guy, we've been dealing with a gentle, tolerant dude who typically reacts very mildly to life's troubles.To conclude on a note of praise: DeLillo's writing, the pyrotechnics, the imagery, the canny little insights, the smaller, thematically unrelated jokes, are great.

To simplify Dillard's argument, she says traditional fiction reflected on society, modernist fiction reflected on the self, and post-modernist fiction reflected on itself. She expands on and buttresses these assessments with a wide array of examples, often bringing the modernists to the fore through Joyce and Eliot, and often bringing the post-modernists to the fore through Calvino, Barth, Coover, and company.The odd thing about this book is that it has an almost polemical tone despite Dillard generally declaring that she takes no sides. She is a powerful and experienced writer herself, and she knowingly highlights the many, many ways any writer of fiction can write almost any kind of fiction and succeed. Her command of the ways in which various writers--Borges, Barthelme, Mann, Dickens, Nabokov Flaubert--pursues their distinctive paths is wonderful. This old book (1982) remains vivid despite the fact that none of of her revered writers (except, as far as I know, John Barth) is still living.Having conducted this tour d'horizon of 20th century fiction, Dillard then turns to some of the questions that always have been discussed in literary salons and writing programs: Does fiction ""mean"" anything? Does it contribute any kind of special knowledge inthe struggle to broaden/deepen human understanding? Do critics matter? Do they influence writers? Should writers let their ""ideas"" show or should fiction be more demure than that? In the final chapters of the book, Dillard answers these questions with philosophical rigor, sometimes tediously so but always persuasively. Again, to simplify: her view is that fiction enhances human understanding by exploring the nooks, crannies, and limits of human possibility. That's probably the key word: possibility. Fiction offers the reader the opportunity to think about what might be as opposed to what is generally conceded to be. Art is what might be.

People like myself involved in foreign affairs studied Central America carefully. There were acronyms and personalities and storylines that had Washington riveted in the Executive Branch, on the Hill, and in the media and think tank world. Basically, the plot had to do with ""fighting communism"" in the western hemisphere, particularly in terms of Cuban support for Nicaragua and the Sandinistas. El Salvador boiled with violence that was only ancillary to that Cold War scenario. Didion correctly portrays the U.S. as attempting to buttress El Salvador's government and make it strong enough and stable enough to keep the commies out, but the fact is that the military and the paramilitary and the guerrillas weren't necessarily at war over communism in the western hemisphere The conflict in El Salvador had different roots. There were fourteen family groups who controlled huge tracts of land; that gave them the wherewithal to control the banks and to an extent the government. Poverty in El Salvador was extreme if you weren't born into one of those fourteen families. So there was a socio-political uprising that went on for years and years, and in a very self-interested way the military established itself as arbiter and spoils-keeper, generally supporting the rich, generally not supporting the poor, and always battling with the rebels (let's skip the acronyms, there were different groups of rebels). The U.S. problem was that the military and paramilitary (arms of the government, after all) committed all manner of atrocities. So how could the U.S. funnel money to human rights' violators? Didion catches this question in a basic way and adorns it with the atmosphere of menace and fear that permeated the country. Somehow the U.S. did keeping funneling money to El Salvador's government.I visited El Salvador even more briefly in 1987. The situation was as bad or worse than ever. San Salvador, the capital, had suffered a terrible earthquake the year before. There was rubble along the roadside everywhere, large piles of dirt and bricks. Napoleon Duarte was president. He was a centrist, a former mayor of San Salvador, and a Notre Dame-educated engineer. I was a member of a small group that met with him. He was attuned to resolving all of El Salvador's problems but lacked the resources to do much, a pretty battered guy who could be shot anywhere and at any time because he knew exactly what was going on. My group then moved to a luncheon/discussion with representatives of business (the 14 families.) We were harangued about the United States privileging human rights over fighting communism. (Again, I don't think that communism really was the incendiary dynamic in El Salvador.) I had the distinct impression that these guys had what they had and intended to keep it; they weren't giving anything away; in fact, they were the source of funding of paramilitary activities intended to guard their riches. Then we met with the Minister of Defense, Vides Casanova. His schtick was that he needed more money, equipment and training so he could deal with both the rebels and the paramilitaries...and squeeze money out of everyone, including the U.S. (which was supplying $100 million a year in military aid at the time.)

Updike is quite dazzling in making this case, but it's tough going. Roger, the professor of divinity who narrates this novel, responds with skepticism. His faith, such as it is, has roots in the theology of Karl Barth and Rudolph Bultman, both of who suggested that God is beyond human understanding and the Biblical record of Jesus. Or, alternatively, Roger toys with the works of late Roman theologians whose work reaches for the truth in carnem, meaning in the flesh of human experience, in some instances sexually, in other instances through the marvels of growth and decay, culminating in death.Updike is terrific on theology, too, and he possessed a lot of schoolboy Latin--I was not aware of that. This, however, offers shaky ground for a novel, which in boils down to the young cosmic speculator succumbing to the professor's eager wife and the professor becoming involved with a 19-year-old niece who lives on welfare and abuses her two-year-old.There are great set piece descriptions of the divinity faculty, the city in which the action transpires, cocktail parties and sex between the professor's wife and her Lothario. Ultimately, however, Roger's interest in his niece, seeing her through an abortion and helping her negotiate Social Services proposing to take away her daughter, borders on the incredible and is inexcusable. And of course the older woman and the younger Lothario lose interest in one another, particularly after another professor at the university demolishes the hypothesis that God lies in the numbers of the universe.Updike writes with his customary panache, but this seems to be a book he forced himself to write during a tough period in his life. The dust jacket photo of him displays a sour, displeased Updike, not his normal smiling self.Oddly, if the book had a darker ending, it would be far more compelling, but things work out for young and old alike....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 02, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/651689.Roger_s_Version

Enough about translations. On to the Homer-Bard, wCaroline Alexander's new translation of the Iliad is excellent, full of life, consistent, and deft. Enough about translations. On to the Homer-Bard, whoever he was: The Iliad is a monument to so many things. It is a monument to epic narrative, a monument to war, a monument to studies in character, and perhaps most of all, a monument to honor-shame cultures. Anthropologists like Julian Pitt-Rivers gave such cultures their name in the 1960s and 1970s; the Homer-Bard gave them reality several millennia earlier.Here we have a story in which everyone, high and low, occupies a status defined either by the honor of having successfully absconded with a beautiful woman or the honor of desperately attempting to get her back. It is an implausible story on many counts. First, how could the Greeks have besieged Troy for 10 years? Second, why wouldn't someone in Troy throw Helen over the ramparts to get rid of her during that period? Third, how could the greatest of all Greek warriors, Achilles, withdraw from battle because he had been deprived of the pleasures of a young woman of no great standing whom he had taken as spoils?The answer lies in the rigidity of the honor-shame dynamic. If I am degraded, I will fight you to the death to recover my honor. That's the Homer-Bard's central concern. Hundreds of years after the siege of Troy, he is detailing the honor-shame as an emblem of what life was like in a previous golden age, when men were men, and values were values. No one yielded back then. Death was an interruption for individuals more than an endgame for groups. The one out related to the shifting and capricious roles of the gods. If you were honored or if you were shamed, it might have more to do with a god who struggled against you than your own struggles against yourself and your enemies. The great strength of Achilles clearly is linked to the foreknowledge that soon after this phase of the siege of Troy is over, he will die. The gods have foretold this. So there is no point in preserving his existence by shortcuts in battle. When he returns to the field, he is all in.The Homer-Bard presents the flaws in gods and humans alike. Menelaus, jilted husband of Helen, certainly is a lesser character, not so brave, not so strong. Paris is a similar type, not the greatest of warriors. Hector, Troy's greatest warrior, is not always preeminent, although he is never as vulgar as Achilles, who drags his body through the dirt after killing him.Fundamentally the objective of the Homer-Bard is to give us an encyclopedic scan of human behavior and human affairs. He examines jealousy, envy, cowardice, incompetence, and bad judgment. But he does this through a story that hangs together and that, through extended episodes focused on key figures--Diomedes, Ajax, Athena, Priam--generates a great deal of empathy on the part of the reader (this reader, anyway). Despite the stiffness of the society and the formulaic style of narrative, something exceedingly and recognizably ""human"" gives the Iliad its magnificent pull.The strange fact is that the dawn of literature shone more brightly than all of the ensuing middays. Subsequent stories about war--think War and Peace, the greatest war story after the Iliad--fall short of the carnage and sorrow and grandeur and depravity of the Iliad, which at one and the same time is more elevated and gritty. It has been very difficult, essentially impossible, for humankind to detach itself from the honor-shame dynamic, which, if we are honest about it, more often than not has led to tragedy instead of victory.As I write this comment tonight, Vladimir Putin has assembled a great army to help him recapture Ukraine. Why? There are many reasons, but it would appear that the shame of Russia having lost Ukraine to independence is the principal factor driving Putin. Russia, in his mind, has been shamed.

Briefly, Westover is born into a Mormon family led by a disturbed, paranoid, bipolar and probably schizoid father who won't let his children go to school, see doctors, or have anything to do with government or the ungodly. He runs a scrap and metal construction business in Idaho. He puts his kids to work early, treats them harshly, preaches the End Time endlessly, and deforms one of his sons, Shawn, into a sadist who physically abuses his siblings, boys and girls alike.Westover's upbringing was so totalitarian that she simply didn't know it was brutal fiction, a nightmare of lies backed up by force, yet she managed, through diligence, talent and some luck, to escape to Brigham Young University, then Cambridge, ultimately earning a Ph.D in history. Ultimately, this led to her ostracism from most of the cultish clan, save two brothers and a sister. She was branded evil, an emissary from the devil. Reconciliation proved impossible. Her mother was a classic example of abuse victim dependency, ignoring the truth of the brutality perpetrated on her children. The sadist son became the arbiter of right and wrong, in or out.The anecdotes and details of this memoir are chilling. What measure of spirit enabled a girl to survive? That's a difficult question to answer. More difficult to answer is how people like her father and sadistic brother became tyrannical and powerful. It isn't Mormonism, per se. More likely, it is a terror of reality, an absolute form of denialism, a mistrust of science and knowledge, a disregard for the suffering of others--in fact, the need to inflict suffering on others. This book is a study in abnormal psychology that really isn't so abnormal. Usually we encounter it in the grotesque figures of history, grand monsters in high places. But it also can show up on a bedraggled farm in Idaho.

He was nasty to his wife, Lady Bird, and brutal with his staff. If he wanted another woman, he grabbed her for a while; if he wanted a staffer to do something, he wanted it done before he asked for it. He literally had access to bags of money from Texas oil and gas barons with which to seduce other politicians and called on it often. He talked out of both sides of his mouth. He ostracized. He humiliated. But at the same time Johnson slavishly flattered his betters--Russell in the Senate and Sam Rayburn in the House--and took their counsel as he embraced their support. The same was true, of course, when it came to the money men in Texas. Caro strains to have us believe that when Johnson began to break the South's grip on segregation and the filibuster by means of the 1957 civil rights bill, focused on voting rights (other dimensions of discrimination were left out of the bill), he was manifesting a basic empathy and sense of justice that reached full flower with the civil rights legislation passed during his presidency. My reading of the Johnson Caro presents is somewhat different. Here is a man whose central, undying preoccupation was with power. Coming from a tough luck family in a tough luck part of Texas, Johnson was determined to get up on people, take control of the situation, have his way. He lived and worked as if he were on fire. His energy was volcanic. Whatever he had to do to get ahead, he would do it. This was not a man desperately determined to defend the downtrodden and defenseless until doing so began to be a way to put distance between him and the South as he altered his political profile in pursuit of the presidency, which depended on him appearing as more than a regional senator. Suggesting otherwise Caro is reading back from the 60s into the 50s, but this is a book about the 50s (and 40s and 30s) wherein Johnson evolved from a New Dealer favored by FDR into a guardian of State's Rights at the behest of Russell and his fellow reactionaries.As a study of racism in the United States, this book is powerful and remains relevant, which is tragic. As a study of how the Senate works and doesn't work, is manipulated, plays a role in stopping more legislation than promoting it, this book also is relevant (right now in 2022). The preservation of the filibuster doubles the rights and powers of minority senators. First, a senator from a state like Wyoming has a vote that counts as much as a state like California, which means that the distinctly minority population of Wyoming is exponentially empowered versus the population of California. That's without a filibuster. With a filibuster, a senator from a little state like West Virginia can throw a huge monkey wrench into the plans of a majority of senators from other states. Manchin of West Virginia and Sinema of Arizona believe that is not only their right but their duty, which outweighs the rights and duties of, in this case, 48 other Democratic Senators.Caro's explication of Senate rules can be tiresome, but it is indispensable, which is not to say the Senate has not changed since the 1950s. The Johnson of today's Senate, McConnell, apparently doesn't have to work overtime to gain the support of his Republican caucus. In Johnson's day, a number of Democratic senators thought for themselves and voted independent of Johnson's wishes. Today no Republican senator appears to have that latitude or courage. The Republican caucus is just as focused on not encroaching on State's Rights in the conduct of elections as the senators of the south were focused on preserving segregation and the South's way of life. There is a link there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/86525.Master_of_the_Senate

If you aren't, you run the risk of getting lost. Certain figures who were important then, a Kennan or a Sartre or Levi-Strauss, have been at least partially overtaken or entombed by analysis since and Menand's deft way of fitting them into this loose historical study doesn't necessarily give them their due.The challenge Menand set himself, covering the social aspects of the Cold War on both sides of the Atlantic simply is too enormous to be done justice. As a result, he can be excessively assiduous in recounting the careers of people like John Cage, Jackson Pollock, Susan Sontag, François Truffaut.In this book, the center doesn't really hold. The pressures of the Cold War did not completely dominate cultural and artistic affairs during the 50s, 60s, 70s, and, I might add, 80s, which Menand curiously leaves out of the story. Quite often new things of a cultural nature were were simply new things, and quite often they were sideshows at best. Jackson Pollock's painting was significant in and of itself, aesthetically, and pretty insignificant in any theoretical sense. The Civil Rights movement was more significantly tied to the decolonization of empires than to East-West animosity, and even so, the Civil Rights movement prospered most when it managed to push its way past Cold War preoccupations entirely.Menand's focus on James Baldwin's experience with Civil Rights is fascinating and sad, but that is less relevant to the Cold War than George Kennan's disappointment with interpretations of the theory of containment, a theory he devised in the first place. Susan Sontag apparently first wrote about things that were ""camp."" This was loosely tied to anti-establishment sentiments and gay culture, among other factors. But she came to react with ""cold fury"" when anyone reminded her of her essay on camp. (Look camp up if you never knew what camp was to begin with.) More importantly, Sontag ultimately infuriated the leftists who always were prepared to blame America for the ills of the world first when she said, in 1979, “Communism is in itself a variant, the most successful variant, of fascism. Fascism with a human face."" That's not in the book as far as I recall.A writer like Solzhenitsyn had a huge impact on the Cold War era, but there's little in this book that would tell you that. Instead we get some very good stuff on the origins of rock and roll, rock's connection to Europe, and the Beatles. Fun to read...the whole book is fun to read...but the Beatles coexisted with the Cold War in time, not in substance.Menand has it right to focus on arts, culture, and thought, but he overlooks a vital fact: culture spawns politics, politics don't spawn culture (until politics outlaws culture.)

HerJanet Malcom’s book on psychoanalysis, aptly titled, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession, is a highly readable account why it is impossible. Here she traces the evolution of Freud’s thought and practice and extends it to the thought and practice of an analyst in New York to whom she gives the name Aaron Green, M.D. In a sense this is a book similar to “Inside the Masons,” or something like that, because it seeks to penetrate a kind of cult or with a special code of symbols and rituals, a major difference being the magnitude of Freud’s singular discoveries and the seriousness with which some very serious people regard psychoanalysis.Green’s psychoanalytic practice is of the New York school variety. He receives a few patients for an hour a day five days a week. After a brief introduction/orientation, the patients lie down on the couch, Greene behind them, and free associate. There are some likely candidates for psychoanalysis, generally neurotics, and some carefully avoided candidates, generally psychotics. Psychoanalysis, in other words, isn’t for everyone.The idea is that through the swirl of uncensored speech a patient can penetrate the defenses and evasions she developed during the earliest months and years of life and come to grips with an unencumbered ego, a self, a human entity with a reasonable degree of autonomy and personal freedom.Malcom discovers that such outcomes rarely occur. More likely, patients abandon psychoanalysis, move away from their analysts, can’t pay for it anymore, etc. These incomplete outcomes are not always failures, but there is no question that they have fallen short.There is a great deal of infighting within and among psychoanalytic institutes, be they in New York or San Francisco or elsewhere. Freud’s thought is nudged along, deviations are sanctioned or repudiated, big battles are fought over seemingly tiny pieces of psychological geography. Ostracism awaits heretics. For example, two famous psychoanalysts became erotically involved with their patients; they quickly were stripped of positions and honors within the hierarchy because their sin was against a central psychoanalytic dynamic, which is as follows: All patients with any chance of success will fall in love with their analysts by means of a process of transference, i.e., projecting their misperceptions of reality onto their caregivers. This is essential; transference rips away many delusions when the analyst recognizes what is going on and countertransfers reality-inducing messages, leading the patient to recognize the fictiveness of her feelings. That is a major moment, cracking the eggshell of projections in which we all live to one degree or another.This is grueling work for the analyst and the patient. Imagine the burden if you spoke about yourself to someone for an hour every weekday for several years. That must be galling. Wouldn’t you frustrate and bore yourself to the point of abandoning your narcissism, or your inability to stay married, or keep a job, or surrender your most cherished obsessions and compulsions just to enjoy the pleasure of shutting your mouth?To make the medicine even more bitter, classical psychoanalysts like Green give their patients little direction. They don’t say much. They reveal as little about themselves as possible. Their job is to offer very little guidance until they recognize the offending patterns in the drivel, spot their ripeness, and only then proceed to a harvest...four years later...five years later...even more.Freud’s influence is as indisputable as it is contestable. The educated world knows his terms and insights, but the number of people who have been part of the psychoanalytic world is infinitesimally small, either as analysts or patients. But there is an allure to psychoanalysis that persists, perhaps because most of us know that we don’t know all there is to know about ourselves, our desires, our conflicts, our aversions. So we will find Malcom’s book quite interesting even as we agree with her conclusion that psychoanalysis ultimately is impossible; it’s not scientific; it’s beyond measurement, it’s an unproven and unprovable proposition. And yet highly educated, very intelligent men like Aaron Green swear by it, and that’s intriguing.

""A House of One's Own"" offers a superb look at the Bloomsbury group. Malcom knows a great deal about all of the players, not just Virginia Woolf, the most famous of them, and a great deal about the writing, painting and criticism these players produced. To stay with Virginia Woolf, my particular interest in Bloomsbury, I continue to be struck by how normal, if troubled, she was when she wasn't what is called ""mad."" And I would contrast this normalcy with the strange, lyrical power of her writing. Malcom succeeds in offering an excellent portrait of Virginia Woolf within her milieu.The other essay of interest, not because the subject is inherently appealing, is called ""A Girl of the Zeitgeist,"" and focuses on the critics and painters associated with ArtForum, notably ArtForum's role in the art scene in New York of the 1980s when it was edited by a young woman named Ingrid Sischy. The regnant artists of the time were figures like Julian Schnabel and David Salle. Their art seems to have peaked and plummeted rather quickly, but it was quite a ride. The best explanation in Malcolm's essay for their success is that in the 1980s, the rich in Long Island and Darien had bought all the big cars they could house and set about bidding up prices for art...art that was pretty slapdash, gaudy to the point of garish. These and other artists were no less worthy, however, than some of the silly critics who preened across the pages of ArtForum. Whether Sischy enabled, improved, or restrained them is not clear. ArtForum appears to have been, during that period at least, a ""happening"" in print. Was it worth the effort Malcom put into documenting ArtForum et al? As an examination of narcissism, superficiality and exhibitionism, overcooked in the lofts of Manhattan, there is something chastening and cautionary about this essay that justifies both writing it and reading it.....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Dec 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16059462-forty-one-false-starts

I suppose this tells you something. Someone in tThe first time I searched for this book on Goodreads, I encountered two entries containing summaries. I suppose this tells you something. Someone in the Goodreads world doesn't expect anyone to read the whole book. I get that. But this isn't the most dense book of economics/public policy; it's quite readable, and it contains mountains of substantiated insights into the US (and global) plight. I'll write this  as if the US were the exclusive object of attention, which often is, unfortunately, the way US citizens look at things. Here are my take-aways:Immigration is a net positive in economic terms. Immigrants go to work and they buy goods and services from already landed immigrant communities. If the GDP is a measurement, immigrants are on its side. However, I don't find here a solution to undocumented immigrants crossing the border. Having spent a good bit of time on the US-Mexico border, I'm sure a wall isn't the solution.Gross Domestic Product, along the rate of its growth, is inscribed in US political landscape. Bigger is better, faster is better. But is it? Is the accumulation of wealth the proper north star of national policy? GDP is a convenient bit of economic measurement only if it addresses other aspects of human existence, i.e., is prudently allocated among the population. The rate of growth, by contrast, is a fishy concept. There are no known and reliable ways to determine how it happens. Obviously it has to entail fresh inputs and increased productivity, but what inputs, what productivity, etc.?The US is substantially undertaxed in comparison to similarly developed economies and also in comparison to previous standards of US taxation, which once reached upwards of 70% at the margins. The Reagan/Republican/Teaparty view is that all taxation is bad taxation. That view has prevailed in recent decades.The consequence of under taxation is that the US has woefully inadequate resources to fund things like elder care, child care, early education, etc. The Build Back Better plan currently being debated aspires to change this. The Build Back Better plan is heavily constrained by the requirement that it pay for itself within current US budget parameters. Some additional taxation of the wealthy and corporations will pay for this. The truth is that in the longterm the US economy will grow bigger and faster if the US does a better job taking care of the elderly and children. More adults will be able to work, and more children will lead more productive (and satisfying) lives.Free trade is not always a good thing despite the simple economic logic that underpins it. The problem is that many workers who have been put out of work by letting other countries take over producing whatever was produced here will not move from their dying or dead towns. To an economist, this is stupid. Go chase the money! But people get stuck. They don't want to leave family and friends and meaningful (to them) locales. This shouldn't surprise anyone, but in national politics in the US, ""meaningful"" is a vacuous term. The answer to some of free trade's damage is to amp up US retraining programs substantially. Why hasn't this happened? Hard to say. Indifference to anything ""meaningful,"" perhaps, or lack of sympathy for ""losers"" who ought to move.Encircling all these issues are two giant problems: Climate change is not really a focus of this book. That's too bad. Income inequality, however, is a focus, and the ultimate point is that Americans were not always so dramatically divided along income lines, with the consequence that alienation profoundly harms the nation's democracy. We live in three groups: those who are stretched to the breaking point and expect to stay that way; those who are stretched to the breaking point and think tomorrow that will change if someone like Trump returns; and those who are in the butter, all slathered and giggling about it.Redistributing wealth in direct payments is an unlikely answer, although it is suggested. More appealing would be higher taxes to fund better social services...for children and the elderly...with the immediate benefit almost always going to the adults in between.There are no unsubstantiated claims in this book and a lot of humility about facing the challenges. I would have appreciated more consideration of egregious healthcare costs, which are double those imposed on the peoples of other developed economies, and climate change. The Republican position that the private sector and market forces ought to resolve those challenges is absurd on its very face, just like ""trickle down"" economics, which in practice means ""bleed out"" economics, squeezing more and more of the life force out of the disadvantaged in this country....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Dec 2021,not set,"Dec 01, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51014619-good-economics-for-hard-times

That's where I encountered Stoner by John Williams. NYRB had republished this novel in its classics of literature series. The blurb language was intriguing, of the 'overlooked gem' sort, the 'quiet masterpiece' sort, the 'how did you manage to miss this?' sort. Stoner lives up to its blurbs somewhat deceptively. The novel opens focused on a boy living on a modest Missouri farm, circa 1900. Nothing about him or his parents or the farm is overdrawn. Throughout the novel, a consistent realism prevails, not just in the straightforward prose but also in the assessment of events. There is a ""life-like"" quality to the narrative, keyed both to its slow pace and also to Stoner's limited expectations and his early experiences, which are humdrum, don't catch fire, smolder.Stoner then traces William Stoner's move from agricultural studies at the university to literature, which has the effect of multiplying, exponentially, his perception of life's possibilities and vagaries. He is mentored by a veteran professor who recognizes him for what he is: a teacher, that's his calling. Being a ""teacher"" is not climbing Everest. It's walking through the same woods for many days and many years. Williams embraces that truth. He adds to it some of the most powerful assessments of university politics I've encountered as Stoner endures a hostile relationship with a fellow professor who gains power over him as head of the English Department. The crux of the conflict is utterly not politically correct on Stoner's part, and yet it is anchored in his unimpeachable professional integrity. So he pays a price roughly equivalent to a 20-year jail sentence. Meanwhile, his unstable marriage becomes awful in its mutual alienation. In both cases, the job and the marriage, Stoner admits to himself that he has lost; he knows why; he knows he can't change things; he accepts them. He is an unostentatious stoic, simply put. Briefly he has a very private and wonderful affair with a graduate student that can't end well for either of them and doesn't end well. I won't go into what that means.And along Stoner goes, years passing, years recorded, noted, endured without complaint...not because Stoner doesn't realize he he has reason to complain but because Stoner understands that many lives, his life, too, are that way. Few get exactly what they ""want."" Williams holds his material together more through this perspective, Stoner's perspective, than through incident. Stoner's greatest gift is a lack of self-pity.Taken as a whole, not necessarily life-phase by life-phase or chapter by chapter, Stoner does qualify as an overlooked gem. To write a novel so well-controlled, so steady, so somber and yet so moving, is no easy task. In some ways Williams reminds me of another great midwestern writer, William Maxwell. He doesn't have Maxwell's beautiful phrasing, but he is very rewarding and worth reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Nov 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

This interweaving of four philosophers' lives is compelling and very well-written, setting each of them in context both pre-WWI and post-WWI. I won't attempt to reprise the kernel of each contribution to philosophy in any detail, but I must say that I found that most of the approaches described here smack of a kind of lunacy. Cassirer was a ""normal"" man, a true philosopher who worked in academe and made huge efforts to link the cultures and functions of society around the globe. In a sense he was a polymath who could have been viewed as an anthropologist and might be were he at work today. There are great passages here focused on his collaboration with Aby Warburg, apparently luring Warburg out of his own lunacy in a Swiss retreat (think Magic Mountain) and enabling him to return to work at his astounding library in Hamburg with its magnificent oval reading room. Ultimately, Cassirer was driven out of his post in Berlin for his Jewishness, landed in Hamburg, received a carte blanche opportunity to revise the philosophy department in Frankfurt, turned that down, and then was pushed into exile in Switzerland and finally, Yale. But he seems to have retained his sanity nonetheless.Heidegger would superficially appear the least of the lunatics, but his intensity and ambition, as manifested both in his life and his work, gives him a good claim on other-worldliness. If you have read his work, you know that his technique was to shape concepts like ""there-being"" (dasein) as means to a landing place for humans who have been ""thrown"" into the world, arrive full of anxiety, and can only achieve a kind of peace by reconciling with the temporal nature of their existence, i.e., death. He led a double life in the sense that he had a wife for family purposes and lovers for erotic purposes and a job in academe for financial purposes and a ""hut"" (what a hut!) in the mountains for philosophizing. Always a prickly character, he ultimately aligned himself with the Nazis as a university rector, and what can one say? There's no excuse. Eilenberger, the author, has a lot of fun with poor Walter Benjamin, who couldn't get a job or hold onto one, or a home that satisfied him, or a lover as an alternative to his wife, or money...he always had money problems. The acute feature of Benjamin's work is its marvelous deconstruction of the world in which we live. Eilenberger gives him credit as the founder of critical theory and the Frankfurt School, but if that's true, he did it, as he did most things, off-the-cuff and on-the-run. In a sense we can think of Heidegger as a philosopher determined to dig into what comes before the reality ""set"" in which we live; Benjamin is a master of of observing that set and delineating its features (when he finished something he was writing), and Wittgenstein, our last crazy, was, at least initially, the mystic master of what we can determine to be reality and what we can't, what is the case, as he puts it, and what isn't the case.Like Benjamin, Wittgenstein was a wanderer. He studied in England, endured WWI, abandoned Vienna, his home city, for the Austrian provinces where he taught public school, and he was poor because...well, because he was a multi-millionaire who gave all his money to his siblings. No one really understood Wittgenstein. Betrand Russell didn't. The Vienna Circle didn't (and they thought they were somehow his followers.) John Maynard Keynes didn't. But everyone was fascinated by his mixture of logic and intellectual asceticism. Unlike Heidegger Wittgenstein most definitely did not believe that there was any accessible philosophical foreground to human existence. If there were, he believed no one could speak of it.There's one observation in this book that unravels Heidegger rather simply. He strove for a state of existence that transcended, or disposed of, what had come to be the technologically-minded bourgeoisie. And in fact he appears to have had some encounters with eastern masters of meditation, which does lead to a shucking-off of the meaningless claptrap of being that defines so many of us so much of the time. But he wouldn't confess or admit that the leap of zen into tranquil nothingness had influenced him a great deal. HIs ideas were always his ideas. He was a jealous god....more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Nov 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49099790-time-of-the-magicians

People have trouble in love, at work, and with friends. Birds die, au pair girls piss off their resentful employers, college reunions confirm not being a member of the in crowd, a frustrated young writer loses his girl to a famous writer (who is an ass).But literary fiction is seldom happy, that's the truth of it, and that's what Salter writes--literary fiction in an updated Hemingway style. The sentences are short yet complete and weighty. They often aren't sentences, lacking verbs, but Salter's timing in violating the rules of grammar is exquisite. You could say that the best of these stories are elegant (and a few of them are clunkers, too staccato.)Curiously, Salter manages to inject a certain air of the romantic into the darkest situations. He does this by invoking the undercurrents of longing, frustration, and even death that carry his characters into their conflicts and failures. Things could be otherwise, he suggests, although they aren't, they're miserable, although the wine is good, Barcelona and New York are good, and the plumber who calls off his affair with a woman far above his station is intriguing.Essentially Salter excels by eliminating the stuff that makes most days and most relationships rather foggy and inconclusive. He is more domestic than Hemingway, more interested in quirks and details, but he still carves with a sharp knife. There is no excess here, all is lean. Perhaps it would be fair to suggest he is a kind of worldly Raymond Carver, but that leads us back to Hemingway, too....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 20, 2021",Apr 2022,"Oct 20, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10324416-dusk-and-other-stories

I lived in an apartment building with an accessible rooftop--no amenities included--and would carry a garden chair up there to read undisturbed and bake myself brown. I don't think I had read any Russian literature before, but I knew what to make of Crime and Punishment because its characters were so vividly drawn, its plot was so ghastly, and its pace never lagged. Here was a fevered Russian Dickens, more daring in many respects, more grisly, and just as agile as Dickens in shifting gears from melodrama to scintillating realism, at times wildly emotional and at other times clinically psychological.I finished rereading Crime and Punishment yesterday afternoon sitting on my porch, wearing a hat to shield myself from the sun and 2.5 readers to correct my aging eyes. It had all the qualities that first struck me fifty years ago, to which I would add an artful compactness, a solid, elemental quality that, despite the melodrama, gave this great book its powerful form.This is one of Dostoevsky's many ventures exploring the tectonics of rationality and irrationality in conflict. Raskolnikov's rationality leads him into irrationality. He wants to think his way into becoming an ubermensch with an axe well before Nietzsche fashioned his ubermensch with a hammer, he wants to take revenge on his beleaguered condition as an impoverished and humiliated student by killing and stealing and getting away with it because he is the new lawmaker--things will be as he sees them, not as ""the world"" has hitherto seen them. The wonder of Dostoevsky is that he could detest such a proposition even as he masterfully delineated it.One key feature of Crime and Punishment is its emphasis on suffering, the need to suffer, the need to accept suffering as fundamental to the human condition, its purpose. Dostoevsky frames this idea in Christian terms. Suffering to him is the prelude to rebirth in Christ, its happy outcome. This treatment is somewhat pasted on although Dostoevsky was totally committed to it. The novel nonetheless offers so many examples of secular, dead-end suffering that it serves not only as a prelude to Nietzsche but also to existentialism. Dostoevsky would have loathed such a reading of his work, but he specialized in anatomizing things he loathed, couldn't help himself, which was his genius....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment

As a result, he is eager to figure things out (what his father is up to) and somewhat unformed, a boy who becomes a man who is intelligent and always given to taking up the next challenge...even if it leads to him becoming a double agent in the game of espionage. Plainly stated, Pym lacks judgment about people, deeds, love and loyalty (a good description of a conman's son). It's not that he cannot tell right from wrong; it's more that he doesn't have the self-discipline to hold himself back from doing wrong.Le Carré tells this story from multiple viewpoints wheeling around Pym's desire to write the whole tale of his life, confess it all, as he hides out from his British spymasters. He has come to an endpoint in being a double agent and with the death of his father, he seems to have to come to an endpoint in being himself.This is a colorful, confusing, and yet strongly written book--lots of atmosphere, lots of good characters, lots of vivid descriptions. True, Pym does a ragged job of writing his portion of this story. Fortunately, le Carré finds ways to make up for his fumbling chronology, sharp changes of point of view, and lost threads.

Viri is an architect with an office in NewLight Years by James Salter is a novel about Viri and Nedra, whose seemingly perfect marriage is faltering. Viri is an architect with an office in New York City. Nedra has no profession other than being herself. They live somewhere up the Hudson with a river view and two lovely daughters. Their friends are sophisticated, varied, and as emotionally untethered as they are. It seems that Viri's infidelity starts things on a downward slant, but that's not true. Nedra already has a midday lover. When Viri loses his grip on his amour, he is shattered. Nedra, however, wasn't shattered when she drifted away from Viri and won't be shattered when she drifts away from her midday lover or any other man who interests her as life moves along. She isn't loosely promiscuous. Rather, as suggested very early in the novel, she is selfish, or self-centered. I'll get to why she is that way in a moment.The charm and power of this novel is Salter's retrained, understated eloquence. His writing is consistently gorgeous--its tempo, its images, the way it leaps past burdensome exposition and keeps the story focused where it self-evidently should be focused. On a few occasions, Salter's romantic temperament gets the better of him, and he sounds like DH Lawrence in heat. But in the main, his writing is a pleasure to read.Nedra, a beautiful, self-absorbed woman, is indeed selfish, but why? The answer lies in a deathbed visit she makes to her father in Altoona, Pa., a moldering industrial town in central Pennsylvania, quite similar to the moldering towns, industrial or not, I knew growing up in eastern Pennsylvania. These are depressing places (now surrounded by depressing subdivisions). Nedra left Altoona when she was seventeen and her return visit now hurts her; she doesn't want to be there; she doesn't want to have come from there; it's a crummy place. She did not go to college at seventeen; instead she went to New York and with her looks and interest in things cultural you would never encounter in Altoona, she made her way forward...eventually marrying Viri. So I take it that she is self-centered because that is how she survives her past. Salter makes no overt point about this, but that's it.Viri is a more conventional, probably prep school and Ivy League personality. He's great with his daughters.

They were friends of old. Branch's job was to ask questions about events and issues on Clinton's agenda, taping his answers at various spots in the residential portion of The White House. Those tapes, some seventy-seven, are not the body of this book. They belong to Clinton, so this book is built on Branch's memory of what Clinton had to say, which Branch dictated on his drive back to Baltimore.Basically, you would have to be an ardent political junkie to make much sense of the tumult of Clinton's presidency by reading, or trying to read, this book, which is an unending series of comments, meditations, complaints, judgments and observations on Clinton's part wrapped up in additional commentary, etc., on Branch's part.I guess I am a political junkie, and I knew enough about the Clinton presidency to make sense of all this. I enjoyed this book, found both men to be impressive in surprising ways, and appreciated the immediacy of discussions, in which Hillary and Chelsea also participated. The key finding is how cooly objective Clinton was about political problems, quirks, and challenges. He displays here an unruffled appreciation for people who try to stab him in the back, or the stomach, and approaches the rough and tumble of Washington with analytic brilliance. Clinton is a man of exceptional range and intellect. He has mastered many, many obscure and complex issues. But I, and not just me, had significant misgivings about him in terms of temperament because of the bimbos and Monica. Branch never really penetrates the Monica compartment. Whatever was loose and stupid and needy about Clinton in his doings with her, or his other philandering, seems not to have affected his commitment to his job. Go figure. There is enough supplemental information about pre-presidential activity, including Whitewater, however, to leave me wondering how much of that was slander, how much truth. Ken Starr and the Republicans and their operatives threw mud at Clinton by the bucket.Branch is the esteemed author of books on Martin Luther King. Good books. I don't get the sense that he ever pulls punches in his renderings of these encounters with Clinton. He would seem to have too much integrity and too much to lose to take a journey under the bus for his old friend.Of course Clinton messed up the final years of his presidency and is to blame for that, but in private as in public, he accepted responsibility. And Hillary, after storms and explosions, appears to have moved past worrying about kissy/touchy games with a young woman (not to mention Gennifer Flowers).The point becomes Clinton's determination to prove that democratic government can deliver essential goods and services to all of us, rich and poor, as contrasted with Republicans who had, and still have, a single agenda, i.e., cut taxes, diminish government, tarnish it, get rid of the damn thing. Just like Mitch McConnell, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich wanted to thwart Clinton at every turn. Just like now, lesser Republicans were terrified of the 20% or so of their radical right wing base.A comparable figure of high intellect and extreme commitment is Obama. The difference between the two, other than Obama's dignity, private and public, seems to be that you could look at Obama on any given day and know he was dead serious and acutely informed. Clinton didn't quite give off that vibe. He is a friendlier man and a more agile salesman. But the two of them shared the same passions for taking care of the forgotten, building bridges not divisions, and ensuring America's competitiveness and security. All that comes through in this book. But I don't really recommend that you read it unless you lived through Clinton's presidency and still have questions or as a political junkie can't get enough of the maneuverings and deceptions so central to the Washington game....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2919932-the-clinton-tapes

The main reason is that the English in command of a ""station"" in Burma during the final decades of the British Empire are so awful in their abuse and attitudes toward ""the Burmans"" that most if not all publishers wouldn't want to be associated with it. The second is that the empty-headed joy the main character, Flory, and the woman he is trying to court, Elizabeth, take in hunting is revolting. Burmese Days is full of abuse, hypocrisy, malice, frustration and endless quantities of alcohol. Having served ""out there"" Orwell probably is quite accurate in his portrayal of people who served as the cat's paws of the Empire. His knowledge of the flora and fauna alone convinces me that he knew whereof he wrote. The main plot revolves around Flory, who is in love with Burma, trying to endure his association with colleagues who hate it. The only solution he can think of is successfully wooing Elizabeth, a penniless girl who, in fact, is in Burma in search of a husband while living in the house of her uncle and aunt. Orwell's considerable talent makes this aspect of the novel credible. There are fascinating ebbs and flows in this courtship, marked by desperation on both sides.The subplot has to do with ""locals"" trying to gain membership in the station's English club while at the same time seeking to undermine one another's efforts. This is a weaker dimension of the book, but it's not without its moments and a certain nasty flare.Burmese Days is a work very much of its time, deeply informed by Orwell's dislike of that time. He's a powerful writer, the text sails along, and yet in these times I think any novel so full of bigotry, racism, cruelty and narrow-mindedness would run aground....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jul 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9650.Burmese_Days

No good reason other than an impression it was a bluff, wacky kind of serio-comic novel I wouldn't necessarily like. so 50 years after it's publication, what do I think? It's a bluff, wacky kind of serio-comic novel that I liked more than I thought I would. One of my thoughts on turning the first pages was that I soon would reach the firebombing of Dresden, because that was said to be the heart of the book. Well, the firebombing occurs but pretty deep in the book and it is handled in what I would call a respectful way, which I appreciated.I visited Dresden in 1996. Even then it had the patchy quality of a city wounded in the war that had not been fully reassembled. Parts of it were lovely, parts of it had the quality of something that had been ripped apart and mended with fabric that didn't match the rest of the place. My experience in Hanover was quite different: every brick was back where it should be, Hanover looked almost new. Hamburg looked perfectly, elegantly old, and Berlin looked old but bullet-marked. Dresden wasn't a settled matter. Maybe it is now, 202i.Vonnegut makes much ado about the fact that he wrote and revised and rewrote Slaughterhouse Five many times. That's believable. It's a pastiche. There is some science fiction, some satire of life in small town upstate New York, and several grueling accounts of naive Billy Pilgrim suffering exactly the kind of abuse and horror one would have suffered in the wake of the Battle of the Bulge, in which Billy didn't fight, only was captured.War itself is treated as anathema, an easy sell in 1969 as the Vietnam War raged on. Billy as the central character is useful in that he is a blank slate. Vonnegut's writerly skills are comedic, deadpan description of horror, and phrase-making. He can sum up disaster in a phrase or with an image.This isn't a book as manic as Catch-22, but it is of the same vintage and conveys the same message: Don't go this way...the way of war. And it isn't a book as bloody-minded as Mailer's first novel, The Naked and the Dead (which takes place in the Pacific). But it's a catchy kind of book, an anthem kind of book, a lament and a cri de coeur: no more war, war destroys people as well as kills them, after war, nothing is ever right again. The relative buoyancy of the 60s and Vonnegut's satirical temperament combine here to make this retrospective look at WWII both chastening and oddly hopeful. Gallows humor can have that effect....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jul 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five

It's rough, it's fairly crazy, the power that draws the two together is that of wanting to challenge conventions, social and personal, so this isn't a book with a happy ending. No passing encounter, Susan and Paul's affair doesn't occupy a month or two of a topsy-turvy summer; it extends for years, becoming a weight heavier than either of them can bear.Paul tells the story, so we can guess from the first pages that he will be the survivor. In fact, he makes no secret of it, but that doesn't let us in on exactly how turbulent and difficult this unusual relationship will prove to be.The backdrop to Susan and Paul's difficult bond is ""little England,"" I guess. The elements are a small-minded, relatively affluent town, where dismayed conformist parents, and an outraged, nasty spouse, pounce on lovers whose means are not well-matched to their means. Not even an escape to London is a true escape. Susan, in particular, has lived too long in ""little England"" and been too handicapped by it to break free. Tawdriness and bitterness ensues But again, there is Paul/Barnes laying everything out with rare control, precision and grace, and that's what paradoxically makes this novel not only readable but interesting.

Life doesn't listen well, and we often don't hear ourselves speaking eloquently about our difficulties until it is too late; they already have pulled us under. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 13, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35570812-the-only-story

Eventually I felt the wide net Lightman was casting coming together, aided by his good, clear writing and his periodic personal observations.The argument he advances here is that the only rational perspective to have on experience/existence is materialist. We begin and end as biological constellations of stardust, in many ways a wondrous reality. Like all but a few scientists, Lightman sees no other explanation. He takes us through the scientific process from the Greeks through Newton and Einstein to the present focused on the atom and its component parts and the universe/multiverse and its endless infinitiy--infinity in itself is impossible to calculate.We go back in time billions of years. We confront the mysteries of neurons in the brain as numerous as stars in the sky. Lightman makes a strong case that we ""know"" these things. No doubt we do even if most of us lacking a PhD in physics or neuroscience cannot really conceive of them, much less understand them. What do a billion years signify? How about a hundred billion years? I think you would have to do the calculations that ended up with such numbers for them to be meaningful.Without yielding his materialism, Lightman periodically makes a case for accepting the value of understanding it in quasi-humanistic terms. He says we know there are scant indicators of anything like humans on earth elsewhere, and he urges us to enjoy our specialness.Others have explored the same terrain as Lightman. I think of Edward O. Wilson's Consilience, focused on the unity of knowledge. What strikes me as curious is that scientists, so astounding in their insights, even bother to draw humanity, or religion, into their meditations. They seem to feel a bit guilty for debunking humanity's sense of primacy in a world that is not even humanity's world, just something humanity clings to as it spins faster and faster in a ceaselessly expanding universe that eventually will end in complete darkness.So much ultimately depends on meaning. Does humanity mean anything, or is all meaning really wrapped up in quantum physics and cosmology? Paradoxically, the numbers scientists churn up actually seem somewhat meaningless; they explore a region that Kant might have considered a category of thought that cannot be thought. Meaning, then, becomes a human term, something humanity can't quite shake, and we may be left with the proposition that ""meaning"" really only functions within the human context. Science may be agonizingly accurate in its judgments but effectively meaningless beyond the status of fact, a separate category altogether....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 13, 2021",not set,"Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54425528-probable-impossibilities

This creates a puzzle palace or labyrintheffect and reminds me of similar exercises by Don DeLillo, another New York writer, wherein the things and persons you are encountering can't really be what they appear to be.The tales of the Fergusons, our main characters, are pretty interesting but at the same time pretty conventional. Boys have parental problems, friend problems, sexual development and bonding problems, college problems, and then career problems. Auster's writing is lively and clear despite the confusion of eliding tales into tales and assigning different roles and outcomes to Ferguson's friends and lovers.This may sound trickier and more post-modern, or post-post-modern, than it is. An ethos wraps itself around all the Fergusons, whether they end up in London or Rochester, which is liberal, warm-hearted, unassuming, and, appropriate to the 60s (the book's key decade), communal in spirit. These are likable imaginings, soulmates. They tend to meld into one another not split apart.Having come of age, as it were, in the 1960s I would say Auster captures the spirit of the age well but may underplay the anxieties and desperations that afflicted many of us who were confronted with two paths (to be reductionist about it). Either we could make it into college and then leave college for careers in ""the establishment,"" i.e., get jobs, fashion careers, ignore the chaos of Vietnam, race relations, sexual revolutions, pharmaceutical and musical explosions, or we could understand ourselves as better fitted to not defining ourselves in conventional terms, thinking that we could subsist on petty cash from part-time or temporary jobs, and somehow hold onto the chaos at hand and make it an ongoing part of our identities. You wouldn't know it from this novel but these choices led a lot of people into some very dark and unfulfilling outcomes. There is a good amount of hurting in this novel, just not the kind of hurting that could feel crushing and compromising whether you chose to be conventional or countercultural.I get the feeling from some writers over recent decades that a decision has been made not to be too gloomy, it's bad for sales. I first noticed this in John Irving's work, though I sure didn't pick it up in Raymond Carver's.The best Ferguson seems to be the one who went to Paris, took hold of his bisexuality, and wrote a book that wowed publishers in London just before he died. Paris figures in more than one Ferguson destiny, and it plays a vivid role. Less vivid, I would say, are the characters who surround the Fergusons in this ""told not shown"" novel. They give themselves up and take stands but their interior lives are little explored.At a certain point I got better at recognizing that the text had shifted from one Ferguson to another, and which was which, but at later point I stopped caring and trying to keep track. Other readers might recognize little Auster vendettas as I recognized his war against Princeton, which he describes as occupying a central New Jersey marked by swamps and cranberry bogs. Neither Princeton nor central New Jersey are swampy, boggy places. To punish Princeton a bit more, Auster jolts us with the cold-hearted ouster of one of the Fergusons. Columbia is not described as occupying snowy cliffs in the mountains of Manhattan, so I take it that Auster regards it as a better place.

Harry is a Toyota salesman, Janice is back with him after her fling with Charlie, and there is poor Nelson, emotionally crippled by the events of the previous book, Rabbit Redux.I don't know how this book would fare if published now, both in its perspective on gender roles and in its appraisals of sex and sexuality. There is a lot of boorishness here, but there was a lot of boorishness back then. The overflow of the sexual revolution of the 60s had washed over the middle class, so it wasn't just kids transfixed by the opposite sex and doing something about it. Updike goes after sex pretty hard. It's one of his two major fascinations. The other is his love of describing road routes around Brewer and Mt. Judge and the houses and businesses lining them. Harry is passive here, not passive aggressive, just passive, an observer, not quick to act perhaps because he likes pondering action beforehand so much. The world continues to befuddle him, but he has enough money and status now that he is relatively unaffected.The real transactions take place through and around Nelson--questionable relationships, marriage, and pregnancy are center stage. Harry wants to advise him, but Nelson doesn't want to be advised. He's twenty or so, a man by his own estimation and pretty good at deceit and flight.What does Janice get out of this? Well, she gets what people get after a point: familiarity and its comforts, a sense of settledness with a little adventure on the side.

Sebald is just fine as far as it goes...or can go, given Sebald's elusive approach to literature. Having read a number of his books, I was curious as to what I would discover about the man. Not surprisingly, he was an elusive fellow as a person, too.For three decades he taught European literature in the U.K., having moved there because he could not bear living in a Germany where people simply did not discuss the Holocaust. They slipped past it, sidestepped it, didn't bring it up. And Sebold found that foul.Eventually he added writing to his occupation as a teacher and would assemble his works out of archival research, personal meditation, photo albums, and an affinity for the elegance of 19th century writers. One essayist in this collection, Michael Hoffman, found him to be a colossal, aimless bore. I tend to think Sebald might agree with him. A long time ago I knew a writer named Juan Benet in Spain. He said his novels were incredibly boring, and he was right. But Benet, like Sebold, was a highly esteemed literary man nonetheless.The other essayists fawn over Sebold. They adore the indeterminacy of his writing, the melancholy, the curious details and digressions, and his careful, unemotional style (except for the melancholy, of course.) What the devil were these books of his? he was asked. He said they were prose narratives, comprising fact, fiction, and very little in the way of narrative architecture, i.e., clear plots, rounded characters, a rise and fall in the action. Action? These essayists like the fact there is next to no action in a Sebald book, and no explanation for why the ""narrator"" wrote them. They are as formless as the printed page will allow them to be, but they are beguiling in their mystery.Sebold's ""subject"" in many ways is memory, a great theme of the last thirty years. Memory is what isn't documented, isn't wrangled into shape with ""meaning,"" what melts much like ice no matter how much sawdust you cover it in, and is, of course, elusive, a guess, often wrong. When Sebold is writing about Kafka, is he really writing about Kafka? I wouldn't think so. Is he ""borrowing"" Kafka? Sort of, but not to the extent that he is forced to deal with some unpleasant fact associated with Kafka. No, no, no, Sebold wants nothing to do with life barging into his books. On the other hand, he is just fine with Nabokov traipsing through one of his books no less than four times with no explanation why.I think the way Hoffman attacks Sebold works better than the other pieces that praise him, although I don't really agree with Hoffman. Essayists who praise Sebold are too cowed and mystified by him. They guess a lot. They often refer to Proust when they write about Sebold, primarily because of their common interest in the theme of memory. But Sebold has no interest in fascinating characters struggling for a footing in society. His narrator, unlike Proust's Marcel, is quite peripheral and much more neutral. And decisively, Marcel knows exactly what he means by memory. He has it by the tail. Sebold doesn't want that to happen, He would rather drop a black and white photo in the text and make you ask, What the hell is that doing there? If you are interested in Sebold, this is something you might like reading. If you are not interested, don't bother....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,May 2021,not set,"May 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/956145.The_Emergence_of_Memory

In a way, it is a tour de force, and in a way, being a tour de force limits it. Let me explain. Here we have a series of stories in which a character from one episode is central to another episode. Their connections are sometimes fraternal, sometimes through being neighbors, sometimes by pure accident or an answered ad in a newspaper. The setting is New York. The Trade Towers still stand. A man is going to cross the distance between them on a high wire. That's one episode (which is returned to). Among those watching him in awe is a judge, who hopes he will catch the case when the aerialist is brought before the law. The judge's wife meets with a group of mothers who lost sons in Vietnam. One of the mothers raises the daughter of a prostitute who dies in a car crash. The prostitute had been looked after by a kind of Catholic friar, who is Irish. He dies in the car crash, too. His brother, visiting from Ireland, participates in the prostitute's burial. While there he spots a woman who was in the car that caused the car crash. And so on...The writing is great, as I say. You won't want to skip this one if you haven't already read it, but I did find that no one is fully developed in the sense that each person is gone before a reader--this reader--has time to care,. Beyond that, McCann is philosophically attuned to the world ""spinning,"" as in going on and on despite a tragedy, a missed opportunity, a death. This has to do with the novel giving up one character as another character takes stage. There is almost a ""so it goes"" quality to the appearance of the next man or woman up, and the same thing pertains to elements within a single character study. One older prostitute has been beaten badly many times; this is reported; but there is no inquiry into her psychic scars. The reader--this reader--sees her from a middle distance, not close up.So this urban kaleidoscope tricks us into accepting a story full of coincidences that ultimately doesn't add up to much beyond the fact that coincidences are always happening in places like New York. I enjoyed the book, but tour de force works of art often sacrifice meaning for method. In my case, I ended up dazzled but disappointed.A novel to which Let the Great World Spin is sometimes compared is Bonfire of The Vanities by Tom Wolfe. I haven't read it in a long time, but my recollection is that the Wolfe novel has more bite. Greed is greed, shame is shame, vanity is vanity, factors in existence we can't spin away from because we brought them on ourselves and we have to live with them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 24, 2021","Apr 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

The series editor takes a spin through his thoughts on Gertrude Stein, which have little if nothing to do with the essays here, all of which are more readable than Getrude Stein's writing. The volume editor then indulges in unoriginal reflections on Machiavelli. Both editors tip their hats to Montaigne. Again, the relevance of Machiavelli and Montaigne is questionable. Of course they were great essayists, but the essays in this volume are marked not so much by greatness as by fulfilling a dictum offered by the volume editor: ""This, in the end, is why an essay is always personal."" And that means these are essays full of psychological intimacies, contemplation of illness and death, and the quirks of contemporary culture.One essayist writes entertainingly about his misadventures as a bartender. A second essayist reflects on recent experiences while driving. A third essayist reports on her impressions of an exhibition of Garry Winogrand's photographs. In each case--bartending, driving, and Winogrand--the topic at hand leads back to the person with the pen. Since these are interesting people who write well, that's not a flaw, it's a strength.One of the most provocative essays is a piece by Philip Weinstein called ""Soul-Error,"" which he defines as ""the comedy of the mind's altering relation to objects and others and events in time and space. Although this formulation is pretty abstract, not to say it is exceedingly vague, Weinstein gets at the uncanny sensation we often have of knowing one thing and yet believing another, or, as Kafka would have it, always finding ourselves in the antechamber of a greater reality, never certain that what is important in existence is within our grasp.Critic Peter Schjeldahl writes about his aimless, feckless but highly productive journey to cultural prominence in New York. These reflections are prompted by and wrapped around the sad fact of his lung cancer. My only problem with the essay is that it was published in the New Yorker in late 2019 and as far as I can discover, Schjeldahl may still be alive in April, 2021. I don't really want to learn otherwise, but if he's still kicking, he sure has gotten a lot of mileage of his reflections on mortality.A.O. Scott's essay, ""Under the Sign of Susan,"" about Susan Sontag inadvertently highlights one problem with the essay as a personal vehicle. The relationship of his fascination with the Sontag mystique is pretty thin stuff. By leaving A.O. Scott out of the piece, A.O.Scott might have strengthened it. Just a thought.And by the way, I don't think that the essay form is always, in the end, personal. They certainly can be, as these essays are, but there are innumerable great essays that skip the personal and focus on an idea, an event, a person, or an entire society. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 15, 2021","Apr 15, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48930314-the-best-american-essays-2020

It plumbs the depths of Lincoln's genius as a practical politician grounded in an unyielding commitment to what is good and moral in life. Kearns' spends a lot of time on Lincoln's development as a country lawyer that is well-justified in that the art of Lincoln's thought in the late, great phase of his life clearly depended on the canny thoroughness of his practice before judges and juries on the Illinois circuit he rode. Give him a great problem, be it a thorny issue or a prickly person, and he would argue it from all sides within himself before advancing his conclusion.Here we read about Lincoln managing his cabinet, the Civil War, relations between the races, and political divisions in the North. Beyond all that, we are given a close look at his complex and often painful family life. Until the night he was assassinated, Lincoln managed to stick to his principles and priorities.... and do so with great kindness and love. We also gain insight into Lincoln the literary genius, his grounding in Shakespeare and the Bible, his gift for speaking in ways that were often humorous, sometimes somber, always memorable.In many ways this is the story of a man who defined the United States, drawing not only on his understanding of the Founders' intent but his vision of a sustainable future. He didn't want the Civil War, the South did, but he understood he and his generals and advisors and soldiers must prevail in it as a way of proving two things: humanity can govern itself and humanity can never be based on the idea of one man owning another. He chose to emphasize self-governing and thereby saving the union of the states as his first justification for conducting a terrible and terrifying war. But this war largely was about slavery and to hold his team together Lincoln had to abolish it, enraging his adversaries in the south all the more but giving notice that when the secessionist states lost, they would lose slavery, too.There's a lot here about Lincoln's personal relations, and it's all fascinating: his relations with his secretaries of state and war, Seward and Stanton; his relations with Frederick Douglass, the leading black spokesman of the day; and his relations with his wife and sons. Essentially no one who got to know him continued to hold to the idea that he was a country bumpkin in a job too big for him. Virtually everyone left his presence convinced that he was intellectually and morally transcendent. There is a very good account here of Lincoln's difficulties with general who weren't, as the phrase goes, fighting generals, all pomp and no pistol. The subtle, determined and somewhat enigmatic Ulysses Grant is described convincingly. He and Lincoln understood one another perfectly. In very few words, they settled momentous issues, each leaving the other to do his part in ending the war.The theory of this book, really, is that mankind creates and disposes of history, or is disposed by it, depending on great leadership. There is no conceivable way the Civil War would have ended with the country reunited absent Lincoln's genius.For anyone interested in U.S. history, the U.S, in general, or political leadership in times of war, this is a must-read book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,"Mar 15, 2021not set","Mar 15, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals

In a tightly written narrative, he brings bubonic plague to Oran, a port city in Algeria and traces its devastation through early phases of denial and recklessness, middle phases of desperation and death, and a last phase in which some of his characters suffer the unjust fate of being the last persons killed in an all-but-concluded war.This is a tale of modest characters who rise to the plague's challenges or submit to them. The main protagonist, Dr Rieux, is neither hero (he won't permit himself to be seen as a hero) nor anti-hero. In a sense his comportment is determined for him by virtue of his Hippocratic Oath. He must treat the ill. But in another sense, he sees himself defined against the absurdity of a plague by virtue of the freedom to act as he thinks rational and morally right. What is absurd about a plague? Well, why does a plague appear and why does it disappear? Why does it kill some and spare others? How does it work its misdeeds? Morality and rationality would want to offer specific answers to these questions, but that's impossible. Plagues transcend good and evil, and they stump reason. So in this novel, there is a choice, not an answer, a choice that is internal to everyone, not derived from God or logic. The plague in itself does not matter. What matters is what one chooses to do in response. Only by a good choice can someone die in peace or survive without shame.Camus would have us understand this message, a species of humanistic existentialism that he does not overdraw or over-preach. He is a philosopher only so far. His view is that when the irrational and amoral impact life, that's when human behavior settles the score, whether in victory or defeat.There are interesting, quirky characters spread throughout this novel, a number of whom succumb to denial or cynical opportunism. Rieux does't judge them so much as offer them up for judgment, or perhaps simply for a reader's intuitive response. The silliest among these characters are doing their best or worse. There's attempted suicide, valor, fatalism, and dangerous self-regard with a bit of insanity sprinkled in.No one likes anything about this plague or the authorities' attempts to combat it. Most people would rather not hear about it or read about it until it afflicts them or their children. Some people grow weary of trying to outwit it, others seem indefatigable in their resistance.Speaking of resistance, I read this novel in light of World War II, a senseless, savage plague fueled by bullets, not bacilli. The Plague can be understood as an analysis of any great effort to survive. In today's world, corona virus is the source of one kind of plague, but one could argue that social injustice is also a plague and climate change, too. Camus would submit that the key in all human struggle is recognizing the threats to general welfare and happiness and then taking corrective action or hoping it is others who die....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 19, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11989.The_Plague

As a musicologist, musician and journalist, Palmer does a wonderful job of connecting the blues' fascinating roots in African music through Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House, Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King and dozens of other not-so-well known bluesmen. These were singers, songwriters, guitar, harmonica, and piano players who found their way out of unheated shacks on the Dockery and other plantations and participated in the great migration of southern Blacks up north through St. Louis to Chicago, Detroit and ultimately, both coasts--New York and L..A.--and Europe and Asia as well.As a music critic--a pair of ears connected to fabulous gifts as a writer--Palmer captures the essence of one blues great after another. He describes all the sounds: the aching, the sorrowing, the preening, the preaching, the dancing, the thundering. And he lodges those sounds in a great piece of Black America cultural history, telling us exactly how the blues spread from Saturday night juke joints to big stages in big auditoriums and stadiums, drawing huge audiences of Whites.One fascinating aspect of this tale is how generous blues musicians were with one another. Sure, there were rivalries and jealousies, but in the main, the blues were handed along, one generation to another, with great care. At each step the ""deep blues,"" that which most sounds like the blues' Delta origins, inevitably were modified according to the next generation's particular gifts, sense of audience, and technology. The electric guitar made a big difference in the blues' sound, so did gospel music, and so did, with the blues' success, the impact of being able to assemble larger blues bands in contrast to earlier solo or duo street corner acts.It's an old and often-told story, but the blues' impact on British musicians from the Stones to the Yardbirds and beyond remains intriguing. The Mississippi Delta to Liverpool and Birmingham is a long throw. The fun of this book lies in the unbroken stream of anecdotes flowing from the early 20th century to the 1970s. There were great successes and tragedies, there was a lot of drinking and sleeping wherever the floor was flat, there were night rides on dark roads with the police in pursuit, there were radio shows promoting flour, there was an endless stream of blues' promoters from the Chess brothers to Sam Phillips. Palmer does a fantastic job of pinning down the whereabouts and fates of scores of blues musicians--who played in Helena, Arkansas, and what it was like when Howlin' Wolf stalked the stage. He addresses everyone's story with care and respect. A very fine book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/269359.Deep_Blues

Baker, who for a dozen years absolutely did play a major role in Washington; whether he ran Washington is another matter, but the hyperbole of the title does no harm to the story that follows.Baker was born into a significant Houston family that weathered the Great Depression with no problem, and he received a good education at The Hill School, Princeton, and the University of Texas Law School. He was marked for success as the family's scion and did not disappoint, making an excellent living as a corporate lawyer.His life turned toward politics when he became fast friends with the politically ambitious George H.W. Bush, a New England transplant. Partly through Baker's work, Bush became Vice President and then President of the United States. And greatly through his own work, Baker became Reagan's first chief of staff and Treasury Secretary, followed by his appointment as Secretary of State under Bush's presidency.Deal-making became Baker's most notable skill as he handled critical details of the Reagan presidency and then managed foreign affairs for Bush. But his self-confidence and self-discipline were notable, too. He stayed on message and on task, focused on achievable goals, and exhibited incredible tenacity as he pushed through major tax reform, rebalanced the world's currencies, played a major role in the end of the Cold War and unification of Germany, helped Bush succeed in the Gulf War and, some years later, ensured that Bush's son, George W., won the 2000 presidential election by avoiding a recount.If you have long followed Washington political reporting, you will find that Peter Baker (no relation) and Susan Glasser have summarized but deepened the Baker story. This is a highly readable book that goes inside episodes involving Reagan, Gorbachev, Shamir, Cheney, Bush father and son, and a long list of world leaders. There are interesting details here, particularly regarding unified Germany's membership in NATO, but also reflecting the constant, constant political infighting and diplomatic tension that Baker dealt with when he held high office.Baker was much more sensitive and cautious than many, including me, would have thought. The guy radiated authority in speech, action, and presence. But he was dogged by a fear of being tagged as a political fixer (for Reagan and Bush) and losing a smidgeon of his honor as a man of his word. Baker was a proud man driven by pride. It's arguable that he ducked out when certain projects went awry, letting others shoulder the blame, but it's unreasonable to expect full success whenever and wherever Baker was involved. There may be a world beyond this one, but Baker's world was as high level and high stakes as you can get on planet earth.Ultimately people always wanted to know how one man could be so talented, keeping his focus and managing the risks he took (or were forced upon him). I'm not sure a book written in the register of excellent journalistic reporting can answer that question. Such books are long on events and the facts embedded in them but seldom on decoding the private enigmas of high-wire politicians and statesmen. How did Baker enter into politics so successfully when in is forties? To what degree did he not only place his interests above those of his rivals but also his family? There are inferences and anecdotes here that take on these questions without getting at anything that is fully persuasive. It wasn't just connections and luck, good breeding and auspicious historical moments. Something more important was in play, I think--an uncanny ability to discriminate among the important, the more important and the most important. For Baker, the most important was all that really mattered.

Somewhat to my surprise I found that it isn't as stilted and pretentious as I remembered. In fact, with the exception of pretty love talk between Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley, the protagonists, A Farewell to Arms is a highly readable, well-balanced, and superbly written novel. Hemingway has a fine touch with the variety of Italians Henry encounters during his time as an ambulance driver in World War I. He offers lengthy descriptions of landscapes, military positions, and weather that border on maddening but in the end are highly illuminating. The dialogue that doesn't involve Catherine and Frederic is witty, acerbic, and punchy. And there is a masterful pace to this book, both in the sentences and chapters, easy to keep up with and appreciate.This is a story about war and love. The war is brutal and awkward and confusing. The love is somewhat instantaneous but plausible. In combination, these themes end up giving the reader Virgil's truth: ""There are tears in things and all things doomed to die touch the heart.""A Farewell to Arms is a sad, sobering book of good length and yet lean.Hemingway's lean short stories remain his best work in my view, however.

He quotes Schopenhauer and glosses him. Everything boils down to a few clauses: ""...when, finally, the object has freed itself from relation to something else; and the subject has freed itself from any relation to the will; then, what is known is no longer the particular thing, but the Idea, the eternal form, the immediate objecthood of the will at this level...""These observations, or conjectures, are the basis of Schopenhauer's response to Kant. They lead in the direction of the subject--you--and the object--it--merging into an avenue of contemplation that transcends the categories and enables the subject to make the great metaphysical leap of knowing the unknowable, delivered from the will, pain, and time.Houellebecq liked these notions when he first encountered them and understood Schopenhauer's proposition that the arts are the media through which such freedom from self and will is likely to occur. Mozart becomes the music, Shakespeare becomes the poetry, and so forth, because the artist sometimes is able to lose himself entirely in his or her work and encounter the uncluttered essence of that which he or she seeks in all its limpid purity.The pessimist Schopenhauer offered us this one pathway to the transcendent, but the fact that Schopenhauer was the first Western philosopher to read Eastern philosophy seriously also prompts us to consider that a non-artist deep in meditation may have an experience in some way related to freedom from the will, pain, and time. Further, we might also ask ourselves if the great tradition of idealism is not linked to the flooding wholeness of something we all possess: a right brain. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 10, 2021",not set,"Jan 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53531357-in-the-presence-of-schopenhauer

Further, she helps you read the different functions of the eyes in interpersonal relations and uses these insights to advance her proven ideas about recovering a visual life and energy that most of us cease to develop at age 7 or 8, when we stop advancing beyond crude, symbolic drawing.Edwards' plea remains that we make more use of our ""right brain,"" the part of the brain that gives us pathways into the arts, the intuitions, and, I would say, both useful sources of intelligence and a greater sense of personal happiness and fulfillment.Today's world is definitely a left-brain world--verbal, analytic, systematic, and logical.

His premise is that the rise of liberal democracy in In seven essays Carl Schorske brings Vienna through the Fin-de-Siecle to the eve of World War I. His premise is that the rise of liberal democracy in evolving Austria-Hungary brought with it the seeds of its own destruction. Once the aristocracy withdrew to reigning, not ruling, the liberal democrats found themselves yearning to be the new aristocrats (ex: the majestic pretensions of Vienna's Ringstrasse) ushering in a new age of modernism only to find themselves swarmed by socialists, Christian socialists, anti-semites, and subjugated nationalities craving their own statehood.The key to Shorske's analysis is that this late 19th century period opened the door to what he calls the psychological man, a sea of subjectivity unto himself, as opposed to nobles, who knew their place, or the haut bourgoisie, who knew what they wished to be their place. At one and the same time revolutions erupted in demagoguery, literature, the fine arts, and music. Society ceased to cohere; structures of stability crumbled; the guiding light of morality was set aside for aesthetic and egoistic reasons; passions positive and negative were released.These are beautifully written essays that come together quite naturally as a substantial book and peak at the end with an amazing study of Kokoschka, the artist, and Schoenberg, the composer. By their time, none of the conventional restraints pertained. Eros and death had done away with the remnants of social realism and neoclassicism. The ""society"" that did still exist, albeit hollowed out, was baffled and offended by having achieved, as it were, the brutal paintings of Kokoschka and the almost incomprehensible music of Schoenberg.A brief essay on Freud, in the middle of the book, aptly sums up the proceedings, trending toward cultural and political patricide.The fact that there isn't an essay on Robert Musil, the novelist, is disappointing but perhaps confirms the fact that no one--if not even Carl Schorske--has read The Man without Qualities to the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 28, 2020","Jan 03, 2021","Dec 28, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19199541-fin-de-siecle-vienna

In this book, he presents and analyzes twenty-seven of those sentences written by George Eliot, Roland Barthes, Charlotte Bronte, Joan Didion, etc. He says that these are his favorite sentences, not that they possess some kind of canonical standing. You might offer twenty-seven sentences you've loved. But if you wanted to do something with your love, you would have to explain their value with something like Dillon's brilliance, and even if you did, you would, like Dillon, find that your audience was narrow. Literature this carefully wrought doesn't seem to possess much standing in the 21st century. There are enough of us who care about it not to worry that literature is dead, but it has become a minor art. And yet someone like Dillon is able to track all the nuances of a John Donne or Thomas Browne sentence and persuade his readers that these words possess an intricate power, beauty, and significance. The truth is that sentences like the ones Dillon praises are able to supplant a reader's consciousness fully, induce a reader to not only think but feel that she has been transported to a better world.I ""liked"" the pieces focusing on Donne, George Eliot, Elizabeth Hardwick, Joan Didion, and Janet Malcolm in particular. I didn't care for the piece on Roland Barthes; this is ironic, given that Barthes has been Dillon's lifelong literary inspiration.The problem with a focus on individual sentences is, of course, the degree to which any sentence depends on the sentences that precede and follow it. There are sentences here that are as long as paragraphs, so they answer this need by themselves. Other sentences sometimes come across as measly things until Dillon has had his say about them and their authors.If you happen to write, you will find Dillon's observations on the uses of the comma, the colon, and the dash of particular interest. His readings are acute; they are very close to the readings a poet would hope to receive. Most people, even avid readers, don't write, so most people might be less enthusiastic about Dillon's smaller-scale observations.The writers whose sentences are not present in Dillon's book that one might expect to encounter would include almost any good to great writer.

These diaries are fascinating for their revelations, indications of the breadth of Kafka's talent and thought and honesty, but perhaps most of all for the view they offer of an artist in a semi-permanant state of major clinical depression.Set against Kafka's almost spare fictional fables, so splendidly true to their fundamental narrative concepts, never straying into unnecessary detail or ambivalence in their propositions of pain, horror, and existential frustration, his diaries reveal a writer who captured and recorded everything as he lived in his life--the shade of green of a woman's hat to the cheeriness of a little girl's smile to the morbid reflections of a stymied writer on the edge of self-destruction.Here we have more or less exactly the unhappy Kafka one would imagine him to be if we only knew his stories and novels...and yet we also glimpse traces of the artist who, once he had found the key to a story, unlocked all its doors with ease. As the diaries reveal, the problem for him as a person was that often he couldn't write or just as often he would begin a story with a sketch in his diary, beautifully written and promising, that he would abandon. The diaries are littered with his efforts to get something going and losing faith.This, if it needs to be said, is typical of the experiences of most writers, if not all writers. Something whispers in your ear, you write a few pages, it disintegrates, won't go anywhere, can't go anywhere, was a bad idea.Kafka may be the best example of a writer who wrote so close to his unconscious, his dreamworld, that he always was in danger of waking up before he got to the end of telling the tale.We can see here that Kafka was at least three persons: 1) a very smart and well-educated individual with a fine sense of irony and a goodly array of social and artistic contacts; 3) a horribly self-doubting, shy, angry man who suffered headaches, insomnia, stomach problems and a general sense of malaise; 3) a writer who, when he was in firm contact with his vision of a story, could render the complexities of his psycho-social world as compactly and powerfully as anyone.Add to the three points above Kafka's difficulties with relationships, notably with his overbearing father but perhaps more importantly with women. He was twice engaged to marry Felice Bauer, convinced that despite his negative first impression, she would provide him with a stable, comforting home life and yet, at the same time, fully aware that he didn't really connect with her and she didn't really connect with him. The diary entries about Felice are perplexing because they never really make clear why they were engaged in the first place.The diaries also reflect the degree to which Kafka was concerned with his Jewishness and with Judaism in Europe and Palestine (Zionism). One might think that an artist of Kafka's other-worldly caliber would be above ethnicity or religion. His fictions can be read as transcendent crises applicable to almost any modern individual, but he was attentive--could not be otherwise--to his social and religious context. Kafka's parables speak to the loneliness of a Jew in Prague while at the same time spotlighting the loneliness--the alienation--of everyone in Europe in the 20th century when almost all the traditional structures of state and economic and cultural power were disintegrating. When you read these diaries, you do have to wonder if modern therapies and pharmaceuticals could alleviate the agonies of a Kafka without at the same time destroying his literary genius. I tend to think that someone like him could be interrupted in his depressions and neuroses but not stabilized, that he would find a way to outwit feeling better. The forces at work in this man were physical, psychological and literary and they also were social and political--broadly speaking, cultural--and he knew this. Only Kafka could resolve his conflicts, and only Kafka, during the moments when he was able to unburden himself in a story, could bring Kafka brief, too brief, spells of peace. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 24, 2020",not set,"Dec 24, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17686.Diaries_1910_1923

The notion that verbal and logical-mathematical capability covered the meaning of intelligence made no sense to me in the 1980s and makes no sense to me now.Gardner's addition of musical, spatial, kinesthetic, and personal intelligences is well-supported in this book. In fact, the book is somewhat misleading. At first glance, it would appear to be a popularization of a theory. Not so. There is plenty of serious social science ihere as well as lots of fascinating commentary on outstanding examples of each of the intelligences he advances.Sadly, though, Gardner reports on, rather than challenges, the undervaluation of intelligence capabilities that can be traced to what is generically referred to as the ""right brain."" There is little here that would strongly defend music education in schools, for example, or arts education, even if musical and artistic gifts are given their due as important dimensions of human experience and intelligence.Gardner points out that concepts of intelligence are culture-bound without fully confronting the perversities of cultures themselves. We all know that U.S. priorities in assessing and advancing intelligence are designed to further economic interests. What we don't know is that by undervaluing artistic education and expression we are beggaring ourselves as a society. The same may even be said with respect to vocational education and the social status and recognition we afford to plumbers, masons, and mechanics. In Germany a tradesman is a professional. In the U.S. there is a tendency to regard a tradesman as someone who couldn't do anything else.Gardner makes clear that culture can and does distort the significance of human intelligences.

Is a man white or black or both? Is a defrocked preacher a lunatic or a philosopher? Is a woman chasing after the man who impregnated her simpleminded or cunning? Is there any way to outrun the past, the Civil War, or the gulf of misunderstanding between the north and the south?The characters in Light in August are almost all obsessed with something, driven, full of outrage, and yet they possess a singularity of action and reflection that transcends monomaniacal flatness.Much of what gives Faulkner's work its power is the failure of romanticism to clear the hurdles of reality. Light in August portrays a society riven by racial divides, gender divides, and socio-political divides. There is glory in life...but it is a feature of the past, a memory, a desperate wish.Joe Christmas, suspicious of his own genes, is killed being taken from the jail to the courthouse. Gail Hightower, the defrocked preacher, seems to die when he finally assembles a montage of the key faces that have pushed his life into the shape it has taken. Byron Bunch takes forever to realize that he isn't going to grab hold of a woman impregnated by a runaway lover until she loses not her zest for the lover but for wandering around and having a good look at life.The scenes, atmospheres, and language of this novel are compact and yet over-the-top. There are marvelous excursions into the abstract, word portraits of time flapping in the wind like a flag not long for its flagpole. Throughout Faulkner keeps small town Mississippi society engaged as a chorus and virtual God. What the central characters don't seem to realize is that they aren't going to permitted to live out their obsessions, that they will be struck down, that grandeur and passion and violent emotions are unwelcome, illegal, destined for shipwreck.Faulkner, a man of the south who lived a life keenly attuned to the south's divisions and tensions, couldn't publish this novel now with expectations of success. But he wrote in a different time and place, and his genius for mining that time and place make reading him still relevant. Light in August is Faulkner in full stride, much more accessible than Absolom, Absolom and The Sound and The Fury.One of the truly great and daring statements in Light in August captures Faulkner's aesthetic and, I would say, moral commitment. “Memory believes before knowing remembers. Believes longer than recollects, longer than knowing even wonders.” There's a world of human psychology in those two sentences. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2020","Nov 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10979.Light_in_August

Iain McGilchrist devotes the first part of the book to examining the research that has documented two different roles played by the left and right hemisphere; this examination is grounded in empirical science that is both sophisticated and on occasion serendipitous. He then spends the latter part of the book examining how western civilization has privileged the subordinate left hemisphere over the naturally dominant (and larger) right hemisphere...to the detriment of western civilization and the planet.I have been intrigued by left brain/ right brain issues for almost fifty years and won't go into the details. What's important is the functional differences McGilchrist and others find in the two hemispheres.The right brain is holistic, ""open-minded,"" (i.e., susceptible to respecting the ""other,"" which includes nature), and better at all things we think of as artistic. The left brain is judgmental, prefers working in fragments, strong in categorization, and a kind of computational receptacle for the flood of perceptions cast its way by the right brain.Yes, I'm being reductionist here, but I don't want to rewrite the whole magnificent book. To become even more reductionist, think of the right brain in terms of curved lines and the left brain in terms of straight lines (and then point out all the straight lines that occur in nature). Or think of the left brain strong in pushing particulars into generalizations and the right brain happy in dwelling on the particularities of particulars. And think of the left brain strong on fear, apt to reject inconvenient intrusions. And the right brain not so timid, and perhaps a good deal more vulnerable.Having spent a few hundred pages on brain research, McGilchrist devotes a few hundred pages more to tracing the left brain's creeping dominance over the right brain from Plato to the present. His breadth of knowledge is astonishing; so is his gift for coming up with citations that are supportive of his argument. He is at ease with Rousseau, Wordsworth, Heraclitus, Luther, Blake, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and dozens of others who rank as major forces in western thought and art.What one sees from the ""Age of Reason"" through industrialization to the Digital age is a pronounced tendency to corral reality and give it structural efficiency at the expense of reality's diversity, orneriness, and beauty. This is a process Weber called disenchantment. It also is a process that leads most of us to lose track of the wonder we felt as children As McGilchrist points out, a majority of us were happier at work in the 1950s than we are now, even if we are not as productive as we are nowworking for Amazon or Microsoft. We tend to follow economic leads, not common sense. The environment--who can challenge this?--consequently has been massively trashed. We have polluted earth, sky, and sea. The imperative for the left brain is functioning in a ""logical"" way; it is not functioning in a way that is more pleasing but less susceptible to metrics, measurement, and profit margins.Deep within McGilchrist's analysis lies the contention that the left brain operates in terms of representation. That's what the words you now are reading are: representations. They don't resemble McGilchrist or filthy smokestacks or dandelions. Plato's eternal forms obviously are representations, not realities, but the left brain likes that, and naturally the left brain agrees with Plato that music and the arts need to be watched carefully so that they don't distract us into meaningful but unproductive pleasures.Meanwhile, the right brain tends to shrink, loses its talent for guiding us toward greater sensuous satisfaction in being alive , and we become more easily regimented. Who doesn't think STEM education is more important than the arts and humanities? Fewer and fewer of us.The greatest of artists and thinkers, Leonardo or Einstein, have been able to draw on both sides of the brain as their needs required. No artist, McGilchrist contends, is more gifted at developing work that is relentlessly fascinating because it is relentlessly particular than Shakespeare. Think Falstaff, think Hamlet. There are no models for such figures, full of contradictions, flaws, and magnificence.McGilchrist's reading of Wordsworth is quite compelling; he seems to understand exactly what Wordsworth was attempting.McGilchrist's dismissal of Descartes is hilarious. We know that Descartes' theory contends we can know nothing beyond the representations in our mind. Descartes, on looking out a window at the street, could not be sure about the people and carriages passing by. To this Sam Johnson replied that he knew a stone was real because he could kick it...and not give himself a headache.The joyless, geometric, flatness and abstraction of painting in the west for almost half a century impels us to stare at it long enough until our left brain's come up with a rationalization underpinning its beauty. Artists and writers and composers all have fallen into the trap of trying to outdo the left brain on its own terms. The left brain is about itself. The right brain catches onto things that aren't the self and celebrates them. But science has been so extraordinary that the arts and letters have tied themselves in knots seeking to compete, left brain to left brain, neglecting the joys of the right brain.Well, this is all nonsense, your left brain might tell you. Listen to me, it might say. The one sure way to underscore the power of the right brain, it seems to me, is curiously absent from McGilchrist's book. I'm thinking about dreams. He says very briefly that dreams are associated with the right brain. He does not go on to make the point that while the left brain is sleeping, the right brain generates images and actions and scenarios that are more dazzling than any movie ever made. I think you know what I mean without having visited my dreams because I'm sure you have had equally powerful dreams yourself. Do they make sense? Not always, maybe not even often.

In itself beautifThis extraordinary study of Flaubert, an idol of Mario Vargas Llosa, could serve as the text for every writing program in the world. In itself beautifully written, it also teases out of Flaubert's work and beliefs a powerful definition of fiction at its best.The famous phrase, le mot juste (the right or perfect or exact word), severely understates Flaubert's concept of producing a complete novel whose strength lies in its subtle management of time frames and points of view, and its emphasis on the concrete and exact not only word by word but scene by scene, with minimal authorial intrusion.Vargas Llosa's Spanish can't be much better than this translation into English. In either case, he puts his finger on scenes and their suggestiveness with interpretive force that is buttressed by fascinating excerpts from Flaubert's letters.In effect, Flaubert built Madame Bovary as much as wrote it. He had just undergone a bitter experience with a previous novel--his closest friends rejected it before it was published--and set about creating a work that is both romantic (his tendency and perhaps flaw) and anti-romantic (the result of his dim view of humanity), not too much the one, not too much the other.A hermit and a grouch, Flaubert's example isn't for everyone. Few would have the patience and tenacity to sustain a literary project so completely thought through, so independent of rhythms of inspiration, that nonetheless conveys the almost physical quality of what Vargas Llosa highlights as fictional reality (versus real reality).Entering the fray on multiple occasions, Vargas Llosa shares his own perspectives on the role of fiction in the 19th and 20th centuries.

That's narrative ring theory as Mendelsohn presents it. So I would say that Mendelsohn uses his subjects as markers around which he skates in three circles, ending up about where he began, which is a neat trick, aesthetically, but leaves us, or me, wanting more meaning and less method. His range of literary and cultural reference is exceptional; his compositional style, however, seems to place his subjects under a bell jar.

Manic Moses Herzog, driven out of his second marriage and separated from his kids, wanders about composing letters to famous wise persons, alive and dead, running short on cash, getting himself arrested, and plotting some kind of revenge if not on his second ex-wife, then on the irrational world into which he was born. Bellow's prose explodes here just as it did in Augie March. It's comic, fast, surprising and often touching. Herzog is a good man who has had a breakdown. He has quit his last teaching post, he has abandoned his next book, and he is afraid of friends, brothers and lovers. The book warrants being called anti-intellectual because Herzog's range of learned reference is enormous, but it consistently makes no sense. Every line of thought is a cul de sac. The only thing that can rescue Herzog, ultimately, is accepting the simple mysteries of life while abandoning the grudges that have driven him out of his mind.Fifty years ago I suppose I thought there might be something to Herzog's mental irruptions. God forbid in the ensuing years any graduate student has tried to take them seriously. Bellow knows the ins and outs of ""higher mental life"" and enjoys satirizing it; he also was furious at his second ex-wife and the ex-friend who took up with her, so they are satirized, too. Bellow's great strength, beyond his wild prose, is characterization. Herzog has all kinds of encounters with cynics, woe-be-gones, sex experts, sharpies, and even a few criminals. They live and dance on the page.In the final passages of the novel, Bellow also finds a way to put poor Herzog to bed, figuratively, by quieting him, giving him some peace, and yet not resolving the many, many problems he has yet to resolve in his life.

A shIn Runaway, 2004, Alice Munro once again demonstrates her mastery of the long short story, which of course is an oxymoron, but there you have it. A short story that runs over 10,000 words is ""long,"" and a long short story that moves back and forth through time and setting, which is Munro's style of short story, is a tricky thing to pull off.Munro's stories here and elsewhere possess what many call ""novelistic' characteristics. I would agree. The first and best story in this collection, the title tale,""Runaway,"" artfully moves from a present moment, when the main character sees her opportunity to change her life, back to the reasons she wants to change her life, back to her first experience running away into her current problems, and through her failed attempt to seize her opportunity this time. That's a lot of moving pieces.Munro's prose is clear, graceful, full of insight into human nature, and a beautiful backboard off which to bounce the ironies of her plots.These stories do have plots. That's another difference between short stories and long short stories.Short stories don't have to have plots. They frequently cling to a moment that leads to a revelation or swift resolution of underlying tensions.Typically, Munro writes about young women or women who once were young who are loosely tethered to their communities, their marriages, sometimes to their parents. One story in this collection, ""Chance,"" aptly reveals one of her favored plot mechanisms: plausible coincidence or confusion, ""chance"" encounters freighted with irony and, often, sadness. These female characters have longings and desires, but they also have principles and integrity. Integrity and desire often collide. Once this happens, many writers would leave the scene of the accident. Munro has the gift of going on and telling ""what happened"" later on in a character's life. Again, this is novelistic--in a short story Munro manages to convey a whole life.The last story in the collection, ""Powers,"" is an odd, sweeping tale that begins as a diary, turns epistolary, and then comprises a series of follow-on vignettes, each relevant to the story's established preoccupations, per the diary and the letters. I can't think of any other story that is so dismissive of form. The ultimate success of the story lies in breaking into the dream life of the diarist and telling us what is ""really"" happening even as ""reality"" sketches a different picture.I like the care and respect Munro shows her characters. On occasion, I wish she had more social and emotional range, but that is very much like saying the same thing about Jane Austen. It is precisely the sure grasp of her social and emotional range that is Munro's greatest strength. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Sep 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14280.Runaway

The chapters unfold like short stories and end with piquancy. The writing is straightforward, not mannered but definitely Hemingwayesque. Paris itself is endlessly charming, of course, and it is fully lived by Hemingway, his first wife, and their child, even in near-poverty. The portraits of Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and others are detailed and believable. Whether they are ""true"" or not is another story. Memory plays tricks on us all, of course, and one has to wonder how Hemingway would remember having a particularly wonderful white wine for dinner forty years after the fact. That being the case, perhaps some of his portraiture of personalities is invented, too. He makes the point in a brief comment at the beginning of the book that there might be some fiction involved, but is that harmful? I rather think almost all memoirs are close to fiction...very close. There has long been some controversy about Hemingway's chapters focused on Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda. Some have said he is unfair and mean toward Fitzgerald and contributes to a long-standing account of Zelda that undermines her better qualities and gifts. As far as Fitzgerald is concerned, I think the portrayal of an early-stage acoholic struggling within a very difficult marriage is pretty accurate. Certainly Hemingway is generous toward much of Fitzgerald's writing, particularly The Great Gatsby. Zelda isn't really fleshed out in this book. There are some jibes and criticisms, she is blamed for getting in Fitzgerald's way as a writer, but her perspective on her own life is absent. Basically, Hemingway is not interested in Zelda.The final chapter is a sad one. Here and elsewhere Hemingway criticizes himself. In the final chapter, the painful criticism has to do with him wrecking his first marriage. So however mean Hemingway can be to others, he's very tough on himself.

Traditional philosophy has a strong tendency to advance by looking backward, marking progress by building on--or breaking with-- previous philosophical insights. In Western philosophy, this tendency generally leads back to Plato. Without overlooking traditional philosophical antecedents, pragmatism in Rorty's view defines its meaning by looking forward, to the future, not the past, to outcomes, not precedents. Another primary feature of pragmatism is that it is not ""system"" oriented. It does not attempt to achieve an inclusive worldview, an explanation of everything. It is not ideological. It is open rather than closed. It is more an exercise in philosophical investigation than conclusion. Rorty emphasizes that pragmatism departs from the Platonic thesis that existence is an experience in dualism, i.e., the world in which we live and the world of the forms, or, in Christian terms, this world and God's world. Pragmatism eschews metaphysics. It does not reserve for itself a reference to something higher, deeper, more perfect, a north star of thought or belief.Rorty's pragmatism is one of human beings settling on goals--however each human being may define that goal--and then exploring ways to achieve it. Christians and atheists, for example, could agree on the desirability of eliminating poverty. The question would be how to do that. So far, of course, no one has come up with an answer, and Christianity does have a handicap, asserting both that the poor will always be with us and maintaining that holiness (or wholeness) lies in heaven anyway.Politically, Rorty was a social democrat. He strongly favored unions. But he also tended to believe that advancing projects of social importance does not also imply scorn for patriotism. Why? For the practical reason that pride in country can be a motivational and instrumental factor in achieving social progress. He argues that in overlooking the bloody battles that the union movement fought to achieve fair wages and worker protections--and it's true, union history has become a minor element in the national narrative--Americans overlook some of their greatest heroes.By rejecting ""essentialism,"" the notion that a higher truth lies out there somewhere...beyond our grasp or ken...pragmatism probably limits its reach in one essential way: it has no frame, neither a great beginning nor an ideal end. It is a philosophy without a story because it is open-ended. Things don't ""turn out"" one way or another. Pragmatism is a philosophy that is inherently social, not the work of one genius, rather the ongoing agenda of entire societies....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Sep 2020,"Sep 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/86099.Philosophy_and_Social_Hope

Well, now it is 2020, so I thoughToward the End of Time is a novel John Updike wrote in 1997 forecasting what life in the U.S. would be like in 2020. Well, now it is 2020, so I thought the book would be worth reading. It definitely was, though with qualifications.Updike's U.S. in 2020 has just gone through a war with China that China apparently won, while losing many more millions of citizens. For its part, the U.S. is no longer a functioning country. States (in this case Massachusetts) are on their own, issuing their own currency and relying on FedEx to provide not only mail service but security services. Our protagonist, Ben, 67, is a retired financial executive living on the Massachusetts coast with his second wife in her family house. He is beset with the problem of stray kids intruding on his property along with deer that eat his wife's flowers. He has accessible grandchildren who make little sense to him. And he decides the best thing to do is keep a journal--not dated, but regular--about the incidents of his life.This novel consists of three dimensions. The first is Ben and his activities, sometimes imagined. The second is the dystopian surrounding. The third is the cycle of nature, ranging from flowers to cosmic birth and death.Updike gives Ben a range of sexual opportunities, some successful, others not, and leads him into a prostate operation that impairs his ability to keep his wife interested. To the contrary, he perceives her becoming quite nice to him, expecting that he will die soon enough, and looking forward to her life in her 70s not encumbered with the nuisance of a man in the house.Updike also uses the wife to stir up potential rivals who emerge from the rubble of war. These are slim pickings, to be sure, but in general life itself has become slim pickings.As for nature, Updike indulges in extraordinary descriptions of Ben's wife's garden, naming every conceivable flower and its appearance, and tying these plants to the passage of time from spring to the following winter. He then goes on to meditating on the sky, the galaxy, and so forth, displaying considerable erudition...erudition that effectively cancels out the importance of life on earth. I have misgivings about this aspect of the book since it goes on too long, just as Melville's cetology in Moby-Dick goes on too long.If we need to read about flowers, I would prefer doing so as Lawrence dealt with them in Sons and Lovers or in some of the novels of Wallace Stegner. In other words, let's weave them into the narrative flow a bit better with finer counterpoints to the main character's psychology.For vivid prose, however, bearing garlands of facts and human insight, Updike displays his customary mastery. At one point he drops into the persona of a monk on the Skellig islands--don't ask me to explain how this happens--in the early middle ages. At another point he is tussling with Saints Peter and Paul. This is impressive writing. When critics and commentators focus on Updike's ""style,"" they seem to focus on the energies of the language, but I don't think language is necessarily the secret ingredient. More to the point, Updike wrote out of an abundance of sheer knowledge. This can break language's bonds and make it much more compelling than mere matters of rare vocabulary, artful syntax, and even lively rhythm. He was (sadly he's gone) a very intelligent, intellectually curious man.Well, Toward the End of Time was never going to end well, was it?

Here are some of the highlights in termsIn a sense, Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton is a biography of an era, which is all to the good. Here are some of the highlights in terms of characters and issues:--Washington comes across clearly as someone not eager to become a hero or an icon--exactly the kind of personality that works best for heroes and icons. He was unbreakable, tough, thorough, and resilient in terms of fighting not only the British but also his army's political masters, who never provided him with enough matériel and money in sufficient quantities and on time. In this book, his mentorship of Hamilton is highlighted; it's clear that Chernow is right. Hamilton needed Washington to restrain and guide him both as an officer in the Revolution and as Treasury Secretary.--Thomas Jefferson? He is portrayed as passive-aggressive, a bit of a coward, an immense hypocrite, and a master of public relations disguises. His slave holdings and racist commentary in his Notes on the State of Virginia contradict his magnificent Declaration of Independence. We all knew that. But we might not have known how he liked to commission Madison to do his fighting in print and politics for him, and we might not have understood how disastrous his views on lightly implementing the Constitution would have been for the nation. Jefferson, like other Virginians, loathed the idea of an executive branch strong enough to finance and defend the nation. Once he became president, he then asserted strong executive branch prerogatives in the Louisiana Purchase, of course.Aaron Burr--A very sleazy, double-crossing, self-interested operator with no fixed views other than his own satisfactions. Long ago I read Vidal's Burr; I won't reread it.James Madison--Extremely bright, a man who did not misrepresent his political views.John Adams--Easily offended, proud, prone to emotional tirades, and someone who spent more time at home in Massachusetts than in the then-capital, Philadelphia.Now, does Hamilton come off better than this cast of characters because this is his biography? Not really. He is portrayed as a brilliant thinker and writer, persuasively so. He possessed courage and a will to serve. He is credited with securing the finances and defense of the nation at a time of maximum vulnerability after the Revolution. In effect, Madison wrote the Constitution, and Hamilton, in his own way, implemented it. But at the same time, we encounter a semi-orphan who came to NY after a rough upbringing in the Caribbean who brought with him significant vulnerabilities and massive insecurity. HIs conception of his place in the world was that of someone trapped in an honor/shame dynamic, so many of his actions were driven by defense of his honor, in a public sense, but his conception of honor did not entirely extend to the personal sphere. His very odd pamphleteering about a sordid affair he conducted so that he could prove the money he gave his lover had nothing to do with public corruption must rank as one of the stupidest and least sensitive acts of the 18th century. For the sake of his so-called integrity and honor, he humiliated his doting and faithful wife. She put up with it, but was she hurt? Of course. So were his friends. A very odd move, indeed.Chernow's major problem is that Burr did not murder Hamilton sooner. Once Hamilton left the Treasury Secretaryship, his political fortunes declined and he really had little impact on national affairs despite lots of writing and conniving. We need to know about all this principally in the sense that it offers a good account of how ""factions"" led to political ""parties. Hamilton's party was the Federalist party. Jefferson's, his nemesis in a political sense, was the Republican. But the truth is that Hamilton became an out-of-office lawyer scrambling to be relevant and not succeeding. Burr had the same problem at the end of his insignificant tenure as Jefferson's vice president. One can only agree with Chernow that the duel Burr forced on Hamilton (which Hamilton was stupid enough to accept because of ""honor"" again) was designed to help restore Burr's place in the sun. And yet it is also clear that Burr intended not to wound Hamilton but to kill him, which he did, and which earned Burr pariah status he could not shed for the following decades.This book is well-written, pretty long, and boils with minor characters, few of whom are admirable. Chernow does not seem to have a particularly cynical view of things; the simple truth is that the birth of the United States was a hard-fought and often dirty undertaking....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 06, 2020","Aug 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton

Proust goes Tolstoy one better in not only giving minor figures names and characteristics, he provides them with intimate biographies.As a social satirist, Proust tends to go on too long. He can extend an evening's cocktail party or dinner interminably. He never wants to pass up a bit of gossip, a wonderful insult, a study in frailty, old age, need, and loss of social status. Could this 700 page book be better at 600 pages? Probably. Could it be better if it spent more time in dispatching our old friend Swann? Yes. Could it be better if it included the episode in which Mme Verdurin humiliates Charlus, instead of foreshadowing it and the pushing it off into the next volume? I would think so.To my surprise, the final pages of S&G boiled with real passion, confusion, and excitement as Marcel wrestled with the issue of whether he should marry or discard Albertine. In some ways I was reminded of the final pages of Ulysses, although stylistically very dissimilar. But I won't conclude this note by revealing Marcel's decision--not only so I don't spoil the book for another reader but also because I don't trust Marcel and am not meant to.

The Wild Palms is sad and desperate.The Old Man is comic and desperate. All the characters dwell in a hostile, or brutally indifferent, cosmos wherein certain words occur again and again: fierce, rage, fury, and the like. That's Faulkner, overwriting to magnificent effect although at times approaching the kinds of excess one encounters all the time in Thomas Wolfe.Faulkner takes the human condition and paints it upon a canvas of raw nature, plucking the human condition of all its defenses, exposing its vulnerabilities, inviting us to weep in sympathy and admiration or laugh ruefully...as in the third time a backflood overwhelms the escaping convict, bringing along with it animal carcasses and kitchen sinks.Faulkner's prose is simply amazing. It is inventive, relentless, and creates, in its excess, a quality of experience that defies rational assessment. I do wonder if some editing might improve these works, but I'm not sure about that.

More importantly, it is intellectually ambiThe Spell of the Sensuous by David Abram is a magnificent book, beautifully written and powerfully argued. More importantly, it is intellectually ambitious, attempting to give the reader unique insight into the human condition. I will do what I can to reduce its ""point"" to a few sentences and then offer some personal thoughts.Abram contends that humanity is alienated from its role within nature, as a feature of nature, not an arbiter of nature. He posits that this alienation is deeply wounding and that it is sourced, broadly speaking, in the human predilection for abstraction. He traces abstraction to the ancient Greek alphabet, whose letters do not represent anything (the Greek alphabet's semitic precursor does, in fact, represent things). He then ties this abstraction to Plato's idealism, wherein the world of appearances (our world) is devalued against the world of ideal forms, and he moves on to the whole Cartesian/scientific revolution wherein what we ""know"" is limited to our capacity to count, to measure, to quantify and replicate with exactitude.He then introduces Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, two 20th century phenomenologists, who reacted against the premise that our interior ratiocination is the foundation of reality. Their thinking trended toward exploring the ways in which we do not, in fact, think alone but can only think in relation to our physical circumstances (let us amend that to say our ""natural circumstances.) Husserl and Merleau-Ponty would go further, suggesting that the tree about which we think participates in our thinking, likewise the wind, etc. This is an assault on the solipsistic dead-end of philosophy as an exercise in proposing reality as a metaphysical construct.Going beyond Husserl and Merleau-Ponty (and of course Descartes), Abrams then engages in a far reaching anthropological assessment of ways in which humanity has existed in the context of its animal nature, i.e., how it has made use of rituals and myths and beliefs that tie humanity to the earth from which it has arisen, literally the physical places, the currents of the oceans, and the winds.Generally considering such beliefs as primitive, modern humanity (let's say the last 2500 years) has done everything in its power to divorce itself from the caprices of the natural world. As a consequence, it has trashed the earth, the seas, and the skies. This, of course, is indisputable. Our rationally developed science has told us that again and again, and many of us know it firsthand, having flown over West Virginia or lived in smoggy Los Angeles or picked our way through the plastic-strewn beaches for a dip in the oily waters of the Gulf Coast.Abrams' book does not resolve the tensions and disasters it describes. The notion of ""undoing"" modern civilization is a thought too big to think. There is no way to unlearn the ancient Greek alphabet and its successor formulations. The digital world takes us further into abstraction even as it ingeniously offers us virtual realities. Abrams does not say so--he is more hopeful--but to read his book is to conclude that the evolution of humanity inevitably leads to its extinction. Marx's version of alienation, extensive as it is, encompasses far less than Abrams's version. He gets at our disenchantment, our anxiety, our internecine hostilities, our materialistic sterility and highly productive modes of self-destruction.But the question is whether you would want to hear this news or ignore it, whether you would want to think about it or pretend that there is nothing to think about.Oddly I found E.O. Wilson's ""Consilience"" much more depressing. His concept of the unity of knowledge, good and bad, hinges so much on the rational that it is asphyxiating. In the end, Wilson gives me a sense that we're material shaped in one way and eventually will be shaped in another and that's that because the laws of physics and chemistry and biology say so. Abrams probes and elevates a counterpoint to the rational (and abstract) by suggesting that the human experience can be much enlarged by accepting its limitations. Certain familiar winds matter, certain moments spent daydreaming matter, certain hikes matter, certain encounters with fish matter, the oceans and the skies matter. We are, in fact, much more wedded to our natural environment than we might suspect, down to the way in which we breathe. In sum, ""experience"" matters, which is why everything idiosyncratic and unique in our lives stands out for us and probably nothing more than childhood memories which encompass what might be called phenomenological encounters with reality that are not at all metaphysical or transcendent or abstract but are, in fact, keys to our unrehearsed, unprogrammed, unmediated, individual ""selves,"" participating in time and space without knowing how to measure either. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,not setnot set,"Jun 21, 2020not set","Jun 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48582.The_Spell_of_the_Sensuous

The novel opens with Artur Sammler clinging to a past he invented for himself as a journalist in London--a vaguely cosmopolitan, vaguely Oxonian past-- as he lives his final days on the generosity of his nephew, a Westchester gynecologist with a loose daughter and a wacky son. He can't fix the gynecologist's aneurysm, he can't straighten out the daughter's sexual misadventures, he can't calm down the wacky son...and he can't do a thing with his own daffy daughter, either. Yes, he possesses a Bellovian gimlet eye for detail, be he in Manhattan or on a self-assigned reporting tour in Israel, and his judgment of human frailties is spectacular.

Or think we know. This account provides insight into his life far beyond his troubles with cocaine. The picture painted here is of a very competitive and yet insecure, strong and yet needy individual, who spent many years abusing cocaine, which provided him with energy for huge amounts of work and a form of release for substantial internal pressures and contradictions. It's often noted but bears repeating that Freud had the makings of a superb neurologist before he developed psychoanalysis. One of his major contributions was his early paper, Über Cocaine, which failed to generate the acclaim he sought because he overlooked a key property of cocaine: it can be used effectively as a local anesthetic. So another doctor stole a march on him in reporting this.Freud viewed himself in his pre-psychoanalytic days as a successor to the greatest neurologists in Europe. All he needed was a discovery. What he personally discovered about cocaine was that as an antidote to a friend's morphine addiction, it could be effective and destructive. He also discovered that cocaine provided him with a boon companion to his grandiosity. Markel cannot be sure why cocaine did not destroy Freud. He points out substitute self-medications in excessive drinking, up to twenty cigars a day, and apparently the release of homosexual desires in a relationship with Wilhelm Fliess, a nose specialist based in Berlin.Markel's account of the devastation to the body and brain of a cocaine addict is horrifying. This drug is Russian roulette. He explains its migration from South America to Europe in the latter part of the 19th century and he introduces us to William Halsted, a brilliant surgeon whose life was twisted inside out by cocaine, wrecking his first spell in the medical spotlight in New York and then after extensive and difficult treatment, a second spell of great success at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore...but while living the haunted life of an addict whose personality was corrupted and whose unreliability was only compensated for by his surgical genius.Some of Halsted's greatest insights, like Freud's, remain valuable today. But they paid high prices for glory. Their drug and substance addictions added nothing to their accomplishments. Rationalizing drug use as a means of unleashing genius is a misbegotten piece of street wisdom.

Kandel, born in Vienna and emigrated to the US as a boy, opens the book with an assessment of the painters Klimpt, Kokoshka, and Shiele and the psychologist Freud, all of whom were part of Vienna's remarkable cultural life circa 1900.Freud is foundational to this study in that he proposed we live our lives only dimly aware that beneath consciousness lies a very active unconscious, which manifests itself not only in dreams but in everyday life. His theorizing coincided with and supported Viennese modernism/expressionism, an attempt to depict the dramas of interior life as opposed to the realistic scenes of exterior life. The artists in question are shocking in many ways because, Kandel argues, they were exploring realities hitherto hidden from the arts. He goes further when he makes the scientific case for ways in which Viennese expressionism reflected what we were coming to know as the biology of the brain. In some ways, Kokoshka et al ran ahead of science, in fact. Freud's theorizing, after all, lacked technical support for decades in the form of MRIs, etc., which could pinpoint areas of the brain engaged by representations of feeling as opposed to representations of physical fact.Kandel is generous in acknowledging the leading figures in the arts and sciences he cites as he makes his larger argument. For a wholly-consumed scientist most of his life, his appreciation of painting in particular is impressive. He does not advance Vienna 1900 as a be-all-and-end-all in the world of western culture, but he makes a solid case, and he adds to this case a very sophisticated survey of relevant scientific advances, covering brain biology, creativity, memory, vision, and language.In conclusion, Kandel calls for a continuation and deepening of the dialogue between the arts and sciences. Many on the humanistic side of the discussion might wonder who would be an appropriate scientific counterpart. Kandel definitely is one such figure; he cites dozens of others.

It's also important, if the classic was written in a language you can't read, to find a very good translation.To start with the latter of these two points, Adam Thorpe's translation of Madam Bovary has the ring of accuracy. It is clear, strong, vivid, and manages to deal with the leaps in rhetorical register one encounters in Madame Bovary.Turning to how you may have changed more the classic, I suppose this is obvious.

The movie follows the book step by step, so there were few surprises, but on balance, it is better than the book because no actor would think of being as exclamatory as LeCarré's Leamus toward the end of the text, where he must explain the tortured goings-on that hitherto have been concealed from his girlfriend (and the reader.)

He says it is his first successful novel--which put him on the literary map--but he doesn't claim that it is true to the life of spying (it isn't; it's really implausible when you step back and consider it) and he appears to recognize that his carefully developed characterizations are overwhelmed by the needs of the plot at the end.LeCarré becomes a much more accomplished novelist as his career advances, and yet there remains the tension of personal life situations (the heart of novelizing) and Cold War contextualization.

It's a novel of movements which overlap its prequel and sequel. For me the greatest pity is that I can't read French. I suspect that Proust's French is stunning. This translation is okay, not stunning.Here are some comments that may be of interest:The book starts rather slowly with Marcel and his family living in a wing or large apartment of the Hôtel de Guermantes (a grand edifice approaching the scale of an apartment block). The Guermantes, Mme. Guermantes in particular, remain central to the entire volume. Marcel is enchanted by her, an unattainable woman of highest status. As he goes about trying to engage her on morning walks, he also narrates some of the social dynamics led by the servants in the Hôtel de Guermantes. For the sake of upstairs/downstairs fullness, this is witty, but not compelling.Through much of the volume, Proust engages in extended purple similes that interrupt the action just as the wave is about to crest. These similes reminded me of Virgil's Aeneid, and further back, the similes found in Homer. In Proust, they can be astonishing, and they can be tedious, sometimes both at once. Again, if I could read French, I might be overawed by the beauty of the prose. As a technique to extend moments of suspense, I find them annoying.The book's themes revolve around the well-known Proustian concerns: subjectivity both personal and temporal. In a way, Proust kindly uses subjectivity to forgive the Guermantes set's infatuation with its aristocratic lineage; after all, theirs is just one of many ways of perceiving ""reality""--as an artifact of the past, the things that used to happen, the things that used to be important.Marcel's beloved grandmother dies. She has long been his best caretaker and soulmate...although his depth of feeling toward her is stated more than substantiated. Similarly, Marcel keeps tumbling after Robert Saint-Loup, hanging out near his military base, mixing with his mates. This is an odd bit of romancing. Saint-Loup takes Marcel for more extraordinary, sensitive and delicate than we as readers can corroborate from the action. Of course, since he is the author of this majestic text, we do have to assume Saint-Loup is right, but that's not illustrated to my satisfaction.Saint-Loup is related to the Duchess de Guermantes and Marcel wants his help in meeting her or at least obtaining a photo of her, perhaps with an inscription. Saint-Loup draws the line on the inscribed photo request, and here comes perhaps the most striking moment in the 800 page text: Marcel confesses that at that moment, he hated Saint-Loup. This is a wonderful revelation of perverse passion that contradicts his normal posture of mooning about.We move on. Saint-Loup's own women troubles are presented. He's making a fool of himself with a courtesan. Why? Well, this fits with Swann having done the same thing, although Saint-Loup is of much higher status.Eventually, Marcel is drawn into the Guermantes set with a dinner invitation. Ostensibly he has come to the Duchess's attention because of his exceptional literary talent, evidenced by reference to a single essay. So we go to dinner with Guermantes and there we see Marcel take apart everyone else at the table--in his thoughts, not his spoken words--even as we see the Duchess emerge as what I think is one of the truly great literary characters. She is willful, she has a quick tongue, teeth that bite, a husband whose constant betrayals don't seem to affect her, a beauty that is somewhat defiled by her rough, occasionally crude, character, and the greatest of skills in managing the Guermantes' status as one of the two key French families, the Courvoisiers being the other. This first dinner goes on forever, but the Duchess is unflagging. At first I found her tediously pretentious, then I began to see her in the round, fully developed, a mass of strengths and weaknesses. (Her husband is the one who is tediously pretentious, unredeemably so).Ultimately contact with the Guermantes liberates Marcel, but to whom? Charlus, the Duke of Guermantes's brother. Again, Charlus is a splendid character, quite forceful, quite nasty and domineering and controlling, an ongoing assault on anyone who interests him...in this case, Marcel. Not much actually happens with Charlus in this volume, but he is well-positioned to play a much greater role in the volumes to come.Marcel/Proust demonstrates an intellect that isn't only aesthetic. His handling of military matters and the Dreyfus case, as well as his gift for satire, are a surprising complement to his psychologizing. I would venture that more than half of the readers of The Guermantes Way never finish. The pity is that the second half of the book is much better than the first half....more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,not setnot set,"Apr 26, 2020not set","Apr 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18795.The_Guermantes_Way

In this collection he interviews or reflects on writers he has been close to, and whose work he has read carefully, starting with two Jewish writers whose lives were changed surviving the Holocaust, Primo Levi and Aaron Appelfield.The Levi encounter is rich because of Levi's homebody lifestyle, post-Holocaust. This is interesting: He lived in his home town in Italy all his life and for money, and satisfaction, he was a manager in a paint factory. This piques Roth's interest. He doesn't know any writers who have stayed so far out of the cosmopolis. He also ventures to suggest that one of Levi's books, a novel, If Not Now, Wben? has a seemingly narrow and tendentious focus, rendering it less compelling that Levi's more autobiographical work. Levi disputes Roth's implicit judgement--that this novel is forced--but what interests me is the risk Roth takes here, and elsewhere, in delivering bad news to a fellow writer.He says later on, in his piece on Bernard Malamud, that writers seldom talk to one another about their work for fear of giving offense, but when forced to do so (as when Malamud reads him a few humdrum pages of manuscript opening a work-in-progress), Roth has to say something, so he comes up with two comments that infuriate Malamud: that perhaps these shouldn't be the pages opening the novel and that he's curious about what happens next. Malamud answers that what happens next is irrelevant. He's pissed. That puts their friendship on ice for several years.In talking with Appelfield, Roth does it again. He says that he encountered some ""difficulty"" in reading Badenheim 1939 because it is shorn of historical context (German persecution of Jews). His footwork is pretty fancy in saying this. Nonetheless, Appelfield, like the other writers, rebuts him. Why should there be any historical context when everyone knows the historical context? Well, in this case, I'm with Roth. This well-known novel doesn't have the impact it should. But it is also true that dramatizing more explicit aspects of the Nazi menace would have forced numerous aesthetic choices on Appelfield he simply did not care to explore.An exchange with Mary McCarthy provides stingers on both sides. McCarthy didn't like The Counterlife, which is a weird experiment that self-detonates somewhere in Jerusalem, for reasons having to do with its portrayal of Christianity. She apologizes for this, but it's how she feels. Roth returns fire. All very civilized. But that's the end of the relationship.The writer Roth adulates most and about whom he writes best (if indiscriminately) is Saul Bellow. He captures the explosion of Augie March perfectly and sets it apart from Bellow's first two novels, Dangling Man and The Victim. Then he goes on to deliver even higher marks to Herzog, well-deserved high marks, I would say, and the rest of Bellow's books through The Dean's December. My problem with this is that he overvalues Henderson the Rain King, Humboldt's Gift, and The Dean's December because he is so dazzled by Bellow, something of a mentor and a close friend. Those three books do seem forced to me, full of inside jokes. They lack the vitality of Mr. Sammler's Planet and certainly the peculiar exuberance of Augie March and Herzog.Knowing a bit about Bellow, though not as much as Roth knew, I would venture that Roth would never risk offending him. An angry Bellow would make for a very dangerous friend.For some reason, Roth inserts an essay/memoir about the painter Philip Guston. This makes little sense in a collection about writers, but I'm glad he did because it provides insight into my own encounter with Guston (via an exhibition) that confounded me. Guston seems to have suffered from fierce depression and at a point in his life after he had achieved success demonstrating a full range of painterly skills, he descended into a cartoonish reductionism in which he produced crude canvases depicting, for example, battered shoes. Ugly things. I was associated with a foundation that helped fund an exhibition of this stuff at the Reina Sofia in Madrid (back in the 1980s) and I can't say it was a pleasure encountering Guston's crushing depression and contempt for his own art. People said nice things, as they often do, but this was a pretty dreadful exhibition. Not liking what I saw, I left Guston behind until I read Roth's account of the man's struggles and perverse rationale. To explain that rationale, I refer to the philosopher Robert Nozick's comment to the effect that he, too, always wanted to write a book so dread-inspiring no one could read it. In Guston's case, he wanted to make paintings so awful no one could look at them, but being acclaimed, like Nozick, Guston's late work had to be looked at. Roth does a pretty good job exploring this darkness....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Apr 2020,"Apr 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29748.Shop_Talk

This collection will make you remember him better, however. There is one basic theme here that I would describe as wrestling. Sartre wrote about nothing and no one without wrestling, grappling, twisting...employing a powerful analytic mind in the service of at least not saying anything false if he could not be sure he arrived at the truth.His best work in this collection shows up in odd places. His essay on his impressions and relationship with New York City is wonderful. At first he disliked New York because it wasn't all twisted up and overlaid by history like a European city. Ultimately, he captured the powerful sweep of the place (we're talking about Manhattan, of course). Except for Times Square and swaths of Broadway, New York doesn't feel compelled to talk about itself; it knows who it is. Sartre liked that: New York waiting to be decoded.Another fine piece is an interview he gave when he was 70 and finally too blind to read or write. His wit and composure is quite striking. His wrestling days at this point are over. The breech with Camus the moralist is here along with a good succinct definition of existentialism: the willingness to accept responsibility for one's freedom, or, to put it more it succinctly, the willingness to be free. Whenever the French communists show up, Sartre hits the mats. Despicable people who didn't like him, either.On a tour through the US Sartre makes notebook entries on the mystery of the American workers' contentment with capitalism. He wouldn't write that today, but then he marveled at how proud auto workers were of the Ford plants they worked in. Europeans had cathedrals, Americans had factories. Working through Sartre's essays, one often comes upon feuds and fissures. He describes at length the rise and fall he experienced with fellow philosopher Merleau-Ponty. This is a somewhat elegiac piece. When one thinks of Sartre's era, one thinks of him at the top of his class. Sartre didn't think that, however. He placed Merleau-Ponty above himself, perhaps not so much for achievement but certainly for fidelity to his intellectual quest.At times Sartre is excessively concerned with the ins and outs of a subject. Some old arguments and debates are just that: old arguments and debates. But in the main this collection displays Sartre's extraordinary versatility and talent as a writer. Beyond that, it lets us see how often he took risks as a public intellectual. To his credit, he does not always insist that he was right all along....more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,not setnot set,"Mar 28, 2020not set","Mar 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13002870-we-have-only-this-life-to-live

Gay weaves three strands together with great skill: Freud the man, husband, father and friend; Freud the intellectual originator of a comprehensive theory of how the human mind works (including its component forces); and Freud the leader of a professional movement, psychoanalysis, as its preeminent practitioner and indefatigable defender of central psychoanalytic principles and practices.Freud the man comes across as a fascinating composite of passions, quirks, loyalties, and, in the main, strengths. He wasn't born to wealth, certainly not to privilege, and made his way into medicine despite the antisemitic counterforces of the day, which were substantial. He was widely read, loved Shakespeare and Goethe and of course, Sophocles. He kept up an extensive correspondence that--like his published writing--reflects a powerful mind at ease in the fields of thought. His was highly dependent on one daughter, Anna, herself a psychoanalyst, and crushed when on of his brood died an early death (this happened more than once). He stayed married, happily enough, for sixty years. He had great friends among both men and women. He worked very, very hard. He spent a long time yearning for but gaining no recognition for his insights, and yet that didn't deter him from pursuing his ideas.Freud the intellectual, who considered himself primarily a scientist, is given substantial, detailed treatment in this book. Gay points out strengths and weaknesses, both as they were apparent right away or became apparent over time, in his theories. Overall, of course, Gay is sympathetic to what we today would call Freudianism, but specifically as it emerged when it emerged, viewed historically, not propagandistically.Freud the analyst and promoter of psychoanalysis is presented as tough minded, realistic, not always successful in keeping order in the house, and a person who from time to time anointed the wrong successor, notably Carl Jung. The Freud-Jung falling out is well told here; in this case, Jung gets the worst of it.Gay enriches his text with good historical sketches, i.e., life in Vienna in the 1890s, WWI, the dreadful decade of the Twenties in Austria (and Germany), the rise of Nazism, and antisemitism throughout. Understandably, if for some reason you hold Freud's work in contempt, you won't enjoy this book, but if you are neutral toward it or somewhat positive toward its monumental novelty (the unconscious. the dynamics of dreams, the revelations to be found in everyday life and jokes, the importance of earliest life experiences, the tensions between love and hate...one could go on), this is an absorbing, well-written and complete biography by a scholar in full control of his powerful, brilliant and endlessly creative subject....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 09, 2020","Mar 22, 2020","Mar 09, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19042550-freud

He reThe Facts, Philip Roth's partial autobiography, is not very sly assault on the premise that anyone can write autobiography, much less biography. He recounts his boyhood in Newark, his college years at Bucknell, and his early years as a successful short story writer and novelist (taking us basically through Portnoy's Complaint). Along the way, once he is in his twenties, he interweaves the tale of his disastrous first marriage to a woman who wants his money and his growing fame. She clearly was, from the outset, a terrible choice. Roth at the time was blossoming not just as a writer but also as an ever-wider ranging intellectual. He already had demonstrated a strong desire to move on from a romantic relationship for the sake of his independence. And his first wife, who bullied him into marrying her by staging a fake pregnancy, was a person with a poor self-image, little self-confidence, and two children from her own first marriage of whom she had lost custody. The one benefit Roth claims to have received from this multi-year disaster was being so maddened that he developed what became his signature over-the-top comic/satirical style. Bye-bye Henry James. Portnoy's Complaint not only made Roth rich and famous, it also generated an intense backlash from American Jews who already believed he was a self-hating Jew who loved making fun of himself and other Jews. Roth disputes this. He claims he always was an ethnic Jew, never a religious or practicing Jew, but altogether he has been fine with his Jewish family, friends, and other Jewish writers. Okay, that's what he says for seven-eighth of this short book. For the last eighth, Roth turns things over to his fictional alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, who devilishly undermines most of what Roth claims was his life--or his attitude toward his life. Zuckerman even goes so far as to suggest Roth has underplayed his first wife, not given her enough time or credit from her own point of view--which of course is the last thing Roth would want to do because Roth quite frankly says that when she died in a car accident, he was unaffected...because he hated her.What's the point? Zuckerman's point, at least, is that fiction offers more truth than non-fiction because non-fiction is incomplete and fiction is the entire sum of an aesthetic proposition. There is a great deal to be said for this view, especially as regards writers. The ""true"" autobiography of a writer in many ways is what transpires during the process of writing whatever he/she writes, and this is inaccessible. So it may be better to focus on the residue of the writing process, i.e., the texts themselves, and forget attempting to document everything that happened to the writer when he wasn't writing. Roth, of course, didn't really live an eventful life outside writing. He didn't go to war, hold high office, spend time in prison, shoot big game, or stab his first wife. He read a lot, he wrote a lot, he spent time with other writers he grew close to, and he felt grounded in the Newark of his boyhood.This book, then, The Facts, thumbs its nose at itself, which is a pretty neat trick. My guess, however, is that Roth didn't intend this from the outset. My guess is that Roth simply got bored recording his sometimes embarrassing activities in a realistic way and one morning decided to riff against the grain, courtesy of Zuckerman, one man's facts being another man's fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 09, 2020","Feb 14, 2020","Feb 09, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19079630-the-facts

In many ways, he did create the field of neurology by using clinical observation as a means of identifying numerous major neurological disorders and also by promoting the field through developing many associates and through a relentless publishing/publicity regime. Charcot was, in a sense, a master builder. At the height of his power and influence he directed the massive hospital for women, the Salpêtrière, in Paris as a vehicle for extensive clinical research, employing photography, electrical stimulation, medicine, and hypnotism as a trial-and-error means of pinning down the associated symptoms of given maladies and naming them.Today Charcot remains a significant figure in the history of medicine with a bit of an asterisk...or perhaps a large asterisk. He focused intensively toward the end of his career on the phenomenon known as hysteria. That's where the asterisk comes in, large or small. No one today believes (and many in Charcot's time disbelieved) in hysteria as Charcot presented it. Hysteria in Charcot's sense was a variable but fundamentally 4-stage illness that brought on seizures, or attacks, or spells. These spells typically began with a phase of paralysis, then yielded to a phase of extraordinary physical expressions (involving the whole body), then yielded to a phase called ""passionate,"" which might be erotic, or fearful, or sad, and finally ended in delirium. That was Charcot's schema, which he demonstrated for the public with the aid of his patients, and which he triggered by first hypnotizing those patients. Charcot believed that susceptibility to deep hypnosis was, in fact, evidence of hysteria, which he did not, by the way, limit to women (prior to his times, women were thought to be the only hysterics). As a neurologist, he further believed that hysteria must be caused by some lesion in the nervous system. Most likely, he thought, all neurological disorders were hereditary, but he allowed that certain disorders might remain latent without a triggering trauma (a young woman being repeatedly assaulted sexually, for example, often was found in cases of hysteria.)There is no question that Charcot was dishonest in his research on hysteria or that he was cynical in publicizing it. He insisted that in the case of hysteria the critical lesion ultimately would be found (as would be the case in other neurological disorders)...and admitted that he simply had not found it yet. One limiting factor in all of his work was his aversion to what might be called exploratory surgery (or, in the case of animals, vivisection). He theorized that surgery might disrupt the phenomenon being sought. Post-mortem, yes, Charcot studied the physical body down to the cellular level, but pre-mortem, as it were, hysteria only could be known through case studies and hypnotism.The most valuable scientific aspect of this book is pinpointing the exact nature of Charcot's errors with regard to hysteria, the first being his resistance to what is termed psychogenic causation, i.e., psychological trauma, not heredity, being the primary force generating many somatic irregularities--paralysis uncontrollable mood swings, a loss of sensory faculties, etc., etc. Freud studied with Charcot briefly. Along with others, we can say he pushed past Charcot's insistence on physical lesions in the case of hysteria.More broadly, the book does not step back and assess a bigger problem in Charcot's work (bigger even than his questionable mastery of hypnosis). To my mind, the bigger problem is how could any lesion typically generate such a complex sequence of symptoms, sweeping through the four phases of hysteria, and sometimes doing so dozens and hundreds of times a day when a patient was most severely afflicted?It began to be obvious, but was not obvious to Charcot and his associates, that the diagnosis of hysteria had to come apart at the seams and that the Charcot's theater of hysterical symptoms was an implausible hypothesis. Over time we have seen all kinds of symptoms, some alone, some in multitudes, present themselves as human reactions to trauma of a psychogenic nature. Thus, the master theory of hysteria, the bringing together of w, x, y, and z states, has fallen apart without necessarily extinguishing those states alone or in combination after a single or many traumas.And we still don't know how trauma enters into and controls the physical organism of a person...how it persists...how it mutates...how it becomes, in Charcot's sense, a lesion.As a master builder, Charcot overreached. He constructed a disorder out of many disorders; the winds of time and further research blew his structure down.The fantastic intellectual error of proposing hysteria as Charcot proposed it...and as it persisted for a few decades...remains fascinating to me, at least. This is not a book for casual readers. I suppose it's not necessary to say that. But it's still a good book for many reasons that exceed my comments here....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2020","Feb 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3823560-charcot

We see Prior living a very low life, Prior saying farewell to his fiancee, Prior frustrating Rivers (his doctor), and Prior back at the front, where he is determined to live and die. And we see Rivers on hospital duty caring for the grievously wounded, Rivers at home looking after his ailing sister, and Rivers, through multiple episodes, living in his past when he did anthropological research in Melanesia. The point of these flashbacks is obvious. The practice of headhunting (or substituting symbols for heads) Rivers studied as a younger man is not that different from the barbarity of WWI, both as the action in the trenches unfolds and as it plays out in his hospital.The strength of this fine novel lies in its writing: the prose is quick, concrete, and efficient. Barker is absolutely stunning as she explores Prior's voracious bisexuality, most of which, but not all, plays out in his head. Here you have the thing people these days say isn't possible: a person of one gender writing convincingly about a character of another gender. Barker is no trespasser, however. She owns Prior whether he is involved with a male or female partner. If Prior exemplifies abnormality in the maelstrom of war, crude and cunning, Rivers exemplifies normality, which doesn't do him much good, since a normal man doesn't really know how to adapt to the crises of combat and its consequences.Perhaps the oddest thing about this book is how relentlessly hopeless it is while remaining interesting and compelling. These characters--including many brilliant adjuncts to Prior and Rivers-- are not destined to emerge intact. There is no good way to either think or fight your way out of a war, and not just WWI. And yet one trusts that Barker will continue to find aspects of life that are riveting even in the face of death. Again, her skill as a pure writer is the secret here; reading her work is having her take over your mind and all your senses without, I might add, overdoing it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 04, 2020","Feb 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/151926.The_Ghost_Road

Sadly, Trump's plot isn't fiction, but it almost seems as though Roth's plot isn't either.This novel wraps counterfactual history (Charles Lindberg becoming president in 1940 and declining to take a stand against Hitler while persecuting Jews in the U.S.) into the lives of a Jewish family in Newark struggling to make its way ahead even when politics hasn't turned explicitly against it.There are several strokes of brilliance in Roth's novel; the most important is narrating the book from the youngest son's point of view, thereby giving the reader a broad view of the confusion descending upon the Jews of Newark (and elsewhere); another masterstroke is offering up a Lindberg whose concept of politicking is to fly from place to place in America on his own, saying little and presenting himself more as an airborne symbol than a man of substance. It's a curious fact that many truly callous, and even brutal, ""leaders"" are ciphers in the personal sense, empty souls like Trump and Nixon...or far more horrifying, Saddam Hussein, Hitler, name your worst nightmare. This sets up the paradox that the most self-centered people on earth seem to possess the least self to center themselves upon.Finally, I would note how many seemingly incidental details and little developments Roth is able to turn into a crushing landslide of persecution.

Arvid, the protagonist, is a middle-aged, commercially unsuccessful novelist who is dealing with two wrenching issues: his father problem and his brother problem. The father was a strong fellow who did not appreciate having appeared in Arvid's first novel.(I say ""was"" because he and most of the family subsequently died in a ferry fire somewhere between Norway and Denmark.)The father's dislike of Arvid's career choice was built on a much longer period of tension arising between him and Arvid, perhaps buried in the father's dislike of himself and, ultimately, lack of interest in Arvid's mother. The brother, now going through a midlife crisis, including a suicide attempt and a divorce, is Arvid's one surviving relative. Once upon a time they shared two siblings' intimate hostility and rivalry. At this point, however, the brothers are both fairly beaten down, and Arvid is pushed out of his brother's life...temporarily, as we see.The plot, if you will, consists of Arvid wandering around Oslo, seeking clues from various settings important in his past (including the neighborhood where his former wife and children still live) and experiencing flashbacks largely focused on his father. In the process, he lucks into one promising affair. Said affair is not given any space in the narrative in which to flourish and grow, but in some ways it is more encouraging that Arvid's reconciliation with his brother by means of a physical fight, reminiscent of their past. Said fight and reconciliation is the narrative's ultimate destination--boom, boom, boom, it's over, end of book.... Arvid is an appealing character because he's in trouble, knows he deserves it, and has just spent two years writing a manuscript he decides (rightly) to discard. It's easy to sympathize with him as Petterson expertly takes us into his difficulties and his wanderings. We see he is in a real fix, we see he is not a bad guy, and we see that he is sufficiently intelligent, and well-meaning, to warrant better things in life. But again, duking it out with his brother and then sharing a laugh and a drink, doesn't take us anywhere in particular. There's nothing in the two of them reconciling that is likely to augur well for them, just a certain spirit and manifestation of persistent life force.In his novel Out Stealing Horses, Petterson manages to paint his humble if interesting story, full of feeling and texture and specifics, on a canvas of much broader existential implications.

He was a late 19th century French writer whose work deviated little from the customs of novel-writing at the time, thereby making his work accessible to a wide spectrum of readers (he was quite popular in England and Henry James admired him), and yet he engaged in subtle forms of irony, satire and exaggeration that flirted with the monstrous in life...the giant ascents and plunging descents...providing readers with a good example of decadent romanticism in the Belle Epoque.The story is a somewhat torturous rendering of an old tale: a fading courtesan (kept woman, higher class prostitute) decides to seduce a younger man in the hopes of leaving her old life behind. The problem is that she has had so many liaisons and her former lovers are so indiscrete that her new lover deduces ""what she has been,"" something confirmed in painful detail when he happens upon a cache of letters from her admirers.

She was as famous as famous could be, adulated for her spectacular talent as an actress and a draw wherever she went (to the U.S. nine times, all over Europe and beyond). Gottlieb doesn't say this, but the account he offers leads me to think that part of Bernhardt's celebrity had to do with the decline of aristocracy in France and elsewhere and perhaps also the secularization of ""public"" sentiment gradually detaching itself from the powers of the ""church"" in all of its denominations. Bernhardt managed to fill voids in the public's emotional life while remaining true to her unique, rather tortured self.In her memoirs, Bernhardt isn't candid about how little parental attention she received as a child and how much it hurt her. Her mother favored her younger sister and sent her off to be raised by others. Her father was essentially never part of her life. This led her to seek love wherever she could find it and well explains another facet of her life that Gottlieb explores (as did the public rumor and gossip mill): Bernhardt had a nonstop series of affairs with ""benefactors"" (when she was young), leading men (when she was a leading lady), and ""notables"" (whenever she came across them.) The problem was that for her sex was necessary but apparently unsatisfactory, and a major attempt to resolve things through her marriage to Aristide Damala, a Greek diplomat, backfired: she put him on stage with her and he had zero talent, she tried to keep him reasonably close to her bed and he preferred many others.Gottlieb succinctly answers a reader's curiosity about Bernhardt's power as an actress. She was the master of the pose, the gesture, and had an extraordinary quality of voice that matched perfectly with the audience's expectations of ""declamatory"" theater at the time. Beyond that, she was fanatically and brilliantly involved in designing ornate, unique costumes and stage sets: She gave the audience something to look at that, again, had an almost religious impact, lush and otherworldly.Gottlieb is a good writer, makes fair and wise use of his sources, doesn't hesitate to call Bernhardt out on her embellishments and exaggerations, and covers the full array of critical reactions to her at the time (Oscar Wilde adored her, George Bernhard Shaw didn't). The odd, odd thing about Bernhardt that Gottlieb identifies without overplaying it is the fact that she was an outlandish prima donna in many ways while at home with friends and family she could be utterly normal, unpretentious, tolerant (especially of her spendthrift son), and realistic about where things stood in her life and career. For many years now the concept of ""celebrity"" in the cultural world has had a counterproductive effect on many of us, signifying a manipulated commercial identity, famous for being famous, and all that. Bernhardt's contrariness and her genius were exploited for commercial reasons, to be sure, but to use one of Gertrude Stein's formulations, there was an abundance of there there. She was human and super-human at the same time....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2020","Jan 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8588334-sarah

By that I mean, from early in life through the 30+ years this memoir covers, Bernhardt sought and ultimately achieved possession of an audience, and the audience, in turn, achieved possession of her, requiring embellishments, melodrama, and stylizations that served their common identity and needs.Bernhardt overlooks large unpleasant truths that were very hard on her as a child and adolescent and she spends next to no time on her amatory life, from adolescence on. Others have done their best to fill in those gaps, both of which ultimately are repositories of sadness. She does, however, exhibit an extraordinary quality of personality that set her apart. This quality is a mixture of boldness, curiosity, empathy, and possibly self-abuse. Throughout her life, if there was anything interesting to see or do or risk, Sarah wanted to do it. She just had to, whether it was finding her footing on an ice floe, the back of a dead whale, or the bottom of an untethered balloon basket sailing off into the night. If she was asked if she wanted to shoot a new Colt cannon, why, of course, she did. If she couldn't get the lions she wanted for her private menagerie, okay, what about a cheetah? She knew she wasn't as good a sculptress as an actress, but she put what talent she had on public display. The energy that evidently radiated across the stage and out into the darkness did the same in the private theater of her life. It made her faint, it made her sick, it made her master role after role, offer performance after performance.All this and much more is well-rendered in this little book. If she was making up details about the look of a certain train station early in the morning or the throngs blocking her way to the theater, she did it well.

This transpired during the 60s,70s, and 80s and continues to this day.Appelbaum has all the names, dates, and data in hand to make his case. I'll try to make his case in more general terms.The highly influential economics department at the University of Chicago (and Harvard and MIT and Michigan) led by Milton Friedman turned economics into the study of money, leaving out the larger component one might expect of economics: human welfare. Specifically, Friedman et al believed that the way you control a national economy is through controlling the money supply, which is best left uncontrolled in the service of market efficiencies, which are always smarter than the government, politicians, and bureaucrats.In crude terms, we all know where this kind of thinking leads: maximization of profits, more wealth for the wealthy, lower taxes for the wealthy, and less regulation of everything. Why? Because more money is always a good thing...whatever it costs.Impediments to wealth maximization are things like unions, environmental protection, and virtually any kind of taxation of giant corporations.Friedman et al (Walter Heller, Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, Arthur Laffer, George Stigler) were a smart bunch who appeared able to argue their case better through numbers than others were able to argue theirs through pointing not just to economic efficiency but to economic effects.Case in point: Alan Greenspan as head of the Federal Reserve had zero interest in the Fed's role as the nation's most senior bank regulator. Whoops, this led to the horrors of the 2008 Great Recession.Case in point: If you were born in 1951, you had a better than 50-50 chance of earning more than your wage-earning parent when she was 30. If you were born in in 1978, you had less than a 50-50 chance of doing better than your wage-earning parent at age 30. This was not because there was less ""money"" in 1978 than in 1951; it was because the wealthy paid fewer taxes in 1978, they had learned how to maximize their profits by heading offshore for lower-cost labor, and they were riding the wave of government-research money that flowed out of WWII and blessed them with incredible new technologies (which they never would have financed themselves...only the ""public"" could do that.) Meanwhile, our 70s baby was running hard into high inflation, high interest rates, and the transformation of the US economy from producing things to ""servicing"" things, which turned out to be good for Wall Street, not so good for Maple Avenue, Anywhere, U.S.The stunning thing about people who espouse ""the free market"" (which led to the Trump tax-giveaway to the rich) is that they manage never to admit how they shape the market to serve their interests; in fact, the truth is that if there is any kind of free market in the US, it belongs to the people who paved its roads, staffed its courts, policed its neighborhoods, taught in its schools, and so forth. Those people--the public--should be the ones shaping the market they created.This book justifies calling economics the dismal science, partly because it makes for distressing reading (dismal) and partly because economics is not a science; certainly it is not the subset of economic analysis and self-interest free marketeers claim as the totality of economics.In the last 40 years, the American middle class has made no progress in sheer money terms; it is not more prosperous than it was in 1980; its financial future is not brighter. These truths, coupled with the nightmare of the Great Recession, have led America in two highly incompatible directions at once. On the one hand, a filthy rich billionaire as president is able to associate himself with massive grievance in the middle class, pretending to be its friend because, of course, profit maximization helps everyone (it doesn't). On the other hand, left-leaning politicians propose utterly unrealistic remedies for the beleaguered middle class. Figures like $20 or $30 trillion for Medicare for All are the worst kind of pandering and, ultimately, bait and switch. Getting Obamacare as far as it has gotten is proof that America will climb out of its healthcare ditch one step at a time, not by means of magical edicts from presidential candidates.Appelbaum gets very detailed as he traces the intellectual history of unregulated free markets. He offers quite interesting case studies of Chile (a divided society, rich and poor), Iceland (a society that almost went completely bankrupt in the Great Recession) and Taiwan (a highly managed and highly successful country where the rich/poor wealth gap is not as pronounced as elsewhere.)As is customary after poking holes in so much hypocrisy, so much skullduggery, so many ghastly outcomes for real people living real lives, Appelbaum professes some hope for the future. He points out that Janet Yellen, when she headed the Fed, worked hard on job creation policies. He notes that the economists' hour really has come to an end...albeit by cleaving the body politic in half. But I worry. We still need an economics that addresses all of our interests, that takes environmental costs into account, that recognizes the need for large-scale government funded basic research, that lowers healthcare and higher education costs and makes hospitals and universities much more open to everyone.Right now Trump and company are trashing everything and encasing future generations in coffins of debt so that they and their playmates can keep living better than anyone on earth deserves.

Said cover photo portrays Amis as a hard-staring angry punk, a persona that he has affected for marketing purposes over the years but doesn't suit the thoughtfulness, fairness, and general (but not complete) lack of snideness evident in these essays, s, commentaries, and so forth. And beyond all that, Amis is widely and well-read, and I find I like his honesty. Example: he adores Nabokov for Nabokov's brilliant renderings of seen and felt reality, but I recall reading Ada many, many years ago, and I was relieved that Amis shares my judgment: Ada is a pointless dud of a novel, albeit written by a genius. Another bit of honesty: Amis revered John Updike. This shows up in many of these essays. But Amis thought Updike wasted some very important years writing Rabbit Redux. I take his point without entirely agreeing with it. Saul Bellow, another Amis hero, is only dunned for his first two novels, which are taut and depressing and lack the life of everything after Augie March.Like many English men of letters Amis does celebrate Philip Larkin. I've never figured that one out. Amis's brief note on JG Ballard is interesting for its portrayal of a dad who worked hard at being a dad, probably not what one would expect of the hard-drinking Ballard.Non-literary pieces focus on poker in Vegas, football in Barcelona, John Travolta, and somewhere in here Donald Trump, an item I seem not to have read.In sports parlance, Amis has juice, meaning energy, curiosity. That familiar scowl of his in photographs undoubtedly has something to do with being the son of Kingsley Amis, and yet Amis the elder is treated with a degree of kindness and maturity when he appears as a mediating figure in the general of arc of the career of Amis the younger.Full disclosure: I had a bad cold during the five days I spent dipping into this book.

Freddie Montgomery is The Book of Evidence, a novel by John Banville, is a good example of how much a good writer can do with a questionable premise. Freddie Montgomery is a trust-fund drifter who runs out of money and has to leave his wife and child on an island in the Med so he can return to Ireland and scrounge up what he needs to pay off one large, dangerous debt. He ends up focusing on stealing a valuable painting as step one in accumulating capital, but he is caught in the act and commits an unnecessary and brutal murder during his getaway. The text of the novel is a reflection on his time in jail, awaiting trial, his life, and the sordid happenings that led to his outburst of violence. He accepts blame, wants to plead guilty, and can't quite explain his brief descent into nihilism. He did it because he was annoyed, he was irritated, he just wanted a clean getaway, things weren't going right as the witness he unwillingly kidnapped fussed at him from the backseat. So he hammered her, literally, and left her for dead when he crashed the car...and she did die.Banville's writing is punchy, well-paced, and consistent in rendering Freddie's voice. He doesn't do a great job in providing a convincing backstory for most of the main characters, and there is the absence of a rationale for Freddie's irrationality. We aren't talking about Raskolnikov (Crime and Punishment), nor are we talking about Meursault (The Stranger).

Prior is bisexual, intelligent, haunted, and guilt-ridden, an expert manipulator (including of his doctor, Rivers) who draws on his doubleness for purposes that are both moral and sadistic. His tale is one of graphic misery, desperation, and ultimately, a measure of self-understanding.Lesser figures in the novel, low-life, upperclass, military, share a kind of directness that, in the context of the horrors of WWI, illuminates them quickly, adding to the narrative momentum.The psychological propositions regnant at the time drew heavily on what might be called a literary understanding of humanity, i.e., personal narratives matter and have lasting consequences.

Mary McCarthy, Hardwick's close friend, is recipient of the letters (at least that is how I interpret ""Dear M.)Above all, there is the beautiful writing, its pace, its wrinkles, its metaphors, its microscopic accuracy, and to carry the writing forward, there are transient characters: a washerwoman, a woman who manages her dreary life by attending Arthur Murray dance classes five nights a week, Hardwick's inscrutable, fertile, possibly indifferent mother, and then the semi-autobiographical author who makes decisions about what would be good to include, what can be left out.Most of my stories are ""a long time"" ago, but here's another one.

Vietnam, racism, drugs, women's freedom, and problems generated by urban decay infecting the suburbs are the main themes. Vietnam has faded from the scene (as of 2019) but the other issues remain alive. So there is a lingering social relevance to this story about a man, Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom, in Brewer, Pennsylvania being left by his wife, Joyce, who feels under-attended and not sexually satisfied, and then finding himself host to a runaway privileged white girl (18), Jill, and a fugitive from the law (for dealing drugs?), Skeeter, who is black, served in Vietnam and harbors extremely negative thoughts about the white world of ""the establishment.""The real vitality in this novel, however, lies not in social or political issues but in Updike's acutely observant style and his ability to bring a diverse cast of characters to life. America's problems, in other words, are less Updike's concern than Rabbit's concerns, his son's concerns, his wife's concerns, and so on.As a narrative device Rabbit serves Updike well. He is a white male of conventional views as of 1969 who is amazingly passive, perhaps because his wife having caused the death of one of their children ten years earlier took the life out of him. As the novel opens, he is informed by his father that rumors have it that Joyce is playing around. Harry doubts it, but it's true. Joyce then leaves him, and Harry accepts, almost welcomes, this rupture in his life, through which first Jill and then Skeeter squirm, each contributing to his education in the new world of women's liberation, black power, sexual freedom, and anti-war venom. Harry's suburban neighbors aren't equally complacent about the white girl and black guy shacking up in full view, however. So there is a tragic fire that Jill doesn't survive and Skeeter is blamed for, although he almost certainly did not cause.This is all colorful, full of good dialogue and great descriptions, Updike's paramount strength. It does seem to me, though, that the title of Rabbit Redux is a bit optimistic if there is any implication that somehow Harry has gotten a new grip on his life--and his wife. He remains fairly bewildered and passive albeit stubborn and peculiarly curious. Much of who he ""really is"" plays out in his sexual life, lack thereof, or fantasies. The scenes in which his prostitute sister, Mim, makes a return visit to Brewer, Pennsylvania, belie both Rabbit's worldliness (perhaps indifference) and naïveté, but these scenes possess an element of candor and intimacy that are persuasive. Mim has fallen, but she's done it in style. Ultimately, she goes to work (literally) in pushing Joyce away from her boyfriend and back to Harry, who isn't sure he wants her except as a mother to his son....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 28, 2019","Nov 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46917.Rabbit_Redux

This means that human beings in the 21st century carry within them distinct and powerful feelings about their needs for mates, for allies, for food and shelter, for a good reputation...and for children. And these feelings--which Wright proposes drive us more forcefully than our rationality--tend to distort our perceptions, leading to the suffering caused by jealousy, envy, greed, gluttony, fears large and small, and what is loosely called tribalism, as evident on the nightly news or your favorite website, to the detriment of humanity as a whole.This is a somewhat choppy book because tying evolutionary psychology to Buddhism takes a lot of work. Fortunately, Wright's take on Buddhism is what he calls ""naturalistic."" He focuses in particular on the ways in which meditation clarifies one's relationship to a host of Darwinian states of mind that pressure and stress us. He offers numerous personal anecdotes based on his experiences in meditation, but he does not present himself as an enlightened being speaking ex cathedra. To the contrary, meditation is a struggle for him; there are more misses than hits. And yet his experience and the experiences of others cause him to argue that a meditation practice can render one more objective, less reactive, calmer, of clearer mind, etc. Wright makes a strong case. Other advocates of meditation do, too. The problem, in a sense, is personal to everyone, however: who is willing to steadily devote a half hour every day...or an entire week...to sitting in silence, reflecting on his/her mind's restless attempts to persuade one that just sitting there isn't going to do it...not going to paint the house, not going to get you into a good college, not going to save your marriage?But no, Wright contends, all that isn't true. Just sitting there, taking note of one's thoughts, begins to give one power over those thoughts, which squirm into consciousness from millennia past and often are counterproductive exaggerations of the true state of things.The question then arises: If your thoughts are unreliable guides to the state of things, is there something else, beyond thoughts, that might be termed the deeper mind...less tribalistic, less concerned with material survival, less Darwinian, less excitable? Wright submits the answer is yes, even if most of us will never reach a state of enlightenment, and that our deeper mind has natural affinities with the deeper minds of others, is less judgmental, more open, more free, and more compassionate....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2019","Nov 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36374034-why-buddhism-is-true

Within a Budding Grove is encyclopedic in its analytic approach, extraordinary in a pictorial sense and superb in characterizations, but there are times when Proust is too Proustian, too insistent on turning psychological studies into philosophical conclusions and too self-indulgent in forcing relationships upon the reader that he himself ends up dismissing as insubstantial as well as ill-fated. And then there is the curious way in which Proust undermines his own massively constructed characters. Marcel is an adolescent boy in Part I of this novel; in Part II, when he is supposedly past adolescence, he remains something of a teenager, intrigued by teenage girls, overawed by contemporary males like Saint Loup (as passionate about literature as Marcel) and Charlus (clearly a heavily conflicted individual), and often apologizing for his neurotic nature and neediness. Gilberte, Marcel's first heavy crush, is the daughter of Swann and Odette. As intent as Marcel is in focusing on Gilberte, we know (because he tells us) that what we're encountering is ""his"" Gilberte, not ""Gilberte's"" Gilberte. Either way, she has a few striking moments (when she invites him to keep wrestling with her on a park bench) but generally isn't very compelling--not as compelling as Marcel imagines her to be. Swann is a marvelous figure precisely because he degrades himself through his infatuation with Odette, who, in turn, can be elevated in social status by Swann but can never outrun her long history as a woman on offer to many, many men. So Marcel tells us implicitly and explicitly that this pair, and their daughter, Gilberte, merit extraordinary attention while simultaneously diminishing them.As I read this volume of In Search of Lost Time, it seemed to me Proust's own neurotic brilliance was a perfect match for the sparkling, shattering decay of rigid social hierarchies in France around the turn of 19th into the 20th centuries. He blows up notions of plot and stable characterization exactly as a world once defined by aristocracies explodes. At one and the same time, Proust/Marcel is lofty in an extreme authorial sense--imposing his thoughts upon the reader-- and buffeted by doubts, hypocrisies, and misgivings. We are not here in what I would call the modernist period of Joyce and Eliot. We are in a pre-modernist period of stable instability. Proust/Marcel constantly tells us in different ways that the entire world depends on his account of it...or yours...or mine. This is relativism, but of the highest order--a relativism that exceeds yours or my talent so that what Proust/Marcel explains as the world is, aesthetically and intellectually, a definitive world, not very relative at all, a masterpiece of literary imagination that in some sense can't stop searching for lost time for fear that time and all that goes with it will disappear. Proust/Marcel has to go on and on because the reality that used to be only exists within his meditations. Were it not for the domestic, personal littleness of Proust's/Marcel's obsessions, he would be engaged in a truly heroic task. This is quite lovely in the sense that Proust/Marcel is strangely humble about his efforts at holding life together. What they tell us is, objectively speaking, rather preposterous, and yet even so, it really isn't pretentious.If I seem to have commented at length about Within a Budding Grove without providing any insight into ""what happens,"" it is largely because nothing happens. In the Proustian world, things happening is passé....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9484.Within_a_Budding_Grove

The early stories often are character sketches cum anecdote. They're good, but often end so abruptly that you wonder if there has been a problem with the text. Over time, Bowen preserved her gift of characterization and added to it a more complete sense of form. The stories she wrote through the 1930s are in some ways good examples of the short story genre reaching its conventional apex, promising and delivering tales that are provocative and yet full. The years of WWII prompted Bowen to push and pull her stories over the conventional apex and develop works that are sui generis, haunted and hollowed out by the bombing of London and bad news from the front. And then, after WWII, when things were supposed to be all right again and yet were not all right, Bowen demanded more of herself. Her characters do things one might expect in Beckett, they turn on each other more sharply, they reflect souls still living on spiritual rations. These later stories are the ones that feel most ""modern,"" especially since Bowen does not abandon her typical middle to upper class characters, instead she gives them sharp twists and kicks. Failing well has long been a virtue in Britain and, to some extent, in Bowen's native Ireland, but she discarded that theme after World War II and explored society failing poorly, stumbling. Her writing became less polite, if you will.There is a new collection of stories by Bowen just out with an introduction by John Banville, which I happened to read in the New York Review of Books. That's what caused me to read this collection--the same stories, after all, and Kindle is great for short stories. Banville elevates Bowen to the highest ranks of short story writers. Think Chekhov. I'm not sure I go along with his judgment in part because fat collections often include early stuff that isn't magnificent. Chekhov, too, wrote many light sketches early in his career that are good but not compelling. So I do prefer what are known as ""selected"" stories or ""selected"" poems, and if I were compiling such a volume, I would focus on Bowen's work from the late 1930s through WWII and into the war's aftermath. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 07, 2019","Nov 17, 2019","Oct 07, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/46042004-the-collected-stories-of-elizabeth-bowen

The odd thing about this work, with its narrative center in Prague, is that it reads a bit like watered-down Kafka. The whole Kafkaesque horror brought on by communism ought to hurt more, but Kundera humanizes and pulverizes it through historical references, personal details, and inventive strategies to combat reality, notably the strategy of forgetting (which can be an enforced punishment) and the strategy of laughter (which can transform the trivially meaningful into the spectacularly meaningless). Ultimately this novel/fiction is a post-modern artifact of a bygone era whose echoes and resonance may be inaudible to ears unfamiliar with the oppression the Soviet Union imposed on Czechoslovakia (which of course no longer exists).

The fundamental point is that anger per se is a losing proposition. Nussbaum gives two major reasons: 1) being angry, and taking revenge, is not going to restore life to a murdered relative; 2) being angry and humiliating the offender so as to lower her status in life won't raise the status of the person who has been offended except in a relative sense.Nussbaum argues that we should learn to transform anger into what she terms Transition-Anger, i.e., an anger that gives us the momentum to alter the conditions that led to the offense so that it is less likely to happen again. Example: Someone who commits a violent crime who has been neglected, malnourished and poorly housed and educated in her early years presents us with the opportunity to take on the conditions that spawned reckless rage in the first place more than on warehousing the offender in punitive conditions that offer no hope of rehabilitation.Nussbaum's overall thrust is social life that she terms welfarism--positive actions in support of the society's needs as a whole.Her philosophical roots trace back to Aristotle and Seneca (who wrote an important essay on anger) and proceed through Bentham and Mill. Seneca, the stoic, was of the view that anger gives external existence too much leverage on the internal peace of the self. He would have us cultivate detachment.Mill and Bentham focused on existence as a proposition of utility, i.e., what can we do that will lead us to something of value. Welfarism goes a step beyond utilitarianism, defining the specific value Nussbaum contends we should seek.Forgiveness seems to be given short shrift in this book, but Nussbaum would have it viewed along the same lines as anger--a rearward looking perspective that often does not achieve positive future results...unless connected to some kind of transitional reordering of future conditions.There are many philosophical (or simply logical) nuances embedded in this text that are interesting to consider, but the argument dwindles in force until the final chapters on anger leading to pointless revenge versus anger leading to a positive transition in the cases of King, Mandela and Gandhi. There we do see Nussbaum's proposition played out on large, complex stages. None of these leaders was ""perfect"" but each refused to be drawn into the cycle of revenge, counter-revenge, and so on--as exemplified by the miseries of the House of Atreus.The utility of this book (if I can use that term) is that it provides an opportunity to think with some sophistication about major contemporary issues, the most salient of which is the U.S. practice of maintaining an enormous ""system"" of penal institutions that are a form of ostracism, internal exile, banishment, or whatever you want to name what we do instead of looking at rehabilitation seriously and comprehensive social welfare programs even more seriously....more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,not setnot set,"Sep 08, 2019not set","Sep 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26721206-anger-and-forgiveness

As a consequence, the poise of these tales makes them more remarkable than their protagonists. They aren’t minimalist, though they are rather spare, and they have the air of knowing exactly what they are aiming for, usually a nostalgia for a lost romantic moment but sometimes the flat acceptance that said romantic moment was false, a lie, self-delusion.	The dustjacket blurbs suggest a similarity between Salter’s stories and John Cheever’s. Both authors published in the New Yorker. In some sense, Cheever was the architect of the New York story as we know it...or used to know it. Salter actually is a bit less romantic than Cheever, however. He doesn’t take flight like Cheever, he eschews some of Cheever’s fascination with domestic details, i.e., kitchens whose messiness is itemized versus kitchens, in Salter’s work, that are merely described as messy, enough said. Not that bottle openers and unwashed dishes are compelling, just that Cheever had a somewhat more robust and even fanciful take on the settings wherein adultery, character assassination, score-setting, and so forth take place.Salter’s stories thrive on being pared down and establishing a cadence that leads order to disorder.

They’re right there in the page, whole and complete.I was interested to see, after the last story, a note in which Salter thanks the Iowa Writers’ Workshop for letting him read his work. Some of the young writers gathered there might have found him rather quaint, but in the main, Salter really is a good example of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop approach to short stories: let them be plain, control them with a consistent tone, and have them turn on a minor psychological explosion, providing a satisfying, well-justified ending. Writing within a narrow emotional register, Salter produces stories that aren’t great, like some of Cheever’s stories, but very, very good....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2019","Aug 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18757.Last_Night

It's too good a piece of wandering reflection, a clever essay in joining diverse elements of dead empires, coastlines, colonialists, entrepreneurs, and enterprises like the manufacturing of silk, to insist that it keep pushing deeper into a given subject in the manner of a novel.

I love its balance. I love its casual daring. I love its quiet brilliance, its quirkiness, its pathos, and its mixture of cultural, geological, historical, and political detail. One day's walk begets five day's insights that then are woven into a half-hour's worth of startling writing. We are not dealing with art forms or philosophy here. There's no system, just the naturalistic tendency to observe, rather dispassionately, the way death and decay lead to fallow eons that lead to transmutation and rebirth.

In Part I, Salter is the child of a wobbling marriage and follows his wobbling father to West Point, a college that doesn't make much sense for Salter...but he ""falls in"" and this leads to Part II, focused on Salter's life as a pilot, highlighted by his service in the Korean war. Part II is followed by Part III, exploring Salter's adventures as a scriptwriter, director and producer in the movie business. Part IV rounds things out by sweeping through Salter's life as a novelist, journalist, and friend to many writers more famous than he.Salter is a gifted writer who sometimes writes sentences backwards, making the reader hold on tight in the search for what the sentence is really about. His strength is description. He's a romantic, something of a hero worshipper, a devoted student of character, and a sort of middle-ground philosopher who turns mortal doings and physical realities into metaphysical premises. The skies and their clouds have their say. Life and Death speak to one another. Certain men and women are doomed by their strengths. And so on. But metaphysics are helpful sometimes, and it can be interesting to see Salter pushing people, places and events over the line into the foggy beauty of Meaning in Paris and the Sublime in New York.The strength of this memoir draws on Salter's gift for friendship, generating wonderful, intimate details about the lives of others, and, to a lesser but fairly astonishing degree, his ability to describe what is going on when you are flying a jet fighter...especially when you are in the hunt, or being hunted. Like Ulysses Grant describing battles in his memoir, Salter conveys all the twists, turns, and maneuvers of his friends and enemies in the air. He makes the sky a veritable geography, giving it features and characteristics one would never imagine lacking his acute perception and intense experience.Irwin Shaw, a successful novelist in the 50s and 60s, is portrayed in this memoir as a man of extraordinary geniality and composure. One great anecdote: Shaw heard Hemingway wanted to belt him because he'd had an affair with Hemingway's fourth wife before she married Hemingway. On seeing Hemingway at Sardi's, Shaw walked over to Hemingway's table and said he heard he wanted to punch him in the nose. ""I'll be over at the bar when you're ready."" Hemingway left without visiting the bar.At one point, Salter notes that conversation would be pointless without gossip; apparently he thinks that is also true of memoirs. There's lots of gossip here: actors, writers, producers, artists, and many intriguing women Shaw pursued and sometimes caught and sometimes missed. Women are the reverse side of his hero-worshipping coin. He doesn't love all of them, but he loves a lot of them.Part III, with its lengthy account of life in the movie business, substantiates once again that being a scriptwriter is a dreadful affair, albeit the parties are great. Toward the end of Part III, Salter notes that a friend told him he was living a life unworthy of him. That's true. Salter isn't afraid to agree, much to his credit.Part IV is an evocative New York literary memoir when people knew one another and the corporations left publishing houses alone. Salter's descriptions of his favorite editors and their lifestyles are excellent.This is one of those books so fluently written that it almost reads itself. On balance, the high points compensate for the lows....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2019","Aug 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/174628.Burning_the_Days

His subjects are a small town in Illinois and scenes from lives led in New York, where he was a magazine editor. Some of the tales in this collection are gems of gentle irony that end in a flash; others dwindle like the day's last light. There are strivers, old maids, flops, busybodies, and family secrets throughout. Maxwell's style is clear, beautifully paced, and subtly evocative of certain times and certain places: where the old railroad bridge still stands, out of service; where the doll house used to be in the attic before the estate sale; the peculiarities of a chopped-up apartment in Murray Hill; the shadowy, boozy atmosphere of a New York bar where an older brother once again is leaning too hard on a younger brother, embarrassing him in front of his girlfriend.There's no rush in a Maxwell story. He doesn't write with electricity in his pen like Flannery O'Connor. He's a middle-class writer. Terrible poverty isn't his milieu. He's a mid-western American from the last century, the elms haven't all died yet, and cars only pass by now and then.So if you like short stories, here are some lovely ones, a good escape from the anxious, cranky country in which Americans live in 2019....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jul 2019,"Jul 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/560034.All_the_Days_and_Nights

I was living in Mexico and I recall one moment when I was wrapped up in Bly's near-polemical arguments and a bolt of lighting hit the wing of the small plane I was in as we descended into Mexico City's brown pollution. The lightning bolt sounded like the crack of a very large, heavy baseball bat hitting a fairly large metal ball. The plane kept flying and I kept reading.When this book came out in 1991, it must have made a similar sound hitting the skulls of most American poets, but as far as I know, they have kept writing the kind of poetry Bly objected to and continued to attend the MFA workshops that he truly despised.In Bly's well-documented view, many of the most successful American poets had succumbed to confession and technique as opposed to reaching into their unconscious for contact with the darkness that they then could return to the world and their readers. They eschewed discussing politics, tended to admire themselves a great deal, and focused too much on ""things"" as if ""things"" told us anything about the human condition. Bly also took the position that truly critical criticism was part of the poet's responsibility as opposed to mutual back-patting and blurbing. I would suppose the poetry world in America more or less loathed Bly for all this. He eviscerated James Dickey for his bloated self-regarding rhetorical exploits in writing poetry about his love affair with personal power. He knocked Karl Shapiro over for telling us what it is like to ride in a New York city bus and just not know what all the things--and people--really mean...probably nothing, I suppose.He took the critic/professor Harold Bloom to task for writing only about poets he admired and praising too highly the airy mysteries of Ammons and Ashberry. He suggested that critics in previous decades like Edmund Wilson and R.P. Blackmur did much harder, more important work both on what they liked and disliked--and telling us why.Poets Bly admired like James Wright got adulterated praise. He quoted one poem to make a point, not, as he said, to assert that it was great. Other poets he liked, Lorca, for example, also merited Bly's admiration for their sudden, swift descents into themselves and out again.As a diplomat, I hosted a luncheon for Bly a few years after I read American Poetry. I was in Germany at the time. Bly was cranky. Luncheons like that are no place for serious discussion, so what was anyone getting out of it? I could see that question in his eyes, and it's a fair question, so I didn't hold it against him, and I knew, from reading American Poetry, that he was fully aware that he made a practice of biting the hand that fed him. In other words, he wasn't innocent of accepting reading fees or grants or varieties of institutional support that helped him along as a poet and critic, even if such support, in his view, contributes nothing to literary accomplishment or culture.Not long ago I picked up a collection of Bly's poems and found them too self-involved on the one hand and too programmatic on the other, pitching a theory of human experience I didn't need repeated on page after page. But this book is truly wild, not at all domestic, and I loved the risks he took then even if he's a little old for them now....more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,not setnot set,"Jun 22, 2019not set","Jun 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1092229.American_Poetry

There's nothing in this handbook that can't be exported from metrical verse to non-metrical verse.The odd thing about reading this study is that it takes one back to 9th, 10th and 11th grade when the ornate rhetorical flourishes and diction employed by the likes of Shelley and Wordsworth were used to ruin one's interest in poetry almost entirely. You know the gig: hidden meanings and bursts of the sublime and all that.I don't know that reading Mary Oliver's handbook will breathe life into poems long ago slain by being forced on school kids too young to appreciate them (or relate to them), but this is an interesting sojourn in the shadowy forest of poetic formalities. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 17, 2019","Jun 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/201217.Rules_For_The_Dance

He seemed to be saying that by putting himself in play in his poems, Updike turned his literary skills on himself, generating scores of compelling poems. Well, I correct myself: that is exactly what he was saying and perhaps exactly why Updike's poems are not nearly as good as his fiction, just as he (and most writers, I would wager), was not as interesting as his fictional characters.Updike was brilliant, gifted, erudite, and fluent in literary forms. There's no question about that, but the burden of his poems, focused on him, lacks the heft--the interesting context--of his short stories and novels.He goes over much of the same ground in both fiction and poetry (memoir, too): Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, some Boston, some overseas stuff, but on reading this selection of his poetry, I felt his nakedness was a little on the thin side. He wasn't a confessional poet, though he had a good bit to confess; he was more of an observational poet. And the link to a story seems to be more vivid, in his case, than any link to his observed self (or should I say his self-observed self?)So these are good poems because Updike was a superb writer with an inventive imagination, but the thrill of reading him describe the burning of a house or a massive heart attack or exquisite sexual encounters (or near misses) as it relates to his invented characters and their dramas isn't the same when it comes to Updike not exactly being so graphic in his more fey, shy, word-dancing accounts of working outside in the winter or contemplating the essence of granite or remembering his time at Harvard in an ode to the graduating class of Harvard, circa 1970 something.Back to Leithauser: I don't usually read introductions and seldom reread them, but this time I did both, and I realized that he talked a great deal about Updike's fiction and not so much, really, about these poems. He did write, peculiarly, that Updike was a master of conjunctions and prepositions. Initially, I forgave this praise as one poetic technician paying homage to another. But on second reading, I thought, What a rotten thing to say!Look, the business of writing introductions often is akin to receiving the black spot in Treasure Island. You're it, no way out, and you have to be generous to a former friend (I suppose) and a major writer--indeed, a writer much more feted than Leithauser. But this is why reading introductions is generally a bad idea. The literary game of I'll-kiss-you-if-you-kiss-me is constant, and Leithauser undoubtedly had better things to do a few summers ago than write an eloquently evasive tribute to a poet who didn't look all that good naked.All that said, if you're a fan of Updike's (as I have been), maybe you would like to see him compress his verbal wizardry into sonnets and such.

They rest on a premiseThe essays in Joan Didion's Political Fiction cover American politics from the mid-1980s to the 2000 ""election"" of George Bush. They rest on a premise Didion validates over and over again: the stagecraft of national leadership in the United States is individual ambition in search of popular wherewithal, and when no wherewithal is to be found, it is readily enough created and then sold to an increasingly alienated, largely nonvoting public as ""true"" by a collaborationist press.U.S. political leaders, Didion shows, really don't want to have to deal with voters; they want to perform for each other and through media magic trick voters into believing what they say and do is in the national interest. There isn't, in Didion's view, that much difference between Republicans and Democrats at the highest levels except who is in power at a given moment. And both parties do their best to be the party in power by concocting political fables du jour that bewilder, belittle, and turn off the voting public. It's safe to cry, ""Fire!"", in the theater of American politics because there's almost no one in that theater anymore--the noise you hear is a canned soundtrack, a cacophony of special interests substantially unrelated to anything resembling your interests or mine.Didion's descriptions of Bill Clinton, Robert Dole, Newt Gingrich, and Bob Woodward are masterpieces of skewering still living flesh and then roasting it thoroughly. She presents Clinton and Gingrich as a pair of fraternal twins, which they were: two boys bounced around in weakly-fathered circumstances and determined through narcissistic resentment and odd brilliance (yes, they're smart, in a way) to be elected president of the senior class, the president of the United States, or Speaker of the House. The main theme in the Clinton portrait is self-pity, lots of it, the kid who is always on the comeback trail. The main theme in the Gingrich portrait is wacky intellectual self-delusion. But both guys were salesmen, and boy, did they sell whatever they thought the public would buy.As Bob Dole put it, he might start out saying one thing in a campaign, find that it didn't work, and end up saying something else. So what? That was politics. And with a bizarrely uncritical press led by a figure like Bob Woodward, the minstrel of method, not substance, Dole could say something like that and more or less (he lost the presidency to Clinton, after all) get away with it.Didion's analysis of how a group of sanctimonious ""evangelical"" fundamentalists, led in one battle by Ken Starr, is an excellent study of how even a failed impeachment/removal effort targeting Bill Clinton still shifted the national fantasy agenda away from security and prosperity to ""values,"" i.e., the Ten Commandments, the obligatory declaration by highest level aspirants that they were the followers of Christ Jesus our lord and savior. This led George W. Bush to espouse the nutty theology of a decidedly lesser saint propounding compassionate conservatism and faith-based organizations. And it led Al Gore to choose as his running mate the perpetually sincere, God-fearing Joe Lieberman (whose natural successor, of course, is the oddity known as Mike Pence.)Were Americans really that revolted by Bill Cinton's hijinks with Monica Lewinsky? Didion offers poll after poll indicating that they really weren't--that in fact a high percentage of Americans found themselves to be divorced Americans because they indulged in the same kind of private satisfactions.But polls themselves, Didion shows, are artful fictions designed by the political class to serve the political class's interests, and they seldom get at what average Americans want from political leaders.Over the last two decades, politics in America have just gotten worse. The ways in which the Reagan administration lied about what it was up to in Central America were fairly high-grade nutrition in comparison to the zero calorie lies machine-gunned our way on an almost hourly basis by the Trump administration.Trump himself validates Didion's thesis: lying doesn't matter in politics. Empty phrases like ""Make America Great Again"" or ""I'm going to build a wall"" matter, at least for the time being. To say that this is bad for the republic is to understate the case. The last forty years of political class leadership have been ever darker experiences. The white lies have turned into black lies, bald lies, insulting lies, boorish lies but apparently that's okay. Income inequality isn't a problem, guns aren't a problem, climate change isn't a problem...and if you think otherwise, why, let's simply declare we're going to have Medicare for all, college is going to be free, and all the polluting corporations in the U.S. are going to clean up their act.

Even the people we know are inventions we come up with, not truly independent beings; so, that is likewise the case when one character in Swann's Way interacts with another character.Part I focuses on the narrator's memories of childhood, primarily at a country house in ""Combray."" This is a slow-moving, infinitely detailed account of a brilliant, sensitive Peter Pan who doesn't want to grow up, so attracted is he to his mother.Part II focuses on Swann, who also has a house in Combray and who is lightly mentioned in Part I (and not favorably). Swann is wealthy, well-connected, a little bit Jewish, given to seducing maids and waitresses, and susceptible to the folly of falling in love with love, which he does by superimposing some of his most precious memories of great art on an artful prostitute who has risen to the level of kept woman. Odette is an opportunist, a kind woman when she wants to be, a woman who gets bored and can't help it, and someone who manages to utterly outmaneuver the far more sophisticated (in some limited senses) Swann.Part III is a kind of essay wherein Marcel advances Proust's notion that what happens in the shadows and fogs of minds is the most durable, most real, most compelling dimension of human experience. That being the case, the tale Marcel tells here about his frustrating childhood friendship with Swann and Odette's daughter (yes, they marry, but their marriage is not recounted in Swann's Way) Gilberte, is largely a fictionalized representation of what Marcel has chosen to name ""Gilberte"" and not necessarily whom you and I (reading Proust) would deduce to be Gilberte. (Clear? Well, no, but that's Proust.)The thing about Proust is the same thing I've heard said about Musil (The Man Without Qualities): you must read him slowly and a bit at a time to appreciate him. The fact that his books are thick shouldn't induce you to try to roll along as though you were reading Dickens or Tolstoy. Do that, and you'll end up frustrated, unsure about the complex distinctions Proust is throwing at you sentence by sentence, and not finishing the book you are hurrying to finish.I had a colleague who worked with me in Leipzig, Germany, who had been reading Proust for decades, renewing his acquaintance with things he knew well but loved savoring repeatedly. The totality of In Search of Lost Times, its completeness as a world unto itself, might best justify that if one were reading in French, which he did and I don't.In college, fifty years ago, I took a course focused on four novels, Swann's Way, Ulysses, The Magic Mountain, and The Brothers Karamazov. Swann's Way by far is the most unsuitable for undergraduate education in comparative literature precisely because it circles and circles itself in musings and obsessions related to Swann's infatuation with Odette that are ghastly explorations of jealousy way over a 19-year-old's head.The writer who resembles Proust in his constantly sharpening his point sharper and sharper is Henry James. There is a repressed and solipsistic quality to both of them, forever suggesting something and then correcting, modifying, and twisting it into something rather unlike what it was to begin with...and then going back to what it was to begin with and doing it all over again.So read Swann's Way slowly if you like the first ten pages and then read the next ten pages the same way...or after the first ten pages, set Swann's Way aside.

And I would hasten to add that I wouldn't call this a "";"" let's say here are some comments.As ""traditional"" as Dubliners are as short stories, I couldn't help wondering where the Joyce of Ulysess and Finnegans Wake lurked within them. Most of these pieces are modest, each could balance on the head of a pin, written with a light but sure touch. There's satire here but no gusts of comedy. Generally Joyce seems to have written them out of acute observation, not his fantasy or dream life.Some stories like ""Araby"" and ""Eveline"" hit a wild, perfect note at the end, anguishing failure and fear toppling the protagonists. Other stories--I'm thinking of ""Counterparts""--are more thoroughly drenched in whiskey and frustration from front to back. These latter stories are somewhat less satisfying. Short stories aspire to be wonderful throughout, of course, but they especially thrive when they are designed to peak in their final moments.Like Chekhov, Joyce is a master of immediate characterization. He captures the limp, the complaint, the loss, the vanity that mark a character right away. Again--observation. He was writing about the Dublin he knew as opposed to the one he later imagined. ""A Little Cloud,"" focuses on a reunion between a man who has lived ""bravely"" and a man who has not. There's a dead-end misery here that somehow loses its voice. That occurs in other tales as well. ""The Boarding House"" is more interesting than its ending, wherein a mother and daughter trap a man into marrying the daughter.""Ivy Day in the Committee Room"" takes the static nature of Dublin political life as its theme and works it into a handful of lay-abouts on election day. This is acute portraiture. Here are the boys who haven't worked all that hard to achieve any results.In ""The Dead"" Joyce orchestrates a masterful blend of general social characterization and private pathos darkening the fringes of a marriage. Gabriel realizes his wife Gretta loved and lost a young boy in her own youth, brought back to her by a snatch of song, and Gabriel is quite vulnerable to this realization because his Irish authenticity and force has been called into question by another woman earlier in the evening's festivities. This is a pitch perfect ""long"" short story; it goes beyond small tragedies to bigger, more varied subjects, capturing both Gabriel and Gretta's moods splendidly. The ending of ""The Dead"" is famous, of course, for its twisting beauty, doubling back on itself like the snow falling this way and that on Dublin, but I was struck by how artfully Joyce works through Gabriel's ratiocinations and rationalizations before that ending. He's a man with an unexpected wound, but he sees it is not a fatal wound, and he takes time to assess its mysteries....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Apr 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11012.Dubliners

He seems to have felt a bit uneasy about this premise, given that real blood was spilled and real friends died throughout his writing career, but he consistently found what endures below the fog of strife by focusing on moments of quotidian revelation. Ironically, he wrote a poetry that explored the unselfconscious poetry of others' lives--the lives of the farmer, stonemason, the old man fishing, the young boy fiddling with the radio, the woman betrayed, the husband adrift in his reckonings of failure, which he saw all around him. These illuminations were scoured from the landscape of Catholic Northern Ireland, heaved up before us as Heaney pursued his art with glacial but steady persistence.He wrote in his Nobel lecture that he had a hard time with how much he loved the exoticism of Wallace Stevens and the romantic sweep of John Keats. He didn't think such poetics befit someone from his own modest upbringing, but he did manage to capture the tensions of rough beauty and rough reality rubbing up against one another in a way that placed him in the orbit of poets so renowned. Robert Frost comforted him, as one might imagine: plain spoken, direct, detailed. Emily Dickinson thrilled him with her ethereal inwardness, likewise Rilke.If I have a perverse comment to make about this volume it is that ""selected poems"" tend to be too many poems, more than a reader really would want to take on. I've had the same complaint about Auden's selected poems, Robert Penn Warren's and so forth.

The focus here is primarily on the IRA, which Gerry Adams says he did not lead and which, according to this book and many other accounts, he did in fact lead. There's an unresolved tale of a kidnapping and execution by IRA members at the book's heart, and there are numerous studies of the men and women who committed acts of terror, spent many years in jail (or extra-judicial internment), and ultimately found themselves falling short of their goal: incorporating Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland today (April 10, 2019) remains a fairly segregated society, Catholics on one side of the street, Protestants on the other (figuratively speaking). So the horrors of insurgency and counterinsurgency led to a form of peaceful hostility and mutual suspicion. That's more than a pity. In his concluding comments, Keefe cites anthropologist Claude Levi-Stauss's view that such antagonism is attributable in part to the fact that there is no such thing as ""humanity."" Instead, there are many different ""humanities,"" each ending at the border of ethnic and sectarian divides.That's one way to generalize about ""the Troubles,"" but in fact the history in Keefe's own book better explains what's wrong with Northern Ireland and has been wrong since it was held apart from the new Republic of Ireland in the 1920s. Northern Ireland is a remnant of Great Britain's faded imperial grandeur, a remnant Great Britain doesn't even want to hold onto. Yes, there is a majority of ""loyalist"" Protestants in Northern Ireland, as opposed to the huge majority of Catholics in the Republic of Ireland, but Northern Ireland is like Gibraltar, in some ways. It makes no sense that a slice of Ireland remains connected to London. But on concluding this book, one can't say that the acts of terror and barbarism committed by all parties in the 60s, 70s, and 80s made any sense, either. Truly vicious behavior begets truly vicious behavior. The people portrayed in Say Nothing were destroyed by their own acts of destruction. They succumbed to alcohol, PTSD, ostracism, and abandonment by friends and family alike. The creepiest figure of all is Gerry Adams. Through his sources, Keefe presents an operator who knew how to keep his hands clean and perhaps always believed that the acts of violence he authorized would not lead to Northern Ireland becoming part and parcel of the Republic of Ireland. He followed a tactical course that never let him down: deny everything, deny you are Gerry Adams, deny you have had anything to do with the IRA, let others do the dirty work. This turned out to be a crushing revelation to his quondam comrades, but I must say that Adams was right if he thought, all along, that the IRA, the Provos, the Real IRA or any other force never could push the British out of Northern Ireland.As we look around the world at innumerable sectarian conflicts, a look back at ""the Troubles"" via Keefe's book is sobering and worth reading. Ironically, of course, the status of Northern Ireland is a big problem in the Brexit context. The Conservative government depends on Northern Ireland's protestants for twelve crucial votes in Parliament; otherwise, it will lose control of that august body. But of course those twelve votes have contributed heavily to the Conservative government losing control of the entire country and Great Britain's place in Europe and the world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2019","Apr 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40163119-say-nothing

As far as books coThe Course of Irish History compiled by Theodore Moody is a book drawn from a TV series built on lecture/essays by noted academics. As far as books covering 2,000+ years go, this is a solid introduction to an island that has been imaginatively cursed and blessed by waves of intruders, including the Norse, the Normans, the English and to a certain extent the Celts themselves. The chapters overlap a bit but that's not a significant problem. Anatomizing Ireland is no easy task. In some ways the best chapter is the first one, surveying Ireland's geography, which has so much to do with its destiny--an island riven with mountains and bogs, transected by rivers, green with pasture lands, fertile in some places and rocky in others, and wrapped around with a wild coastline that only occasionally yields to useful harbors.Of all the curses that beset Ireland, one would have to rank the English highest, although even they are bred into its human fabric. Their occupation of the island was partial but persistent, covering centuries, exploiting scarce resources, dominating some parts of the population and setting other parts of it against other parts. They never seem to have thought Ireland was the greatest of prizes, but it was there, and they didn't want the Spanish or French helping themselves to it. In the end, their policy's lasting impact derives from supporting protestant immigration to the north, and so, on top of geographical divisions, we see a political division that remains extremely inconvenient to the English as well as the Irish, given the role the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland plays in Brexit. To use the old phrase, the English can't seem to chew Ireland and can't seem to spit it out.Membership in the EU, ironically, would appear to be Ireland's greatest blessing--the Republic's greatest blessing, I mean. The EU has provided a powerful counterweight to the U.K.'s asymmetrical domination of the Irish economy. This is a good thing, just as staying in the EU would be a good thing for the U.K.This book is better on physical culture (ruined castles, monastic artifacts) than on literary or musical culture. It's not very analytic, but mentioning Yeats and Joyce and the other great Irish writers may be enough to convey the point: here is an apex tale-telling, story-spinning culture, one of the world's finest.The book's final chapters, covering the last five decades of Irish history, are rushed, crammed, and generally dismal. Here you have immense political corruption, financial chicanery, and the sins of the Roman Catholic church.

Here are family feuds, painful loves, poignant disappointments, and a few risky adventures beyond Ireland's shores, leaving the small towns, hamlets and farms of Ireland behind.I don't know that I would call O'Brien a master of the short story form in the category of a Chekhov, Joyce, or William Trevor. In his introduction, John Banville places her there. But I definitely find a quality of mastery in her work albeit smudged by a lack of conciseness. Her stories are close to mesmerizing even when they lurch a bit and go on too long.In fairness, there's something about contemporary writing that can never be as ""good"" as the now accepted classics, of course, so I'll set unjust comparisons aside in favor of commenting on O'Brien's splendid characterizations--all her characters live and breathe--and skill in delineating the faultlines and conflicts in what might be called ""Irishness."" Most of the stories in The Love Object are modern literary stories in the sense that they aren't really stories at all. They have no more plot than there's a plot in rain and fog. To me that's good. Life lacks plot, or if it has plot, it's contested, questionable ground. What O'Brien gets at is the incompleteness of human relations, the truths that can be known but through bad timing, mishaps, and perhaps ill will, can't quite be said, or would be too painful to be pronounced.Many women are hurt in O'Brien's stories and on occasion when they're not hurt--or not yet hurt--they find themselves caught up in romantic fantasies that are not entirely convincing. But men are hurt here, too, often out of misguided sentiment, anger, bad luck and drink, lots of drink. Triumph doesn't really play much of a role in the world she portrays because it would have to come at someone else's expense, and that's no triumph at all.

Jarrell must have written it the way Nabokov is said to have written--notecard by notecard, pasting each in place when he had finished anatomizing one of his targets: the college president, the college president's secretary, the visiting writer-in-residence, the permanent composer-in-residence, and so forth.Small women's colleges aren't completely thing of the past, but they don't have quite the resonance they had in Jarrell's day, and I don't know that they quite make sense as objects of satire anymore, but that's not the book's weakest point, which is the way it loses track of itself from time to time, taking something on and dropping it and then taking it on again.This can be a technique that works. The closest thing to Pictures, in my mind, is work by Henry Green, which doesn't go anywhere, either. Fussing about can be amusing, but sometimes it's distracting, as in: what the hell is going on now?When summer arrives, the students and faculty scatter and the book is over. No more pictures. And yet the emptiness of a campus in summertime can be poignant, just as, in my opinion, Christmas break on a campus is the best time of year of all, a time when ghostly fugitives from their families and students from abroad who can't afford to go home are free to think their own thoughts, no longer syllabus-bound, and take long walks in the snow.Ultimately, Jarrell was a poet.

Against his better own better judgment, he proposes. As she matures, she discovers the cosmopolitan appeal of St. Petersburg, which her husband already has come to disdain. The best scenes in this affecting descent into realistic accommodation as opposed to romantic love have to do with the two of them baiting one another, withdrawing from one another, and generally underperforming their personal values. In the end, their love still glows but casts off neither flames nor light.""The Death of Ivan Ilych"" is a harsh judgment on an upwardly mobile, vaguely noble bureaucrat who learns that death, which is supposed to happen to someone else, is happening to him. The way he is emotionally abandoned by his family before he expires is highly educational and not altogether unwarranted. And then he tumbles into the tunnel of no return, a ghastly journey. This is a masterpiece of narration and irony. Tolstoy always has a grip on his subject here.The same cannot quite be said of ""The Kreutzer Sonata,"" which suffers from a gassy run-up to the facts of the matter, i.e., our protagonist's transformation from a civilized human being into a murderer who gets away with it...not that he ends up pleased with what he's done.Hadji Murad is a tale of Russias endless assaults on the peoples of the Caucasus region. Hadji is a chieftain at war with another chieftain. He's decided to align himself with the Russians in the hopes of rescuing his kidnapped family and taking over as the principal lord of of the Muslim lands (under Russia's control, however). This is a majestic story of action, ethnographic insight, and cross-cultural cynicism. One really striking passage is the portrayal of the czar, brutally and blindly pulling strings from St. Petersburg. Tolstoy leaps back and forth between dramatically different settings with complete ease and authority, and here, I would say, his ghastly ending not only comports with historical realities but also reflects a naturalistic as opposed to moralistic perspective. He cannot like but cannot dispute Hadji Murad's fate.I've read these stories before--and so have you, I imagine--but found them worth rereading.

There's simply a graceful flow to this translation, a quick pace, an instinct for directness that, in fact, is very true to the original Greek.I can say this, with some hesitation, because the last time I read The Odyssey (fifty years ago) I was reading it in Greek. I was a senior in high school at the time and what struck me then, as I am struck now, is the firm simplicity of Homer's language. The Odyssey had to ring true in the original because it was spoken poetry; it needed to go right into the ear and then right into the brain, more or less arrow-like.Wilson succeeds in getting the ""story"" quality of the poem right. Her lines are pleasingly short, her meters simple. That said, she also brings out something that hasn't been entirely clear to me. The bulk of the tale is so well known, with so many gory but half-comical episodes wherein Odysseus outwits fate (with Athena's help), that it's possible, almost inevitable, to miss a change in tone in the final books. Here there are no weird creatures causing trouble. The troublemaker, the real killer, is Odysseus. He absolutely wants to murder Penelope's suitors, just as he absolutely wants to hang those serving girls in his house who have been more on the suitors' side of things than Penelope's. The Iliad is the bloodiest book I think I've ever read. That judgment still stands, but the final books of The Odyssey are brutal, and Wilson gets at this brutality, lending it a realism that is not make-believe at all. Concomitantly, Odysseus displays a rough deceitfulness that is somewhat superfluous, especially when he first encounters his grief-stricken father, Laertes. But the burden of his suffering makes him that kind of mistrustful, manipulative man, and Wilson's plain translation lets this show through.It's odd, when you think about it, that Joyce decided to portray Odysseus as a kind of anti-Odysseus, i.e., Leopold Bloom. There's no killer in Bloom, but Joyce wanted to write an ironic comedy where a killer wouldn't have fit.In a way, Emily Wilson now joins the centuries-old line of bards retelling this tale and making it hers. Her style is understated, effortless, and cuts close to the original bones of one of the world's greatest poems....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2019","Jan 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey

Haven, is an intriguing, sometimes heavy-going, study of a radical French intellectual wEvolution of Desire, a biography of René Girard by Cynthia L. Haven, is an intriguing, sometimes heavy-going, study of a radical French intellectual who built his career in American universities but never lost touch with France. Girard began his career writing about literature and expanded beyond literature into speculations of a more anthropological cast. He contended that literature is data, it can be mined, it is an artifact molded by and true to life. So he moved from writing about Cervantes and Proust to probing the Old and New Testaments and the German philosopher of war, Clausewitz...with thousands of forays into other writing, some literary, some sociological, some theological.Haven's portrait is of a beloved if controversial academic who was reserved but kind, ironic but gentle, and relentlessly wrapped-up in his thoughts, taking him from Johns Hopkins to SUNY Buffalo and back to Johns Hopkins and finally to Stanford. Girard was, intellectually, a humanist, and yet he also was, by dint of a personal conversion, a Christian. He located the source of human desire, often yielding violence, in mimesis, or copying. As a Spaniard once told me about Spaniards in general, envidia (envy), is the most important fact about Spanish society. And then a Mexican told me the same thing about Mexicans...make your own mind up if it is also true about your nation, wherever you live.Girard would have it that groups admiringly copy one another, end up contesting each other's possessions/achievements, and the ensuing conflict, if it comes to an end, arrives by means of a hero (think Christ) being martyred...a hero on the loser's side, of course. So that's a core thought, not Freudian sex or death drives: we emulate on another, band together and violate one another and end up accumulating a series of martyrs (not just Christ) as mementoes of humanity's inability to transcend its covetousness, which extends beyond possessions to customs, virtues and values.Well, I like reading books like this even though in this case Haven knew Girard and there are times when her personal appraisals and reports have the quality of magazine writing. Those passages can be forgiven, however, because there are numerous instances of her reaching beyond her multitude of sources to express exceedingly complex ideas than the sources themselves (Girard himself, I would say) were able to do.Girard seemed embarrassed to be accused of having concocted a theory of mankind, but in the final chapters of the book his early theory of mimesis takes a turn that encompasses a theory of history, too. From the French Revolution on, we begin to see violence itself as the greatest of historical forces...and a force that increasingly is beyond control...not subject to reconciliation by martyrdom (the loser's consolation.) On the one hand, we now have nuclear weaponry. That's potentially apocalyptic. On the other hand, we have the provocations of smaller twists of the technological knife...airplanes flying into buildings, for example. And then there is the furnace of social media, chockfull of envy, stoking violence, threatening to catch us all up in an uncontrollable dynamic of mutual accusation that turns into an endless string of violent acts (think Sandy Hook, think Las Vegas, think Charlie Hebdo, think Yemen, think Ukraine, think Syria) to which we become accustomed and anesthetized.Haven gets into all this through conversations with Girard in his last years and through his final book on Clausewitz. In a sense, so much is taken into consideration that it's impossible to consider it all. In another sense, there's a ring of truth here....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,Jan 2019not set,"Jan 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36459725-evolution-of-desire

The infamous camp at Dachau isn't far from Munich, after all.During its feisty and courageous battle with Hitler and his cronies, the Post's editors had their offices ransacked and often were taken to court for, unbelievably, libeling Hitler and company.

It's an historical response to today's intimidation tactics, including cries of false news and butchering journalists in consulates or detaining them in prisons or finding other ways to silence them.What's particularly interesting here is the fact that Hitler's methods and intentions were obvious to those German journalists who had the courage to look at them, analyze them, and denounce them. Hitler didn't emerge out of a dark cloud that suddenly appeared German skies. People knew who he was and what he was up to. And yet only a few brave souls stood up to him and opposed him.

The River of Consciousness is a volume of pieces published in the New York Review of Books and selected by Sacks for inclusion here only a few days before his death. His editorial team and designees have done a wonderful job arranging these meditations on speed, consciousness, the intricacies of the brain, Darwin, and the sentience of plants.Each piece has a thematic unity that is enriched by Sacks astounding ability to digress and yet hold the thread of thought firmly between his fingers. And each piece is stylistically a marvel of lucidity, pace, and one, sometimes drawing scientific history, sometimes drawing on Sacks' personal experiences as a doctor and thinker, and sometimes drawing on his capacity as an intellectual historian.For me his most useful observations have to do with the changing nature of science itself from the 19th century through the 20th. Fundamentally the science of the 19th century was rooted in detail, the accumulation of annotations relevant to a given subject. A hinge figure was Darwin, who both recorded every little thing he saw and at the same time felt the pressure to consolidate his findings into theoretical form--ergo, evolution. Theory can never be detached from ""fact"" and yet Einstein took us into a paradigm-shift based on an entirely different theory of time and space. Freud is less well known as a neurologist than as a psychoanalyst, but as Sacks (and others) observe, Freud's first twenty years as a doctor were heavily invested in neurological data collection. Sacks then comments on how Freud's experience in natural science blended rather naturally into his psychologizing in broader terms. He mentions the famous case of Anna O--a case of hysteria, demonstrating weird somatic effects emerging from even weirder psychodynamics--and this caused me last night to reread that case in light of Sack's analysis. In fact, it's true that one can see Freud driven from nonplussed doctoring to psychodynamic theorizing for compelling reasons. And with Anna O, the history of psychology, as we know it, was changed.But writing in the 21st century Sacks has moved far beyond those early days of mental mystery, giving us glimpses of the multi-tiered neuronal complexity that underlies sight, thought, memory and identity.I understand one more book of this nature is in the offing.

The story focuses on Strike, a rather orderly and cautious adolescent deputy in the sales chain, a homicide cop named Rocco, and Strike's brother, Victor, who takes someone out (kills him) because that someone has been getting in Strike's way.The street and drug jargon, atmospherics, characterizations are depressingly realistic, likewise the outcomes. Small flames of moral concern burn here and there in the projects and some of the cop cars, but there's a whirlwind spinning around the cocaine game, snuffing out those flames along with many lives.Have things changed in the last 25 years? I doubt it. That's why Price's tale of degradation and mayhem remains relevant. It's too long, and some of the story lines simply disappear, but the denouement, which is a downer, has a listless kind of power, a lull preceding more of the same in north Jersey and around the country.At times Price inserts himself in the internal reflections that drive Strike and Rocco toward one another.

A described lone wolf, Seymour Hersh's reporting on foreign policy, national security and intelligence affairs has been required reading for decades. A described lone wolf, Hersh has had numerous relationships with major news organizations, notably the New York Times and the New Yorker, but his real strength has been the tenacious and patient network of sources he's developed and kept active long after one major story has passed...helping lead him to the next one.Hersh's memoir, Reporter, opens with his very basic Chicago beginnings. His father ran a dry-cleaning store and for a time it looked as though Hersh would be saddled running it indefinitely after his father's death. But that was impossible. He was too smart not to be noticed by mentors who helped enroll him in the University of Chicago and then move through the news networks in the Midwest to Washington and ultimately to the world.In wonderfully vivid, clear, fast-paced prose, Hersh takes us through his major breakthrough--reporting on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam--to Watergate stories, CIA exposés, the Abu Ghraib atrocities in Iraq, etc. He's often more kind to editors he worked for than they were to him. I can only deduce that Abe Rosenthal of the New York Times was jealous of him, for example. But even though investigative journalism, of which he is the great master, is a rough business, he has reached his eighth decade still marveling at his partners and rivals in reporting, giving credit where credit is due to journalists like Bob Woodward.One of the mysteries of investigative journalism is why it's necessary. It's hard to believe that JFK or LBJ or Nixon or Henry Kissinger or a handful of CIA directors so often decided that lying and deceit were the best way to deal with their misjudgments and mistakes. (Today Donald Trump takes this practice to an extreme, a fool like no fool in the history of the Republic.) But the truth about Vietnam or overthrowing Allende in Chile or letting prison guards turn into torturers in Iraq (while CIA officers became torturers at black sites around the world) always has been too much for our leaders to frankly admit.

It's fascinating. Did Syria under Assad have to become what it has become? Hersh makes us wonder about that. Has there ever been a worse ally than Pakistan (or now, Saudi Arabia)?

Doudna is, for the nonscientist, a perplexing but stimulating book that comes in two parts. The firstA Crack in Creation--Gene Editing by Jennifer A. Doudna is, for the nonscientist, a perplexing but stimulating book that comes in two parts. The first part is the fairly technical description of how the gene editing technique known as CRISPR was developed; by means of CRISPR, genes can be severed and altered. This has relevance to genetic-based diseases as diverse as Huntington's and dwarfism, but CRISPR is still in its early stages. Actual ""cures"" appear to be some years off. Further, the modalities of gene cutting/editing/splicing aren't quite as clear to me, at least, as I would like them to be. Doudna doesn't spend much time explaining where and how corrective DNA materials are to be developed (and are being developed). Nor does she explain exactly how the repair will cascade through an entire organism. This isn't because she doesn't know. She's a world-class scientist. It's more a question of being torn between writing a scientific paper and writing a book for highly-educated but nonscientific consumption. She just sweeps certain interesting topics under the rubric of even more interesting topics, i.e., how we now are on the verge of being able to correct genetic conditions (some of them) and even head them off at the embryonic stage. The dismally simple illustrations that accompany the text are a good illustration of what happens when she is determined to mention something but not do much to illuminate it.That's part one of the book. Part two is an account of her efforts to generate a global dialogue on the implications of being able to modify what she calls the ""germline"" in embryos such that certain desirable characteristics (let's say athleticism, becoming a Lance Armstrong a birth without the need of drugs) are embedded in certain privileged populations of the future. This leads her to describe international meetings that revolved, basically, around a renewed interest in the possibility of eugenics. She takes great pains to counsel prudence, patience, and caution. Most but not all leading scientists in her field seem to agree with her. She likes to compare gene editing as a transformative possibility on a par with nuclear weapons--something so powerful as to potentially change the course of the human race, and something that has been subjected, for decades, to a multi-tiered effort to constrain their proliferation.I'm not sure this is the best way to look at gene editing as a challenge to public norms and interests. In some ways, gene editing apparently will be of great benefit to humanity but it's not going to be as expensive (at such an industrial scale) as nuclear weaponry. Nor will it largely be under state control (meaning both good, responsible states and bad, irresponsible states.) Private pharmaceutical companies already are buying heavily into this field. There's going to be a global dissemination of materials, know-how, and expertise, and there likely will be a gray or black market for fiddling with the human genome. I don't mean to sound overly pessimistic or to downplay the importance of Doudna's efforts to provoke broad pubic discussion, but it's human nature to err, and as she points out repeatedly, our DNA (yours and mine) errs and corrects itself (or fails to correct itself) on a daily basis.Beyond that, one can easily imagine the most advanced states and the wealthiest individuals feeling justified in editing/replacing lesser gene stocks for reasons of both ""national security"" and personal privilege. What's known, as Doudna points out, can't be unknown. On a more positive note, Doudna gives us excellent insight into the global scientific community's methods of collaborative competition. What we see here is instantaneous diffusion of important discoveries and a degree of honest, ethical self-regulation of scientists and labs claiming victories and admitting failures. On the fringes of this particular issue, however, we do see dollar signs looming like skyscrapers. So the basic question she raises in part two of this book comes into conflict with the basic findings of part one: how is a public debate going to be conducted when the complexity of the issues to be debated far exceed public understanding? Hiroshima and Nagasaki showed everyone the power of nuclear weapons.

His journal ran only from 1660 to 1669. It covered that period of his life in all its dailiness, lechery, marital difficulty, rise to influence, and exceptional egotism, but along the way it homed in on the various struggles within England and between England and Holland (and France, to an extent). Tomalin considers it--the journal--a novelty in literature, perhaps the first dispassionate self-assessment in the modern era. Given that Pepys told graphic tales on himself as well as others (but he didn't publish any of it during his lifetime), this may be true. But again, it is an idiosyncratic work that makes it somewhat of an outlier in the English literary canon; in a sense, it's one of a kind: quotidian, funny, insightful, eloquent and wide-ranging.No aristocrat would have written as Pepys did perhaps because no aristocrat would have had to rise as far and fast in society as Pepys did. And no aristocrat would have worked as hard at his job--naval affairs--as Pepys did because aristocrats are born to something, while Pepys was born to nothing. The pleasure of Tomalin's book comes from both how well-informed and astute she is about Pepys' life and times but also from how forgiving she is, accepting Pepys as a product of his life and times, hard on women while cherishing, even worshipping them, good at adding to his fortune by taking continuous bribes, and gifted in making and sustaining friendships.

These stories are, in the main, acutely informed by Updike's skill with details, whether he's writing about Africa, Australia, the Middle East or Middle America. They are witty, ironic, and well-played against the somewhat stolid figure of a writer who isn't exactly ""blocked"" and isn't exactly lazy and certainly doesn't think he deserves any special consideration for whatever it is that has stalled his wobbly arc into the literary firmament. He knows people are nicer to him than he deserves, even when engaging in anti-American rants, but the truth is that being perplexed about himself and the world isn't a terribly painful fate for Bech. He sees modern life as a kind of show, a somewhat faded, jaded repetition of historical enmities, passions, and ill-conceived prejudices.A devout or practicing Jew? No, of course not. A writer who is as significant among other Jewish writers like Bellow and Roth? No, of course not.

Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, relates many of their joint findings and adds a few others. Had Tversky lived long enough, he would have received the Nobel Prize in Economics with Kahneman, but unfortunately, he didn't. So...psychologists win a Nobel Prize in Economics? Well, to complicate things, I personally think this book, and Kahneman/Tversky's work in general, focuses on human nature, a subject that is spread across the social sciences and humanities and is rarely dealt with in and of itself. Thinking, Fast and Slow, goes beyond psychology and economics into the core realities of what it is to be human. It deals with judgments and decision making, happiness, risk taking, pain, time, memory, bias, and the physiology of human reactions thereto--how our pupils dilate under certain circumstances, how we tend to walk more slowly when recently exposed to melancholy words, our skin temperature, our respiration, etc.I wish this book had been available 50 years ago when I took a required psychology course as a freshman in college. It would form an excellent two-semester text by itself. It also would enable an ambitious high school senior to do better on SAT tests. A good bit of human error, it turns out, is a deficiency when it comes to statistics and estimates. Kahneman is on top of that: He shows how we bid high when we should bid low, why we hold onto less valuable objects rather than trade them for more valuable objects, and why we generally and foolishly think we can ""outsmart the market."" Kahneman's method, developed with Tversky, is to formulate a question that can be employed to reveal human dispositions empirically. For example, we tend to remember the endpoint in pain (if it ends) more clearly than we remember the experience of pain as it unfolds (in real time). For another example, our marriages tend to last longer based on avoiding lots of low points as opposed to achieving lots of high points. One of my favorite chapters in this book has to do with planning. Human beings are terrible planners. They're over-optimistic. They think they can perform tasks under budget and before the deadline. Sit back and contemplate the public works projects you've read about and try to remember one that came in under budget and on time. But this begs the question: Why are human beings terrible planners? Generally, it's because they eschew expertise, assume they can do something cheaper, faster and better than their predecessors simply because they're smarter, and do not bother to conduct what Kahenman calls a ""pre-mortem,"" which is a description of what will happen after a corporate merger fails or a new product flops. Kahneman's observations on optimism, as in optimists, ring true. Optimists are born, not made. Optimists don't suffer deep wounds of self-doubt post disaster. That said, there's no real reason for optimists to succeed more than pessimists except a very simple one: they keep trying. This takes us back to Michael Jordan, who observed that he scored a lot because he missed a lot of shots, but he didn't miss them all.One of Kahneman's most interesting and important chapters deals with ""regression to the mean."" In all realms of human endeavor, a mean exists. This mean can be increased by diligent practice or decreased by negligence (or bad luck.) Yes, there will be fluctuations, but over time, events will regress to the mean. Jordan will score 40 one game and 20 the next, and his scoring mean will end up 30 and over 15 years, all scoring considered, that's where it will stay.I've saved Kahneman's overarching framework for understanding human nature for last. He proposes, somewhat arbitrarily, that we have two basic systems. System 1 is our instinctive, intuitive, what-you-see-is-what-it-is system. That's how we negotiate familiar issues without thinking--we can talk and drive at the same time, we know red is red, we expect mom not to approve. System 2 is our SAT system: It's analytic, rational, reflective, cautious, and strategic. Some of us are more impulsive than others (although we're all impulsive to a certain degree). Others tend to hang back, look things over, raise questions. So there's a blend--the individual who is more 1 than 2 and the individual who is more 2 than 1. System 1 is essential for basic survival. System 2 is essential for prospering.Often we think of psychology in terms of insecurities, disorders, phobias, traumas, obsessions, etc. Viewed from Kahneman's perspective, these phenomena would show up in individuals and be treated as such, clinically. They do constitute psychology in that sense, but human nature is a broader subject. It is that set of characteristics that everyone shares and constitute what could be called existence, at least insofar as human beings can know it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Oct 2018,Oct 2018,"Oct 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow

It moves at a fast clip, it brings the Trump wars to life (and there are many, many Trump wars), and it is refreshingly uncluttered by Woodward's characteristic plodding writing, full of clichés. At the center of the storm, howling like Lear, stands Donald Trump, concisely summed-up by his former lawyer, John Dowd, as ""a fucking liar.""Trump's addiction to lies, to exaggerations, to things he thought ""thirty years ago,"" to his own existential centrality shows up everywhere. He doesn't know much and doesn't care to learn things from his cabinet secretaries, generals, or intelligence officials. He enters into tirades that I suspect surpass anything the worst bullies in the White House (think histrionic Lyndon Johnson, think a red-faced furious Bill Clinton, think a snide, biting George W. Bush) ever engaged in.Woodward does a remarkable job portraying Trump's agenda while sinking it with the criticisms of every authority and expert around him. Trump wants to cut off America's costly alliances (no matter the security benefits) and he wants to keep out undesirables and he wants to reconstruct a manufacturing economy that began sputtering and going out of business in the 1950s. And the environment, climate change? No, Trump endorses exploitation, not conservation.Some of Trump's worst battles were with his economic advisor, Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs. Cohn clearly gave Woodward a lot of time as he did his research. He wasn't cowed by Trump but he was frustrated, disheartened and ultimately sickened by him. Charlottesville was the end of the line for Cohn. He is portrayed in this book saying things to the president that almost no one says to any president, let alone the hyper-sensitive Trump...but they were well-deserved jibes.The successful cabinet secretary here is James Mattis. He is a man of few words, such as, Mr. President, the reason we have troops in South Korea is to prevent World War III. But Trump doesn't want to get it. Again and again, he comes back to the trade deficit the U.S. has with South Korea, the European Allies, Canada (nonexistent), Mexico and so on. 99.9% of economists argue that trade deficits don't disadvantage the U.S., but Trump knows better. He doesn't want any relationship that is a true relationship (one of trust, giving and taking, supporting). He wants transactions, in his favor. Let's be friends: I win, you lose. The wild success Woodward's book is having has much to do, it seems to me, with the growing alarm Americans are experiencing in reaction to his presidency, but I wonder if a lot of the backstabbing, maneuvering, and so forth here isn't really ""inside the Beltway"" stuff. I worked in the belly of the beast for 25 years and had my share of contact with the great and powerful from presidents on down, so it all makes sense to me. I wonder how good the uninitiated reader can be in determining what's substantive and what's simply Trump's personality disorder on display. There are fireworks everywhere and everyone touched by Trump is abused, fired, or ends up in jail, but Woodward isn't all that good at expounding on the meaning of Trump's folly for the country. He's a journalist, after all, but in that role, I admit, he is a gifted and possibly even enduring chronicler of America's last four decades....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 24, 2018",not set,"Sep 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41012533-fear

She also wants to demonstrate the Lowell's bipolar disorder was hereditary (she does this), and she wants to background us on reports of bipolar disorders as far back as the ancient Greeks (she does this, too.) And finally, she wants to offer us glosses on Lowell's poetry that reflect her sense of the connection between psychology and poetry.Lowell's life was rough. He was a difficult child with a cold, controlling mother and a weak, feckless, wife-dominated father. He came from the long line of distinguished New England Lowells and by his second year at Lowell House at Harvard, he couldn't stand another day of his heritage or Boston or New England. So off he went to Vanderbilt and then Kenyon and more or less found himself as a poet-in-becoming...only to dive into a tumultuous marriage with the writer, Jean Stafford, that ended as badly (for her) as his subsequent marriages.As he passed through his twenties, Lowell's bipolar disorder worsened. Redfield explains this disorder expertly (she's an expert, after all, and suffers from bipolar disorder, too). In short, the disorder has three phases: mania, which means uncontrollable behavior and thought, remission, which means the patient is okay, and depression, which means...you guessed it. In Lowell's time, this disorder was classified as manic-depressive. There wasn't much effective treatment available except institutionalization and electro-shock therapy; Lowell therefore was institutionalized and electro-shocked many times. Eventually, lithium proved to be very helpful in staving off the cyclical return of mania, and Lowell benefited from that...when his heavy drinking and confused life didn't lead him to neglect his meds.Somehow--Redfield attributes this to character more than anything else, plus a quotient of genius, of course--Lowell managed to write many of the 20th century's great poems. He was a prize-winner, much anthologized, and well-respected by predecessors like T.S. Eliot and contemporaries like John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, and Randall Jarrell. But all was not well...all was often chaos. Redfield partially leaves the ugliness of this chaos to Hamilton's biography, I gather, omitting the cruel, savage specifics of Lowell's breakdowns, his assaults on those around him and his infidelities to his second wife, Elizabeth Hardwick. Her thesis, which I guess is true, is that Lowell really couldn't help himself and he has been unfortunately diminished, poetically speaking, by the grim facts of his spells of mania. There's a lot related about these manic spells, to be sure, but I had the sense that Redfield wasn't really offering a full psychological account of Lowell's time on life. That said, I don't think I will read Hamilton's biography because, as Redfield explains, Lowell was out of his mind when he was at his worst.Redfield herself is an estimable writer, truly gifted. Her appreciations of Lowell's complex poetry--a mix of cosmic meditation, historical exploration, and autobiographical exegesis--are superb. Lowell was, at his best, unquestionably a terrific poet. He had an uncanny knack for taking New England several steps beyond Robert Frost, taking it on more frontally, accepting it more fully.But Lowell's was a cheerless life and it was a destructive life. Redfield can't avoid dealing with that since it became, increasingly, the subject of his poetry. As wonderful as he could be when he wasn't manic or depressed brilliant, eloquent, penetrating), he did a few awful things when he wasn't manic or depressed as well. For twenty years, his second wife Elizabeth Hardwick saw him through desperate collapses. Then he went off to England and ""fell in love"" with a very naughty, alcoholic, but quite pretty heiress of the Guinness clan, Caroline Blackwood. That led him to divorce Hardwick and marry Blackwood and have a wretched up and down time with her. When he became manic again, she wasn't up for sticking around like Hardwick. Others had to manage him. Ergo, Lowell divorced Blackwood and ""went back"" to Hardwick. Worse, he published a book of poetry that exposed the gist and text of many letters Hardwick had written him during their pre-divorce break-up...and he put himself in the position of a poor guy over whom two women were fighting. Hardly the case.I presume this explains why Hamilton's biography put the nail in Lowell's reputation for quite some time. I also wonder why Redfield doesn't take head-on the vanity/egotism of Lowell writing about Hardwick in demeaning ways. She cites Faulkner saying something about art above all, kill for art, never compromise your art (it's a famous quote, you can look it up), but Faulkner also said he reread Don Quixote every year, which was nonsense, too. Elizabeth Bishop, Lowell's close friend, had it right when she wrote to him that art wasn't worth such destructiveness.Another concern I'd like to raise has to do with the implicit judgment Redfield seems to offer that Lowell's extensive and surprising revisions of his work reflected some kind of gift from his madness. I do think that madness might heighten a talented artist's perceptions, but many, many poets and prose writers revise their work dozens of times, turn it around, twist it, pound at it until they understand what it is they are trying to say. That's not especially bipolar. It's just commonplace artistic obsession with getting things right. Here what we see--the poet at work--is exactly what Redfield means by Lowell's character.I don't know if Redfield manages to rescue Lowell with this book or if that really was her deepest intent. She handles so much material, so many angles, so many inherent contradictions, that she no doubt achieves many goals, but like Lowell, they are somewhat confused. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Sep 12, 2018","Sep 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30267770-robert-lowell-setting-the-river-on-fire

In fact, the life stories of these Americans, most not famous like Ernest Hemingway or his companion, Martha Gellhorn, are somewhat distracting except in connection with the larger issues surrounding that awful struggle.Nonetheless, this is a very accessible, well-written book and it surfaces three points of particular interest.The first point is that the Spanish Civil War was of much greater international import at the time than it seems to have become after being overshadowed by the eruption of WWII. Prescient folks understood that this conflict was about dealing with the leading edge of fascism, specifically fascism rising in Germany and Italy, both of which were indispensable to Franco's victory and subsequent 36-year dictatorship. Had Germany and Italy not outspent the Soviet Union (on the Republican side), the war in Spain might have lasted many years longer and Spain might have been more significant in the dynamics of WWII. And we cannot overlook the fact that the U.K., the U.S. and to a somewhat lesser extent France did little to take on fascism in Iberia.The second point the book raises, somewhat implicitly, is that Spain is a difficult, diverse country and Franco's brutality toward Republicans, particularly in Catalonia, left wounds that still bleed. The Catalan independence movement has many dimensions but one of them surely is the memory of Nationalist destruction, which included attempting to destroy the Catalan language and culture.The third point, which isn't even raised implicitly, is my own reflection on the similarity between the Spanish Civil War and the war against Assad in Syria. Again, without Iran and Russia supporting Assad, that war would not be coming to an end in Assad's favor...or perhaps to any imminent end. Reading Hochschild's book and comparing it to events in Syria, I think we see the dangers of letting dictatorships being nourished by kindred regimes abroad--dangers both for the Syrian people and for the region. Syria is a difficult, diverse country, too. Assad's father was his own kind of Franco, and like father like son: brutal, repressive, indifferent to human rights and life itself. Yet once again the leading nations many of us would like to consider enlightened and democratic have ceded the field...and so three million people already have fled to Turkey and beyond and with the prospect of a final assault on Idlib Province (similar in a way to the final Nationalist assault on Barcelona), we may see millions more flee tyranny. Turkey says it can't handle this, but I doubt that troubles Iran and Russia.

In a nutshell, Dr.McLeod discovered that chromium has a powerful effect on what is known as insulin resistance, reducing it, and that people who suffer from atypical depression often suffer from, yes, insulin resistance. By reducing insulin resistance, chromium also reduces the miserable symptoms of atypical depression. Sometimes chromium achieves this effect in combination with common antidepressants; sometimes chromium acts as an effective antidepressant by itself.The science behind this finding is one part of this book. Another part is the series of case studies that led to the science. Dr. McLeod observed an extraordinary improvement in one patient's depression and by careful detective work he linked it to chromium in a supplement the patient had begun taking.

It opens with a chapter about picking the talent necessary for professional sports teams to achieve championship level. This is fun because diamonds in the rough are hard to spot. The best example is Tom Brady, the New England quarterback, who was drafted in the 6th round (choice #199) and has become, probably, the greatest quarterback in NFL history. Another interesting example is Jeremy Lin, a small basketball guard whose key virtue wasn't spotted by most scouts--he had a blazing fast first two steps, which, in basketball, are fabulous assets.But the first chapter of the book is a kind of a teaser, leading us into the fun world of pro sports and never returning. Thereafter, the focus alternates between the life experiences and character of Kahneman and Tversky, their peculiarly intense collaboration, and at various points, the substantive fruits of their collaboration, which led to what is called behavioral economics, which in itself is both brilliant and, dare I say, obvious.Through thought experiments that were substantiated by empirical studies, Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that human judgment and decisions often, even in economics where rationality and utility supposedly rule, are influenced by ingrained intuitional biases and distortions. Sometimes people don't understand the dynamics of statistics and instead of studying options in terms of the law of high numbers, quite reliable, fall into a more subjectively distorted trap of what might be called the law of small numbers. Example: a basketball player sinks four shots in a row. From this, we deduce he has a ""hot"" hand and is likely to sink a fifth shot. These are small numbers upon which to base a prediction. Statistically, they don't bear out, just as a coin coming up heads three times in a row is no more likely to come up heads or tails the next time it is flipped. Ultimately, the law of high numbers catches up with basketball shooting and coin tosses. And yet people fall in love with the romance of intuiting what comes next, which is irrational, but it is what people tend to do.This book fiddles with these problems and gets into intriguing examinations that are more subtle. For instance, when we ""rationalize"" bad behavior, what are we doing? Explaining it? Excusing it? Regretting it? Imagining it as the consequence of multiple factors, all of which could have been otherwise...but weren't? And is ""alternative thinking"" actually a human trait that might otherwise simply be called ""imagination""? Lewis doesn't deal with the ""alternative facts"" of Donald Trump, but he, Kahneman, and Tversky probe this kind of mass mistake. They also--though it doesn't appear in the book--explain why Alan Greenspan was so shocked by a flaw in his thinking prior to the 2008 financial crisis. He believed that markets, ultimately rational, would stop short of destroying themselves with emotional vapors, i.e., greed. But markets aren't completely rational, and economics aren't completely rational, either.I'm going to read Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow sometime soon because in it he apparently ties much of his work together. The precise problem with this book is that it reflects the paper by paper approach Kahneman and Tversky pursued. These were brilliant thinkers but seemed more interested in--and perhaps confident of--specific problems than theoretical or general structure-building. As a consequence, this book is choppy, though I must admit that does lead to a fairly predictable and appropriate outcome for the Kahneman/Tversky collaboration: they were the closest of friends who fell afoul of basic human flaws, envy and pride. And so their productive relationship dissolved when, rationally speaking, it ought to have continued being so phenomenally productive....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 26, 2018",not set,"Aug 26, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35631386-the-undoing-project

Adam Hochschild is referring to the ways in which history is judged to be so inconvenient as to be forgetting...or never knowing. King Leopold II of Belgium set up a colony for himself in the heart of Africa around the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, and his methods for extracting ivory, first, and rubber, second, yielded 10 million deaths.Naturally the Belgians didn't want to remember that, and other colonial powers didn't want to remember what they had done in their colonies, and the Belgian Foreign Office kept explosive reports from that era under lock and key into the 1970s, and Leopold II himself, upon ""selling"" his colony to Belgium, had his own archives burned--that took a full week.This tale begins with ""explorers"" and ""discoverers"" of Africa, notably Henry Morton Stanley (""...Dr. LIvingstone, I presume?""), with a focus on the massive river known as the Congo. How any Europeans survived such journeys is somewhat beyond me, but this led to an ambitious, greedy monarch in Europe jealously surveying the possessions of all the other monarchs in Europe and deciding that the Congo would become his personal possession.Early on, Joseph Conrad memorialized the essence of what then transpired in The Heart of Darkness, but his tale is a distillation of horror. Hochschild's is an expansive survey of the butchery, the servitude, the kidnapping, the forced labor, the bizarre punishments and trophies (among them thousands upon thousands of severed hands, roughly the equivalent of the scalps, as proof of death).And then there is the Euro-commercial machine of harvesting riches, shipping it to the wharves of Antwerp, tallying the take, making sales, and providing massive quantities of guns and ammunition for enforcing the rape of what might be called the heart of Africa, darkness being a more apt term applied to Leopold and his minions. Leopold set up his own army, his own form of governance, and fought tooth and nail to convince the world, briefly, that his purposes were humanitarian and Christianizing.But one factotum in Leopold II's business, a man named E.D.Morel, surveyed the coming and going and realized all this booty was flowing out of Africa to Europe on less than a sea of blood. He became one of the first international human rights advocates, joined later by Irishman Roger Casement, and reinforced by conscience-stricken missionaries and writers like Mark Twain and Arthur Conan Doyle. The effort to expose Leopold II went on for a good many years; his attempts to bribe the press to write otherwise (generally successful) prolonged the struggle. Eventually, though, this massive crime was appreciated in all of its wretchedness and that's when Leopold II decided to sell his private colony to Belgium, which perpetuated much of his system throughout WWI into the 1920s.Hochschild's rumination about other genocides, his comparison to the Holocaust, his thoughts on similarities between Leopold II and Stain, etc., are interesting and persuasive. Wandering into these matters as he does sometimes may not make this a better book, but as he notes in his afterward, it is very, very difficult to convey the magnitude of such a massive act of brutality. The moral imagination and its failings sadly contribute to the silences of history. How do you ""wrap your mind"" around so many deaths?Belgium ""granted"" Congo its independence, its first elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, wasn't to the West's liking, so he was disposed of, and then Mobutu raped and pillaged the country called ""Zaire"" for three decades, and then that county became the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is a Balkanized battle zone (multiple civil wars, loosely defined) Western mining interests still somehow exploit. The computer I'm typing on and the one you may be reading on may contain coltan that originated in Congo. Or if you're reading this  on a cell phone, there could be coltan there, too.So this is a good book; it's well-written; it's ambitious; and it's troubling. The problem with history, ultimately, is that it doesn't go away, it simply subsides into the geology of human experience, always underfoot. Pick at the topsoil of contemporary life and you may find bits and pieces of it there....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 10, 2018","Aug 19, 2018","Aug 12, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40961621-king-leopold-s-ghost

In the Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg does a splendid job of advancing one's understanding of habit, perhaps the most significant factor in how one leads one's life.He goes into the brain, the marketplace, casinos, Target, Alcoa, and elsewhere looking at ways in which both bad and good habits are formed. His virtue, as a journalist, is simplifying complex human behavior without reducing it to a mechanical schema. Habit is a powerful force, he shows, but it is something that can be altered.The habit loop in this book goes this way: first, some cue gets you going; next, you pursue a routine prompted by the cue; then the routine leads you to a reward. The cue in the case of Alcoa was a safety incident that called for corrective safety routines that led to a good safety record. Along the way, communication and efficiency throughout the corporation was increased, i.e., built into routines that promoted safety. This led not only to greater worker safety but higher profits.I won't go on rehashing the case studies here, but I did find a core value promoted at Starbucks to be fascinating: willpower. Turns out that willpower can be taught, and not surprisingly willpower is associated with high performance across virtually all disciplines and walks of life. My word for willpower is tenacity, but they are the same thing. It's about not giving up, not letting a customer walk away angry, not reaching any goal in particular. Duhigg's research shows us that when we confront areas in which we do not demonstrate willpower, we're en route to establishing a routine that summons willpower and leads to the reward of success. It's a little bit like telling yourself you can't do math and giving up to go watch TV versus telling yourself that you can do math, but you need to study tenaciously (pursue a willpower regime) to achieve a good test score, or a tax return that's accurate, or a balanced checkbook.Duhigg goes into addictions (gambling/alcoholism) that may operate in terms of situational cues that could be resolved by different different routines (other than gambling or drinking too much). One example: some alcoholics, when lonely, turn to drink because drink involves going to a bar and being with other drinkers. The Alcoholics Anonymous answer to the loneliness cue is to substitute ""meetings"" or calls to a ""sponsor,"" both of which respond to the loneliness cue without alcohol.I see I've ended up making Duhigg's book seem like a series of simplifications, as in, ""sure,easier said than done,"" but it's a book worth reading nonetheless...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 05, 2018",not set,"Aug 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit

Roth attacks these issues by proposing a second Philip Roth who has assumed his identity and is busying himself promoting a second Diaspora, wherein Jews in Israel emigrate back to whence they and their rich culture emerged--anti-Semitic Europe.

Apparently Faulkner thought he was writing a funny book--and it is a funny book in some measure--before developing the tragic element of a woman (Eula) Flem lost to adultery and a daughter (Linda) who wasn't his. Indeed, Eula Varner Snopes (1889-1927) conveys Faulkner's customary darkness convincingly and her daughter, Linda, expresses well Faulkner's conviction that one must escape the past yet one can never escape the past.Among most critics, The Town is an unpopular book, and it is easy to see why. The chapters are narrated by a series of participants in varying and not always complementary tones and registers (think of As I Lay Dying as an example of greater success using this technique) and there are moments when Faulkner's ceaseless tendency to describe things backwards and inside out grow wearisome. Beyond that, Flem Snopes isn't one of the voices employed, so he doesn't roar at you like Jason Compson in The Sound and the Fury...much to The Town's detriment, depriving it of a central character's internal passions and contradictions.Even so, there are many fine moments of clear-headed analysis by the lawyer Gavin Stevens (central to Intruder in the Dust), who successively falls in love with Eula and then, many years later, Linda, and cannot let himself have either, understanding the doom they carry within them. Eula makes him a wonderful ""Let's do it, then"" offer in a memorable scene early in the book that flat-out overwhelms him. Linda knows what he's feeling for her, later on, but he can't bring himself to prey upon her, a teenager to his graying maturity of thirty something, approaching forty.The sweep of the story essentially is this: Jefferson is succumbing to Snopesism, which is vulgar but hard-working commercialism that lacks any connection to ante-bellum South, including decorum, education, and decency. That's not to say Faulkner presents the traditional South in a good light, but its demise at the hands of a Flem Snopes is an indignity (which Faulkner obviously intended to deal with satirically when he thought The Town was going to be a funny book.)There is enough here to remind one of Faulkner's writing when his powers were greater to justify reading The Town. But if The Town is the first Faulkner novel you've ever read, you likely won't finish it or pick up another, which would be a great pity....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2018","Jul 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10985.The_Town

LExit Ghost is a literary puzzle palace in which the narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, struggles with his own ghost, the ghost of a writer he admired, E.I. Lonoff, and late in the book, the ghost of George Plimpton.Perhaps the best line in the book has to do with describing fiction as rumination in narrative form...not as representation. Zuckerman, a writer, comes up with this line as he attempts to persuade a brassy litterateur named Kliman (recent Harvard grad in need of a subject) not to write a biography that borrows the theme of incest from Lonoff's unfinished novel and inserts it into Lonoff's life. Complicating matters, Lonoff's elderly paramour, Amy Bellette, thinks she remembers Lonoff confessing incest with his elder half-sister, but Zuckerman tells her she's wrong. In fact, he says, Lonoff was riffing on the literary speculation surrounding Nathaniel Hawthorne and his sister. Well, it's hard to say who's right. The fact is that Zuckerman is becoming elderly himself, has memory and urinary problems, is now contemplating leaving the Berkshires for a return to his old life in New York City, and has fallen in love with a young woman in such a way as to echo Lonoff's love affair with a much younger Bellette. But Zuckerman, told by Kliman that his old friend George Plimpton has died, begins comparing himself to the totally realized person/writer Plimpton and crashes into the fact that he isn't much of a person anymore, just a writer, and a writer who is defenseless against the annoying predations of literary New York. He doesn't have, like Plimpton, a go-to persona that handles public stuff for him (Plimpton made a lot of hay pretending to be a bumbling athlete). He's just serious-minded Zuckerman in an old man's diaper, quite incapable of sexually consummating any relationship with a young woman.

So is his memoir of Edna St. Vincent Millay and his assessment of Leon Trotsky. Only a few literary critics have had Wilson's range and depth, someone who despite his brilliance worked as hard at literature as a construction worker. I suppose the same could be said of Samuel Johnson...and Harold Bloom...and George Steiner, but that's about it in terms of English-language literary criticism. For a single essay--let's say something on Henry James--Wilson would ""work up"" essentially everything James wrote (if he didn't know most of James' oeuvre already) and then propose ways of assessing James as a whole: the early versus middle versus late James, the social James versus the aesthetic/moral James, the American James versus the European/English James.Wilson did the same with even broader subjects: the Dead Sea Scrolls, for instance, or American Civil War literature, especially Southern literature. And with Canadian literature. And so on.There was a time, starting with Samuel Johnson and perhaps concluding with Wilson or the much younger Harold Bloom, when literature understood broadly was taken as a kind of cultural imperative, a North Star embodying values and principles essential to understanding and guiding human affairs. A writer like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Wilson's friend, understood that Wilson had made himself into an arbiter of how one assessed life seriously, by means of literature, and in the end, Wilson became the conservator, one might say, of Fitzgerald's literary remains. Glimpses of their relationship show up in this reader.Wilson's assessment of Hemingway and Joyce seem to me more or less permanently sufficient. Little more need be said. Hemingway wrote singularly superb short stories at the outset of his career; his art was of a very high order at that time; but then he experienced a kind of leaf fall, the pages of his works fluttering downward into self-parody and self-flattery. Sensibly enough, Wilson also tells us something we all know instinctively about Joyce: on first reading Ulysses one neither picks up on or sees the necessity of all the Homeric substructure. That stuff was more important to Joyce than to the average reader. Academic critics would cry, ""No, no! That stuff is the essence of Joyce's genius!"" Sorry, Wilson counters, Joyce's genius was devising the multi-vocal reality of modern consciousness. This often is called ""stream of consciousness"" but stream of consciousness hardly does justice to the stunning parodies, lyricisms, metaphors, discordances, and tonalities that Joyce devised for Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom...making them seem plausible by virtue of his effortless literary virtuosity. I read this volume by flipping through it, finding topics I considered irresistible, and diving in. The editing by Lewis Dabney is fine, but there's no reason to enslave oneself to it. We all have our interests, be it Baudelaire and Proust or Pushkin and Nabokov.

As usual, Updike writes with astounding stylistic flourishes and a broad grounding in science, natural and manmade. The manmade science here is computer science, specifically programming, which becomes the purpose to which Owen puts his degree in electrical engineering. The natural science is the science, or knowing, or experiencing, of human sexuality.We'll chuck the professional journey Owen follows, largely used for narrative purposes, and focus on the heart of the matter. As his wife tells him on the eve of their divorce (after four children and a long series of infidelities on Owen's part), he never really grew up. He looked and acted like a man but did so with the sense of impunity a child might assert when said child took more than his share of life's goodies.There are lots of inventive and graphic and various sexual encounters and partners in this novel. There is high school exploration, there is college infatuation, there is pre- and post-marital fooling around, and there is a kind of untrustworthy finale with Owen's rather motherly second wife. The high school girls are more assertive than Owen expects, his long-time first wife Phyllis is a reserved beauty (also a brilliant mathematician), and the affairs run from trysts after the conference program concludes in Vegas to nuzzles in the Connecticut woods with first-timers to locked-door office randiness with an underling to pounces on women in Middle Falls, a Connecticut village, who are bored or vulnerable or compliant or, in one case, quite knowing in what strikes Owen as a rather manly way. The fact that the four children has with Phyllis are barely sketched-in has more to do with Updike's focus on unraveling Owen than any lack of writerly breadth--Updike could do anything with prose fiction, of course. In the process he may have reveal a lot about women's sexuality or, from a knowledgeable woman's point of view, he may simply be indulging in lascivious, self-centered fantasy--perhaps like Owen himself.As vividly as Updike wrote about middle class sexcapades in New England, making his fortune with Couples in the late 60s, one might think (I might think) that he wrote even better in more restrained and allusive stories, or, in the Pennsylvania-based Rabbit books. Rabbit shows much more heft than Owen does; the fixes he finds himself in hurt more; he really, really wants more; and his choice in women, ah, Janice, is more three-dimensional, earthy, confused and costly.Updike's underlying theory of the case in Villages is that villages are places where procreative urges are facilitated in service to human survival. He makes many stabs at giving Owen a sense of existential freedom by means of women, but Owen is not quite such highfalutin' material. He's after the next partner in mischief, the next exploration of female anatomy, the next opportunity not to make his marriage to Phyllis work.Owen and Phyllis's last conversation is a penetrating study in her understanding of him and of herself. It's a fine confrontation. He gets it, but he can't deal with. Fortunately for him, and unfortunately for her, the plot is what really springs him loose....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 18, 2018","Jun 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61326.Villages

None of us had ever heard of it, so this news was quite a shock.  I still have--it's on my desk right now--the copy I went out and bought: a 95 cent Signet Book.  Reading it about fifty years ago, I vaguely understood what Wolff was talking about. I hadn't been to Mexico, where the action unfolds, at the time and I didn't speak or read Spanish. That wasn't much of a handicap but it's a much more powerful book when you have lived in Mexico and know Spanish because so many of the specific data here are Mexican. I mean the land, the atmosphere, the flowers, the cultural misunderstandings, the generally timeless passage of the days, and of course the twin volcanoes, Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl.Beyond Mexico there are three principal characters, Geoffrey Firmin, his wife Yvonne and his half-brother, Hugh. These figures are densely rendered, Geoffrey through his terminal alcoholism, Yvonne through her determination to save Geoffrey and their marriage, and Hugh through his defensive ambivalence about the causes and loves he espouses (including Yvonne). The day is the Day of the Dead. Geoffrey is a wandering mentality in search of the next drink and in flight from Yvonne. Yvonne is a human being in search of normalcy, dreaming she and Geoffrey may find it in a shack on the Canadian coast. Hugh is passing the day saying goodbye, without ever saying it clearly, before he heads off to Veracruz for a ship that will carry munitions to the Spanish Republicans. All is chaos and confusion.The proposition that Geoffrey, in his alcoholic daze, could figure as the protagonist of a long novel is, on the face of it, bold if not ridiculous, but Lowry knows the demons of drink, and he understands the staying power of misery. Yvonne shows up best in letters she sent Geoffrey following their separation a year earlier. Hugh holds onto his feckless boyishness, though he's thirty. Two of the best scenes are him giving Geoffrey a shave because Geoffrey is no good with a razor and him taking a horseback ride with Yvonne, adrift in memories of having had an affair with her at some point in the past (which can have done none of them any good.)One doesn't read Under the Volcano for the stirring plot. One reads it for that ""blizzard of specific data"" Roth spoke about. This is book is blindingly concrete; you don't see the words as much as feel them, their punch, their impact, their ironies.Novels like The Sound and the Fury, Ulysses, and Crime and Punishment read the same way. So yes, Under the Volcano, is a great novel full of flaws like all great novels, improbable like all great novels, and utterly compelling, like all great novels....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 11, 2018",not set,"Jun 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31072.Under_the_Volcano

Ballard's fantasies absent the superstructure of setting: meditations and loosely-grounded dialogues that strive, it would seem, more toward making a point than resolving a conflict or plot.Some of these stories have wonderful bite; these would fall into the Beckett category. A man has problems holding onto his hen's eggs in the factory where he works and is permitted to keep her. Two old men wobble to work at the same factory on their bicycles and come upon a double-stranded pearl necklace that, naturally enough, is taken from their grasp. A boy helping his mother on a nightly office-cleaning detail wanders in on the truth of miscalculations that are the questionable foundation of a worldwide business.The undertone of stories like these is elemental: you can't win...you can't get away...you're being watched...your family never liked you. In other words, these are stories we tell ourselves when we're falling asleep (or have just been fired or have just made a bad investment.)The stories in the pure fantasy category have a somewhat unconvincing oratorical quality. They display Calvino's ability to drill deeper and deeper into an idea for the fun of it. Even the best of them, however (I'm thinking of ""The Other Eurydice,"" wherein Pluto informs us that life within the earth is much compelling than on its surface) go on too long, are just too tediously inventive.

And if the inventive coda weren't so cheeky and authoritative, the novel as a whole would be a very great flop.The problem is this: Two newly married Americans go to France in the late '40s and they suffer all the indignities four months of tourism can offer: luggage difficulties, overcharges, opaque cultural rebuffs lightly sweetened with polite formalities, dreadful rooms, no hot water, bad food, endless discussions about whether to break the schedule and hurry ahead, inscrutable and undeserved affections showered upon them by needy acquaintances... In the hands of Henry Green, this tale would be delightfully comic. He'd make the most of the confusions, the squabbles, the endless dinners, the endless rain, etc. Maxwell chooses, instead, to honor French rigidities and reserve, letting Harold and Barbara peer at life as though through smokey plate glass. Some have called Maxwell a romantic in writing this way. I'm not sure about that. He becomes very sharp and pointed at least once on every page.The centerpiece of the novel is a two-week stay at a once grand chateau now run as a country hotel, of sorts. Madam Viénot operates it. She's wise and tight-fisted, determined to keep up appearances and not let anyone in on what happened to the family money. Her daughter scrapes by as a commercial artist in Paris. She visits the chateau from time to time. Likewise Madam Viénot's son, Eugène, and his wife, Alix. Harold and Barbara would like to befriend all of them, the other guests included. Harold and Barbara are Americans, after all. Not uncultured Americans but still...Americans like to get on with people...and Americans tend not to think that having smashed France in the process of crushing Hitler should be held against them. But Harold and Barbara can't figure people out, and there is no Jamesian middleman to explain to them why Eugène runs hot and cold or why Alix does the same. At times the sun shines. There are good days along the river and good days visiting other chateaux and a party or two from which it is at least enjoyable to leave.All along Maxwell describes everything he's willing to reveal quite expertly. He is (was) a fine, fine writer. But he's got a narrative trick in mind. He's going to hold back on the backstory of the indecipherable French cast and force the reader to puzzle along...just as a reader of a book like this no doubt has puzzled along in France himself...or Italy herself...or Germany himself/herself.We have too much luggage. We don't know what's in that bowl just set before us. We thought it was going to be a salad but it appears to be calf's brains. We think the sheets are mildewed or moldy or both. We look at so many paintings that we can barely recall any of them. We want desperately to carve out time for the Île de la Cité, but there are travelers checks to be cashed and tickets to be confirmed and a shoe that has to be picked up from a shoemaker who really doesn't repair shoes, he makes them, but is willing to do us a very expensive favor.Do we need to read the memoirs of our own difficult spells as rookie tourists? Well, even if Barbara and Harold are a bit less interesting than we are, the cast of French characters is more interesting, and Maxwell scores point after point in presenting them. He does the same with foodstuffs, the moods of the day, the condition of an old chateau's plumbing, and the hazards of ferry rides.Well, here's the deal, make of it what you will: He unravels all of his mysteries (and miseries) in his final section and we are able to see deeply into everyone's motivations. He does this after the fact. The story is over, but he goes back and in a kind of self-interview tells us what's bugging Eugène and Alix and so forth.In other words, Maxwell masterfully (I think) violates that hoary old edict all the writing schools issue: He succeeds, in the end, by telling, not showing. This wrap-up is superb.Now, would The Chateau be a better book if it showed more in a telling way throughout? I suppose not.

Arvid is thirty-seven and getting divorced. His mother, in her fifties, has a recurrence of abdominal cancer and is exploring the nostalgia brought on by dying. In a sequence of scenes that tumble on the page with no chronological consistency, he recalls not the story of his marriage and how it has failed but the story of falling in love with his wife. Meanwhile his mother returns by ferry to Denmark, where she was born, and revisits parts of her life that are clearly deeply meaningful to her but not transparent to us...or to Arvid, who chases after her on the next ferry.The mother/son relationship is one of tender distance. Arvid throws away his educational and life prospects to become a member of the working class--into which he was born into--and his mother takes him for a dope, but one she sticks by. She chastises him lightly when he goofs, stumbles, drinks too much, and struggles to deal with the fact that she loves him less than another son she lost. Why should he romanticize the working class and devote himself to a communist party that, as the novel unfolds, is crumbling with the Berlin Wall? No good reason, really, but that's the kind of guy he is, a specialist in bad choices. For her part, his mother is long out of love with his father and shares some kind of deep bond with a man named Hansen, who stayed behind in Denmark when she took off for Norway in search of a better life post-WWII. Was Hansen the father of the lost son? I'm not clear on this. I suppose so. Again, this is not a novel that builds upon itself sequentially. Rather, it's a novel that quietly builds on a continuous subtext of disappointment, missteps, and benign self-criticism. Being a dope doesn't prevent Arvid from being wonderfully perceptive (even when he can't handle the burden of his perceptions), nor does it prevent Arvid from taking the final passages of the novel into a very fine Hemingwayesque reportage of minor but meaningful events and observations. The novel is so emotionally charged by this point that small things associated with his mother's return to Denmark for a few days become quite large things that, in a way, pound Arvid into confronting the fact that it's time for him to grow up--the Berlin Wall has fallen, his divorce is inescapable, his mother is dying....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 21, 2018","Apr 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7433149-i-curse-the-river-of-time

Along the way and afterward, Americans seized indigenous peoples' lands, put down slave revolts, chased runaway slaves, stole half of Mexico, drove the Spanish out of the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, trampled Central America, and conducted well-known operations in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.Dunbar-Ortiz doesn't argue that all this mayhem flowed from the Second Amendment. Rather, she traces the lineage of armed exceptionalism from the Massachusetts Bay Colony through the creation of militias during the colonial period to their continuation via the Second Amendment, somehow landing in the laps of sovereign, God-blessed, American individuals whose, in the main, last vestige of true political power lies in the romantic fantasy of always being free as long as they could shoot.To underscore the real life corruption of reality that gun-based fantasy generates, Dunbar-Ortiz notes the highly peculiar cultural celebration (in movies, books, and song) of local Confederate militia/murderers like ... name your favorite gunfighter. Jesse James? The Younger brothers? One way or another, Dunbar-Ortiz associates them with the white supremacism we see still vital today...saw it on Ruby Ridge...saw it in Oklahoma City...saw it in Charleston...saw it in Charlottesville.She persuasively points out what many of us already know: the U.S. is a bizarre country. Its exceptionalism in terms of guns is stunning. There are 300 million plus guns in the U.S. just in civilian hands. We don't all have a gun, but we could. In fact, the average gun owner possesses something on the order of eight.The fundamental point of this book is that our cultural/historical origins and land-greed generated the Second Amendment as a by-product. Yes, it has been distorted by the NRA and others, but there is no way to deal with it politically without first dealing with the enormity of the gun culture that, in fact, makes the NRA more powerful than its 30 million per annum lobbying budget makes it. And beyond the gun culture, you have the gun manufacturers and profiteers. According to her research, the U.S. has provided close to a million guns to elements of the Afghan government since 2001. The U.S. is by far the major weapons purveyor in the world. I came across this book when it was favorably mentioned in the New York Review of Books. Ultimately it is a pessimistic book, as testified by the national non-response to events like Sandy Hook. The point is that you can't lobby gun reform or control in a typical D.C.-effort and you certainly can't get rid of the Second Amendment...until you foment a counter-movement greater in passion and energy than that of American gun owners and sympathizers who in some ways, as Obama said, cling to their weapons as a final vestige of personal political power.A final, complicating point: Here and there Dunbar-Ortiz does sprinkle some material generated by what obviously is her opposition, notably a hunter's eloquent statement of need and fulfillment. Extrapolating from that, one might stop and consider the fact that a significant number of mass murderers we associate with the headlines about massacres were not hunters. Think of the Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Charleston, Ft. Hood, and Orlando killers.

The geographical focus is Minneapolis (although for some reason severe winter seldom appears here). The lead characters are generally professional class with downward tendencies.Baxter's gift with the short story form is his energy, the way he moves the action along while filling it with those odd things we all notice in life and chide ourselves for not articulating. Or maybe we don't all do that. Maybe we rely on writers like Baxter to render for us the sidewalk and riverwalk and barroom and bedroom and backyard scenes that fill our lives.His prose style is economical, pungent, and contemporary. These aren't moody stories; they're punchy. My favorite involves a set of Christian parents confronting a doctor whose son has impregnated their daughter, which led the daughter to have an abortion (not performed by the doctor in question.) This doctor has had parents go wild on him for decades (he's a pediatrician), but the put-downs and damnations he receives in this piece are terrific, as is his impressively temperate way of telling these folks to perform a sex act upon themselves.One curious thing about Baxter's stories is that often they end with deliberately flat but leering revelations and reversals. Sometimes it feels as though he's simply pasted a few sentences onto his text, but he's too good for that. I'd need to read more of his work to be more confident that I know what he's up to. The coda to these stories, a short prose piece about Minneapolis, is a perfect example of this peculiar aesthetic.

The setting is the suburbs. The singular moment of revelation comes with his recognition that he is a Jew, Jews are different, and Jews suffered the Holocaust. His non-practicing parents decide, however, that he should go through a bar mitzvah. Well, he does, but this is an unenlightening, grueling process and takes precious time away from pick-up baseball, which he adores. Compared to some of the memories Philip Roth has shared of life as a Jewish boy in the New Jersey, there's little here of interest. One of Auster's virtues when he writes fiction--his flat aesthetic--doesn't serve him well.Things get worse because Auster becomes an adolescent. Naturally, there is some investigation into and beyond the underwear, both his own and girls'. That's sort of okay. What's not okay is the decision Auster makes to recapitulate in excruciating detail the plots of two movies that apparently made a lasting impression on him. These are The Incredible Shrinking Man and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, which he describes as two cinematic earthquakes in his life. But Auster doesn't really analyze his reactions to these movies, i.e., how they moved his aesthetic and moral needles. And they are not B movies; they are more like C or D movies. I suppose we are to take from his extended synopses that if you want to know Paul Auster, you need to know these movies, but again, it would be better if he clarified the connection. Oh, no, Auster then becomes a college student, a period for which he has no written records, no journals, no apprentice fictions or screenplays, until, alas, his first wife informs him that she has a lot of his letters to her when they were undergraduates. Does he want them? Yes, he wants them, and yes, he uses them to illustrate how self-deprecating, self-absorbed, self-dramatizing, self-criticizing, pompous, lonely, lost, well-read, preachy, and angst-ridden he was when he wasn't near his first wife (then his first major girlfriend) and had to write her the kinds of letters that we all wrote when we were that age and none of us except Auster wants to reread, much less publish in a book. Ye Gods, it's painful to be so smug, so inept, so naive, so miserable. Why put yourself through it again? The one thing I can say for this last prose section of the book is that it does reveal Auster as a young man with lots of raw talent as a writer. That he would finally transform himself into an accomplished novelist definitely seems possible.The last section of the book is an album of photos and illustrations connected to earlier elements of the text. It's black and white and pretty humdrum from the Lone Ranger through A-bomb testing to the Columbia uprising against Vietnam when Auster was an undergraduate.In comparison to his other memoir, Winter Journal, Report from the Interior falls kind of flat. There's too little here that illuminates the inner development of the artist; Auster doesn't seem to have a ladder on which to climb that would enable to really look down on himself and contextualize himself acutely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 29, 2018","Mar 29, 2018","Mar 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17286963-report-from-the-interior

Occasioned by the ""drama"" of turning 64, he also recounts many other lives, those of his mother and father, his first wife, second wife, some friends, some lovers, a delectable whore who quoted Baudelaire to him, etc. Taken altogether, he offers a pretty detailed picture of the New Jersey boy who became a New York man, a baseball fanatic turned obsessive writer. Sometimes he drifts into lists that aren't very Homeric, itemizing all the quirks of physical life, but in the main he targets episodes that obviously are meaningful if difficult to reconcile within a single human experience.I gather that in Report from the Interior (the next book I plan to read), Auster will turn more decidedly toward his imaginative, creative, intellectual development and influences.

It's generally well-written, sometimes funny and insightful, but here's the thing: Lix Dern, our protagonist, isn't very good with women, so the way to make his travails into a semi-continuous story, Crace offers a gimmick he only half, if that, exploits.Lix always impregnates the women he has sex with. That's the gimmick. Usually they take the lead in getting into bed with him because he's not a much of a Lothario--although he's a well-known actor and singer--and usually they drift away from him, or dump him, but when they go, they've always got his seed worked into one of their eggs.Well, okay, but it raises the question, What about the ensuing kids? And that's a question Crace doesn't answer, or exploit. They are named, they are referred to, but like the women, they are not major features of Lix's life. Their significance doesn't really bloom until the closing pages of Genesis, and even then, what we get is a smooth chunk of Crace's prose, not three dimensional characters.Lix is not portrayed with unflagging sympathy, so this isn't a novel about how difficult women can be for men. It's more a novel about a firecracker (or firecrackers) that didn't go off. I'm going to read another of Crace's novels fairly soon. I didn't hate this book.

Through him we read of their passions for remote mountains, falcons, the borderlands between urban development and suburban sprawl, vast bogs and the battering tumult of rain-drenched life on the western coasts of the U.K.In between chapters, Macfarlane includes glossaries of words in local use, largely forgotten or in danger of being forgotten, to describe things like the little passageways small animals make in hedgerows to come and go and the various terms used for ice coating plants in post-storm wonderlands. He notes that the Oxford University Press, in its periodic updates of the Oxford English Dictionary, is consistently including new terms like #hashtag and discarding older ones for phenomena like milk fog that no one notices or mentions much anymore.I was reminded of the fact that some Inuit communities have more than a dozen terms for different kinds of snow. If Macfarlane had focused on the Inuits, those would be the terms in one of his glossaries.In a closing chapter on children who are set loose in the woodlands near where he lives in Cambridge, Macfarlane illustrates quite perfectly why so many of us have a special kinship with that part of our lives. The children he writes about are perfect examples of the pre-disenchanted, demonstrating the intuitive grasp we have, but tend to lose, of what life really is like at first sight: a place without straight lines, without locked doors, without fixed numbers, and without time-bound schedules. Childhood is curvy, sparkling, vivid, flexible, and wondrous. Even though we tend to forget that, nature doesn't.

There's a charm in this especially because Modiano is so deft in moving his tale along, scene by scene, while vividly depicting his characters' calculations and vulnerabilities.Odile wants to become a recording artist, but one backer commits suicide while another forces her to have sex with him and then tosses her aside. Louis doesn't want much of anything so when he leaves military service, he becomes a doorkeeper and bagman for a con artist. Sometimes the two of them live better than badly. At other times they scrape along pretty low. Their predatory associates are modestly evil, not great villains. In fact, their own lack of ambition is probably their greatest nemesis.Modiano succeeds by keeping this novel focused within a narrow band of realism. The storyline has a loopy, idiosycratic quality that renders it believable. No one is permanently disfigured; everyone more or less escapes intact. As in life, so on the page: no great drama, just some nasty tricks and betrayals. Ultimately, at 35, Odile and Louis have come out okay.

I'm afraid this almost 1,000 page study of the Russian Revolution through the lens of the ""House of Government"" built across the Moskva River from the Kremlin by the Bolsheviks isn't one of them.This massive structure became home to thousands of different Soviet officials (high, mid-level officials) after the Revolution and cosseted them with bourgeois conveniences that undermined their millenarian convictions, or, if not cosseted, then contradicted, or at the very least pointed out how much a good Communist enjoyed going home to a handsome apartment at night after a long day of trying to translate Leninism and then Stalinism into a bloody kind of egalitarian heaven.Slezkine's persuasive argument is that the Revolution spawned a sect of purist, true believers whose fundamental framework for relating to the world was religious, not political. The idea was The End of History, or, in Christian terms, an apocalyptic upheaval entailing good's final triumph over evil. He illustrates this analysis by means of scores of fascinating, intertwined life stories, animated by diary entries, letters, and quotations from speeches, articles and novels. The Old Bolsheviks did ""believe;"" less so their immediate successors; and not much at all the generations following the cataclysm of Stalin's purges in the 30s and Hitler's onslaught in the 40s. Gradually, Marxism-Leninism succumbed to a reencounter with previous eras of Russian high culture, especially its literature, especially Pushkin and Tolstoy, in combination with a deep Russian attraction to West European giants--Balzac, Dickens, Goethe.In effect, the House of Government and great writing became refuges for the generations who did not participate in the Revolution or subsequent civil war. In part, this was necessary because of the ruthless treatment Soviet communism afforded not only its enemies but its party members as well. In the 20s, the clean-up action focused on drilling down to the proletariat, driving out the merchants and kulaks and skeptics, killing them if necessary, transplanting them if not necessary. But along with this, continuing debates about the meaning of communism split the Bolsheviks apart, so that in the 30s, Stalin had a free hand in destroying dissenters, whether they were truly dissenters or not. Slezkine's accounts of individual suffering, exile, imprisonment, humiliation and execution is graphic, detailed and persuasive. Under Stalin, the sect had turned on its heretics, a kind of madness prevailed, paranoia reigned, and the uniquely impersonal consequences of Marxism-Leninism savaged an entire society without remorse.Again and again, this book takes us into episodes of personal destruction--and disbelief. The problem is that The House of Government aspires to the impact of a novel while refusing to surrender yet one more--too many more--historically valid and compelling storylines.Russia, the Soviet Union and now Russia again is so interesting (to me at least) that I put up with more facts and anecdotes and ironies than I needed to get the point. Ultimately, this comprehensive work overreaches, and the mini-tragedies blend together, somewhat unrecognizably, elements of one saga concealing or confusing elements of another.The core ""thesis,"" if you will, takes us into the romantic perils of belief. Up to and through WWII, successive generations found reasons to believe in the national project (which was supposed to be transnational, of course). But WWII, Stalin's death, and Krushchev's 1956 revelations about what Stalin's rule really entailed ended that. Putin doesn't figure here, but he is foreshadowed.

He links this literary withdrawal into the self to the notion our civilization has been telling itself that existential meaning is an interior affair, not a confrontation with exterior realities. What writers tell us, he says, is that the specificity of what we personally can see, touch, smell, etc., conveyed into the Cartesian mind is the essential literary concern. This is the basis for ""show/don't tell"" creative writing edicts.The role of literary novelists has been, then, to calm the reader, essentially distracting her into thinking that the things she thinks are the quintessence of reality...while the things laissez-faire economics and liberal democracy (cum imperialism) meddle with are unmolested by literary insight.We can look at two 19th century writers, Flaubert and Marx, to see that the literary mind occupies itself with beautifully rendered trivialities while the social mind takes on the furnaces and fumes of industrialization with their stark human and environmental consequences.Of course there are exceptions. Ghosh acknowledges this. He isn't a polemicist. He's a widely read, thoughtful, artful essayist. He points correctly to writers like JG Ballard and Margaret Atwood as writers alert to the awesome consequences for the earth and its inhabitants of real depredations spawned by industrial development -- managed by colonial powers so that the metropole industrialized faster than the colonies.Leaving literary fiction aside, Ghosh then explores the history, economics and politics of global warming, rising sea levels, and immediate impacts on human health of carbon-based pollution. He alludes to something I've foreshadowed above: We seem to have advanced into a ""deep state"" world wherein self-expression is easy to come by, even massive demonstrations are tolerated, but actually altering governmental behavior is virtually impossible.What makes the ""deep state"" go of itself is the western paradigm of laissez faire and endless faith in endless profits. No one better exemplifies this approach better than Donald Trump, of course. He is a devil-take-the-hindmost practitioner of ""someone has to lose if someone is going to win...and I'm going to win."" Ergo, he bolts from trade and environmental agreements and shimmies as best he can to loosen the bonds of alliances like NATO.The problem is that science (which I believe intimidated literature into the realms of subjectivity and interiority) makes quite clear how gravely we already are being affected by climate change.  And yet...and yet...this suggests a limitation on the ideology of ""freedom,"" which the west, especially Trump and supporters of Brexit, cannot abide.Ghosh concludes with a splendid comparison of the Paris Climate Accord and Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si' on climate change and justice. The Paris Climate Accord is a thicket of weasel words, cut outs, imprecations, vagaries, and pomposities which (to borrow  a comment sometimes made about babies so ugly only a mother could love them) only a bureaucrat could love (or an international civil servant or a foreign minister.)  By contrast Laudato Si' plainly addresses in plain language the horrors ahead and the need for unselfish immediate action in order to diminish their impact on tens of millions of human beings.This book is a powerful contribution to understanding how we have come to the precipice of self-destruction.  I can't do it justice in a . Its intellectual underpinnings are solid.For some reason, Ghosh ends on an optimistic note.

Hitler then orchestrated his circular firing squad and the destruction of Germany after WWII was greater than its destruction after WWI.The artfulness of this study lies not so much in its account of political history as in the way it weaves literature, painting, dance, theater, architecture and other facets of German life into a broader tapestry. That's hard to do. Simply mastering the nature and impact of German poetry, or the Bauhaus, or Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche requires exceptional erudition.The lesson we might draw from Weimar today (on the eve of 2018) is that violent political consequences are sometimes concealed by the brilliance of contemporary culture. You can have Brecht and Mann and Gropius and Benjamin pushing the boundaries of the arts and still end up in disaster. Ugly politics can undermine civil society.

But I don't reread Chekhov every once in a while for introductions, which I generally avoid, or afterwords, which I generally avoid, or blurbs on the dust jacket. Chekhov for me is the master of the day-to-day dullness and frustrations of life, its nuanced passions, its stifled aspirations. In each of these plays--The Seagull, The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard, and Ivanov--one is permitted to see oneself up there, a little person off to the side, not in the headlines, dealing with cultural change, dwindling income, and the way time falls on one's head like a scattering of rain, a little bit here, a little bit there, reminding one of life's passage. Chekhov's characters mill about, complain, heat up the samovar, worry about gout, and gossip. Each moment is full of significance, however, a complement to the preceding moment, a prelude to the succeeding moment, an illustration of the thick, binding webs of family relations, an explanation for why, as the wind kicks up, nothing else seems to move, and all is ennui. But not flashy, philosophical ennui. Not the kind of ennui that leads to Sartre's nausea. No, a human ennui, quite understandable and safe, an ennui that doesn't disrupt obvious underlying tensions and tear things totally apart. We can even call it a dignified ennui, hard to bear but nobly borne, even by the least appealing of Chekhov's characters.I like to read plays as much as see them staged. I even feel, sometimes, that it is better to read them. The death at the end of The Seagull and the final sigh at the end of Uncle Vanya worry me enough that I'm just as glad not to be seated among a few hundred audience members as depressed as I am. As someone once said to me on another occasion, ""When something like that happens, what do you do with your face?""Like Kafka, Chekhov often thought he was being funnier than others, who didn't know him, understood. He wasn't above gentle satire, and he wasn't above a little bit of abusive moralism, intimating indirectly that his characters (and his audiences) ought to take better care of themselves. Otherwise they'd end up in the pickles he dramatized.Like William Carlos Williams, Chekhov was a doctor, and he had a gimlet eye for malingerers, self-pitiers, and the truly dangerously sick. I think Chekhov's generous impersonality flows from his medical background. He saw too many people too close up to get totally involved with them, but he always wanted to help...even when it was useless, nothing could be done.""Gentlemen, why do you live your lives so stupidly?"" he once asked.That's my favorite Chekhov quote.

Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erik Fromm, Herbert Marcuse, and, latterly, Juergen Habermas were the tangential or direct beneficiaries of a rich grain merchant's desire to please his son by endowing a social research institution with a Marxist bent in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1923, hence the name ""the Frankfurt School,"" which went through many incarnations over the following decades.Stuart Jeffries does a handsome job of intertwining biography with intellectual history, making this book enjoyable to read if, by virtue of its subject, somewhat depressing. Walter Benjamin's story glitters with imagination and tragedy; Max Horkheimer's story doesn't quite get told; Adorno's tale conveys both his brilliance and his prickliness; Fromm's heresies are entertaining; Marcuse's ""solution"" is even more entertaining and Habermas's life and opus ends up seeming rather pointless, despite his worldwide renown as a philosopher.The problem all these thinkers confronted, ultimately, is whether pure thought could have any impact on the juggernaut of violence and capitalism that triumphed, if that is the right word, in the 20th century. Most of them suspected their Marxism was a dead end, in practical terms, and most of them regarded capitalism as the ultimate control mechanism. Marcuse's novel contribution was to suggest that eros might be a force wily enough to endow modern existence with a certain piquancy, if not freedom, but as Jeffries recounts, Marcuse's eros became, in the popular imagination, the sexual revolution of the 1960s and that became trapped in the commodification of ecstasy, either by promiscuity, drugs, or simple shallow-mindedness. Ultimately Marcuse viewed contemporary western life as one-dimensional, flat, constrained, and directed by an impersonal dictatorship of economic interests.Habermas had the misfortune to be optimistic that still another way out of this No Exit scenario could be found in the realm of genuine social communication apart from the tyranny of ""the system."" Jeffries uses many of Habermas's skeptical critics to make him pay for this. The problem was that Habermas was a classical system-builder, someone who was determined to bring all manner of philosophical concerns together in the manner of Kant or Hegel. No one believes that's a useful proposition anymore--better to pick smaller targets of attack, make your point, and move on.Adorno coaching Thomas Mann through musical theory as he wrote Doctor Faustus was my favorite passage in this book. Benjamin's desperate attempts to write a lot by writing a little--precisely not writing as Habermas wrote, rather by proceeding from fragment to fragment--are the book's saddest passages.Saving ""critical theory,"" which the Frankfurt School is credited with developing for last, I have to say Jeffries never seems to try to define it. As presented here, the proposition essentially is philosophizing within multiple dimensions of an historical moment or movement...playing that moment or movement's contradictions back to it...understanding that there is no disassociating a wrong from a right...presenting and dissecting the ambiguities of overarching forces, be they economic or related to Freudian notions of self-repression and deferred gratification, i.e. the inherent discontents of orderly social existence....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 28, 2017",not set,"Nov 28, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33911758-grand-hotel-abyss

Eric Kandel fled Vienna with his parents and brother when he was nine, just as the Nazis were moving in. The family settled in New York where Eric excelled in school and then went to Harvard to be...an intellectual historian...no, a psychoanalyst...no, a Nobel-prize winning brain scientist. Here, he weaves elements of his personal autobiography together with elements of his scientific biography. There are many ways to get at the science he presents, but this is a good one, starting with work at the cellular level on learning and moving toward memory and the role of genes in the multiple components of the brain. For a nonscientist this book can be demanding but also astonishing. Kandel's story takes us several important steps toward understanding the interaction of organic features of human life with environmental features (nature v nurture). We end up with no ""ghost in the machine"" but a mysterious ability to take experience and record it at the molecular level, where memories are stored.Kandel's life really is his fascination with science, his attachment to his wife, and his generosity toward his scientific colleagues. Once he is clear of Vienna, he has the freedom to explore, examine and verify the underpinnings of what he calls ""mind,"" not ""the mind."" Along the way he helps elevate biology, previously a descriptive science, to the analytic/synthetic heights of chemistry and physics. This exposition reminds us of our capabilities as human beings while at the same time illustrating the ways in which science outstrips social reality. The things we can do scientifically simply dwarf our abilities to fashion just, liberal societies.Kandel continues to believe that Freud, originally a neurologist, remains relevant, particularly in the dimensions of understanding the conscious, the pre-conscious, and the unconscious. He frequently cites Freud's speculations about how much more his generation had to learn about the brain and how future generations undoubtedly would advance new paradigms for understanding it. The ultimate problem, of course, is subjectivity: why do certain experiences evoke different reactions in different individuals, all of whom really do see pretty much the same blue and hear pretty much the same note C.Kandel often mentions his love of music, but he doesn't reach the obvious conclusion: the role of the artist is to fashion a compelling aesthetic subjectivity to which the multitude can have access.

LWalker Percy's best writing involved his characters and stories presenting themselves (i.e., The Movie Goer) without too much metaphysical claptrap. Lancelot offers some of both. Our protagonist, Lancelot Lamar, recounts how he ended up in a mental institution to a vaguely identified confessor (a psychiatrist, priest, old friend). The more he explores his existential quandary, the less we (I) care. The more he focuses on Margot, the woman who betrayed him, or his ancestral homestead along the Mississippi, Belle Isle, the more involved we (I) become.Lancelot is the scion of a withered New Orleans family, a lawyer, a cuckold, and a reasonably heavy drinker. He has lots of thoughts and in the end he takes a grand sweeping action, leading to death and destruction but no jail time. The lesser characters are just that--lesser--and in the end it seems Margot is lesser, too, a woman who drove Lancelot mad once upon a time but has lost interest in him. Just plain doesn't want to be with him anymore.This is pretty thin as far as a plot goes, so Percy makes up for it as he goes along with fine descriptions of the locale, the servants, and a fellow asylum inmate Lancelot takes an interest in.Flannery O'Connor somehow always managed to make evil an active figure in her writing. Percy just went limp when he philosophized, often portraying folks as basically indifferent to how things turned out, not making them sizzle and squirm.So, no, I wouldn't recommend this novel unless you have a long-time interest in Percy.

The final passages, devoted to his time working in his father's factory after Oxford, simply seemed tacked-on, leaving me to think, as I read toward the end, about my burgeoning disappointment.My greatest complaint has to do with style, for which Green ultimately became famous. This memoir is chockfull of peculiarly phrased, very long sentences that do their best, whenever possible, to eschew commas. Later on Green learned to write in unpunctuated cadences that turned the action from one thought to another like a good skater changing direction. But here he seems to get muddled in tortured prose that reminded me of Cicero. Often I would be forced to reread a sentence to determine the subject, the dependent clause (s), the object, the swooning verb fainting just before the period, and then, of course, the meaning. At age thirty-three, Green wasn't yet good at managing his predilections and idiosyncrasies of punctuation and syntax. And no editor took him in hand to point out that every other writer who'd been through Eton and Oxford knew the rules of grammar and composition no matter how much he (boys' schools, remember) drank and smoked while a student and undergraduate.As a boy in the fields or streams near his parents' estate, Green had a great love for what it was to be on his own in nature, starkly contrasted with the exigencies of life in the house surrounded by formalities and servants. He then went, as the scions of the wealthy class did, to a somewhat Dickensian little boys school commanded by the Tyrant (headmaster). My sympathy with the ongoing plight of youth cast out of home was fairly strong, but already I began to feel intimations of discomforts he would experience come Eton-time. There the jocks ruled and the uncoordinated struggled to become aesthetes. Well, boarding school life is claustrophobic and its pecking orders and disciplines and snobbishness are dreadful. (I know, having gone to boarding school at thirteen.) Green's portrait of himself at this point in his life is appropriately vague (adolescents are rather vague, not yet knowing who they are) but unfulfilling. Perhaps here, too, the weight of those awkward sentences began to wear me out.Ah, then, Oxford: First six months, drunk every night. Balance of time, luncheon in one's room with one's dearest companions--the menu chiefly being duck and hack, day after day. All along Green somehow managed to write a novel that was published (while he was still an undergraduate), but he doesn't tell us much about this. Instead he begins to expostulate on how important certain dons could be, but we don't get many specifics--nothing in comparison to his very specific and well-done accounts of his boyhood fishing expeditions. The overshadowing background to Pack My Bag, throughout, is war. He was a boy during WWI and boys knew about the war, even heard guns from across the Channel. And he wrote this memoir more or less in the pre-WWII spirit of ""We who are about to die salute you."" This was natural for Englishmen of his age. At thirty-three, assuming that 1938-39 signaled yet another conflagration, Green wanted to pull his thoughts together. If he had lived (and was about to stop living), he wanted to leave a bit more of himself behind. But as his son writes in a preface to this volume, Green lost control of his material the closer WWII came, and he apparently rushed through an awkward ending.Well, his other books are gems (those I've read) and perhaps it's worthwhile to read a great writer's clunker every once in a while. By way of comparison, think of F. Scott Fitzgerald's awful The Beautiful and Damned (starting with its over-the-top title). Eventually, Fitzgerald wrote lovely stories and The Great Gatsby.

On diving into Nothing by Henry Green, I immediately was reminded of the TV series Seinfeld, a show explicitly about nothing, not nothing in the Sartrean sense, but nothing in the sense of ""well, this is all very funny...how excited we become about...nothing.""The other analogue that occurred to me, because Green's Nothing is largely exquisitely wrought dialogue, is the William Gaddis novel, JR, also mostly dialogue.I am discussing here, then, the core of comedy: a touching bit of virtuosity whose outcome obviously is of little importance. Who cares if Jane Weatherby and John Pomfret succeed in derailing their children's wedding? Who cares if instead Jane and John reignite a long dormant romance and become the pair that march down the aisle...or to the registrar's window?Well, we care to the extent that the project involves more and more plates spinning on more and more broomsticks, defying our belief that such an enterprise can be brought to a sound, witty conclusion. There, in a nutshell, is the aesthetic challenge...just getting through what you've started against all odds...extrapolating the fizzy, gossipy, inconsequential narrative premise into one devilishly penetrating scene after another such that ultimately a wholeness is achieved and it is a pleasant sort of sighing nothing.Beyond that, Green's quick scenes of statement and riposte are rich with characterization, psychological insight, plotting, counter-plotting, and dry merriment. There's a character throughout, we'll just use his first name, Richard, who is never really described (not physically, not professionally, not in his home or office or amongst his relatives or neighbors), and yet is astoundingly effective at negating any and all histrionics thrown at him. He may be in his 40s, a reasonable guess, but he portrays himself somewhere around 110, out of play, not involved, not impressed, not inclined. Richard seems to have been born in a three-piece tweed suit, shipped through Eton (we don't know that) and Oxford (we don't know that) and ended up just where he needs to be to serve as a foil to the mad little passions of young and old. He is complete in the sense that William Gass has suggested all fictional characters are complete: if all the author tells us is that X has a red, bulbous nose, then that's what we get: a figment of fancy we, the readers, are expected to sketch out as we will. We feel we would know that red, bulbous nose anywhere...and the head and body attached to said nose.Well, I liked Seinfeld and JR, and Nothing is so immensely unpretentious and silly that it's difficult not to like it, too.

""Atmospheric"" is a pleasant but accurate tease. In Red Gold Jean Casson, a former movie producer turned anti-German activist at the outset of WWII, spends a lot of time contemplating rain lashing his windowpanes, listening to the rumble of trains taking him into danger, lurking around critical river locks in the dark, and scrounging up a few francs for real coffee in a smokey café instead of roast barley infusions. The setting is largely Paris with a few excursions south and north. And the atmosphere in Paris in 1940-41, overrun by Germans--largely but not exclusively louts--surely was as Furst presents it. Lots of shadows, people following you, assassinations, betrayals, and conflicts between the de Gaulle cadre, the British-backed infiltrators/saboteurs, the hard-edged emissaries of Stalin, the men and women working against the Vichy regime from within, the unions, and the unaffiliated, somewhat unwilling moral actors like Casson.Furst handles all this masterfully, inserting a few romantic encounters and presenting a variety of hard-bitten and odious characters on the fringes of history, ready to trip you, steal your gun, and kill your friend.This is, as Graham Greene would put it, an ""entertainment,"" a kind of spellbinding spectacle full of hypocrisy, irony, and bad luck, in which Casson has a few brief ups and a few dreadful downs. He excels in accepting the ambiguity of being pursued both by the Gestapo and some of his alleged colleagues in disruption.Furst's aesthetic strength probably is not making too much of Casson or others, both in the negative and positive sense. He's a guy in a jam, not an existentialist anti-hero, and he's a fellow who knows he may never see his short-time lover again...but can live with it...good for her...nice while it lasted.I like Paris, Europe, modern history, and all the cagey details Furst inserts into the narrative. He makes a brutal truck run through backwoods France fascinating. He takes a little thing--some boxes of machine guns originating in Syria--and turns it into connective tissue for a plot that encompasses much more than being able to knock off the bad guys.By 1941, we know, WWII was just hitting its stride in Europe. Furst doesn't have to make that point; all he has to do is make us see how difficult it was for anyone to simply survive until 1941, never mind VE-Day....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Oct 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/253558.Red_Gold

Daudet was quite successful in his day, a much lesser French Dickens. In The Nabob he writes fluidly and somewhat romantically about a nouveau riche Frenchman (originally from the south of France, like Daudet) returning from Tunis and determined to buy his way into the upper reaches of Paris society. He is led from one mistake to another, humbled and humiliated. The underlying thesis would appear to be either a) country mouse comes to city and is eaten by the urban cats or 2) Darwinian naturalism rules in French society and disposes of the weak who are only superficially strong.I read this novel out of curiosity sparked by notes Daudet left behind, emerging post-mortem as In the Land of Pain. What strikes me is that when he was writing a novel, he was ""writing,"" i.e., performing to his audience's expectations of a writer, confirming suspicions, bringing the high low, exposing evil, rendering innocence and giving it a chance to flower. But In the Land of Pain is Daudet in frank dialogue with himself, raw, comic, brutal, ghastly, profound. There is nothing performative about In the Land of Pain, perhaps explaining why it did not emerge for decades after Daudet's death. When we think about the great writers of Daudet's times, Flaubert, for instance, we realize that the editorials and pirouettes and stereotypes aren't present. His work is immediate, like In the Land of Pain; it's not confected, like The Nabob. Here you have the difference between commercial fiction, another novel, just another novel, and a work of art.

From adolescence on, he fornicated widely and often. Somehow a lady of court is attributed as having infected him around age 17, but again, decades passed as he succumbed to the excruciating miseries of this malady. When he determined (in the 1880s) that he wanted to write about what was happening to him, he fretted over who might read a work of fiction as not fiction at all...so he kept these notes, which went unpublished for yet more decades and eventually were translated into English, quite masterfully, by Julian Barnes.I've never read a book quite like this one. Daudet is unsparing in his self-assessment, not as a moralist but as an almost detached observer. The famous French physician Charcot told him he was lost long before he died, but Daudet apparently held no grudge against Charcot for his candor. His ethic, it seemed, was to write as naturalistically as possible, and when he wasn't writing, to minimize the impact his increasing debility had on his family and friends. That, to him, was the essence of courage.Not long ago I read Reynolds Price's account of his own horrific illnesses; this book goes further in capturing the torture and humiliation of pain but, again, in an unsentimental way. Neither book reflects surrender even as the human body, the flesh, wastes, withers, and rots.

Its protagonist is Vera Stark, a white lawyer who works on land disputes for a nonprofit foundation. Despite the scope of the tale, also examining the experience of black Movement friends framing the new constitution and governmental structure, Vera is the odd key to everything. The two themes of the novel are power versus justice and sexual dependency versus selfhood. Vera is on the side of justice--she's clear about this--but she is less certain about the possibilities of selfhood absent sexual dependence, i.e., the fulfillment in sex between man and woman. Early in her first marriage, then again in her second marriage, she's drawn to infidelity, but even as she switches men, she longs for a man who doesn't need to put all of himself in her keeping, which is the case with her second husband, Ben. That said, her daughter's lesbianism strikes her as a non-answer at the gut level, and her son's marital uncertainties suggest he's no better at resolving sexual needs than she is.By contrast, Vera's closest black Movement friends seem a bit more adept at managing their affairs by emphasizing their need for and commitment to power...even to the point of Didymus, a rough player during Apartheid rule, accepting lower political status than that accorded to his wife, Sibongile. Their constrained sexuality is focused on an avid teenage daughter's love interests, and what they want, after the girl is impregnated by a married man, is to shut her down and abort the baby, which would detract from their somewhat puritanical and impersonal political claims.This is a novel built around brief scenes, more briefly described physical settings and circumstances, and more extensively elaborated exercises in reasoning, quite close reasoning. It has the virtue of skillfully rolling a lifetime into a single narrative, thus achieving, in the end, a sense of persuasive duration. There are so many twists and turns in the text, nuances and second thoughts, that a short novel (relatively) seems like a long one, and some of the surprises at the end unfold quite convincingly without much explicit foreshadowing. Ben and Vera, for example, separate in a casual way: Ben's visit to London to spend time with their son, Ivan, becomes a permanent exile from Vera back in South Africa. They just begin calling one another less often, each assuming the other is now living in a separate world. Meanwhile, Ivan takes up the financial slack, enabling both parents to live modestly but well apart.One odd feature of this book, which I have never associated with Nadine Gordimer, is how peculiarly and often badly it is written. The text is strewn with weak, clumsy sentences, strange uses of punctuation, and thoughts Gordimer just hasn't sufficiently reflected upon to state clearly. This isn't arty stuff; it's careless stuff; and it hinders the flow of the story, which has a choppy quality to it. I suspect that Nobel Prizes--Gordimer won hers before writing this novel--aren't good for writers, or at the very least, they cause editors to clam up when they should be raising objections....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2017","Sep 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96340.None_to_Accompany_Me

This is a strong novel with a flaw, like all novels, that facilitates self-indulgence on the part of its protagonist, one Robert Merriwether, doctor and professor of physiology at Harvard.The key year is 1972. It’s summer. Merriwether comes from an old New England family and has a grand barn of an inherited house an agreeable walk across campus to his laboratory. Having been right there, right then in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the summer of 1972, I can testify that Stern describes the scene (the human scene, the physical scene, the meteorological scene) perfectly. The ’60s have crested but the foam of their final waves are still bubbling on the beach–long hair, Hare Krishna celebrants, self-satisfied languor, “freedom.” In a few months, of course, we in Massachusetts would be the only ones in America favoring McGovern over Nixon, but this isn’t a political novel. It’s a social novel, and, in the wake of the 60s, that means, to a certain extent, a sexual novel.Gorgeous Cynthia is twenty. Merriwether is forty. He has a wife from whom he’s alienated (but with whom he still lives) and four children who mean a great deal to him. He’s not wretched about his marital problems, however, and not on the prowl. He just happens to be volunteering for a little clinic duty when Cynthia comes in looking for a birth control prescription and falls for him, or wants him, or needs him, take your pick. This could have happened then or now, the kind of disruptive good luck that might, eventually if improbably, lead Merriwether out of his dead end marriage. But it does feel a bit like a fantasy trip on the part of a middle-aged male novelist, and it doesn’t feel, to me at least, like Robert Merriwether’s loss of innocence…and “our” loss of innocence… an anatomy of the legacy of the 60s.I say that despite the fact that Stern’s highly-informed prose (he understands Harvard faculty members, their self-absorption, their quirks, perfectly) helps him handle some really tough challenges — Merriwether’s encounter with Cynthia’s disturbed father on the French Riviera, for instance, or Merriwether’s encounter with his wife’s divorce lawyer.The novelist Philip Roth, Stern’s friend, has described Merriwether as something of a latter-day, dream-drunk Gatsby while Wendy Doniger, another writer, promotes the innocence idea in an afterword, contending that Merriwether’s journey through the destruction of his family is, I suppose, an exile from Eden.I’m not buying it. It’s hard enough to think the under-described Cynthia really has the maturity and emotional gravity to isolate herself for a few years with Merriwether, cutting off ties with her generation. And hard enough to accept, as a reader, that the Merriwether presented is more than a narcissist who (though Stern doesn’t spell this out in dramatic detail, which is cheating) beat his wife into alienation by constantly dismissing her intellectually, cutting her off, correcting her, giving her C+ with his stare at the dinner table.As America didn’t have a fair claim on a loss of innocence on 9/11 (the America of Vietnam, of destroying the people who first occupied this continent, of slavery), a super-smart Harvard prof doesn’t get my sympathy for the losses resulting from his excesses. Having done the Riviera one summer, Merriwether and Cynthia end up in a cabin in the Rockies another summer. They’re close to Boulder, where Merriwether can participate in an ultra-sophisticated scientific seminar and write a book … and Cynthia? Well, as on the Rivera, so in the Rockies, she kind of drifts along looking great, being plenty smart herself, and finding satisfaction in clinging to her man.We believe the damage done to Merriwether’s children (though it doesn’t seem to be much) and we certainly believe his ex-wife’s hostility toward him, but what we don’t believe, I think, is that the 60s set us adrift with no moral compass, forcing us into emphasizing pleasure over happiness. Yes, Stern eloquently and wittily puts Merriwether through the wringer, but he’s no victim of overriding powers that cause him to lose his magnificent barn of a house in Cambridge, the tradition of Thanksgiving dinners with the whole family involved, and more than a few friends who weren’t really friends. He does all that himself. And in a sequel to this novel, if there were one, he would lose Cynthia, too....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Aug 30, 2017","Aug 30, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/332986.Other_Men_s_Daughters

This volume, then, is a labored, sober, self-doubting attempt to conduct science clinically, woman by woman, patient by patient, afflicted by a wide array of symptoms: loss of hearing, loss of the ability to speak in one's native language, loss of movement in a limb, persistent coughing, lassitude, mood swings, paranoia, inability to recognize the presence of someone whose presence in a room doesn't figure in the disorder of consciousness.Hysteria viewed in these terms differs from the hysteria explored by Jean-Martin Charcot, the French neurologist under whom Freud studied for four months. Charcot's patients exhibited a fairly typical cycle of exceptional symptoms that he did not so much attempt to treat as observe and document. Studies in Hysteria launches psychoanalysis with Breuer's successful cure of Miss Anna O by means of what she herself called the ""talking cure"" under hypnosis. What is striking, and central to Freud's elaboration, is the conviction that if an hysteric could be induced to revisit a primal trauma, said hysteric could, like dropping a handkerchief or hitting a ping pong ball, dispose of her (usually her) difficulties. Neither Breuer nor Freud claim to be certain about all this. They do not have an answer as to why some women become ""hysterics"" while most do not. In many case studies, they describe therapeutic events more than analyze them. It's always apparent that what worked best for them, scientifically, was logic in the form of post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this therefore because of this). Similarly, it's apparent that they knew they were working in darkness.Freud, in particular, approaches his case studies much as a literary writer would. He is painstaking in establishing causes and effects on character and a narrative/biographical understanding of personality (in the very limited context of hysteria, not more broadly.)This is early Freud, and in many ways it is appealing Freud. He subsequently rose to such great fame and such great criticism that it's useful to encounter him as an observing clinician. As medical doctors, Breuer and Freud first worked to assure themselves that there was no identifiable medical cause of hysterical afflictions--at least none known to the science of the day. But they then were left with inexplicable afflictions, and the question of what to do about them.For whatever reason, Freud was no good at hypnosis, so he developed a technique of applying pressure to a patient's head with his hands and using that intrusion to jar the patient into entering the labyrinth of associations that would lead to the original insult. One sees him as authoritarian in this method, but he freely confesses failures, dead-ends, and frustrations, which he says the physician simply must accept. But he is convinced that the patient knows what is bothering her, that it can be rescued from repression, and that once it is revealed, it will vanish.Today much of what Freud dealt with would fall under the category of sexual abuse or a form of PTSD. It might also be subjected to brain scans, and it might be treated by medications. Beyond abuse, the shame factor plays large in Freud's social context (a much more restrictive context than today's, which isn't to say say shame, embarrassment, or guilt are not fierce forces throughout human experience.) Clearly,he and his patients defined health as fitting back into ""normalcy,"" a social construct.I had a specific reason for wanting to read this turgid, repetitive book to the end. That probably is necessary for any reader, some specific motive. It's early mind science; some of it seems weird but much of it can easily be rephrased into today's problems, terminologies, and treatments. The redescription of a phenomenon does not eliminate or totally invalidate it. Terrible things happen to some people and yet they go on relatively unscathed while others become locked in the death grip of obsession or depression or repetition compulsions. Breuer and Freud knew they were clinicians practicing weak science, even by the standards of their day. The fascinating thing in Freud's case is that his early clinical work led to an incredible variety of theoretical and scientific insights, many of which are now considered doubtful but all of which were provocative....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 29, 2017","Aug 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/249041.Studies_in_Hysteria

I had read lots of Steiner's brilliant criticism and didn't know he wrote any fiction until I came across this volume a few weeks ago in the USED BOOKS section of Flyleaf in Chapel Hill. Initially, I thought ""Return No More,"" the first piece, explained why Steiner mostly wrote criticism. The prose stuttered, and the action and plot seemed abrupt and forced. Who would believe a German officer would return to a French village after the war and hope to marry the sister of a man he had had hanged for treachery against the Wehrmacht? Well, maybe no one, but the ending of this piece is brilliant and chilling, like something out of Shirley Jackson.""Cake"" is more fluidly written, very well-written. Again, the premise is forced: a young American literary scholar decides to stay on after WWII's outbreak and becomes active in the French Resistance and then is hidden away in a Belgian insane asylum (that's what they were called back then). There he encounters a group of intriguingly sick folk and a lissome Jewish girl, not at all mentally deficient, with whom he falls in love. Ultimately things do not turn out well, as one would expect, but the portrait of the girl is superb, and there are stretches of dialogue that are preternaturally good--full of insight casually shared.Generally, Steiner has a phrase maker's brilliance. He is adept at compressing his erudition into a sentence, or a clause, while moving the story forward. These observations are psychological, historical, and aesthetic; they're always apt and make you blink with gratitude.""Sweet Mars"" sweepingly recounts the fates of privileged schoolmates, now hurled on the rocks of modernity by the storms of World War II. It's beautifully written. One minor character, who gets chucked out of the story by a divorce, an American named Vi, is more or less at the apex of bit parts in fiction. She's just so annoyingly smart. The two mates most attended to have more depth, great depth. Their school year friendship makes sense, their dilemmas post-war make sense, the pain they suffer makes sense. Here we have Steiner demonstrating how wars demolish souls. Writing against the grain of soldiers typically pounded into silence after their wars, Steiner opens up wretchedness as it is felt, a constant rain of misery, marriages destroyed, livers vanquished, ideals trampled, achievements belittled. At one point, Steiner raises the question of who is dead, after all--the survivors or the departed? Maybe the survivors, he suggests.Toward the end of the piece, Steiner writes himself into a box he breaks out of in an odd way that I felt signaled a final downpour of drivel, but he recovers, and the final passages, the incomplete reconciliations, the returns to the scenes of battle, and the inevitable surrender are convincing, poignant and masterfully delivered....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2017","Aug 28, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1355943.Anno_Domini

Already a famous researcher and clinician, Charcot took on the task of documenting and exhibiting ""hysteria"" in the final decades of the 19th century. Hustvedt focuses on him and three of his prime, ""star,"" patients--Blanche, Augustine, and Geneviève--as a means of describing for the reader what is tantamount to a small hysteria about hysteria.Charcot, a neurologist, believed there was a physical explanation for hysteria, although he didn't know what it was, couldn't find it in postmortems, and in fact made no consistent attempts to cure it. In a way, he saw his role as describing hysteria, first relocating its origin beyond the uterus (easily enough done since some men were known hysterics), and then developing a kind of dramaturgy around it. A good hysteric would go from a sense of an episode coming on to forms of rigidity or lethargy followed by bizarre physical posturing (known as ""clowning"") and ultimately a period of delirium, which could be babbling, dreaming-out-loud, being unreachable to reason, having visions, hearing voices, or succumbing to fear, passion...virtually any emotion subject to intensity. An hysteric is never simply amused, droll, dry, witty, or ironic. The word for Charcot's hysterics is histrionic.Hustvedt's research is massive and spellbinding. She describes a hospital that housed thousands of women in conditions of ""insanity"" or despair or incapacity with a core of some hundreds of hysterics kept in a special ward. Charcot and his assistants monitored the hysterics closely. On certain days, he would march into an amphitheater that held 400 spectators (including actresses, writers, politicians, other doctors, journalists, and the generally curious) and trot out the likes of Blanche, Augustine, or Geneviève to be hypnotized and then led through the phases of the illness. Hypnosis was largely discredited as a scientific phenomenon by Charcot's time, but he brought it back into vogue. Under hypnosis, an hysteric might experience no pain when punctured with a sharp object, bark like a dog, bend over backwards and place her hands on the floor like a contortionist, have her ovaries squeezed to quiet her symptoms with a device something like a chastity belt, experience her numb spots move from the right side to the left side of her body when she was touched with a special metal or an electrode, cry out in ecstasy, or perform acts, some erotic, due to post-hypnotic suggestions.People loved watching this. They loved the  that publicized Charcot's work with photographs of the women frozen in impossible positions, ecstasy, prayer, or agony. And the best of the hysterics, our aforementioned trio, generally, but not always, performed with convincing gusto. Charcot wasn't a charlatan. He was deadly serious and profoundly successful in identifying conditions that remain recognized to this day (ALS, for example). Under his direction, the Salpêtrière gained in order, cleanliness, humanity, and renown. But he did not have, until the final years of his life, any sense that the body was connected to the mind. This overstates the case, but only slightly. He was a 19th century scientist, a so-called positivist, committed to material reality. So there had to be an organic cause for hysteria...had to be.Hustvedt does two things wonderfully: She draws detailed pictures of the three aforementioned female stars of the play and she concludes the book with musing about the analogs of hysteria today: what is anorexia nervosa? what is bulimia? what is depression? what is cutting? what went from being soldier's heart to shell shock to Gulf War Syndrome to PTSD? We lump many things under the heading of psychogenic diseases; then we alter the way we lump them; then we subdivide them. Hustvedt doesn't crusade about this, but when you read this book and the utterly incredible nature of late-19th century hysterics (preceded by the utterly incredible behaviors and symptoms of Catholic saints), you lose any reservations you might have had about the interconnectedness of the mind and body.Suppose a young woman cuts off her left nipple. Suppose her skin, traced over by a stylus, is susceptible to manifesting a doctor's autograph for days afterward in raised lettering. Suppose she freezes in an unbreakable crouch. Suppose you can put her in a straitjacket over and over again and she always gets out, often by chewing her way through. Where does the energy come from to do these things? where does it reside? how is it loosed? why does it follow set sequences?Freud spent 4 months attending Charcot's lectures and demonstrations. He, too, was a positivist on arrival in Paris, meaning he had not yet thrown his lot in with the psychogenic. When he returned to Vienna and hung out his shingle, he tried hypnosis but didn't have success. (He didn't use a gong or a gold watch on a chain, his method was pressing his hand on a patient's forehead.) So he came up with the idea of just letting a patient talk, ""free associate."" His focus was not so much on physical symptoms, it was a focus on the mind. So 400 people couldn't watch as the ""talking cure"" evolved, yet in some ways, Freud's misjudgments and scanty documentation notwithstanding, the mind become the star of the 20th century's new play thanks to his efforts and --here I'll give you a new word or remind you that you have always known it but not seen it used for years -- indagations. (My spell check went into hysterics over that one, by the way.)Today we continue to look for chemical solutions to mental/psychological issues, and we have had great success, but as Charcot was fond of quoting, ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio/Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10102358-medical-muses

Wallerstein's well-argued point is that these academic disciplines fail to generate a total picture of what he terms world-systems. World-systems, Wallerstein argues, are not necessarily globe-encompassing. They are, for example, something like the Atlantic Community (Western Europe and North America), or, more diverse and less integrated, the Pacific Rim community. These are systems that, in effect, are worlds unto themselves based on their level of economic interdependence, non-violent political rivalry, cultural interpenetration, and adherence to agreed rules of commercial competition.Wallerstein thereby attempts to leap over terms like socio-economic, socio-political, socio-cultural, etc. The core of his case, however, does revolve around the predominance of capitalism as the controlling dynamic of all these world-systems (short of war). He defines capitalism, quite lovingly, as ""a historical system defined by the priority of the endless accumulation of capital."" Wel,l perhaps not so lovingly, but accurately. What else is meant by an individual possessing or ""being worth"" $10 billion or $25 billion? Does this not suggest that these capitalists are on an endless search to become richer?In this short, lucid book, Wallerstein traces the evolution of our ways of thinking about capitalism and suggests, persuasively, that it is in the end an economic process that, in eternal pursuit of profits, will tear power from some regions (the Netherlands centuries ago, for example; Great Britain more recently; perhaps the U.S. in the coming decades) and relocate it in regions where the costs of producing goods and services are lower and therefore the profit margins are higher.In the Pacific world-system, this dynamic obviously fosters the interests of China, especially since, as Wallerstein points out, there is no such thing as free trade or free markets. Rather, what we see through time, and today, is that nation-states have organized themselves to support their ""firms""... and that market-distorting policies are the essence of political maneuvering in a transnational sense. China is rather brazen at that game.All of this is also sustained, Wallerstein says, by societies, or social structures, that are shaped in ways that support and accommodate capitalism through skilled and unskilled workforces. Wallerstein is not a Marxist; he's a scholar who doesn't see how one can detach the anthropological from the sociological, political, economic and cultural elements of being human. His somewhat softly stated prediction is that inequalities of wealth distribution (the billionaires versus the people who can't afford health insurance, the ill-paid tech worker in Bangladesh versus the the potentially even worse-paid tech worker in Kenya) likely will bring on a crisis in capitalism that won't be something current world-systems will work through. For him, crisis means crisis, turning point, profound change.With Brexit and the unilaterist nativism of Trump, we are seeing a turning away from the verities that have underpinned the endless pursuit of capital for several hundreds of years. This means not only revised trade arrangements (the commercial dimension of a world-system) but also revised immigration arrangements (a sociological dimension of a world system). While the EU pursues ever-closer union, the US and UK are heading in another direction, and issues like recapturing runaway factories, with huge socio-cultural impacts on places like Cleveland, Ohio and Janesville, Wisconsin, gain in salience, provided that said runaway factories are not recaptured to benefit undocumented aliens (which is exactly how a true capitalist would like to see things turn out.)Wallerstein works in sharp observations on how capitalism also affects the environment, irreplaceable natural resources, infrastructure, and taxation. He suggests that that there are two fields of study: the so-called natural world and the social world. Someone created the natural world, or it just happened, but we created and continue to create the social world. And we are divided into three camps: Conservatives, Liberals, and Radicals (of the left and right) There's no need to explain what these camps are all about. I suspect anyone reading this note already knows. In a sense, that's the odd strength of this book: almost everything here is what everyone already knows. It's a very straightforward treatise about how we tend to overlook general truths because, like anthropologists or specialists in other social disciplines, we are wedded to fascinating particularities.Who was it who jokingly came up with a course title, ""All Previous Thought, 101""? Was it me, many decades ago?

No doubt it is heresy to note that most estimates suggest 16,000+ individuals were guillotined during this period and yet it's not clear, to me at least, that ISIS has yet attained such a number through beheadings. This is not to exonerate ISIS, which is despicable, but the guillotine was despicable, too. (And it was in use up to 1977, did you know that? I didn't.)What we see in Dickens' text is a mixture of things. This steely spine I've referred to is created by a kind of descriptive, atmospheric, generalizing writing at which Dickens excels. He is wonderful staring brute force, manic behavior, and uncontrollable human energies in the eye. His prose is self-possessed, daring, and amazingly vivid, given that he did not live through the French Revolution himself. The Paris of the Revolution was a nightmare in his pen.There are then two other main elements in the work. Characters are another strong point, especially Dr. Alexandre Manette, who ultimately survived his long term in the Bastille by becoming an obsessive shoemaker, but also the roguish, no-good, self-sacrificing Sidney Carton, who redeems himself in the final pages of the book and, I would add, Madame Defarge and her husband and the assorted Jacques who assist them. Here again I have the feeling that Dickens was coming to terms with his views, and expressing them, quite clearly and personally. He was saying: ""This is what people are; this is how they can be deformed by events; this is the consequence of history; no comedy can soften this.""Less compelling--and I won't be the first person to note this--are the multiple coincidences and overlaps that hold together Dickens' plot and give us its lovely, unbelievable victims and do-gooders. The word for this is melodrama, which isn't all bad, but naturally lacks the convincing force of Dickens condemning his subjects more than romanticizing them. Dickens' pure literary talent enabled him to do anything he wanted with fiction and the English language. He had an ear and eye and mind for everything. On certain mornings, he wrote with deadly serious conscience, obliging him to take on and diminish the ""greats"" of the world. On other mornings, keeping his popular audience in mind--its yearning for twists and turns and surprises and heartbreak and enduring love--he fiddled and twisted and played pranks. Shakespeare, of course, did the same. Comic relief, we call it.He was, all in all, a driven genius of a novelist, and there are passages in A Tale of Two Cities, starting with its famous first line, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" that are thunder between the covers of a mere book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 10, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities

She's perplexing because Joyce Carol Oates' collection of stories, Give Me Your Heart, underscores how perplexing and interesting she is as a writer. She's perplexing because she sometimes writes poorly or sloppily (probably because she writes so much so fast), and yet she is interesting--and this contributes to why she is perplexing--because her fiction is committed to the project of exploring the moral conditions of contemporary America. She doesn't explicitly target America's worst, worst situations. In a way, she's scarier because she targets ""near-worst"" situations. In other words, she doesn't write, at least in this collection, about gangs in Chicago. Instead, she writes about lower class victims and perpetrators of abuse, violence, and war.The setting might be a lakeside vacation community or somewhere in the mining zone of the upper midwest or the dreariness of central New Jersey. The characters often are girls being preyed upon by older boys/guys, or women being spurned/abused by higher status males, or, as in the final story, a badly maimed soldier returning from one our recent war zones, Iraq or Afghanistan or both. There are drugs, to be feared, and there is someone in prison, to be visited, and there is deceptively mature pubescence, to be exploited. And people get older, they ache, they complain, they can't tell hot from cold. Meanwhile, Oates rushes along through all of this, the polluted swamps, the crumbling roads, the yearning to be back in a warm classroom with everything in order and the only problem being the meaning of hypotenuse, as in, What the hell is that? I give her a great deal of credit for taking these settings and individuals on.After all, she's a professor at Princeton, she knows western literature backward and forward, and yet she slums in dreamworlds of despair rather convincingly, reminding us that so many of our fellow citizens live lives that are dangerously underfunded, oversexed, depressed, angry, and, that word again, violent. There's going to be violence in any Joyce Carol Oates' collection of stories just as there is going to be violence on the front page of most newspapers. Yet it's going to be somewhat better explained, more understandable, than newspaper stories. And, because it's fiction, which is more moving than made-for-TV stuff, it's going to be more precise and powerful. This isn't play-acting; this is material that comes, as I've suggested, from the moral imagination of a scholar-writer who gets into heads and hearts, whose literary gifts are immense, if sometimes ill-used.Who knows, but maybe it can be said that Matthew Arnold was the last literary figure who contended that misery must not be overlooked in literature. Or maybe it was Dickens. (Who died first?) Or maybe it was Dreiser or John Dos Passos. But anyway, we come to Oates insisting on the horrors of a University of Pennsylvania boy fulfilling, at long last, the nightmares of his parents about adults preying upon children...or is it children preying upon adults?These stories are awful in the original sense of the world--full of awe. They are realistic enough to be ghastly. And they are speckled with the oddities of Oates' rushing this way and that. She will use ""hotly"" as an adverb when, since D.H. Lawrence, and not even then, no writer ever has used hotly effectively. She will refer to a .22 as a favorite old deer hunting rifle. Nope, she doesn't know much about rifles, or shotguns--she refers to a Remington 1100 as bolt-action. Does that matter? To most readers, probably not, but doesn't she have an editor or a Google connection? Oates is too focused on the sex drive, the social taboo force, the Thanatos urge, and the revenge desire to worry about certain details. And she feeds the reader's imagination with too many juicy tidbits to have to worry about those details. What Oates possesses, in abundance, is the ability to set a tale in concrete and use that solid foundation to build a structure of suspense. She gets off to good starts. Then she seasons her narrative with mundane situations that could go wrong but don't...until she settles on situations that are not mundane and do go wrong.I've never met Joyce Carol Oates. I imagine she is well-spoken, perceptive, erudite and...nice. Her writing, however, is not nice.

In parallel, large banks like Morgan Stanley, etc., etc., created ""dark pools"" of stocks wherein their customers could buy/sell without having to go through exchanges.So here we have in the post-2008 financial meltdown another hideous example of worthless activity that made thousands of moral and cultural cretins rich beyond belief.Flash Boys is written as compelling, story-telling journalism, but the ins and outs of some of it are sufficiently technical that I don't want to repeat it all, and I wonder if folks less conversant than I am with stock markets would really appreciate the magnitude and cynicism of the tactics that were employed. What everyone will understand, however, is that ""the system is rigged."" Simple example: A safe way to invest is to buy index funds from Vanguard, which has very low costs to the investor. However, even a giant like Vanguard, when approaching buy/sell time, lacked (and perhaps still lacks) the speed to outrace the foxes already in the chicken coop, ever ready to manipulate prices and skim off tiny fractions of monetary fat that, added together, became icebergs of gooey lucre...and outrageous apartments in NY, private jets, mansions in Darien, $2000 loafers, and $600 bouquets on Secretary's Day.Flash Boys' hero is one Brad Katsuyama, originally from the Royal Bank of Canada, a staid, 9th ranked player in New York. Frustrated by high-frequency rip-offs, he created a new stock exchange that did not reward speed and encouraged transparency so that generally the buy/sell point met in the middle, i.e., $1 versus $2 became $1.50. Lewis tells Katsuyama's tale well. But there are other heroes on Katsuyama's team and there is a subplot based on a Russian programmer who innocently ""stole"" open source code from Goldman Sachs and lost his job, home, wife, kids and freedom because no one in the FBI or the court system really understood the digital magic being worked on Wall Street.If you think you would like this book, read this book. If the subject matter turns you off, don't read it, but there is a larger issue here you should deal with in you own way and time. That issue is the predatory force creating income inequality everywhere, impoverishing retirement accounts, and distorting reality beyond recognition so that, literally, what you see with your own eyes is a lie. This force doesn't just show up in the financial system. It animates the airlines, Amazon, Microsoft, Big Pharma, Monsanto, and the list goes on...Walmart...the political parties...Hollywood...and on... and on. A guy like Brad Katsuyama sacrificed millions because he'd rather thwart the force than be part of it. That's why he's a hero, but there are other ways to be a hero, too: recycle, borrow and return books from the library, love your kids, ride your bike to work, eat locally grown produce. Futurists of a certain ilk--let's call them greedists--have a fatalistic but self-serving vision that entails us surrendering to the wave of innovation heading our way. They think up a million and one unnecessary services, conveniences, and con games designed to move the money their way, not ours, enrich their lives while impoverishing ours. Give Lewis credit for giving us one good account of how the flesh-eating bacteria of modern life are working their way past our knees....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 31, 2017","Jul 31, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24724602-flash-boys

The absurdity of this proposition might be something out of Kafka or Beckett or a contemporary writer, but of course Kleist wrote it in 1806. He then demonstrated his unusual talent for marching absurdity along the path of straight-faced realism while powdering it with sympathetic touches of romanticism. He was a tale-teller, a clue-dropper, and something of an antiquarian, meaning his work often indulged in the magic of times past, of legends, of miracles. In this sense, he was a very early bridge figure between the 19th and 20th centuries, at one and the same time ironic and tender.In my edition, which I don't find listed in Goodreads, Thomas Mann's introduction suggests something special about Kleist's style, in German, that was essential to his trickery: he burnished his prose to the point that the reader would glide across it quickly while at the same time constantly being caught on its prickers. Emotion wells in all of these stories, likewise violence. In ""The Earthquake in Chile"", Kleist commences by noting that just as the earthquake struck, Jeronimo Rugera was standing next to a pillar in his prison cell, preparing to hang himself. In ""St. Cecilia or the Power of Music,"" Kleist commences by placing four brothers in Aachen, determined to start a riot in protest against the Catholicism of the Convent of St. Cecilia. In ""The Engagement in Santo Domingo,"" perhaps the scariest of Kleist's tales, he commences by introducing the fierce African Kongo Hoango mercilessly leading a revolt against the island's French whites.All of these stories, as I commented in my  of ""Michael Kohlhaas,"" achieve compression and excitement by being ""told,"" not ""shown,"" exactly what contemporary critics and creative writing teachers most abhor. But it is the ""once upon a time in a strange place"" quality of Kleist's fictions that making ""telling"" work--along with that steel smooth style of his. ""The Duel"" is dense with period-piece detail while hurtling improbably toward the enigmas of God on the one hand and lascivious chambermaids on the other. It relies on the power of honor and shame that even today does not need explaining even if duels are a thing of the past; that power can simply be assumed. Of course, men would fight over such slanders and insults. Of course, there'd be a naughty woman behind it all and a virtuous widow almost forced to pay the price for the wench's mischief.There are writers like Pushkin and Kleist who are revered in their native tongues but not valued quite so highly in translation. Kleist's peculiar appeal to his German-speaking audiences (Kafka loved him) derives, I suspect, not only from his painstakingly revised prose but also from his intimate insights into the hypocrisies of pre-unification Germany and pre-dissolution Austro-Hungary. He stands nobility, justice, passion, loyalty, and pomposity on their heads and makes them look convincingly silly. He writes exactly what he knows people think but don't say, and that's what made Kafka laugh so hard. But at the same time, Kafka's protagonists suffer passively while Kleist's, venting his own anger, I suspect, fight hard...or, as often happens, they faint, a kind of trope in Kleist that mostly affects women overcome by the nauseating truth of things but occasionally affecting a man, even killing one...by fainting!The key to Kleist, I think, is that you take him seriously by not taking him seriously. You laugh even if you aren't in on all the private German riffs. You know that because he is so strong, so headlong, so compelling, he is fully aware of what he is doing when he blows up conventions with nary a hint of puckishness.Evidently he was miserable, shy, and unhappy most of his life. He had the wild notion that somehow he could supplant Goethe in the pantheon of German literature. But we should forgive him that. Kleist at his wildest is Kleist at his best.

Hence he did not feel it.""""Human judgment of human actions is true and void, that is to say, first true and then void.""In a declarative way, such statements are analogues of his beautifully opaque fictions, and yet there is, as one reads along, a sense that Kafka is not having quite as much fun and cutting closer to his own bones.Here's another example: ""In a certain sense, the Good is comfortless.""Repeatedly Kafka writes as though to him Good and Evil were meaningful terms, although as in this example, the actual meaning is empty, or Good cancels Evil, or vice versa.He writes about God less compellingly that ""impatience,"" which he identifies as the greatest of human flaws, or weaknesses, more than once. It is as though he is saying to himself that enduring The Trial or visiting The Castle might not be such a bad thing if one were only more patient with mystery.Some passages go so far as to suggest, to me at least, a Zen-like attitude toward existence, which is to say a negation of existence or indifference or an acceptance of all things as one thing and one thing as all things.""There is no having, only a being, only a state of being that craves the last breath, craves suffocation.""These little blue notebooks are shocking in the sense that they reflect conclusions external to Kafka's fictions, a brooding resignation, an editorial dismissal. As disturbing as his fictions are, they bother about telling a story and in stories lie nooks and crannies of hope or at least echoes thereof.Perhaps some of that survives in his most private thoughts: ""The indestructible is one: it is each individual human being and, at the same time, it is common to all, hence the incomparably indivisible union that exists between human beings."" The best fiction writers cloak ""thought"" in plots, characters, settings, tonalities, rhythms. They create and hide in aesthetic structures. And yet fiction writers do have explicit thoughts.

For the better part of his intellectual life, he sequestered himself in mathematical and cosmological thought. Then, in his forties, he became deeply involved in alchemical experimentation. He wasn't able to turn lead into gold, however, and it would appear that a massive depression he experienced had something to do with this failure. Approaching fifty, he wanted to earn more money--he had ample fame--and move from Cambridge, where he was a professor, to London, where life might be more enriching in different ways.The turn from science (pure thought) to administration and then detective work has few parallels. I think, for instance, of Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist who directed the Manhattan Project, but no one else comes to mind.Some of the Amazon verbiage about this book suggests it would make an excellent HBO mini-series. I think this suggestion is correct. There are many other books that dwell at greater length on Newton's character and personality. His genius was in some measure a function of generalized obsessiveness, a non-stop drive to do away with whatever provoked him. A frightening man, implacable, impossible to out-think.

For the first 250 pages of the book, there’s not much said about Lincoln. Instead, Blumenthal recounts the North-South, Democrat-Whig, struggles seeking to find some way in which the United States could remain united with slavery in its bowels.If there is anything this book accomplishes, it puts an end to any idea that the Civil War was not about slavery (i.e., it was really about states’ rights or purely economic rivalry) and that the Civil War was avoidable and/or unnecessary. Southern selfish hypocrisy and Northern obsessive indignation are presented in detail, the chief antagonists being John Calhoun and Henry Clay succeeded by Jefferson Davis/Stephen Douglas and, eventually, Abraham Lincoln.Slavery was a crisis without end, and when it found an end, it was begun again. No compromise or measure from the Ordinance of 1787 through the Missouri Compromise and onward was a final settlement The issue as we know was extending this pernicious institution to the new territories (substantially, but not entirely, taken from Mexico). Blumenthal’s portraits of Clay, the Kentuckian who sought to constrain slavery; Davis, the Mississippian who exhibited an incredible will in supporting slavery and dreaming of its extension to Cuba, more of Mexico, and Central America (a Southern Empire); and Douglas, the political king of Illinois always in overdrive due to ambition, greed, and a lot of whiskey, are compelling.Davis’s control of the agreeable, handsome, and malleable Franklin Pierce is presented with great art and insight. Douglas, the master dealmaker and egomaniac, is Davis’s equal in guile and determination. Poor Clay served to illustrate–to Lincoln–the power of the pro-slavery factions, aided and abetted by men like Millard Fillmore and James Buchanan.Lincoln, in this volume of a multi-part study, spends many, many pages riding the Illinois judicial circuits and attempting to save the Whigs. He is a one-term congressman with a powerful mind, compassion for all other human beings, and a certain practical bent when it comes to aiding and abetting the political process in Illinois, about which we learn more, probably, than is of interest to most readers.Blumenthal’s best work on Lincoln comes not from general descriptions of party politics or the views and analyses of Lincoln’s friends but from his presentation of Lincoln in his own pre-presidential words, both as a speaker and a letter-writer. There is at one and the same time a direct firmness in Lincoln’s argumentation and an evocative gift for making use of the Bible and Shakespeare (in particular) in advancing his uncomfortable belief that slavery must come to a violent end. Remember, this is in the mid-1850s, so don’t let anyone tell you that Lincoln didn’t sense and live through the inevitability of the Civil War. He was practical and would have preferred some other end, but his forebodings were strong and accurate.What we see is a deeply, deeply political Lincoln, a man of self-discipline and self-restraint, who has a knack for inspiring trust in others and deploying them, move by move, on a complex chessboard. Chicago is one thing, Springfield is another–let’s put it that way. He does not want to give up on the Whigs and takes the longest time, years, accommodating himself to the need to forget them and move on the aligning himself with the newborn Republicans.That Lincoln was a Republican and the current president of the United States is a Republican should not be taken as meaningful. Lincoln’s thoughtfulness, his precision, his humility, his wit and humanity made him an epic of a man. No contemporary comparison is welcome.Blumenthal’s 250 pages of “setting the stage” for Lincoln’s re-entry into politics after leaving Congress (one term) probably is necessary but surely could be compressed to give this study more narrative impetus. That’s more than a quibble, but it’s still an impressive work of U.S. political history....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2017","Jul 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753654-wrestling-with-his-angel

Steiner writes beautifully and brilliantly about Russian, French, English, American, German, Italian, and Jewish writers--Kafka, Solzhenitsyn, Bernhard, Benjamin, Weil, the list goes on. He has an extraordinary ability to place his subjects in context--political, historical, cultural, intellectual--and a rare gift for criticizing the weaknesses of writers he reveres. His piece on Simone Weil is a masterpiece of extracting gold from a very dingy mine. His piece on Russian writers and the fundamentally political nature of their work reflects a multi-century grasp of their wild, frustrated unity. He is both charitable and critical of Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.It's Steiner's gift to understand that no writer or literary work can be completely satisfactory in every dimension just as no human being, or literary character, can be without failings and contradictions. Beyond forgiving those failings and contradictions, Steiner devotes energy to detailing them with considerable objectivity and often compassion. This a matter not just of sensitivity but intellectual balance and rigor. In some cases, he's simply being fair. In other cases, he's just relating the sad facts of how the 20th century, in particular, deformed great talents.Steiner's throwaway observations about Jesuits, or the Russian czars, or Hitler, or Betrand Russell reflect breathtaking erudition. He can be accused of being an elitist, though not by me, but he can't be accused of not documenting his judgments with facts and specific examples (as opposed to general ideological principles.) In his essay on Anthony Blunt, Steiner examines Blunt both as an influential and diligent art historian and as a species of misguided toff playing at espionage with significant consequences. One has to feel, along with Steiner, that Blunt's cadre and connections at the higher levels of British society somehow were complicit in his darker activities...that friendship among a special class outweighed loyalty to a nation.Few literary writers are as broad-gauged as Steiner. Susan Sontag read as widely and deeply, perhaps. The same can be said of Edmund Wilson, who wrote as well albeit more compactly. Overhearing a conversation between Steiner and Harold Bloom, if they got along, would be worth several years of one's life. How does Steiner know exactly where Amos fits in among Old Testament prophets? (And he does.) How much work did Steiner have to put in to dissect all the great Viennese writers and thinkers and artists and composers in one brilliant paragraph after another?One thought that occurs to me in reading Steiner, very focused on central Europe with a deep background in the roots of western civilization, is that we may, in the 21st century, be facing the need to recalibrate our literary perspectives in a much broader historical and cultural context. Asia is the simple, one word way of putting this. Not just China but India and Japan as well. We in the west certainly have begun this work and been doing it for decades, in some cases centuries, but we're not far enough into it so that someone like Steiner has appeared who is fully at ease with a transition from comparative literature to something that might be called global literature. I suppose Joseph Campbell, working with myth, has come close, but the full appreciation of literature itself requires a detailed knowledge of history and intellectual/aesthetic cross-currents, including the biographical forces that direct genius in one direction or another....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2017","Jul 03, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3626284-at-the-new-yorker

In another sense, it's a tribute to the family farmhouse where he spends his final days, unafraid of death but not enamored of dying.He is unabashed in detailing the grim facts of decrepitude--the four-wheeled walker, the wheelchair in airports and museums, the inability to go upstairs in his farmhouse, the surrender of his driver's license because two accidents taught him he was a menace--but he retains a singular clarity of insight and expression, a specificity and succinctness, that demonstrate he's in full possession of his intellectual faculties when he's not nodding off.I love Hall's recollection of interviewing T.S. Eliot and asking him if he thought he was any good...and Eliot saying hell no, no one thinks he's any good. I also love Hall's thick skin in shrugging off the meaning of rejections (which come with the territory for all writers), honorary degrees (which are more for the university that grants them than the recipient), and awards (one writer who'd won a Pulitzer said that if he received a National Book Award next, he'd know he was no good for sure.)Here's a man who has lived long enough to have met Robert Frost and heard him, kind chap that he was, privately trash Eliot, Stevens, and Williams...and who met Dylan Thomas and heard him say that he stole his most famous poem from Yeats (Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night) and didn't really like it...and who met Mrs. Fiske and Her Daughter forty years after Whistler immortalized them.Jane Kenyon, the love of Hall's life, is underplayed somewhat in this collection, which is interesting. For many years, I thought Hall would never again write about anyone else. But here is his first wife, Kirby, and a fine account of why the marriage occurred and failed, and a series of cameos by Hall's current caretakers, notably his close companion, Linda, who for a long time (not possible any more) accompanied Hall to readings where he insists, for reasons he doesn't explain, he would ""say"" poems, as in, ""Then I would say a poem..."" Doesn't that strike you as an odd usage?This curmudgeon is happy to recount shooting groundhogs and other infestations too large and quick for his cats or dogs to dispatch. He allows that mindless activity is quite fitting for intellectual workers played out come nighttime. He says he was drunk in his forties and doesn't remember them well. He clearly has a fond memory of the young woman who told him she wanted to wrap her legs around his head. And he is pleased that he gave up a tenured professorship at the University of Michigan to become a freelance writer--almost no one in his right mind would do that, not these days anyway.During William Shawn's editorship at The New Yorker, Hall would receive essay proofs marked up with scores of quibbles. He'd deal with them. Then, usually about dinnertime, he would receive a call from Shawn, who would spend the next three hours harassing him about commas that one might question. Whether this was necessary or not, Hall now writes crisply and knowledgeably. He has a genial way of organizing essays along thematic lines with transitions that sometimes don't seem justified until two paragraphs in. I like the way this makes the reader guess,""Why the hell are we onto this now?""There's no getting away from the end time of a son, a husband, a father and grandfather, however, so that's a kind of constant, a somewhat exasperated muttering in the background. In fact, Hall's primary interest--poetry--is something he says he had to give up. Doesn't have the testosterone for it, the energy to make the vowels howl.I would read this little book if I were you.

Indeed, it seems to me that no matter how grandiloquent Faulkner can be in conjuring tattered generals or obstinate widows or desperately sexual teens or monumental drunks, the foundation of his vision lies in our transience and littleness, a judgment sealed both by war and slavery but rendered in an infinite variety of petty lusts and broken dreams as well.Among his greatest stories are ""Mountain Victory"" and ""Barn Burning,"" fantastic studies in hatred and endurance and revenge and loss, the former focused on the aftermath of the Civil War, the latter focused on that insidious creation of Faulkner's, Abner Snopes. But the list of great stories goes on: ""That Evening Sun,"" ""A Rose for Emily,"" ""Turnabout,"" and a demonic little tale I like in particular, ""Elly.""Reading lots and lots of Faulkner stories one sees past the Southern myth maker, titanic in his rhetoric and ambition, to the resolute writer, strong and economical, versatile and vivid. There is relatively little phrasing like ""the aggrieved and insulted dust"" or ""the implacable fury in the man's outraged eyes."" Instead, there is a mixture of pure story-telling (tale telling) and concrete description, often in biting dialogue.There is something to be said for the view that the greatness of a writer is contingent on the scope of his works. Writers who write brilliantly for years and decades, producing story after story, book after book, make the burden of writing seem light, though it isn't. They write out of need. They write because that's the corner they can't escape anymore. They write out of drive and thoroughbred power, at ease with their speed and the risks they take. If you read all of Faulkner's novels, you'll see this, but that will take you years. If you read all of his stories, you'll see it, too, and it only will take you a few weeks. It's worth the trouble.

Some of the stories are realistic portrayal of life under the regime’s lash (often literally). Others, like the title story, have the air of fables or dark fairy tales. Either way, these stories stand up well both as literature and protest. Dorfman always retains an interest in character, setting, and narrative structure that ensures lasting appeal, long after the Pinochet regime’s demise.I particularly admire a story called “Reader” that examines the role of a censor who becomes wrapped up in a manuscript that he knows he must not let be published…but decides to do it anyway. Another story, “Consultation,” focuses on a doctor, who is being tortured and at the same time probed, half-seriously, for some medical advice of use to his lead torturer.The fake news worlds of authoritarian regimes—where black is said to be white, facts are variable, laws are designed to oppress, not protect, and inconvenient truths are brushed under the rug—demand specialists in irony like Dorfman. And yet they also demand realists, again like Dorfman, who take time to dwell on the human consequences of governmental abuse. In “Family Circle,” the issue initially seems to be a father’s fury that his son has accepted his military service obligations but this argument gives way when the son, returning home for a weekend’s leave, realizes that his twin sister has become a prostitute to put bread on the family table.

It could easilyTHE WAR THAT MADE US WHO WE AREPaul Fussell’s The Great War and Modern Memory (1975) is a tour de force and more than a tour de force. It could easily be the single book assigned for a semester-long graduate seminar focusing on how Great Britain’s literary culture helped shape contemporary understanding of World War I–casting it in romantic, pastoral, theatrical and homoerotic terms–and how World War I returned the favor by shaping the western world’s literature thereafter.The unspeakable folly and stupidity of WWI and how it was fought, trench warfare with assaults at times killing fifty thousand soldiers in a single day, beggared the imagination, driving the likes of Robert Graves, Rupert Brooke, Siegried Sassoon and Edmund Blunden to scour their lifelong reading from past centuries to find, here and there, hints as to how such darkness could be made visible.Fussell demonstrates a mastery not only of professional memoirists’ and poets’ attempts to come to terms with the carnage but also deep knowledge of how Everyman the Letter-Writer portrayed his ghastly experience through the cultural filters of stiff upper lips, the nobility of service, and the tropes of putting on a good show.At one and the same time this is a study that rests on the shoulders of Fussell’s exceptional erudition and his apparently indefatigable efforts to mine the Imperial War Museum’s archives for epistolary realia that demonstrates, year by year, how the molds of culture were filled to overfilling and then broke.No one knew the meaning of trenches or machine-guns until WWI brought them together in a stalemate of slaughter, 1914-1918. Fussell illustrates this better than almost anyone. He is at ease with the English writers of the times, with their American counterparts–Hemingway, Dos Passos–and with their successors– a Norman Mailer, a Ted Hughes, a Thomas Pynchon.Because there are so many aptly chosen quotes, embedded within extremely acute commentary, this is not light reading. Fussell’s expositions of individual poems are masterful, his judgment is excellent. And he does the same with essays and novels, demonstrating repeatedly how WWI never really ended, always thereafter framed human experience as Winston Churchill saw it–war and then more war. When a Norman Mailer inserts parapets into his WWII novel, The Naked and the Dead, he writes with larcenous irony. There were no parapets from which you might be shot in WWII, but the feeling of WWI parapets, where what you were looking out for ended up being your onrushing death, lingered as a useful symbol of what war, any war, is all about: exposing yourself to dying and then doing it, getting yourself killed, having done with it so the next man might have his chance.Fussell’s own story is fascinating. He saw heavy fighting in WWII, returned to the US to get a PhD in English, and then dutifully wrote the books he knew a rising academic was supposed to write, purely literary studies. Once tenured, he told himself the time had come to write a book he wanted to write, and so he produced this unique study of literature not as Rapunzel in her tower but as Penthesilea in battle. The actual uses of literature, and culture in general, have seldom been so well presented, playing a prominent role in the affairs of nations and mankind, teaching the dumbfounded what and how to think about the dumb things they are doing. This social dimension of literature increasingly has become familiar in academe since Fussell’s time, but it was fairly controversial back in 1975. What makes it convincing, in this case, is Fussell’s astonishing command of his subject, both the war and the not so belles-lettres that crawled into and it through it and live to this day. Here we have verse, lice, rats, religion, mustard gas, Arcadian imagery, Milton, and Pynchon’s shit-eating Brigadier Pudding.Ultimately, what we see is the transformation of passing horror into a foundational myth–an origin myth–of the modern world.

Janesville, Wisconsin, once was a manufacturing town. Parker Pen originated there (and was shuttered there). GM built cars and SUVs there, and then as the 70s, 80s, and 90s turned into 2008, thousands of jobs disappeared when the last enormous Chevy Tahoe rolled off the assembly line and GM, forced into bankruptcy, closed its Janesville plant and sank, at the same time, the many parts suppliers that fed it.Goldstein's Janesville proceeds by narrating the consequences for Parker and GM ""families."" Real teenagers were abandoned by their parents, real moms committed suicide, real husbands had to take jobs 280 miles away (spending 2 days a week with their families back in Janesville), and real social activists--teachers, job training directors, health care volunteers--barely sustained ever-diminishing programs designed to help folks keep their houses, deal with their diabetes, and cope with mental exhaustion and illness.This is fact, not fiction. Red brick towns all over America have been, for decades now, deindustrialized, abandoned by large corporations, sold out by unions, and hollowed out by big box stores that decimated Main Street. We all know this, don't we? But Goldstein puts an unforgettable face on the discouraging decay, the happy-talk tough love of politicians like Paul Ryan and Governor Scott Walker, and the loss of small town soul in the hinterland. Janesville became a moral slum, a canyon with the majority crushed by their financial shortfalls at the bottom and the minority, the small minority, doing just fine up on the cliffs above disaster. The Chamber of Commerce crowd crowed that by 2015 Janesville was back. The retrained, underpaid exiles from manufacturing knew better, their kids knew better, their doctors and the coroner knew better.Goldstein traces the year-by-year efforts dozens of residents made to rebrand and renew Janesville, but in a sense, Paul Ryan's refusal to ever visit Janesville's struggling job retraining center symbolized their failure. He became Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan not by looking the facts in the face, but by deciding, correctly, that he could afford to lose the vote in his hometown and still win...small town boy faking compassion by focusing on budget cutting in Washington to give the rich a better chance to get richer.We go back to that sinister capitalist phrase, Schumpeter's ""creative destruction, and sadly are able to see only destruction, nothing creative. We hear Trump's harrumphing about bringing back the jobs and already can see he has no desire to really focus on that (or any idea how). And then we read page after page of this book and face the fact, again, that yes, a GM can and will fail, and no, we have no national response.The fundamentals of life--acutely and painfully highlighted from 2008 on and woven throughout Goldstein's text--are obvious: people need protection from rapist banks and cynical financial manipulators, children need quality education, and everyone needs access to affordable healthcare. Obama did his best; he even bailed out GM; but we have succumbed to multigenerational greed and mismanagement, and it's going to take multigenerational effort to put things right...if we ever do.The Janesville Goldstein presents is unrecognizable to its residents. They cannot imagine a Labor Day parade float featuring homeless teenagers. They cannot believe the food bank shuts its doors after forty families are provisioned when the need runs into the hundreds. Well-intentioned and even ambitious civic efforts are made to reverse the town's plummeting fortunes, but tragically, the local billionaire contributes more to the Republican budget cutters than she does to her own local initiatives. We have known this was coming. Goldstein is not the first journalist to give us the news. Edmund Wilson described our Depresson-era misery in the 1930s. Michael Harrington wrote The Other America: Poverty in the United States in 1962. And of course LBJ and RFK made a stab at advancing a War on Poverty later in the 1960s. But we are not, we keep telling ourselves, a poor country, we are a rich country. But that's only true in terms of dollars and defense budgets, not in terms of common sense or morality. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 21, 2017","May 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33665908-janesville

It gives equal attention to Einstein's personal life, his scientific accomplishments, and his outspoken support for peace, freedom and tolerance.I'll skip the personal life, though it's interesting, and first compliment Isaacson for limning out an element of Einstein's habits of thought sometimes overlooked or underemphasized. In the most fundamental way, Einstein's breakthroughs relied upon Hume's skepticism, Kant's idealism, and Mach's empiricism. Famous for being a theoretical physicist, not an experimental physicist, Einstein turned mental pictures into scientific theories employing as much pure logic as imagination, geometry and mathematics. His techniques and intellectual criteria were, in essence, philosophical. Here we encounter the convergence of all thought, its limits as well as its flexibility. We think of the theory of relativity as ""scientific,"" which it is, but it is more than that; it is simultaneously an expression of the human mind and the natural world... as constrained by philosophical, as opposed to empirical, possibility.Ultimately, Isaacson argues, Einstein settled into a kind of realism that contended something lies beyond what we can think or demonstrate. In this we sense a bit of Schopenhauer and a bit of Spinoza, both a bit soft in comparison to the three thinkers mentioned above. Einstein's realism drove him to the end of his life, fruitlessly pursuing a unified field theory wherein quantum mechanics and relativity mesh. Einstein helped create quantum theory, but he never liked it because its uncertainties made fools of us...and der Alte (God, the Old One).The latter half of Einstein's life was marked more by engagement in world affairs than scientific breakthroughs. Isaacson portrays him as a spokesman for world government, disarmament, freedom and tolerance who learned bitter lessons from World War I, the rise of the Nazis and World War II, the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union, and the fear mongering of Joseph McCarthy and his ilk. And add to all that Einstein's complex relationship to his Jewishness, Jews in general, and the new state of Israel.As the world's most famous scientist, Einstein could and did make himself heard. He was remarkably eloquent, insightful, and yet humble when he spoke out against oppression, the hydrogen bomb, anti-capitalists and anti-communists alike. He tended toward socialism, or egalitarianism, without overestimating its possibilities. He stood by friends who were attacked and accepted responsibility for speaking out in behalf of strangers. As a personage, he was adulated and condemned. Today we may think of him as a beneficent, other-worldly angel. During his lifetime, he wasn't always treated as an angel, nor did he think of himself as an angel. Again, he was astonishingly humble.Five and six and seven hundred page biographies always run the risk, for me, anyway, of becoming litanies--this...then that...then this. The best part of this biography is, and has to be, the part focused on Einstein's intellectual miracles, covering a span of time roughly from 1905 through 1915. How do you go about thinking things no one has ever thought...or ever asked...before? Einstein's life gives us an idea how: imagine visually, guide philosophically, and then document mathematically. Easier said than done. E=mc2 makes perfect sense when you think about it, but first you have to think about it. It takes an Einstein for that.2...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 19, 2017",not set,"May 19, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10884.Einstein

Trump misread or misApparently Steve Bannon recently gave Donald Trump a biography of Andrew Jackson because he sees Jackson as a prototype of Trump. Trump misread or misremembered or couldn't quite get the book. Be that as it may, I thought I'd read the same biography, but I wasn't the only library member in Chapel Hill who had the same idea, so I ended up with a short volume by military historian Robert V. Remini called, unsurprisingly, Andrew Jackson, focusing on his military career but framed within his pre- and post-military experience (childhood and the presidency.)It's a good book. Some of the writing is stiff, but Remini is a master of explaining and analyzing military operations. The fundamental Jackson comes through loud and clear. Jackson was an ambitious, iron-willed, self-disciplined and, by his lights, highly moral man. He had no formal military training and made mistakes, but he learned from them. Contrary to popular belief, he did not win the battle of New Orleans after peace was concluded; the treaty had been signed but not ratified. The battle itself, which made him a national hero, did more than stop the British attempt to control the Mississippi. It sent the world a message that the U.S. could match the world's greatest military power in a head-on collision of forces, outfighting and outthinking the British. It also, because Jackson commanded troops from many states, did a great deal to nurture the idea that the United States was more than a federation of states, each proud and sovereign. In the early 19th century, that wasn't a commonplace concept. (Of course it was Lincoln who saw the U.S. through to the ultimate meaning of ""one nation."")Given that Trump went to a military prep school and never served in the military, there is no comparison between the two men. Jackson's generalship entailed victories in major campaigns. His physical sacrifices and education in the brutality of war, as well as in leadership, made him the towering figure of his day.Jackson's obsession as a military leader was securing the U.S. from indigenous peoples and foreign powers. His thought was that the south could only be safe if the indigenous peoples were confined to smaller spaces--where they would become agriculturalists as opposed to hunter/gatherers--preferably across the Mississippi. He fought and defeated the Creeks and Seminoles in pursuit of this goal, rationalizing these wars as good for the indigenous people because they would be safer somewhere else, far from white settlers. Here we have a species of nationalism that is somewhat Trump-like, although Trump's anti-immigrant stance completely flips the coin Jackson first pried off the table, meaning Trump wants to make America safe for immigrants (most of us) against anyone else who wants to live in the U.S. whereas Jackson was obsessed with displacing people already in the U.S. so that immigrants (most of us) could take over. Eventually, Jackson pushed the indigenous peoples across the Mississippi, following the ""Trail of Tears,"" when he was president. Trump's idea is a kind of metal Mississippi, his border wall. One of the things that irks Trump the most is how far short he falls of true popularity. Jackson was a feted hero; his armies loved, respected, and feared him. He put his life on the line repeatedly. So he had a charisma the billionaire Trump could never attain, much as he wants to be loved for having won the presidency with 3 million votes fewer than his opponent.The issue of populism extends far beyond popularity, of course. Generally speaking, populism entails empowering the little guy, disentangling him from a too-powerful central authority. Here we see a colossal misfit of Trump in the Jacksonian mold. Skipping over his authoritarian, me-me-me concept of rule, one huge issue stands out. Jackson is the only president to have eliminated the national debt. At no other time did the U.S. owe zero to creditors. His reasoning was commonsensical but far reaching: it's better not to have a central government that imposes itself on the nation with financial burdens that stretch endlessly into the future. Trump has styled himself ""the King of Debt"" and his budget and tax proposals follow the precedents he set for himself as a businessman: borrow a lot, push the debt onto someone else, and then take off with the profits and glory.We know that most economists believe debt is a necessary evil, helping the nation deal with downturns and wars and strengthening the nation with wise investments. We also know that we will never retire our national debt and probably will never again ""balance the budget"" as Bill Clinton did. But if we look at the personal values and political priorities of Jackson and Trump, we see opposites. The idea that Trump is some kind of populist because he channels the little guy's anger into his pocket is absurd. Jackson deservedly fell in stature during the Civil Rights period in the '60s, but as misguided and cruel as he was, he was attempting to secure and build the nation, a man of his times. If Trump, too, is a man of his times, that speaks ill of us all and has nothing to do with Andrew Jackson....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 14, 2017","May 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/908321.ANDREW_JACKSON

As I have mentioned, it's an ongoing detective story, fun to read, well-written, set in New York, that becomes, in its final movements a kind of romance in the technical literary sense, which is to say it is realistic but gauzily improbable, a thing of the heart more than the mind. Auster mentions Melville several times in the lead-up to this finale but earlier he has inserted Poe into the story, and it's on the wings of Poe that he flies through the closing pages to the end. Poe also was drawn to detective stories, as we know, that concluded in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, for example, in a mystical, mysterious white-out, an ultimate plunge into the metaphysics of the self giving up on itself, solipsism becoming suicide. That's what Auster is up to.Some of the writing in The New York Trilogy is inspired. The first novella, City of Glass contains an amazing account of how language came to be and came to separate mankind from reality. It also makes use of walking through New York as a kind of writing, which is clever. Ghosts, the second novella, captures the futility of observing anyone from outside. The third novella, The Locked Room takes us inside the prison of self where the full corruptive potency of language, the self's default means of understanding itself, wrecks havoc and destruction.Auster's irony both saves and to a degree defeats his art. The archetype of the private eye (private I) gets turned on its head. It possesses unlikely characters. It leads to other noir references in old movies and makes New York sometimes sepia, sometimes black and white, but never technicolor. But the same ironic toying defuses skillfully constructed tensions, backing Auster away from the desperate grandeur of a Poe or Melville.The solidity of Auster's style, its pace, its rhythms, its focus, its savviness, is probably the key ingredient in The New York Trilogy's overall effectiveness--the satisfactions it provides a reader. If Auster does not even intend to land the kinds of crushing blows his predecessors specialized in--because he does not believe in them, probably, modern life being a smaller spiritual affair and getting smaller all the time--he still flirts convincingly with mystery, makes the unlikely and bizarre seem quotidian, and suggests that storytelling retains some of the magic of yore....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 29, 2017","Apr 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/431.The_New_York_Trilogy

So Richard (failed) goes to great lengths to mess with Gwyn (successful) and does more to upset his own world than he does Gwyn's.Most of the novel takes place in London and features one of Amis's favorite devices--the upstairs/downstairs narratives involving thugs Richard hires to give Gwyn a hard time: a really hard time. But there is an American book tour that avails Amis the opportunity to write with wild, often unbelievable, energy in ripping the former British colonies apart...as he rips London literary society apart...as he rips English country house society apart...as he rips the universe apart in quirky cosmic interludes that seem to be telling us that the human comedy is too trivial to be worth the expenditure of so many words...a lot of words...because once Amis gets going, he's not economical, he's fantastical, he's bloody-minded...he's a bit of a literary spendthrift.Satire,the best way to describe The Information, is a tricky business. Its shelf-life can be rather short. This mid-90s novel still has bite, but there is a cranky joy here that might just become a toothless howl in a decade or two. Overshadowing the antics and rivalries and send-ups is a kind of nostalgia for the days of Dr. Johnson's poets, the era when a well-wrought poem or tale meant more than it did toward the end of the 20th century. This, at least, preoccupies Richard, though Amis's descriptions of his miserable literary productions suggests he has small claim on the verbal worlds he explored when he was a student at Oxford reading Andrew Marvell.By its own explicit terms, The Information can't be comedy or romance because it doesn't end well for Richard. This a man whose physical and mental deterioration somehow outruns the simplicity of dying, plaguing him with the prospect that he will have to go on suffering Gwyn's success for a good long while.On Gwyn, a final word: I don't know exactly whom Amis had in mind. Gwyn's success rides on the back of everyone in his novels being diverse yet conflict-free, the happy happy few. We can think, I suspect, of Voltaire's Dr.Pangloss, or more recently, the forgettable (I've forgotten his name) author of I'm Okay, You're Okay. Feel-good writing works for some people. Amis clearly loathes it.

It's old but it's new.For me A Sport and a Pastime has just been that book. I recall reading and ing James Salter's last book, All There is, and not thinking much of it. It seemed forced, a bit staged, a last gasp (or grasp) of improbable love. But long ago, Salter published A Sport and a Pastime with all of his ingenious technique, phrasing, and gift for chucking plot in the wastebasket in the interest of delving deep into eros and life through the mystery of well-chosen words.This is a novel that seems to be written by a young man, hidden away in France, about another young man, hidden away in France, having a profound encounter of some months with a young French woman, perhaps not twenty. We can't be sure that the first man is making all this up--the story of the love affair, if it can be called love--but that's the impression he leaves. The opening passages are fundamental, riveting, maddening descriptions of a train ride into the France where the writer, who masquerades as a photographer, plans to hide a while. He sees all the things you see in France. Old things. Old churches. Old fields. Old walls. And they are beautiful but maddening because you are not the one seeing them from the train window, he is. And then, more madness, a feckless Yale dropout has his insincere affair with the French girl in great, physical detail, and he's not worth her. His signature quality is possessing a Delage automobile, ridiculously fancy, eye-catching, which by rights ought to belong to the elusive narrator, the one who can describe things (France, meals, breasts, sex acts) so well. But in his subplot self-narrative, the narrator doesn't have a car and doesn't get his arms around a woman he covets in Audun and doesn't have any luck with another woman--girl, really--he'd like to take to bed. In the perverse way things work, he is subordinate to his imaginary friend, the one for whom Anne-Marie would do anything, front or back, up or down.The lover is called Dean or sometimes Philippe or Philip. He knows, we know, the narrator knows, and Anne-Marie knows that he will leave Anne-Marie because, as her mother puts it to her, What has she held back with which to hold onto him? But anyway, while his leaving her is not happening and he is making her happy and she is making him as happy as he can be, not very, the two of them drive around ""the real France"" in the Delage and experience what many of us have experienced via the tantalizing frustrations of so-called travel, or touring, which is to say they see so much, so many hotel rooms, squares, dining rooms, that do not and never will belong to them--postcards in the mind--and so take refuge in one another's bodies, moods, accommodations, quirks. This does generate spells of the erotic; somehow Dean is good for that; and it's a spellbindingly frank eroticism, not too much, not too little, just the way it works. But even then, given that Dean is a wastrel, there is a lack of promise in the lovemaking; there's a certain amount of technical calculation about avoiding what lovemaking might lead to, a counting of days before, during and after certain feminine events. But still, our narrator, going right between the sheets with Dean and Anne-Marie, can get it right without getting it for himself. The alter ego he is constructing for himself outmaneuvers and outperforms him. So that's frustrating and realistic, too. Everyone always thinks everyone else is having what they don't have, don't they?It's all fascinating, really--a beautifully written novel that swirls languidly through the pages, overcoming its weak central character, demeaning its admirable heroine, enabling its onlooking narrator to torture himself with well-chosen, beautifully paced words.This is really a very minor key Gatsby with zero glamour but much more erotic intimacy.

I frankly loved his skill and humor in managing this trick with no transitions between subplots. He is, after all, a superb writer, and he is able, as Philip Roth once said of himself, to do anything with fiction that he wants to do.But I said ""almost,"" didn't I? So what's that about? In fact, what's the novel about? In the broadest sense, it is a study of the Fujimori years in Peru, when Fujimori's intelligence chief, called ""the doctor"" in this novel, ran roughshod over politics, the media, the military, and commerce. Here the doctor help sets up an exposé of a major mining magnate that gets out of hand. A slimy editor is murdered as a consequence. The mining magnate is humiliated (this is a photographic/graphic exposé). The murder ultimately is hung around the neck of a poor fellow who once made a living reciting poetry. The major mining magnate's wife starts an affair with his best friend's wife. The major mining magnate--once clear of his public humiliation--turns out to be the perfect mate for two women in love. And the sleazy female star reporter of the dead editor's almost defunct journal boldly reveals that the guy behind almost everything is the doctor, who is ruined while she becomes a kind of gossipy TV queen. Got that?In a way the trouble with synopses of all novels is that they are crimes against literature. Moby-Dick is a book about a guy who has a thing about whales. Don Quixote is a book about a guy who has a thing about windmills. Remembrance of Things Past is a book about a man who has a thing about cookies.It's just that Five Corners is expertly written in the service of characters who are either repugnant or simply featherweights. There's lots of sex here and a great deal of technical Spanish that enlarged my vocabulary and wore out my dictionary (what exactly are they doing to each other? why is that the term for it?) and there is a flow Vargas Llosa achieves through short paragraphs and just right dialogue. But other than the chapter I mentioned above, only one extended passage has horrifying weight--the mining magnate's brief stay in a jail in Lima.In contrast, Vargas Llosa's Conversations in the Cathedral, also about Peruvian politics, is novel of deeply disturbing and sinister impact. It whispers nasty things to the reader for hundreds and hundreds of pages.Vargas Llosa, of course, lost the presidency to Alberto Fujimori, and Fujimori's wonderfully named intelligence chief, Vladimiro Lenin Ilich Montesinos, surely did Vargas Llosa no favors, so one senses that twenty plus years later, Vargas Llosa decided to settle some scores. The problem is that in this case the historical record outclasses the fictional proposition. Five Corners should have been a nightmare. But for that to be the case, we would have to have some sympathy for someone and the only candidate is the pathetic reciter of poetry, not a very compelling guy....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 05, 2017","Apr 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28190198-cinco-esquinas

He is It pays to reread Borges every few years, and if you are able, to do so in Spanish, for the pleasure of his complex irony so lucidly expressed. He is no more difficult to read in the original than Kafka is in German, although neither is easy to completely grasp, albeit for very different reasons.Kafka is the unawakened dreamer fully engaged in his enigmatic struggles. Borges is the awakened dreamer who has not yet finished with his enigmas. Kafka's dreamworld is a single, internal thing, obedient to its urges and fears. Borges's dreamworld requires reams of referential embroidery, layer upon layer of lacy mischief, some of it the woven product of astonishing erudition, some of it the whole cloth invention of astonishing imagination.Borges in Ficciones is concerned with the mind within which the world thinks it unfolds. He is a labyrinth-builder, a mirror-polisher, a time bandit, a strangely sensuous seeker of any image that is multiple, multi-layered, ambiguous, bewildering. He's an idealist in the sense that what matters is what is subject to thought. He's a gnostic in the sense that what is true bears within itself its own truth, not yours or mine, a truth that predates us, a truth great by virtue of its simple name, which is what, exactly? That's the mystery.He does like mystery stories; he likes a good murder; he likes a vainglorious death; he likes a global complot, a mysterious conspiracy contingent upon discovering a volume that was misprinted or a library that overflowed its bounds and became the world itself.In his wonderful story, ""Pierre Menard, Author of Quixote,"" Borges anticipated the rage of relativism that overtook philosophy, literature, and criticism from the 50s to, in some instances, this day. Menard writes the same Quixote as Cervantes; it's identical; but it's so much different because Cervantes wrote it when it was meant to be written, but Menard had the genius to write it at another time, in another context, when it took such heroic imagination and intellect to write exactly the same thing. Think how hard it is for Menard to make Quixote happen in the face of already having happened!The last story in Ficciones, ""El Sur,"" has been called Borges's best. It's about death and memory, and it is beautifully composed and paced, yielding the impact of stories like Tolstoy's ""The Death of Ivan Illyich"" in a tenth the words. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 28, 2017","Mar 28, 2017","Mar 28, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/426504.Ficciones

Two other books of this kind that ""work"" are The Meeting of East and West by FSC Northrop and Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge by Edward O. Wilson.The Swerve traces the genesis, rediscovery and impact of De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) by the Roman poet/philosopher Lucretius. His poem presents the idea, per Epicurus and Democritus, that the world consists of atoms that collide and cohere and create what we call nature before decaying into what we call death or dissolution or evaporation. Atoms are everything, ourselves included. When we die, we go back to being atoms. There is no afterlife. There is no god. There's just substance, which, again, Democritus conceived of as atoms, each alike and only different in aggregate by virtue of the forms they cohere in . . . temporarily.De Rerum Natura, written around 40 B.C., was somehow lost for the next fourteen hundred years until Greenblatt's protagonist, Poggio Bracciolini, a high ranking papal official put out of a job when his pope was de-poped (he called himself John XXIII), found it in the archives of a monastery in Germany, perhaps Fulda.Poggio becomes the story for a good part of the book. He's an early humanist, we might call him a classicist, despite his duties at the Vatican. Through him we and the world gain insight into the final phase of what might be called the pre-scientific era because his discovery, De Rerum Natura, is a brilliantly written, vivid, compelling disquisition on life as an exercise in physics, not theology, that underpins and reinforces the empirical studies and proofs of the earliest giants of modern science--Galileo, Bacon, etc.--and the meditations of the first great post-theological thinkers --Montaigne, Machiavelli, etc.Greenblatt artfully sketches De Rerum Natura into an historical process (from the classical era into the Renaissance) without overstating or understating its influence. He hits a tender spot well: fear, and fear's role in helping the church control society. With no afterlife to worry about, what is to prevent mankind from misdeeds?The answers Epicurus, Lucretius and others provide are basically twofold: Mankind has a natural disposition to seek pleasure and mankind has a natural disposition to be curious about the nature of things. These two factors serve, or should serve, as guide rails or incentives to live well and wisely.Of course Lucretius and everyone else mentioned here lived on the highest of intellectual planes, so ""common man"" really is not likely to take these points on board in the abstract. What is necessary is a two-fold enactment. The first enactment would be natural science itself permeating everyday life. (We're getting close.) The second enactment would be natural science and empiricism thoroughly displacing religion in the political realm. On this latter point, Greenblatt writes well about Sir Thomas More's Utopia and the problems that would have to be overcome to achieve such a thing (start with no private property and take it from there.)Ultimately the challenge remains accepting the supremacy of reason and the ways in which reason can humble and tame our pride and greed and all our other ""sins,"" prejudices, superstitions, biases, and, let it be said, fear of one another, or fear of ""the other,"" so amply capitalized on by the utterly cynical fear-mongering of the Apprentice in Chief currently residing, along with the occasional intruder, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Consilience by Edward O. Wilson is a brilliant book that aims to point us toward a unity between the sciences and the humanities and in terms of pure reason does so quite powerfully. What it lacks, and what makes it for me a chilling study in the inorganic essence of existence, is Lucretius' poetry, a sense of ""greater than,"" a sense of transcendence, even if it is grounded in the mysterious little atom. The Meeting of East and West by FSC Northrop offers both reason and poetry by virtue of its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons and aesthetics. Northrop was a mid-20th century academic philosopher who understood that culture is something fundamental to the human experience, atoms notwithstanding. Beyond that, he understood, like Schopenhauer, the transcendent power of art.A final point if you're curious: I discovered The Meeting of East and West when I was reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance 35 years ago. Robert Pirsig refers to it there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 14, 2017","Mar 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13707734-the-swerve

To recover from losing his partner, Steve, in San Francisco, he pulled up stakes and headed east That's where he found New York and the man he refers to as O.This is a book that comes in song bursts, short chapters that describes the infinite moods and characters of New York and the tender complexities of O and being with him. Some of the chapters are vignettes, some are diary entries, some wheel around the maypole of deft, pleasing poems.Hayes describes himself first and foremost as a person of feeling. That's consistently evident in his writing--it's all about the aesthetics of emotional response. His life is a moving vantage point, a listening post, an antenna. New York lends itself to that kind of person, one always looking, wondering, open to conversation and encounter, and, as the title indicates, prone to sleepless nights when the sounds keep clanging up off the street, the voices keep calling back and forth, the tree limbs keep slapping against the window in a rain storm.For me the appeal of New York, as for Bill Hayes, isn't its consistent beauty. New York isn't beautiful consistently, it's beautiful periodically, at given moments and in given places. This building charms you, that one is as intriguing as blank newsprint. Likewise the people. They can't be, and aren't, all fascinating. The majority grind life out, but ten or twenty percent bring a talent for showing off, showing up, and putting on a show that justifies keeping your eyes open. What kind of skateboarder will you see? Who will tell you what at a party where you weren't really invited? When will the solitude of an empty subway car suddenly burst forth with the force of a symphony? In New York, they say, you can buy anything and see anything. Hard to deny it.Enter O, a polymath, famous, deeply introverted, shy about his homosexuality, and much Bill's senior, a December/September partnership. For the first time in thirty-five years, O lets himself be seduced, or goes along with it. Bill just has the right sense of humor and patience and companionability. This, then, is the love New York promises in human form, and Bill renders it superbly through accounts of private moments, snippets of conversation, and gliding meditations. He does not own O or vice versa; they live close but apart; they share one another; they give each other room; they have interests that are diverse but not very divergent. The challenge of O, if it is to be put that way, is his utter brilliance, the high plane of his mental life, the richness of his knowledge and urgency of his passions.O's own account of his life, which was written during the period when he and Bill were together, is deeper and more entertaining than Bill's and should be read (My Own Life), but taken together, the two accounts harmonize well, and Bill is able to say things about O that O wouldn't say about himself, perhaps because he didn't notice. (Genius is that way.)And then, as we know, O dies. Liver cancer, in simple terms, but not simple liver cancer. Yet O, having been a doctor for so long and thought himself through for so long, knows how he wants to die, what he wants to have done before it happens and where he wants to be when it happens.Bill Hayes? He finds places to go where he can write this book, and then he confronts the question so many have asked: Can I keep living in New York, or do I have to give it up because I've gotten everything I've ever wanted from it and in it and there's nothing left there but memories of what I lost?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 09, 2017","Mar 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30038960-insomniac-city

There was nothing ragged about his prose, but the characters he focused on and the places he put them in (geographically as well as situationally) definitely had a certain dysentery-like odor to them, resulting in a meal you enjoyed eating more than digesting.Fun with Problems, his collection of stories published in 2010, features drinkers and dopers and women with hard luck and folks who are simply mean and pissed off and generally repellant. A public defender works over a psychological counselor he meets when both are doing their jobs in a local jail. A bum of a journalist wangles his way into the house of his ex-girlfriend's sister and infuriates the sister's husband. An art professor/artist takes a trip to lecture in the most gaseous and plastic corner of Florida's Gulf Coast and gets thrown in jail because he has been served what he considers fake crab squeezed out of a tube. A vagrant husband is turned into a mark by a woman who only wants to get into his house to case it for robbing everything in it the next day.Everybody in Stone's world gets what they deserve--they're freeloaders, faithless, feckless and a bit freakish. Although these stories were published in major magazines like the New Yorker, they aren't really stories. Stone inevitably lets them speak for themselves at the end and say essentially nothing.So what gives? Well, he wrote great sentences, he probed deep into the general creepiness of people you wouldn't otherwise want to know that well, he had an acute eye for the half-baked scams that make the film world (such as it is) tick, he understood rage, he could make rage funny, funnier, then funniest, he wasn't afraid of depicting figures whose general outlines might resemble himself and skewering them for their bad judgment, habits, and associates, he was apparently able to convince highfalutin' editors that his mixed-up points of view and caricatures made sense. So here we have a kind of literary tabloid-ism, lacking the grace and humility of, let's say, Raymond Carver, but nonetheless delivering whip-cracking sentence after sentence. Really, a single paragraph of Stone's hyperbolic yet deadpan prose can contain eight sentences and twelve images another writer might trade a significant tooth for, even a front one.There are times when you feel all right about reading stuff that is as stinky as your worst thoughts and suspicions about the people and places you disliked most in your life.

The first thing is the notion of the angry underdog rising up to become a political scourge of the rich and entitled and along the way losing his personal bearings by womanizing too much, drinking too much, and thumping his enemies too hard...so he ends up hoisted on the petard of his machiavellian maneuverings and what could have been isn't what finally happens. Willie Stark ends up murdered (not assassinated, murdered, because the killing is personal, not political), but again, the notion of a rube country lawyer getting smart and powerful and taking on the vested interests is a compelling one, perhaps especially in America where our basic myth is that each of us is a sovereign...so why shouldn't any one of us, even Willie Stark, get the upper hand?So that's one element of All the King's Men's strength and staying power. The other element, or ground, or just plain thing, is the way the novel is written. It's a southern novel in that it's wordy, folksy, fleshy, and sort of sweaty (because it's hot in Louisiana or Mississippi or wherever the action takes place), but more than that it's the unbridled, full gallop expression of a poetic gift busted out of the corral. Warren's characterizations, his descriptions, the way he sets up scenes with piles of vivid details, is flat out hypnotizing. He makes cars scream, ruins good suits in drenching rains, hides fires in glasses of bourbon, discovers the cheesy smell of old law books, reveals the sexiness of a pock-marked woman who never gets her hair right, and turns a bay's waters fleeing an oncoming storm into bedding being hastily thrown back so that wind god lovers can wrestle in its cottony white foam.Similes, metaphors, sayings, philosophizing and every other rhetorical device and trick enrich this text, usually not going too far, usually veering away from purple excess, and usually, as I am doing right now, employing repetition as the cardinal means of hammering thoughts and significance into the reader's hard head.The truest delight of this book is the narrator's voice, informed by Warren's poetic skill. He writes recursively, which is to say he manages to double back and double back, exploring a second and a third time, the essential rhythms of a confrontation, a scene, and a setting. This takes fortitude and imagination. Fortitude in this case is sheer writerly strength, staying power. Imagination is a varied way of reconceiving what already has been said well and saying it better.Jack Burden, our narrator, Willie's sidekick and counselor, keeps scratching at the opaque surface of things so we can see what's inside. Jack Burden, like this sentence which invokes Jack Burden's name again, doesn't hesitate to give us another well-modulated earful about what's wrong with Willie, what's wrong with Jack Burden, what's wrong with Willie's son, what's wrong with Jack Burden's girlfriend, and what's wrong with Willie's enemies--all of them. That's Jack Burden, doing something most of us have been taught not to do, i.e., use the same words and even the same inflections almost ad nauseam (but not quite) instead of coming up with something new. But here's the thing: Jack Burden builds narrative momentum by inserting just the littlest changes in previously employed formulations; he does this so often and with such art that we get his point the way we get a room in which we are sitting for an hour or so, taking it in once, then again, then a third time, transforming it into a place that we are sick of, or fascinated by, or come to confuse with the cosmos itself, nothing much existing outside this hospital waiting room, or this courtroom, or this miserable hotel room with its threadbare rug and wilted curtains and water-stained ceiling. Reading All the King's Men is like that; you get stuck in its sentences and story because it skillfully sucks you in deeper and deeper. Your life and the novel's life merge, and the novel's life is more graphic, has more pulse, offers more interesting smells, like those cheesy old law books.All the King's Men probably is Robert Penn Warren's best known work of literature, but it's far from his best. His poetry is leaner, stronger, and in some ways wilder. His poetry is more concentrated. His poetry is less repetitious. His poetry is more terrifying. There are hawks and skulls and winds in his poetry that are more memorable than almost anything in All the King's Men, but All the King's Men is a powerful myth that sprawls through thousands and thousands of words and for many hours it has its way and remains worth reading 70 plus years after it was written....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2017","Feb 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/379138.All_the_King_s_Men

More than that, this is a novel replete with knowledge of WWII throughout Europe, with as much action occurring in France as Poland. Furst is a demon for historical detail, anecdote, and quirk. He creates splendidly foggy, smoky atmospheres and populates them with deadly serious, clever characters who could not, back then, get Europe right any more than Europeans today can get it right. (But Europe is still a wonderful subcontinent, and that's part of the reason I like Furst's books so much: they enable me to walk familiar streets via sentences if not sidewalks.)Our officer, de Milja and we'll leave it at that, is a Polish cartographer who falls in with the Polish underground intelligence network. He's reliable, stoic, and resourceful. He does the kinds of things we all like to see happen: sabotages the Nazi war machine by engineering prison breaks, harbor mishaps, and air field miseries. Nothing on a grand scale, but this is just one man, after all, and in a wide-ranging war, a few hundred Polish officers like de Milja, contribute quite a bit of useful chaos -- striking at the Russians, too.Some of the war details are are difficult to follow. At many points Furst is as nimble as de Milja in escaping narrative logjams, leaving the reader scratching his head as to how things quickly ended up here ... and here...and here. But resistance is not a systematic enterprise; it's an opportunistic enterprise; so we forgive Furst for what de Milja must do, much in demand as he is.One of the amusing aspects of the book, unintentional, I suspect, is de Milja's luscious hard luck with women who keep making themselves available to him. This spices the storyline, but after a point, this man who otherwise suppresses all emotions begins to exhibit a suspiciously Hemingwayesque flare for melting sultry accomplices, so it's ""here we go again"" as soon as a new damsel or matron--all women are beautiful and desirable in the face of death--parachutes onto the page.Oddly the most moving and restrained of de Milja's interactions with a woman comes at the very end. I won't spoil it, but it's a nice passage, particularly because he manages to use her as a reference point for recalling women he's lost and not adding to his list of heartaches as a new conquest.As a stylist, Furst is good. He has a restrained but insistent cadence, very sure-footed. Again, he creates settings quickly and persuasively. And some of the situations he imposes on de Mija, whether by research or imagination, are exquisite. I particularly love a difficult truck journey up a tributary of the frozen Bug (maybe my favorite river name).

Pritchett was a British master of the short story form, gifted in turning the surface of social interactions into sudden depths of insight. His characters chatter at one another, bleating revealingly, and his storylines can move across days, month and even years in the span of a sentence. Often he focuses on isolated souls--widowers, spinsters, hard-luck salesmen, black sheep--in search of companionship or just a little contact, and he has a gift for placing them in very routine environments, let's say a kitchen where all the glasses are perfectly lined up or on a seaside walk where a former acquaintance toddles along and threatens to spoil one's holiday.In contrast to Chekhov or Kafka, Pritchett's characters have the peculiar feel of being very specific individuals, limited, not susceptible to generalization. (In Chekhov or Kafka one has the feeling a character is a bit of an emblem, a type, a larger suggestion.)A volume of Pritchett's stories entitled, A Careless Widow, contains three excellent stories and three so-so stories. The difference isn't so much in the execution, Pritchett's sure-footed way of perfectly expressing the way a woman yelps when surprised or a man pulls at his nose when he's fibbing, but in the scope and ambition of the story and, to a certain degree, the weight of the irony.The three excellent stories here are ""Cocky Olly,"" ""A Trip to the Seaside,"" and ""A Change of Policy."" In ""Cocky Olly"" a girl finally breaks into a neighboring family's circle, which is more fun than her own family's circle. The characterization of why one family is fun and the other isn't is perfect; in fact, the tacit premise that some families are more fun than others is something we all know but might feel constrained to keep to ourselves, for fear of offending someone. In a ""Trip to the Seaside,"" a widower realizes he should have seized his chance with a woman before he became a widower. But he was too faithful. In ""A Change of Policy,"" a man pursues a former client when his own wife lies in an apparently permanent coma, and she says no...she doesn't and wouldn't do such a thing...but then she says yes, the change in policy, and is amazingly unconstrained in enjoying herself...and then then the wife wakes up from the coma.The ironies in Pritchett's work don't involve murders, ghastly betrayals, wars, or earthquakes. They are matters of sentiment, self-regard, convention, and manageable passion. He's a writer engaged in contemporary social reality, but he makes the humdrum dance, and in his best stories, he is acutely good....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 18, 2017","Jan 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1983988.A_Careless_Widow_and_Other_Stories

In short, it's a book full of themes and motifs, rich with repetitions, that completes a circuit of stillness, resolving nothing but ending with a certain hopeful fullness, its principal characters still independently dependent upon one another.Noa is a schoolteacher in a town in the Negev desert. Theo is her companion/lover, fifteen years older, a free-lance development advisor. They met in Venezuela, each of them pursuing a flight from Israel, and have returned to coexist in a simple way in a simple place that is complicated by a student's death--by drugs, suicide, an accidental fall, we are not entirely sure.Tel-Kedar is the place, more or less planned, more or less lifeless as desert towns tend to be. The dead boy's father, on assignment in Nigeria, returns and asks Noa to help him establish a kind of memorial to his son; his idea is a residential drug rehab center for addicted youth.Noa wants to take this project on although Theo is better equipped to execute something this ambitious, especially in the face of a community that does not want Tel Aviv's drug addicts imported to Tel-Kedar.Thus begins a very slow motion but carefully described series of pushes and pulls, tracing the rhythm of Noa and Theo's commitment to one another, and the larger pulsing of Israel's geography, history, and peoples.Ironically, so little happens in Tel-Kedar, and in the novel, that Oz is able to be very precise and clear about his characters, their situation, and the setting. In a dead little town in the Negev, people have to generate constant ceremonies--having tea, having coffee, listening to music, the BBC, the wind, the thunder, a lover's breathing--and these are the almost musical passages in this text.I have been in many dead little towns where nothing much happens and don't like them. I'd rather be in the woods or a city. But I found this novel interesting and enjoyable. I particularly liked Oz varying the style of his chapters so that some are narrated by Theo, some by Noa, and some in the third person but from one or the other's perspective. This generates a kind of intimacy and frees Oz to take care of the backstory--how they both ended up in Venezuela and returned to Israel together--rather neatly.So here you have not great events and a great conclusion but a prose experience, sensitively rendered. It is not quite tender but it is not harsh, either. There is something endearing about Oz's own affection for dead little towns where nothing much happens, especially in the maelstrom of the Middle East, which is referred to obliquely, somewhat like the occasional peals of thunder, with neither apologies or explanations....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/78391.Don_t_Call_It_Night

Writing in a general sphere of conspiracy and suspicion he shares with Don DeLillo, and to a lesser extent with Cormac McCarthy and Margaret Atwood, Pynchon's novels have melded history and fantasy with an astonishing array of pop culture tropes, ginning up a general picture of animus amok in the 20th and 21st centuries.It seems to me that Gravity's Rainbow occupies a very special place in the pantheon of counterattacks on ""authority,"" which can be good or bad but in Pynchon's scheme is always genetically bad...but comical, good for satire and the exploitation of power drives and sex drives in powerful weaponry and other technical machinery that can be applied more personally than explosively. The well-placed electrode or a time-release death grip handshake, for example, can be very effective.Vineland, which I've just read after sidestepping it for 27 years, is a spirited farce that hinges on one of Pynchon's great strengths: he creates the illusion of plot without ever providing it.The elements here are a pot-growing region of northern California, hippie uproar in the 60s, love children bearing cutely named children like Prairie, mixed-up diabolical federal agents reporting to shadowy structures within the general structure of the federal government, very powerful women with very beautiful legs, lots of dumb males bumbling along half-lovably, certain bars and bar bands that are as intoxicating as the entire Pacific ocean transformed into a giant margarita when mixed together and . . . and ... here's the catch: the list can go on; characters can appear 270 pages into a book who have no backstory or previous cameos; the general notion of a fishing line in a rat's nest can be turned inside out so that the author doesn't unravel it for another cast, he ravels it tighter; and the underlying sense of pointlessness can run through the pages like mercury loose in the hallways of a junior high school.No, don't read this book. The strong sentences, wonderful physical descriptions, weighty lead-ins, and highly predictive powers found here of a world roughly similar to the one we live in don't warrant the time. It's easier to follow today's news: Syria, ISIS, Russian hacking, Chinese bankrolling of an American president who wears a sheep's ass for a toupee, mad gunmen in Charleston, Fort Lauderdale, and Sandy Hook, and an FBI director who takes out a presidential candidate tell roughly the same story in more bite-sized portions.

It was a solid WWI novel, as I recall, and that's all I recall except the distinctive name--Ford Madox Ford. So I didn't know that I didn't know about his quartet of novels, Parade's End, until I was browsing used books in Flyleaf Books in Chapel Hill and came upon all 900 pages of four novels published separately but ultimately bound together into one huge, wonderful, idiosyncratic novel about Christopher Tietjens, his stiff sibling, Mark, his vicious wife, Sylvia, and his ultimate true love, Valentine...not to mention the multitude of characters that must, perforce, populate a novel that extends through pre-WWI upper-class British life, WWI in the trenches, and post-WWI British decay.This is a cheeky, satirical, witty, comical novel that serves as a kind of hinge between the Victorians and the Modernists. It anticipates Virginia Woolf and Henry Green. It is painfully acute in dissecting values and traditions, stuffiness and scruffiness, principle and vice. Mark is heir to Groby, a great northern estate, of no interest to him or to his younger brother. What to do? Christopher refuses to divorce his wonderful bitch wife, Silvia--because one doesn't divorce--so again, what to do? Valentine has no wherewithal to get her way no matter what she wants...what to do?Christopher is brilliant, idiosyncratic, and complicates everything with self-denial. He's maddening, but he's undeniably noble. The part of the novel that drags concentrates on his time in the trenches, but the way he makes things drag is also the way he preserves both his life and his virtue.The most surprising part of the novel is a long section wherein the stodgy, predictable Mark, having suffered a stroke, thinks through the pity of his ancestral estate and his younger brother tumbling farther and farther away from one another. Mark and Silvia, Christopher's wife, are stunningly unsentimental, which makes them stunningly shrewd and interesting. The difference between them, until the end of the novel, is that Mark is fatalistic and Silvia isn't.Like all great novels of a certain scope, this one has its flaws, but it also has an élan, a whispering quality, and immense insight into the rotting social structures of English life. The fun of it, if you like studies in English quirks and customs and hypocrisies, is that it goes on and on and as it does, it advises, through both good and bad examples, how to evaluate life, how to behave, how to appreciate...how to condemn... how to laugh.So you didn't know Parade's End by Ford Madox Ford existed?

It's worth reading and brooding over, tackling quesThe Soul of the World is a short but massive book, rich with erudition and provocative references. It's worth reading and brooding over, tackling questions that are regarded as somewhat embarrassing because unanswerable in modern secular discourse.Scruton suggests there are two worlds: 1) the world science gives us, our dominant modern paradigm, constructed by thinkers like Newton and Darwin who focused as do we all on causes and 2) the world we construct in contact with each other--I to I--in the shadows of the transcendent, focused on the reasons we offer for our commitments, our sacrifices, our love and even our disenchantment (Sartre's Being and Nothingness plays an important role in Scruton's analysis.)From Descartes or Kant forward (take your pick), we have come to regard that which we know as known within our brains, or minds. All of our sensations and impressions take shape there, always, every instant, and there is no way around this even though we easily agree that what I see you see and what I taste you taste and these things are roughly the same. Kant endows us with certain innate prerogatives emerging from our way of experiencing existence in time and space but extending beyond time and space to realities confected by our reason and grasped by our understanding. We encounter geometry this way. We also learn to pose the question of whether we are free or obscurely determined. As to that which is really real, the thing in itself, or God, we cannot know a thing, not through reason and/or understanding.From Darwin forward Kant's analytic thinking took a turn, based on the concept of evolution wherein we see two reciprocal drives, almost two sides of the same coin: survival and reproduction. We live to survive and we survive to reproduce--all life forms do--and this is, viewed over time, an immensely complex proposition. Ingrained in this proposition and reinforced by the sciences of Newton and others, we begin to see biology, or life, as material. Going fast forward, we enter today's world of neuroscience where we look for the specific neural elements of humans being humans--self-conscious, rational/irrational, story-telling, etc. The idea, if not today's research, is an old one. Where is the ghost in the machine, the strange force of mind that haunts that body?Scruton proposes that the world we make through our face-to-face interactions, the world of subjects encountering subjects not objects, replicates or echoes or induces us to contemplate and access not only each other but whatever is sacred and perhaps divine. He sees the search for causes a means of advancing our external possibilities but the search for encounters as advancing our internal needs. He calls this the lebenswelt, German for 'the world that is lived,' and he suggests it is the doorway to that which is beyond cause--God would have no cause, how could he?Like Schopenhauer, Scruton sees art as a facsimile of eternal meaning, only possible by virtue of a human being's perception of the beyond and skill in operating there in the no-space of the imagination. He writes well and provocatively about architecture and music in particular in this regard.For Scruton, the big move is the uncaused move: falling in love, falling under the spell of two eyes that are so magical that they feel like they are your own eyes, in which you can stare forever. He proposes that life is a gift, if it is properly construed, and death, when it comes, is a gift, too, moving us into bodiless encounter with what was before us and what comes after us.Again, Scruton's erudition is breathtaking. He supports his argument with apposite references to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and of course the full range of philosophical thinkers from Plato forward. Along the way, he demonstrates knowledge of the most interesting contemporary books I've never heard of and would like to read, studies in cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, ritual, music, and much more.I am sure I have done Scruton little justice with this note, and I suspect he goes through life never being done justice. He's written some 50 books, considers that some of his more polemical and speculative works have ruined his academic career, held high posts in many universities and think tanks, and planted his flag on the soil of Burkean conservatism, which at least endows him with one wonderful conviction: we must preserve the earth, seas and sky, they are only ours in trust. So he is a polymath popularizer but at the same time a multidimensional original thinker and an excellent and ingenious writer, and I gather that he has a lot of enemies who don't want to hear about faith, conservatism, and the unlikelihood that science ever will catch the ghost in the machine by the toe....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2016","Nov 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18730696-the-soul-of-the-world

Ballard's Empire of the Sun is a striking novel on two levels.The first level is the way in which Ballard's tale fits into the larger scheme of novels that focus on the normalization of war's brutality, especially, but not only, when children are the focus. By normalization I mean the way in which war transforms ethics, perceptions, expectations, and the general social order, making the unacceptable not acceptable but perversely routine and unremarkable.Ballard's young protagonist, Jim, is witness to Shanghai's suffering in World War II, first as the Japanese rampage through, and then as the Allied forces, often at odds with one another, reclaim the city in preparation for the continuation of war. Separated from his parent's, Jim has no concept of the purposes or strategies of war, but war's quotidian horror and brutality become, as it were, a part of him, whether he is a fugitive in the ransacked city, an internee, or a pawn in the palms of bandits following Japan's defeat. The Empire of the Sun isn't about big, glorious things or the gritty spectacles staged by combat units. It's about scabs, pus, the meaninglessness of corpses when there are enough of them about, the little abuses of crafty elders, the generosities of stoic elders, and the upside down vertigo of not really knowing which side to cheer for, just liking the silvery glint of a plane's wings as it soars through the clouds or spirals into the earth.This novel is said to be autobiographical. In a way, it has to be (more on that later) because it is so specific, so loyal to the ways in which war makes it necessary to believe in the unbelievable. Jim can't abstract himself from his dilemmas. He can't not see the indignities of abuse. He is a member of a class of fictional characters that show up in other novels like The Tin Drum, The Red Badge of Courage, The Painted Bird, War Trash, and so on. Inhumanity is their theme. Sometime in the future we will be reading similar novels written by Iraqis and Syrians and Yazidis. The cardinal virtue of these novels, and fiction in general, is that they impose the necessity of inhumanity upon us. We might be able to argue or pray against it, wriggling our way through by means of reason or divine intervention, but we cannot reject it when it takes hold of a character in a novel and makes us live misery sentence by sentence. A well-written novel, and The Empire of the Sun is a well-written, powerful novel, can never become yesterday's paper, a bad story that went away. Its aesthetics make it permanent. For proof, consider the Iliad. It is the goriest of all war stories and will never go away.The second level on which The Empire of the Sun intrigues me is how the sacking and abandonment of Shanghai clearly became a permanent image in Ballard's writing. Ballard excelled in creating vacant, empty places in the stars, on some faraway earth, in some distant time, in some terrible vacuum of the spirit. These places, unlike Shanghai, are not ""real,"" but in their resemblance to the Shanghai of The Empire of the Sun, they are definitely real, not just aesthetically but psychically. Whatever Ballard experienced as a boy in Shanghai and then later as a novelist writing about Shanghai stayed with him; he found many ways in which to describe confusion and pointlessness even more powerfully--and with more negative beauty--in his short stories in particular....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Nov 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56674.Empire_of_the_Sun

Basically, the only time capital does not outperform earned income is when a war or depression forces national governments to raise tax rates on capital stock, or very high levels of income. That levels the playing field, but when the war is over and taxes come down on the rich, yep, again: the rich get richer.I found Piketty's book frank, sober, fair and modest but sadly unrealistic. He targets income inequality, a major problem in the US and Europe, and demonstrates how dangerous it is to the overall health--social as well as economic--of nations. One marvelous datum: the average income of the parents of Harvard undergraduates is $450,000. Wow! This means that despite Harvard's 30+ billion dollar endowment and generous student aid programs, Harvard is as elite as elite can be...and so are all of the other top universities...private clubs targeted on pushing the affluent higher on the affluence ladder. Harvard's endowment spins off 10+% returns because it can afford the best investment advisors money can buy. Schools with smaller endowments achieve lower rates of return. In a nutshell, we see Harvard as a microcosm of the US national economy: a tiny fraction of the population is so wealthy that its wealth accumulation is accelerating, at the expense of others. Piketty traces this phenomenon through many sectors of the global economy. Think of Norway's sovereign wealth fund, or Saudi Arabia's, or Bill Gates's fortune. By virtue of very, very low taxation on capital, and even on high earned incomes...the rich get richer.Piketty's principal solution is a proposed global tax on capital. This is where he becomes unrealistic, at least in the near term. Post-Ronald Reagan, the anti-tax forces in the US, for example, are fierce beyond belief. Hillary Clinton's modest proposals for raising taxes on high earned income individuals and lowering them on the middle and lower classes don't venture into the area of actually taxing accumulated fortunes, and yet, they, too, are unrealistic as long as the Tea-Party, right wing conservative Republicans control the House of Representatives.In fairness, Piketty offers his suggestion as a kind of thought experiment. He demonstrates how wise it would be, and fair, and economically sensible, for wealth to be siphoned off a bit and redistributed to the less wealthy, but he admits repeatedly that engineering such an idea on a global, regional, or even national scale would be very hard to pull off.In the US, studies consistently show that when taxes on high incomes are higher than Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush permitted, overall economic performance improves. Simply put, the ""tax-and-spend"" Democrats generally are better for the national economy than No-More-Taxes Republicans.Piketty excels in crafting his arguments by focusing on data. Almost every paragraph, even every sentence, rides on the back of solid research. This is not an ideological book even if it sounds to some like a return of the Bolsheviks. It is a sober study of the facts.High concentrations of wealth in a few hands have led, throughout history, to political instability and social injustice. The wealthy, even many wealthy economists who should know better, don't see it that way. Their view is that wealth is accumulated by merit. Well, Piketty allows for this in many cases, but overall, wealth has built-in advantages that have nothing to do with merit.Consider his research, how he presents it, and decide for yourself, or simply remember what you've always known: the rich get richer....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Nov 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century

Schopenhauer's masterwork goes this way:1) Kant had almost everything right when he said that we live in a reality of mental representations (phenomena) and are incapable of connecting directly with the underlying things-in-themselves (noumena).2)HOWEVER, Schopenhauer knows what the basic thing-in-itself is: It's Will. Will in the rocks, the seas, everything material and everything organic, you and me, too.3) It remains somewhat unclear to me exactly how Schopenhauer can know this if he agrees that mortals cannot transcend the phenomenal, but he makes a comprehensive case for the one-ness, the unity, of all that exists, attributing a grand fatality to it that sweeps us along. In fact, he would say we don't exist to be swept along, we only think we do, because we are inseparable from the Will, and can only rarely, under special circumstances, deduce its own existence through such things as art and the suppression of our own feeble will. Be ye Shakespeare or be ye an ascetic, ye shall know that what we see is us, and what sees us is us, and what is going on is that the Will is working its wonders through and around us. More explicitly, Schopenhauer cites the Chandogya Upanishad: Thou Art That (Tat Tvam Asi)4) So dial back to the '60s and remember Ram Dass and everyone like him and then consider the fact that these colorful folk were completely anticipated by Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher who was not really very colorful and never danced with flowers in his hair.5) The first two ""books"" of The World as Will and Idea are laborious. We get the amendments to Kant and we get a trip back to Plato's Ideas. The third and fourth ""books"" are spectacular. If you are an artist of any kind or a connoisseur of any kind, you will find that Schopenhauer makes a wonderful case for why you are enamored of writing, painting, and most of all, music. We are talking about negative capability here--the gift of genius that enables an individual to be more than a single consciousness but rather a wide range of roaring consciousnesses, in effect, the full tumult of creation (Goethe, Beethoven, name your greatest hero.)6) Now, such apex moments and figures don't last and aren't commonplace, as we know. So here we get Schopenhauer the pessimist telling us that we are mere incidental twitches in Will's fury. His advice, then, really, is to abandon all hope and accept the truth of illusion...the illusion of gain, of desire, of immortality, of personal autonomy. A certain kind of Christian or Buddhist or hippie would know that the world is suffering, not fight it, and seek to aline herself with ... nothing (which is Schopenhauer's last word.)7) I would raise a question or two or three. My first question would be whether Schopenhauer's Will couldn't just as well be called Being. My problem with Will is that it implies volition, as in pursuing an end. My second question would be whether the reality of human experience--having and raising children, doing useful work for oneself and others--is necessarily as grim and pointless as Schopenhauer submits. And my third question is whether it isn't rather ironic that to be an accomplished artist or devoted ascetic requires immense will. The blank page and empty stomach in the morning are not comforting company; it takes as much ferocity of intent to write as it does to go without eating.8. There is one other book, and perhaps only one other book, that struck me as even more bleak and depressing than The World as Will and Idea. That is Consilience by Edward O. Wilson, a materialistic interpretation of the unity of knowledge. But Schopenhauer's work is the greater intellectual triumph. Wilson rides the back of science. Schopenhauer rides the wings of pure thought. What's more: unlike his European predecessors, Schopenhauer easily and readily and correctly connected East and West. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Oct 30, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/537365.The_World_as_Will_and_Idea

Gass excels not only in writing sentences, which he playsWilliam Gass's essay collection, Life Sentences, is, for the literary minded, worth reading. Gass excels not only in writing sentences, which he plays with in his title and I in mine (above) but in the scope of his literary and philosophical knowledge.There are acute observations here about Kafka, Ford Maddox Ford, Wallace Stevens, Plato, Aristotle, Knut Hamsun (highly critical), Katherine Anne Porter, Henry James (one of Gass's heroes), Malcolm Lowry and others. There is a wonderful exposition of the evolution of the ancient Greeks' philosophical thought, self-observation, and self-consciousness. There is a strong, imaginative essay on Nietzsche, and there are two fascinating essays on ""narrative sentences"" and the aesthetic structure of the sentence. For a working writer, like myself, this volume is a treasure trove of canny observations and judgments.Gass takes a position here that he's taken before but perhaps not so explicitly. He contends that fiction is not about story-telling but rather about providing compelling experience (literal experience, for one is in fact experiencing something when one reads) and significance.Gass says stories can be related anywhere--in conversation, on TV, in magazines, in gossip and dinner talk--and that's not what readers, ideal readers, read for.What readers, ideal readers, read for is the mental/imaginative experience of actually entering into a moment or series of moments that flickers with beauty, interest, ugliness, peculiarity...that spends time on airing out the dimensions of reality that exceed the average person's talents for self-expression... so rhythmically, perversely, ironically ... as might be found in the work of a master prose stylist like Conrad or Joyce.Sentences, Gass contends, should breathe, look over their shoulders, wink, knock hard on the mind's door...effectively take over the reader's, or ideal reader's, mind. And ultimately, he proposes, fiction, great fiction, should resolve itself not in a surprising or gratifying plot but rather in a grander kind of significance which is the sum total of the experiences presented.Gass supports his contention with many, many good examples but there are times when he seems to overemphasize fabulous word-play writers like Joyce or James and underemphasize the effects achieved by writers like Kafka or Chekhov.He tips his hat to Kafka for writing in a straightforward way, doesn't criticize him in the least, but there's more to praise about Kafka than Gass manages even in a full-length essay. Lately, I've been rereading Kafka's short stories in German. and my observation is this: yes, exactly, Kafka is beautifully concise and straightforward but at the same time his deliberately flat rendition of the incredible creates as big or bigger echoes in the mind as parades of Jamesian splendor. Beyond that, there is the translation issue. The ""sense"" of Kafka comes right at you in German or English. But the sound of German and the odd way it winds the springs of a sentence because of German's peculiar syntax is something else again. In effect, I'm not taking issue with Gass (a masterful translator of Rilke), just pointing out that the more exquisite writers (Nabokov, for example), who completely submerge you in their verbal worlds--or dispossess you of your own--sometimes are not the most thunderously effective...thunderous in a quiet way, thunderous in the way of a sound, even a little sound, piercing you when you think you are alone in a church and are not.Kafka, Chekhov, Hemingway, Raymond Carver and others achieve a mental something that isn't mechanical plotting but is anti-aesthetic, if you will...and yet they all confirm Gass's larger point: we who read to experience, to live, do find fiction more compelling when it is powerfully rendered than when it is powerfully plotted.The opposite of this coin is shown when Gass quotes a ghastly series of sentences by the crime writer Chester Himes. I can't imagine an editor letting these wretched word burps spatter a page. But I think Himes and others sell pretty well because many, many people are in fact after the story, the plot, the whodunit, the what happened, etc. They are not aesthetically engaged in the writing, they are just taking their daily dose of storytelling in book form as opposed to movie or TV form. Storytelling is long-lived, and it's an ineradicable aspect of being human. But it doesn't have to, and often doesn't, come close to literary fiction in terms of the importance of the experience of perfectly chosen words that are utterly present and satisfying in and of themselves, making you see the hairs in an ugly nose, hear the bark of a defeated politician, pull away from the hapless panhandler who reminds you too much of your personal fear of destitution, or memories thereof.Anyway...by now you will want to read Life Sentences by William Gass or you won't...you will feel you need to or you won't...you will have recognized through him, and my reporting of him, that you are someone whose life is a sentence, works itself out in sentence, and will never stop seeking out sentences that are revelations of what you always thought but never were able to put into words. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 12, 2016","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11778315-life-sentences

This survey is organized thematically, so the chapters have headings like Soul, Mind, Time, Science, God, Death, etc. That is one part of the book’s humor. With almost comical erudition, Scruton just keeps coming with insights on every painfully complex issue confronted by philosophers from Descartes to Rorty. It’s astounding that at some point he doesn’t gag and croak on his own brilliance.Through 500 pages of exposition he simply never yields! Is God possible or impossible? Is time real or an illusion? How did Kant deal with Hume’s Law? (How did Hume deal with Hume’s Law?) Why is it impossible to superimpose a left hand on a right hand even in four-dimensional space? (What is four-dimensional space?) Why is it unreasonable to fear death and doubt immortality?The indefatigable Scruton sifts through thousands of arguments on the finer points of freedom, free will, and “the” will…the finite and the infinite…process and becoming…. There’s an inherent intellectual suspense in this tome, deriving from its chapter by chapter virtuosity. What is process? What is becoming? What is a number? Why isn’t zero a number? What is now since now is not the same now as it was when I began typing this sentence and you began reading it?Scruton’s more easily appreciated humor—and more intentional—emerges when he writes about the likes of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Sartre, etc. He freely despises these “Continental” rogues and impostors. Heidegger gets battered the worst as a kind of mad German mystic. The problem with the others, running from existentialism through deconstructionism, is that their devious, busy little minds worked very, very hard to undermine humanity’s faith in all previous thought, institutions, and the possibility of just, collective human cooperation and mutual understanding. “Nothingness, [Sartre] tells us, lies coiled in the heart of Being, like a worm.” Dear me! And interpretation, says Nietzsche, godfather to the deconstructionists, is a function of power, not truth. The text therefore, any text, says Derrida, is a tissue of the reader’s imagination, not the author’s.Let’s call this book laborious but not labored fun, a steep hike through the hills of what you think but don’t know why you think it.Scruton is the author, despite Derrida’s views, of fifty books.

It remains a classic story of jovial, necessary scapegoating in which once a year someone from a small town must lose the lottery and die a communal death.The other stories in this collection are mixed. A few, “Flower Garden,” “The Tooth,” and “Men with Their Big Shoes,” fall short of classic but are subtle in their plain style ghoulishness, the humdrum turned into the macabre. Others are a little dated with flat characters in marginal control of their marginal lives getting the worst of the ongoing joke of life.In Jackson’s world there is a place for people who are just outright mean. “Seven Types of Ambiguity” is a good example of this—a couple who have come into money buy Empson’s book right out from under a college student who can’t afford it, but dearly covets it, just yet. Flannery O’Connor wrote a lot about mean people, too. So does William Gass. Jackson’s meanies emerge out of sudden, nasty actions, O’Connor spun them up with religious fervor or diabolical malice, Gass develops awful people by wreathing ugliness in his beautiful sentences.I’ve always had a place in my heart for unlikeable characters and never really understood why other readers complain, “But they’re all so awful!” Where does one find a more delightful cast of miscreants than in The Inferno? Or in The Canterbury Tales? I also enjoy characters with bothersome names, though I can’t say Jackson shares this preference. She uses names like Elizabeth and Clara, David and Kathy—just name names to get the naming business out of the way, perhaps, or perhaps, more likely, to brand characters as Everyman, indistinguishable from you and me.There’s a new biography of Shirley Jackson just out, but I wasn’t aware of it when I bought this collection. The point of the biography seems to be that Jackson had a miserable life as a faculty wife and wrote in the spirit of revenge. A secondary point may be that as a female short story writer, Jackson has been overlooked or undervalued. I’m not sure about that. “The Lottery” itself is unforgettable, and anyone interested in short stories and literary fiction in general surely has read it. Her other stories remain in print as well, and they have a kind of early suburban gothic allure. She saw directly into the vacuity and nakedness of the grassy kingdoms popping up beyond the city limits in the 50s and 60s. There was, and she captures it, a terrible sense that the world had rushed to an end point, i.e., a suburban housing development, and this was how, frightfully, all of history had turned out.So this is a book of well-made, vivid, judiciously phrased stories that captures the leer in things, that grin you’re greeted when you achieve your dreams and discover they’re nightmares....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89723.The_Lottery_and_Other_Stories

He’s a cantankerous, righteous sort whom Eliot apparently wanted to impose not only on her story but English society, suggesting that ethical reform of a quasi-religious nature would serve England better than political reform, which is less trustworthy and too abrupt.The pity is that Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) populated Felix Holt with many more interesting characters, from the conflicted heroine, Esther Lyon, to the intriguing Mrs. Transome, a fallen woman who lives most of her life, hypocritically, as the mistress of a substantial estate that does not, by virtue of antique and complex laws of inheritance, really belong to her.One way or another it’s possible to put up with Felix and his stiff-necked principled way of causing himself trouble, notably by virtue of passages of astonishingly acute writing that successfully merges the moral with the psychological in these other characters.Eliot’s masterwork, Middlemarch, is almost Miltonian in its self-confident cadences and carefully balanced conflicts. If Felix Holt falls short of that standard, it would seem to be evidence that it’s a bad idea to undertake a lengthy, social novel with a fixed idea in mind. But Eliot fortunately was too good a writer to produce an Atlas Shrugged. In Esther Lyon she created a somewhat self-absorbed and shallow figure who is much more than a label and therefore capable of significant growth and change.Baggy old 19th century novels with their multitudes of subplots often take a long time gathering speed. That’s true in this case, and Eliot knew it. She therefore imposed an author’s preface that gives us a coach ride through the evolution of England in the 19th century as a hint as to what Felix Holt is all about. Less poetically, but in its way just as well written, this introduction reminds me of Gogol’s meditation on Russia that begins, “Oh troika, winged troika, tell me who invented you?” There’s little in common between the tone of this introduction and the novel’s text itself, but underlying both one finds Eliot’s extraordinary acuity and intelligence.One of the true oddities of a woman who had to assume a man’s name to be taken seriously as a writer is that she is still referred to, as I have here, as George Eliot.

Every sentence is an act of acute reasoning and every permutation of a thought or the general experience of being human is pursued with indefatigable intellectual zeal.Like many others, I'm sure, I long put off reading The Critique of Pure Reason straight through because I got caught up in the thicket of Kant's tortured writing on earlier attempts. The problem is not only the subtlety of analysis but also his precise use of words that he can only define at length and that sometimes ""work"" only in the context of his philosophy, often in a way diametrically opposed to conventional usage.So the trick is to plow ahead and subject yourself to Kant's mode of thought and style of expression and let them gradually clarify themselves as he repeatedly employs the same verbiage and techniques on problem after problem. In so doing, you are entering a realm of literary/intellectual mastery that suggests very few peers--Shakespeare, Goethe, and Aristotle perhaps.Kant's unique appreciation of the metaphysical incorporates extraordinary candor about its limitations while at the same time unfurling its importance and scope. He is wonderfully frank not only in trumping figures like Descartes and Leibniz but also in silencing himself. What can we know and what can we say about time, space, freedom, and God? How can we secure any knowledge at all about what he calls the unconditioned?This is one of those books that must be read, eventually, but that will be heavy going, painful, and often so dense as to be mind-numbing.

Most of these essays were puTony Judt’s last collection of essays, entitled, When the Facts Change, reminds us how much we lost when he died in 2010. Most of these essays were published in the New York Review of Books. As a regular reader of that publication for more than 40 years, I had read them all when they first appeared. Nonetheless Judt astonished me a second time with his erudition and intellectual versatility.Jennifer Homans, Judt’s widow, provides an insightful preface documenting how hard Judt worked on his contributions to the NYRB. He took extensive notes on everything he read, drafted an outline, and then inserted his notes and additional thoughts in an arduous process of research, planning and drafting. I don't know how such well-informed essays could be written any other way. These pieces flow well, but they are not stream-of-consciousness; they are a stream of conscience, if they are any kind of stream at all.There are a number of very sad observations in this collection, none sadder than those which document Judt’s deepening disenchantment with the politics and policies of Israel. As a Jew and an historian of Europe, he might have expected better than a state determined to “secure” itself at a cost betraying its human values and tragic experience. Over the years, Judt lost hope even in the prospects of a “two-state solution” as Israel gnawed away at the land Palestinians would need to create a state with their massive settlements and aggressive policies in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Six years after Judt’s death, things have only gotten worse, a fact somewhat obscured by the collapse and chaos that has beset the rest of the region.Judt was disheartened by George W. Bush’s negligent support of Israel’s intransigence and deeply disappointed by Barack Obama’s half-hearted efforts to force Israel to call a halt to the settlements and engage in some form of serious peace talks. He was eloquent in pointing out that the demographics of Palestine, absent a two-state solution, could (and can) only lead to an apartheid state, with Jews ruling the Palestinians who at some point will outnumber the Jews under their direct or indirect rule. Not a good prospect.One of the best essays in this collection focuses on why the U.S. has never succumbed to the allure of social democracy. The problem, in a nutshell, is twofold: Americans are not homogeneous enough to trust and support one another and Americans have permitted the economic paradigm to overshadow the political paradigm. We subordinate our political interests to the economy, not vice versa. I suspect Judt would have supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary campaign, because this is what Sanders pointed out.There a few odd pieces in this collection that reflect Judt’s affection for railroads, not merely aesthetically but politically. Along with sociologist Richard Sennett, Judt believed that sharing common spaces across class lines increases a sense of community. Sennett’s favorite example was the 18th century public house in England. Judt’s was trains, wherever they might run.In this collection we see Judt predict growing economic inequality in the U.S., more terrorism (not a new phenomenon), and a difficult period of slow growth. He was right. The Trump phenomenon, a backlash built on resentment and fantasy, would not have surprised him. European and world history is littered with the political carcasses of authoritarian narcissists; the problem is that doing away with Trump (as of August 15, 2016, he is pretty well dead in the water) will not do away with the problems he has tried to exploit to his own advantage. We could use Judt’s thoughts on this. How are we going to persuade ourselves that politics should define economics, and not the other way around? ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2016","Aug 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22529145-when-the-facts-change

The narrator, Michel, is not especially upset when his father dies or thrilled that he will inherit a nice sum of money. He’s a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Culture with no great interest in culture, most of which is exhibitionistic tripe. But he’s well enough off to go on a holiday in Thailand and the book becomes a kind of touristic story, focused on the touchy dynamics of group travel, leavened by easy opportunities for extra-group sex with the local ladies.Houellebecq is a social satirist with a sharp eyes but not very sharp claws. He’s not a mean, angry satirist, he’s an amused, jaded satirist. And he doesn’t push his novels with tight plotting, which would eliminate the space he needs for irrelevant forays into the randomness of modern life and opportunities to comment on it.So the reader is well into the book before Michel meets Valerie, who is a girl Friday to the unhappy but successful Jean-Yves…and they are in the tourism business…and the unimaginative Michel gives them a great idea when they are recruited into a larger firm, i.e., they should transform their destination resorts into lightly disguised sex resorts, skip the boring bus tours to look at ruins and the volleyball tournaments, just get on with creating a comfortable place where everyone can do it with everyone.Again, Houellebecq is not an over-the-top satirist. The casual way things happen leads to numerous sex scenes, but they’re harmless, not orgiastic and/or ridiculous (except for one S/M episode.) In fact, some of them have a graphic but tender quality to them, no harm, no foul, an addressing of human needs and exploration of human pleasures.Pleasure, of course, is Michel’s big idea and his fundamental critique of striving Europe/America/the West. The pleasure principle is gone. People go through life’s stages toward pointless ends, disliking their spouses, uninvolved with their children, wishing they’d pursued other careers, hating their daughter-in-law. No big thing. Just the standard BS of existence. No pleasure for pleasure’s sake as in, for instance, Thailand or Cuba.Eventually Islamic terrorists strike one of Jean-Ives’s resorts and that’s it for Valerie and for Jean-Ives’s career. Michel? Well, he finds a still more remote, primitive resort in Thailand where he retreats far, far away from everything and writes this story, ending with a meditation on how insignificant and unmemorable his death will be.Michel’s final rumination, and the nihilism of his story, made me think flickeringly of him as a contemporary Underground Man, not angry, not violent, not bitter, but rather well-sated in his alienation. But I didn’t think long. This is a book that strives for a certain cultural/analytic grandeur, a kind of idea book, that is passively aggressive. I do wonder if Houellebecq’s effects have more bite in the original French, which I wish I could read. It’s possible that he is drier, more acerbic, funnier, more stylish and witty in his native language than in this humdrum translation. But then again, he might be a little lazy, only inspired on odd days, not even days, and quite okay with gently dismissing that he which he has no illusions he can change....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2016","Aug 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88514.Platform

Sebald and superbly translated from the German by Anthea Bell, rises and falls in chops and surges like the waters of a large harbor and goes nowhere without losing the potential to go somewhere.Fundamentally this is a novel about a Czech boy sent to Wales to escape the Germans in WWII who manages, in middle age, to discover where he came from, who his parents were, and what his life must have been like up to age 4 when he was shipped off. Jacques Austerlitz is a Jew, and those Czech parents lost their lives to the Nazis, apparently, his mother in the ghetto/concentration camp of Theresienstadt and his father perhaps in flight from Paris across the Pyrenees.In a manner quite similar to the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard, Austerlitz recounts his search for the past to an unnamed narrator in a highly detailed, emotionally inflectionless style. Paragraphs are hard to come by, and sentences can go on for pages. The connections between Austerlitz's obsessions--with fortresses, libraries, cemeteries, hospitals, moths and the past--are implicitly rendered by repetitions more than explicitly by explanations. The book goes on and on until around the midpoint it becomes clear that this is a Holocaust story, but an elusive one that cannot be definitively recovered and therefore, potentially, can never be lost. There are digressions and an almost DeLillo-like suggestion that the conspiracy of the labyrinth is a thing of time as well as space.In addition to Bernhard, it would seem Sebald was influenced by Borges, Proust, and Kafka. The translation is so lovely that it reminds me somewhat of William Gass's Letter C, another novel that is more a sequence of sentences than a novel.There is no resolution. Eventually finding a picture of his mother does not turn out to be an apex moment for the book or Austerlitz. There's still his father to wonder about and a long reflection on what the Nazis did with all the loot they plundered from Parisian Jews and how, perhaps, they stored it in the same inhuman way the French built their new, sterile, inhuman national library.Overall, then, this is more a Proustian book with a set of political, rather than social or personal, fixations.

They are Maureen, who is in despair over taking care of a completely incapacitated son, Martin, who has lost his TV career because he had sex with a minor, JJ, who just lost his band and his girlfriend, and Jess, whose older sister has disappeared and has lost her boyfriend.These strangers more or less rescue one another, become a news item, continue to meet and even vacation together, and ultimately find, at the 90 day mark post-intention to commit suicide, some path ahead.The premise of the novel obviously is a bit shaky. The only character who really seems to have cause to want to take her life is Maureen, but she doesn’t really want to, either. All of them clumsily are seeking a way out.To the extent that A Long Way Down is interesting, the interest derives from the narrative style—sequential first person narratives, carrying forward the collective themes while introducing personal considerations and details. Jess, who is about 17, I would guess, is the most energetic, annoying, and compelling of the lot. She’s at war with everyone, starting with her parents, and has unique talents for finding new ways to rebel, mostly verbal onslaughts at the worst possible time.Hornby’s basic objective seems to be to coat everyone with the floating scum of popular culture and superficial interpersonal relations and then slowly scrape them clean.

But it made its way into print and Greene died rich and it’s a splendid, compact, penetrating tale…and we have it—or it can be found in used bookstores—so all is well.The idea is that 10 Frenchmen are held captive by Germans and 3 of them will be executed in reprisal for Resistance activity near at hand. Lots are drawn. The richest man draws one of the marked lots. He offers his fortune for a substitute. Another man accepts the deal so that his mother and sister will have wealth after he’s gone—he doesn’t expect to live under any circumstances.The surviving rich man then revisits his lost estate after the war and is taken on by the mother and daughter as a manservant. He conceals his identity from them in part because they hate the man who engineered their son/brother’s death.The sequence and unfolding of ironies, the masterful little characterizations, the impulses and shifting identities in this novel (or novella) are superb. The writing is dry, sometimes grounded in generalizations about human nature, and pungent. Greene’s typical overtone of desperation is absent. Despite all the death and hatred, these folks want to live—perhaps because they are French, who knows? In fact, one might be reading a translation of a Maupassant story, or something by Balzac—a vignette—or even Flaubert or Stendhal. In other words, this is a tale, a kind of fable, but achingly realistic and lacking in heroism. Wits are matched. Things like the relationship between mourning and lust are explored—the passageway between loss and desire.By not trying too hard to be the lapidary Graham Greene, Greene wrote in a relaxed, unadorned way and then…forgot he had done it.The fact is that this happens in a writer’s life. How to account for it? The way it works is as follows: You enter the mode of thought that is “writing” and you follow it as though you were following a stream and then you see an embankment and you climb it and there’s a path and you follow it and you get another idea and another and you forget the stream. Trying to make money, as Greene then was doing, can mean the path has to do with movie money, and the thing about movie money is that it’s more plentiful than publishing money and you come up with ideas fairly easily, one after another…what if this?…what if that?…and you relocate and lose track of the stream, now in a suitcase, and years pass and you come upon the stream again, now owned by someone else, and because the mode of thought called “writing” is a kind of loss of personal identity, you don’t even remember when you were wet with something many years back.Odd, odd, odd, but true....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jul 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3707.The_Tenth_Man

Nechayev in many ways was a precursor to today's Islamic terrorists, notably by virtue of his association with the phrase, ""the propaganda of the deed."" This, of course, is the essence of terrorism--generating an outsized psychological effect with a beheading, a car bomb, or a series of murders.

(SPQR is an acronym for the Latin, Senatus Populusque Romanus--the Senate and People of Rome).I would almost say that someone with little knowledge of Rome's past could read SPQR with pleasure, but fortunately, I am fairly sure that no one with little knowledge of Rome's past would want to. This is a book for the informed reader, a person who was compelled to take Latin or ancient history in high school, or a person who fell in love with the various novels and movies about Rome that have had a broad impact--I, Claudius, for example, or Spartacus, or the novels of Robert Harris focused on Cicero, a figure immensely important to Mary Beard, too.Beard's thesis is that for all we know about Rome and Latin literature, there are great gaps and many nasty bits of propagandistic misinformation. We cannot really be sure about Caesar's populistic versus dictatorial inclinations even if we can identify both in his track record. We cannot quite trust the black legends the victor Augustus promulgated about the defeated Antony and Cleopatra. And we cannot really know the exponential magic that enabled Rome to expand, century by century, into the empire at its apex.If Cicero, prolific and persuasive and a true man of the Republic, is Beard's prototypical pre-Imperial voice of reason (and self-interest), then it is Augustus who established what Beard refers to as a template for the extended rule of emperors--Caesars--from the first century BC to the third century CE.Beard makes the case that the empire created the emperors, that Rome outgrew the Senate's ability to govern it, and that concentration in a central executive figure was inevitable and logical. She also makes the case that Rome's expansion and multi-century stability was contingent on its relative openness, permitting ""new men"" to enter the Senate and foreign men (always men in both cases) to become Romans, and, eventually, emperors themselves.Beginning with Augustus, and perhaps never better managed afterward, the emperor and senate recognized that they needed one another, granted one another legitimacy, deference, and operational control over a complex mechanism that was multi-cultural in the extreme. Of course the emperor was the First Citizen, primus inter pares,but the senate, even in its weakened state, served a purpose.The excellence of this study lies in Beard's easy command of facts--political, military, economic, cultural. She offers a sense of what life was like for the elites and for the impoverished. She contextualizes the judgments we've heard before from Cicero,Vergil, Pliny, Tacitus and Plutarch. Her final comment that perhaps we don't have much to learn from Rome is softened by the nuanced judgment that we have a great to gain by engaging with Rome. The distinction here, I take it, is that our times are not Roman times but some of the questions we have to answer for ourselves are indeed Roman questions: What is law? What is a right? What are bicultural identities? What is the value of peace enforced on populations across mountain ranges and seas? What is the proper attitude to take when confronted by a new and apparently hostile religion?This is a serious, authoritative study that is attractively lacking in pomposity.

Eden-Olympia, scene of the action, is a futuristic business park on the French Riviera, where the heads of major multinationals are susceptible to stress ailments (infections, swollen joints, inflammations) that can only be resolved, apparently,by indulging in weekend assaults on the immigrant Arab and African servant class in and around Cannes.Imagine a Hell's Angels with Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and what's his name from Amazon on the lead bikes.

The scenario is wickedly interesting, but it should not be prosecuted like a mystery story with lots of forced explanations in stilted dialogue. It should be a pastiche of surrealistic conflicts wherein the basest human drives are supercharged by capitalist decadence. Too much is explained here, turning the book from a novel into what Graham Greene called an entertainment. Ballard does not exploit his own sinister talents as a cryptic fabulist. The end result, much praised when the book was published, is tedious even though the underlying idea retains interest.At some point in the accumulation of wealth and virtual omnipotence, isn't there a moral danger that does in fact lead to the success of one becoming the abuse of others? And is this not plausibly understood as more than a mere byproduct of being a billionaire and an inevitable corruption of character? On what morning can a billionaire wake up in his penthouse or on her yacht and not be utterly detached from everyone else? Ballard's greatest irony is that the book culminates in a kind of revenge on revenge wherein thanatos meets thanatos, but, again, the book is too talky, an aesthetic disappointment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jun 25, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70277.Super_Cannes

Will there be a Brexit or not? Should there be a Brexit or not?Barnes is a Francophile, steeped in France’s history, its regions, its wines, its general sense of refuge from “Little England,” a snobby, small-minded nationalist version of Great Britain one would, indeed, do well to flee. These stories, as a consequence, bespeak an appreciation for French humor, landscape, and skepticism about the English.They are exceptionally well-written if, I have to say, somewhat bloodless. Despite adventurous narrative tactics and varying settings and characters, the unifying quality of this collection is not a fictional ebullience but an essayistic sobriety–dry wit and sometimes damp wit but always beautifully writ. (Pardon me for that one.)The best stories revolve around a woman’s fifty year obsession with visiting British cemeteries in France from WWI, an aging duffer’s splendid ruminations and observations during a trip to Paris by train through the Chunnel, a young British Tour rider’s acquaintance with how one peddles in France, and a pair of aging women’s efforts to revive a Medoc vineyard. Oh, and let’s add a whimsical piece about a non-conference literary conference, all a joke, pointless, devoid of any posing, competing, bed swapping, and nasty gossiping.Barnes, I should think, will be opposing Brexit next week, but he will do so fully conscious of its vanity and folly. Great Britain’s days of establishing a separate identity from the Continent have been well-spent and are over. What’s British will somehow remain British, but the interconnections between Britain and the Continent, specifically France, are inviolable. How do you do away with being great enemies and great allies? How do you dispose of the need, as Barnes beautifully puts it, to have another country near at hand where you can project your idealism, sentimentality and nostalgia? There’s something about somewhere else that is conveniently malleable to desire, not tied down by reality, more full of possibility than life at home.In the European scheme of things, France is king of the Continent even if England once was monarch of the world. There are many ways to debate this assertion, but it’s difficult to dispute the fact that French is the most beautiful language, Paris the most beautiful city, and French history and culture, combined, the most noble experiment in living well. Yes, there is a Little France, too–self-involved, rigid, dull–but the French know how to rebel against this, correct their sins and incorporate a multitude of aesthetic pleasures into the trivial incidents of daily life.Barnes pays homage to all this. Cross Channel is not a scintillating collection of stories, but it is as good an argument as any for the U.K. not bidding the Continent farewell....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2016","Jun 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/110948.Cross_Channel

Somewhat uniformly these writers employed the valet's view of their characters--to them no master is a hero. Moral compromise, deception, cynicism and a kind of randy egocentrism make the figure of the antihero more typical in such tales.Furst, a master of the genre, chose some gems for this collection. I have known the name Eric Ambler for a long time without knowing how well he wrote. I had no idea that Maugham's Ashenden was so uniquely compelling. One of the most raw and insightful selections in this book (all the pieces are excerpts, not stories in the classic fashion) is Maxim Gorky's The Spy. A revolutionary himself, Gorky manages to perfectly portray street-level rats working for the Czar's secret police, catching their humanity, vanity, and confusion in the face of the Bloody Sunday massacre of peaceful protestors in 1905. (How could the beloved Czar's minions slaughter his devoted subjects?)For as well as he wrote, and as prescient he was, I nonetheless always have thought Graham Greene was a bit sloppy in his broad-stroke characterization of the spook Pyle in The Quiet American. That said, the episode reprinted here does offer a panoramic view of Vietnam's complex politics in the 1950s.Possibly the worst piece in the collection is taken from The Tears of Autumn by Charles McCarry. Here, instead of depicting an intelligence agent as a headstrong idiot, we get a Hamletesque fellow who despairs of everything he does but nonetheless possesses immense ability to do things. He is a former poet, he allegedly can pick up Asian languages in a few weeks by listening to them, his latest lover is truly in love with him, he has the nerve to piss off the Kennedy White House, and he really, really knows Paris...and Rome...and Bangkok. McCarry writes within the subset genre, in other words, of the supremely gifted but sorrowful spook, a rather romantic and implausible antihero.The selection from Conrad's Under Western Eyes, a book I read a few years ago, struck me as odd this time around. Here Conrad is recounting the way a Russian student is compromised into alienation from the Czar. Razumov is really unhappy about this but sees no way out. In a sense, he is much more persuasively human than Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov because of his ambivalence. But in another sense, an almost sub-narrative sense (I'll explain this), he is less perfectly rendered to the point that, on occasion, Conrad's majestic prose, his phrasing, his tempo, falters and becomes a kind of imitation of Russian translated into English. What's going on with one of my favorite authors? Well, it turns out that he was writing against Dostoevsky, had great difficulty doing so, and seems to have spent some time during the drafting talking to himself in Polish about what he was trying to do in English. True story? Who knows, but I read it recently and it accords with the little bobbles in the text.Rebecca West's The Birds Fall Down is fascinating for its rather daring exercise in recounting all the twists and turns, misconceptions, dropped balls, red herrings, and goofs that plague an imperfectly coordinated cadre of Russians hoping to get control of a ship being built in Glasgow that they hope can be boobytrapped to sink the Czar on its maiden voyage. One stretch of pages is a nonstop monologue few editors today would sanction, possibly for good reason. It can't be followed...but that's okay because it ends up turning back on itself in a kind of O Henry twist. None of the logic that appears to add up, strains to add up, really adds up.My quibbles and critical observations notwithstanding, this is an entertaining and well-edited anthology.

This self-portrait renews his encounter with southeastern Pennsylvania, its fertility, simplicity, directness, friendliness, modesty and self-absorption.Shillington, Pa., his hometown, is a suburbanized nothing sort of place whose metropolis is Reading, an urban nothing sort of place, but in his childhood, it was intensely fascinating, almost luxurious, and left a deep impression on Updike long after he moved to New England.This book is the nonfiction cousin of the fiction found in Olinger Stories, Pigeon Feathers, The Poorhouse Fair, and The Centaur. That's Shillington. Reading is to be found in the Rabbit novels. Writing fiction or nonfiction, Updike had a descriptive gift, an antic, lyrical, puckish style, equal to anyone's. Another writer from the same terrain, John O'Hara, explored some of the latent melodrama in the big houses, bedrooms and bars of Pennsylvania, but he was not devoted to its details, its boxwoods, its spiders, its high school hallways, its front porches or linoleum floored kitchens. That was Updike's forte: the quotidian and undervalued specificity of person and place.Updike's approach in this 6 part memoir extends past, but is deeply rooted in, his hometown. He writes about childhood, his lifelong problems with his psoriasis and bad teeth, his stubborn faith in the good intentions of politicians, his love affair with Ipswich, Mass., and his religious faith. He was a believer because he thought it made sense to believe; God provided him with the fullness that even a lifetime of self-consciously written words could not give him.Curiously, he was the successor to John Cheever as a short story darling of the New Yorker, but he didn't like mingling with his literary counterparts, especially agents, publicists, ers, and high-living publishers. He made excellent money, was considered somewhat conventional in his politics and views, suffered praise to the effect that he wrote beautifully about nothing of consequence, and just did his best to stay out of New York and its cocktail parties, if not some of its feuds.F. Scott Fitzgerald once worried to Edmund Wilson that he might not be as intelligent as he'd like to be. He wasn't as intelligent as Wilson--who was?--but Fitzgerald had plenty of smarts and a gift for condensing his sense of life into fiction a great deal more moving and successful than Wilson's. Updike wore his erudition lightly, but it was there. He thought deeply about social change, theology, science, and the arts. That may be more visible in this book than in some of his novels, where his knowledge played a background role, deferring to the lives his characters actually lived.I've always known Updike was crazy about Henry Green, the British novelist. I didn't know that Proust was another great influence on him, or that he believed he'd learned many valuable literary lessons reading mystery and crime novels when he was in his teens. Proust's endless peeling of the onion does seem reflected in Updike's dazzling details. The shortcuts and plot twists Updike thinks he picked up from Erle Stanley Gardner are not so apparent, at least to me. You don't read Updike for what happens next; you read him for his sentences and feel for human experience in the latter half of the 20th century.The dreariest part of this book is the section devoted to a genealogical exploration of the clan Updike. It meant more to him than it could possibly mean to someone who isn't an Updike. The best part may be the final passage where he is brooding about the indignities of old age, the infirmity of his frail, elderly mother, and his many defects and deficiencies.He links these defects and deficiencies to Original Sin in a curiously beneficent way. I've never looked at an infant and thought he or she was a sinner from the first suckle, but I understand what Updike is getting at. Believing we are imperfect (obviously), we can accept our failures more easily; it is not such a tragedy when we discover we are not divine. If we leave our first wife and four children, well, that's very difficult and unfortunate, but we are apt to make mistakes and do not control the order of the universe. Even in our worst moments, there may be something of value, if not benefiting us, perhaps benefiting someone near to us.I don't buy this line of thought. It's exactly the kind of comforting reflection that turned off many of Updike's snootier, more ""worldly"" critics. But he is admirable in praising the average performance of average people, counting himself more or less among them, and standing up for them. Somehow Original Sin gave him the latitude to be mischievous as well as earnest, outlandish as well as insightful. In many ways, Updike was a writer's writer. All he did was write, write well, and make a good living from it, eschewing not only Cocktail New York but Distinguished Professor Academe. Nonetheless, this is not really a writer's autobiography.

So I was curious to see what Winch had had to say that was so disruptive to anthropology and other social sciences in the late 50s and throughout the 60s. As I will put it, Winch contends that the work of philosophy is to examine that which makes something intelligible within itself. By extension, he grants philosophy not only access to itself but to any other discipline. In the process, he takes notions of disciplines, fields, cultures, history, and all else as manifestations of their own nature. The nature of the physical sciences is contingent on cause and effect, consistency, and predictability but it is also contingent on the meaning of the terms cause and effect, consistency and predictability. Once those terms are agreed, anything that falls within them is ontologically scientific. Following Wittgenstein, Winch disputes the notion that social sciences are sciences as described just now. He posits that social phenomena are contingent on mutually reinforcing conceptualizations and practices that enable social beings to understand what they are doing and what will result. In other words, Winch distinguishes between scientific laws and social rules.This was a more earthshaking argument in the late 50s than today. For more than a hundred years, the humanities and evolving social sciences struggled to compete with science, achieving equal rigor and exactitude. But we know that is impossible because cultures establish their understandings of themselves in myriad ways that differ from the behavior of natural phenomena. That is to say a culture does not ripen and erupt the same way a volcano ripens and erupts. In fact, the words ripen and erupt suggest entirely different interpretations of that which is observed when applied to cultures and volcanoes.The social scientists wanted, and many still want, a statistical hermeneutic that would enable them to unlock the future of human experience. They would like to be able to understand and predict causes and effects with a certain degree of precision.Well, there is no reason not to continue seeking a key to all mythologies or a commonality of brain functions across 6 billion human beings, but Winch would say that that should be done in the context of rules that emerge out of contexts not laws that emerge out of physical phenomena. And he would go further, I suspect, to say there is no reason to be disappointed when the rules change in the social context versus the physical context.We can say that to be consistent is inconsistent with so-called human nature. And we can revel, perhaps, in the higher order of complexity human interaction bespeaks than the mysteries of atoms and volcanoes....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"May 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/258291.The_Idea_of_a_Social_Science

He had a way of boosting odd notions into the aesthetic stratosphere; appealing enigmas were his forte. What palm and why at the end of the mind and how did it get there?Stevens' unhurried, meditative, low-key poetic style is, it seems to me, the real pleasure and essence of his achievements. In a way, he wrote the same poem over and over again, but each time the poem has a distinctive way of asserting itself.Stevens' core idea was that the poet does more than endow reality with meaning; he makes reality; his focal plane is that verbal space between things and perception; and that is where words give us experience.As important as recurrent images, certain words are talismanic in Stevens' work. Combined, images and words elicit a kind of emotional frisson that goes beyond the rational into the obscurely gratifying.In fashioning his longer poems, Stevens often seems to know what he is doing without letting the reader in on the secret. He manages non sequiturs with the persistent grace of his tonality and tosses off impenetrable tropes with insouciant carelessness.The question does come up, again and again: What does Stevens mean, if anything, by palms at the end of the mind and blue guitars and ordinary evenings in New Haven and Comedians as the Letter C and Supreme Fictions and Ideas of Order at Key West? Each turn of phrase and image comes back to that single point: if there is order or a comedian or a palm anywhere, it is because the poet (or the devout reader) put it there. God having decamped, man must take over. Certain poets, perhaps many poets, deserve leeway when it comes to explaining themselves. The being of the poem is the meaning of the poem.

Long stretchesThe Maytrees, Annie Dillard's 2007 novel, is an almost flawless blend of extraordinary lyricism, story-telling, and character creation. Long stretches of prose read like poetry. Single sentences are jaw dropping. There's no point in quoting because there are so many passages that merit special attention--why not read the whole book?As it opens, The Maytrees reads like a modern day fairy tale about an enchanting woman falling in love with a unique man at the tip of Cape Cod. Lou and Maytree (as he is usually called) match up shyly but well. He is a carpenter-poet; she is a nature-loving painter. Dillard embeds them beautifully in the Cape's wild beauty, its serried waves, its handsome black nights, its grasses, scattered fish bones, bird bones, and perhaps a few human bones.When they marry, it's a relief but not a surprise. As they travel through time together, they complement each other's silences and habits and delights. Their chorus is a group of Provincetown locals at a time, Post-WWII before Provincetown was overrun by tourists and faddists. Good, peculiar, self-reliant, interesting folk.If Dillard did not write so well, this would become boring, but she is a prose stylist in the league of William Gass, John Updike, John Fowles, and a few others you might not think of: Jim Crace (Being Dead) and Richard Powers (The Echo Maker). Her approach is consistent in rhythm but eclectic in reference. She is a naturalist, but she also is a cultural observer and a wide ranging reader. In any given paragraph, she may dip into all three fonts of inspiration for images, comparisons, and revelations. Boredom comes up short when Maytree behaves badly to Lou. I'll generalize so as not to give away the plot too much: he has a midlife crisis in which he realizes he's not the free spirit he once was, not as unpredictable, not as psychologically muscular.Given the amazingly good marriage Maytree enjoys with Lou, this is hard to believe, but there's something of the dull thud of reality about it. Abruptly, the man just doesn't want to be tamed and doesn't care that he's so damned happy.Stupid, for sure. Lou isn't the kind of woman a man should mistreat or abandon; a man would have to be, in fact, about as naive and unsophisticated as Maytree, with a very narrow frame of feminine reference.So Dillard darkens the canvas, and yet she sustains the naturalist's setting, couching the littleness of human experience in the awesome of geology, the ocean, and the sky. So there is something reassuring about what transpires as well as inevitable--something no one can fight, although only Lou seems to realize that.The Matytrees is a short book that reads long because it is so densely written.

Initially the story traces Lahiri's experiences taking on Italian, a multi-year process that did not fully work until she moved to Rome with her family. But in the end, the book is a meditation on Lahiri's sense of divided self, Bengali through her parents, American through her upbringing, and the ways in which writing has established a kind of equipoise between those selves, ultimately achieving the stability of the triangle by virtue of her midlife acquisition of Italian.This is a beautifully translated and conceived autobiographical essay (really too short to be considered ""a book"") that offers valuable insights into two fairly obscure realities--1) learning another language; 2) what it means to be ""a writer.""As a writer who has learned four foreign languages--I learned Latin and Greek like Lahiri in school; then I learned Spanish and German as a diplomat--I can only say Lahiri accurately describes her two main subjects in perfect detail.The best time to learn a language is as a child. Anything is possible then. The last time it's easy is in high school if you spend a year abroad. After that, it is painful, frustrating, exhausting and embarrassing, and this is the experience Lahiri recounts. Most adults simply fail to master a foreign language. Lahiri explains why--the memory lapses, the grammatical confusion, the mysteries of syntax, uses of pronouns, shyness, sense of personal inadequacy. No classroom study ever will make an adult fluent (nor will it make a high school or university student fluent). It's crucial to live and breathe a language in the land where it's spoken...and simply succumb to it.Writing in a foreign language is the most difficult task of all. Lahiri poor mouths her Italian, but it's good. Her strategy is the right one and essentially the only one for someone at her stage of life: short, straightforward sentences (conveying fine thoughts). Goldstein follows suit in her excellent translation.Her linguistically constructed self (the writer's self) is, in Lahiri's terms, a kind of evasion. For her, language is a private experience, somewhat analogous to living life in one's reflection in the mirror--her but not her. Ultimately, she lost a good bit of her childhood Bengali and developed a sense of her perfect English as a kind of step-mother, not always the best kind of mother to have but sometimes the most useful.Italian seems to have completed her, becoming the language she chose rather than was chosen by. Reflecting on Beckett (who wrote in French and translated himself back into English) and Conrad (who absorbed priceless English at sea after a Polish upbringing) and Nabokov (who learned French before Russian and English but all during childhood), Lahiri says, correctly, she's different, but she feels more free and bold in Italian and does not know what she will do when she moves back to the US, return to writing in English or go on with Italian.My guess is that her English will take over and her Italian will remain cherished even as it loses its succulence. But there's a hint here of something else that's very writerly. She says she's tending toward more abstract and open-ended drafting, perhaps less realistic. This is something that would represent a substantial new approach to the major passion of her life and could work in either language. The spareness of her Italian (imposed by the limitations of her knowledge) might remain in force imaginatively, even stylistically, and generate work that is intrinsically Lahiri-like and yet quite different from anything she has produced before.She makes the point several times toward the end of In Other Words: all writing, autobiographical or fictional, is a kind of falsification and also a kind of reification. Even as writers try to explore what they feel, they invent what they feel, and language is only an analogue to feeling, an approximation, a guess.In this sense, I would say that writing is almost the same thing as learning a foreign language; it's struggling to find the right words and seldom being confident that one has done so....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 12, 2016","May 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25614298-in-other-words

One could almost say that it confirms the notion that the arts anticipate history better than social scientists.Here we encounter a novelist, Bill, who is a Salinger-like recluse and the focal point of two caretakers and a visiting photographer. One of his caretakers, Karen, has married but not consummated her relationship with a fellow named Kim, as arranged by the Reverend Moon. Scott, her rescuer and lover, is fanatically devoted to Bill's habits and needs with nothing less than a Moonie's passion. Brita, the photographer, is just into writers, taking pictures of them, with no assumption that her photos will gain an audience, in this case because she has promised Bill they won't be made public.Bill apparently has published two important novels and is polishing a third, over and over again. He has no apparent interest in publishing it, or in making himself a public figure, but through the maneuvers of an editor, finds himself involved in trying to gain the freedom of a French poet being held by a man named Rashid in Beirut.Got that?Okay, thematically, the point is that the images of modern life are as shallow as a Warhol and last as long as toilet paper in a public bathroom. So we can go anywhere--from a New York gallery to a farmhouse somewhere to London to Cyprus to Beirut or Teheran--and it's all the same media-goop wherever we are.This is DeLillo's familiar riff, sometimes lightened by the suggestion of a conspiracy but generally just heavy on meaninglessness.Now comes the good question: How does he achieve a fairly compelling effect with his stick figures and slick nihilism?The answer perhaps lies in the dedication of this novel--to Gordon Lish. Gordon Lish was a very influential editor in the 1980s and 1990s who knew how to really work the formula ""less is more."" His most brilliant (and upset) student was Raymond Carver, whom Lish made a successful minimalist against his will. Lish would unerringly (it seems to me) cut to the chase for Carver and give him edited versions of his work that were better than what he knew how to write. Carver appreciated and hated this. He begged Lish to let him be himself. But Lish wasn't having it. And eventually Carver died after forcing some stuff into print that was less well written than what Lish, the editor, would have permitted.Anyway, it would seem that somehow DeLillo also fell under Lish's influence because through expert reductionism Mao II and many other DeLillo books hang together by virtue of an exciting, highly targeted, but enigmatic tone that is pure Lish. The secret here is 1) obsession, 2) specificity, 3) indifference to the cavalcade of details, acutely observed, that create the Theater of Nothing that is a New York gallery, or a farmhouse, or London, or Beirut. Wherever you go in this novel, it's all wonderfully concrete and pointless.Now, back to whether this 25-year-old novel foresaw the future. Well, not really. Terror as we know it began somewhere in the 1970s. By 1991 we had seen a lot of it. Maybe not ISIS scale, but the blood ran in airports, the Olympics, cruise ships, and, of course, Beirut. Osama bin Laden did not invent terror. The Bader Meinhof gang had a hand in that, the PLO had a hand in that, Black September had a hand in that. Never heard of them? Okay, but they did, and that's what DeLillo was writing about and that's what we're still experiencing--furious, futile tragedies going nowhere but not leaving the scene, either.The issues one might take with Mao II, while acknowledging that it's a gripping and arresting novel, are twofold. First, given the seductive uniformity of its dry, photographic detail and controlled characterization, Mao II doesn't really need to have an integrated plot and literary folks like DeLillo and Lish probably would object that an integrated plot is the ultimate fiction. Second, the stylish portrayal of a novelist eagerly accepting death in Beirut is Warholesque but unrealistic. Even suicides, perhaps especially suicides, die in desperate awareness of their failure to keep on living. Death may be narrated as a cool, clean event, but it's not a mere incident; whether we are a crowd put to death or an individual sacrificing his own life, it's not nothing, in other words.In literary terms, the problem is that when you make your prose beautifully formulaic, you risk doing the same thing to your story. If your point is that the world is such that no one cares about what happens to anyone, okay, point taken.

Bertrand Russell was his best-known supporter, helping him establish himself at Cambridge, but Russell, like many others who were close to Wittgenstein, ultimately gave up on him. As Monk makes clear, Wittgenstein was uncompromising, harsh, and exhausting. He fled from and to Cambridge on numerous occasions, lectured by shouting sometimes and maintaining silence at other times, and ultimately adopted a philosophical style that was a quarrel with convention. If Socrates was a self-described gadfly, then Wittgenstein was an inveterate nuisance to himself and others. He could outargue anyone but apparently did not so much enjoy doing so as felt obliged to do so.In Monk's view, Wittgenstein's philosophizing was a restless, relentless attempt to discredit or overturn the scientific/technological culture overwhelming Europe and the United States. He mistrusted theories and generalizations. He bullied himself and others into finding ways to think logically and live ethically. He would have everyone live more slowly,not more rapidly, and disbelieve in Progress.The pity of this biography and Wittgenstein's life, it seems to me, is that despite the enormous amount of documentation Monk is able to weave into its telling, we still don't really have a good picture of the man in action. Like Coleridge, he was a voluble and brilliant talker, much more prolific in person than in print. After the Tractatus, he spent years and years fiddling with new work that he could not bring himself to finish. He did leave a substantial cache of manuscripts and typescripts that have found their way into print post-mortem, but like the Tractatus--and unlike Wittgenstein the man-these texts are gnomic provocations that insist on the importance of context in interpreting words and events while eschewing their own context. They are brief, brilliant, anti-systematic outbursts that lack the impact of Wittgenstein's facial expressions, his tones of voice, his abruptness, dismissiveness, philosophical personhood, if you will.People did not know what to do with him. He was acknowledged as a great philosopher, but he was not much interested in the work of the philosophers who preceded him. He would philosophize about psychology or mathematics without spending much time discussing psychology or mathematics. He was interested in how we should think about psychology and mathematics...and how psychology and mathematics should think about themselves.Famous as he was, he famously did things like becoming a factotum at a London hospital during WWII when he could quite easily have stayed at Cambridge as professor of philosophy. (And he also famously gave away the fortune he inherited from his father, transforming himself from one of the richest men in Europe to one of the poorest.)Monk spends a lot of time on Wittgenstein's romantic relationships, with one woman in particular and many men. Some of these relationships, but far from all, were unconsummated. Wittgenstein was so self-punishing and self-critical that one wonders if he was deeply at odds with his predominantly homosexual preferences, but in an interesting appendix, Monk essentially knocks this notion down, addressing sexual identity questions more directly than he does in the main text. Withholding some of these comments so long may not be the best way to present them.Ironically, most of us who might find Wittgenstein fascinating would have the opposite effect on him. This biography is a good way of getting around the perils of his immediate personality, but I still would love to have seen him in action....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"May 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12079.Ludwig_Wittgenstein

So it is. The novella opens with him leaving one ship because he's somehow lost his spirit and interest in things. Then he's given a chance to move from being a mate to assuming the captaincy of another ship. Suddenly he is motivated and eager to get under sail.Subplots and excellent characterizations abound, but the real burden of this work is exploring a passage in life that is crucial and unpleasant: learning to be humbled by surviving by the skin of your teeth, fumbling your way out of near-disaster to a future less glorious than you secretly fantasized was your due, having your elders turn out to be your betters while remaining willing to put up with you because you've bungled no worse than they did when they were half-snapped by fate.Objective studies of how unattractive it is to be in your twenties, full of yourself but legitimately talented, are difficult to write and difficult to read. Joyce overinflated his first attempt in Stephen Hero and then got it right in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Shakespeare succeeded with utter brilliance in Hamlet. Dostoevsky's Raskoinikov in Crime and Punishment gives us an example of talent putrified rather than purified. In contemporary life (as opposed to literary life), we can see Reagan's first OMB director David Stockman, utterly disgusted with himself, engaging in self-destruction. It took Eliot Spitzer, former governor of New York, a few extra decades to reveal the little boy lingering inside the prodigy but the mistake-maker ultimately emerged.Failure is critical to maturation.

He encounters a place tumultuous with cultural, ethnic and political clashes. There are the Islamists (the girls wear headscarves, the boys congregate in some kind of Turkish madrassa), the Kurds, the secularists, the military, the vestiges of Armenian and Russian influences, and a range of characters representing these groups and forces.As the novel proceeds, it becomes more Dostoevskian. Think of The Idiot--there are holy fools here--and think of Demons--there are revolutionaries in abundance. An overarching tension is Turkey's ambivalence about Europe, also true in Dostoevsky's Russia.Running deeper than the political and cultural scenario, we also encounter a double, or triple, or quadruple, love interest that ignites Ka's long dormant poetic imagination, although we hear about his Kars poem cycle (to be called Snow) without having a chance to read it.This is a funny, moving, sweet, and horrifying novel held together by a narrator (it turns out to be Pamuk himself), who reminds me of the chatty, insightful narrator intermittently present in The Brothers Karamazov. The narrator knows things it would be difficult to know, but ultimately he documents his discoveries fairly persuasively and succumbs at the same time to the same beautiful women as Ka.There's buffoonery, mockery, sincerity, and satire in Snow.

They take refuge in the train station's adjacent hotel and continue the ongoing drawing room comedy of their lives, flirting with and and gossiping about one another, fretting about who is most likely to win rich Max's affections, and looking in on a subplot in which a not-so-elderly aunt collapses after a single drink at the bar. For upstairs/downstairs relief, Green's thwarted traveling party occasionally looks out the window at the masses of frustrated commuters pouring onto the platform below and wonders if their personal attendants are managing to keep their luggage safe from the throng's grasping hands.Party Going is a short novel, whimsically and artfully written, that reads more like a short story. The main characters, not compelled by economic necessity to be other than they are, do not develop. They are like a group of seals tossing balls of plot from nose to nose, barking with pleasure and generally being impervious to what any outside observer might make of them.This is an antic book full of Green's peculiarly effective dramatizations of wooing and wounding. The scenes in which Amabel decides to have a bath while waiting for the fog to lift and everyone else remains clothed and perturbed about her naked in the tub beyond the door and in which she masterfully manipulates Max (who ultimately figures out how to crawl out of her clutches) are priceless.Putting his stylistic quirkiness to effective use, Green elides distinct interactions without any transition to highlight the sameness of this social class's features -- it's often unclear who is talking and who that who is, i.e., what's the difference between Evelyn and Miss Crevy, and which of them, if either, is married to Robert? This is a novel that has echoes of Chekhov in it while ploughing again the English furrows first gouged by Samuel Richardson and William Makepeace Thackeray. And for whimsy let's keep the most original English stylist in mind, Laurence Sterne.I have one question I need to answer out of personal curiosity.

To me it doesn't matter that ""international relations"" fall under the category of ""social science."" Science is science. Excluding human behavior from the field of ""true"" science is folly. Human nature is a subset of nature, or a feature of nature.Womack's mixture of analytic tools comprises logic and history. His logic is unassailable. Relations between states always imply asymmetry in economic, demographic, and scientific (productive) capacity. That being the case, history shows us that greater states are less attentive to lesser states but more demanding while lesser states are compliant with said demands to the extent that their autonomy and identity are acknowledged. In other words, a greater state's policy preference prevails as long as it does not damage the self-regard of the lesser state, in which case the lesser state is willing to fight harder over an issue than the greater state finds worthwhile. And this can impose unacceptable costs on the greater state, as in the Vietnam war.Simply put, Womack's core thesis is that war is abnormal. Now, saying that war is abnormal can be an exercise in counting the days when war transpires versus the days when peace transpires. But more importantly, it is saying that the prevailing paradigm of realism's insistence on ""power rules"" makes for marketable journalism but overlooks the facts of state behavior. History shows us that the location of adversaries, often neighbors, mandates a dance of identity, autonomy and deference. Peace is more perpetual than war. This works on the bilateral plane and in exponential ways on the regional and global planes.As a diplomat for three decades, I cannot think of an instance where Womack's description of state, regional, and global dynamics is inaccurate. He accounts for deviations from peace through two principal phenomena--the self-interest of powerful domestic constituencies and the failure of ""intelligence"" to assess an adversary's goals from the adversary's perspective. At times domestic constituencies are more powerful than neighboring states. And generally, great powers and lesser powers see things differently. That's what leads to war: narrow self-interest and bad intelligence.Full disclosure: I read and commented on portions of this book while Womack was writing it. He generously acknowledges this, but the truth is that I had no idea the final work would be so good.At times, this book reads like a grand master's chess manual. That's unfortunate because it likely will restrict its readership to the academic and expert communities. The next step has to be some kind of popularization and simplification that makes the idiocy of ""carpet bombing"" and ""beautiful walls"" (between the U.S. and Mexico) instantly emetic (vomit causing.) Any US diplomat anywhere knows that he/she is dealing with a lesser power that seeks greater recognition from the US. And any US diplomat knows how difficult it is to provide that recognition from the Executive or Legislative branches. But at the same time, if US diplomats are to help the US achieve its objectives, recognition and respect have to be made manifest, whether through state visits or exchange programs or specific acts of Congress.Womack accounts for this. He does not say that the US always will make the right choice, and he does not say that China is not the next global rival to the US. Of course it is. But as a China expert, Womack recognizes that Chinese per capita income will peak at about 50% of US per capita income (over the next fifty years) and Chinese science (productivity and innovation) will lag US science and productivity. Thus, the concept of a new Cold War, or a battle of two hegemons, is a journalistic and ideological misperception.Can the US coexist with China? In the evolving, globalized world, it has little choice. Of course it can.Here's an academic book, philosophical and scientific in nature, that needs to become a commonplace of thought.

It is a book about injuries to a self that passionately wants to bear witness to its painful truths, which is to say: born on the other side of the tracks in Kentucky, witness to the rage of a father who thought his wife betrayed him, black in a country where the white elites had become post-racial feminists (aren't you over that black thing yet?), wanting to be an academic rather than an a literary writer, not wanting to be drawn to a cold, brilliant, sexy man who could not manage the intricacies of the openness to which he had pledged himself (for me, not for you), and not wanting her religious/poetic sentiment to be confined within the institutions of social faith, as opposed to transcendent faith.This is a subjective memoir, one-sided as all memoirs are, yet self-critical and fair. hooks's insights into male/female dominance dances are powerful; her representation of what it feels like to be black in America is compelling. The narrowness of her social awareness is something that is both forced on her and born within her, because she is not very social except when she is intimate...and there the wounds and passions are deep. hooks explicitly acknowledges that she is not a person who believes in footnotes; she is a person who believes in what she experiences and how she experiences it.The subjective is incontrovertible, although we all know it is a kind of prison. Few of us are so attentive to our perceptions, and so articulate, that we can put them on a page. Quite often we therefore ignore or gloss over our own sentience. Not hooks. She convincingly makes the case that she did, in fact, live by a creed of honesty in the first three decades of her life. She doesn't claim to be a saint or perfect, but she does assert a willingness to think through the consequences of how we are, as opposed to how it would be convenient to be, or how we ought to be.Most of the writing here is strong and vivid. Some of it is overdrawn and perfervid, and not in a good sense.It always has seemed to me that race, as in racism, is the greatest unresolved American theme (in part because Americans have no chance of ever resolving their historical relations to the original peoples of these lands.) hooks is no racist, but she is deservedly tough on whites. So a white reader will have to endure many unhappy paragraphs in this book.Curiously, hooks seems, however, to pose race as the dominant problem in her life while focusing more intensely on sexuality and female/male relations, illustrated through her deep analysis of a 10-year involvement with a black male named Mack (probably not his real name, as bell hooks is not bell hooks's real name.)The issue she focuses on is whether a man and a woman can divvy up elements of their relationship in such a way as to permit each to thrive in equal, if differentiated, measure. With Mack, that proves impossible. But as a literary writer, hooks isn't postulating that the same would be true with any man. She's specific, fascinatingly so. She gives him a lot of credit for supporting her, putting up with her, loving and desiring her, until she begins to exceed him: her book is published first, she's the one offered a job at Yale.As a counterpoint to the Mack/hooks's relationship, she offers a wonderful portrait of the relationship between the poet Robert Duncan and his male partner/lover Jess. Duncan was famous and a little bit (or a lot) flagrant in different ways. Jess was not so famous but held his private ground just fine. hooks adored Jess. Duncan seems to have adored Mack . But Duncan and Jess had an equipoise that escaped Mack and hooks.This book was published in 1997. I pulled it out of a throwaway pile because, as I've said, black and white issues are at the moral center of the American experience. These last 8 years we have had Barack Obama as the American president. When I was a boy, a black president would have been unimaginable. Maybe that is why the Trump revolt is unfolding today--a desire to put America back in the 50s. Sorry, the 2050s are coming, the 1950s are gone.A final point: throughout the book, hooks takes on the issue of whether human beings of one social category or another can fully understand the experience of human beings of another social category. I think she proves that is roughly possible. A black reader will not read this book exactly as a white reader will read it, but there's a bit of transcendent commonality in both the wounds and the passions.

The owner is about to die, but not yet, and the son is about to take over, but not yet. Meanwhile the workers sing and chatter to one another, gossip and comment,and have womenfolk and children at home with just enough cash on hand to make it through the week.Lily Gates is the moral center of the tale. She's in her early twenties and must stay at home and take care of it for her father, Joe Gates, and her grandfather, Mr Craigan (as he is called). She'd love to have a job, love to live the kind of life she sees in the movies, love to be able to decide who is the better bet for marriage, Mr Dale or Mr Jones, both foundry workers. This ensemble reminds me of Colm Toiban's Brooklyn but the delicacy and ingenuity of the prose, its spontaneity, reminds me more of the flight of pigeons, an airborne motif throughout the novel.Living is half overheard, a quarter lyrical exposition, another quarter striking, quick-paced encounter. At the same time it is curiously phrased not only in Birmingham dialect but also in a kind of notational style wherein articles and prepositions are deliberately omitted creating stumps of sentences that are pleasant to trip over. Some passages read like Dubliners, others like Ulysses, and then others like the sweeping montages of John Dos Pasos's U.S.A. trilogy, capturing public houses, the fizzing, foaming fury of molten metal, football match jousting, and the unexpected intrusions of the foundry owner's son's romantic disappointments. If he were not necessary to the unfolding of the plot, he would be more than expendable.For reasons that are not always clear, Green divides this text into chapters.

So the premise is upstairs/downstairs, but it's mostly downstairs, and the incidents are mostly trivial or petty but matter a great deal to a group of people who get by on small wages and worry a great deal about what's going on in England, under attack by the Luftwaffe.Green excels in the psychology of dialogue, its disappointments and blind alleys. The actual words he uses are apt but more important is the revelatory way in which what one character says provokes an unexpected reaction from another. Beyond that, Green has an intuitive grasp of when an exchange in one setting logically should be followed by a scene transpiring elsewhere in the castle, so the narrative is essentially unbroken and unblemished by forced transitions or the ominous footfall of a chapter's end.This can be disconcerting. There's little exposition. A butler's background emerges from his actions and statements and desires, not from a Trollope-like account of what has brought him to our attention, gone on in the meantime, etc.Even more than stream of consciousness writing by Joyce or Faulkner, Green's prose somehow simply happens. The way to read it, I have found, is slowly, letting each sentence come to a full stop before taking on the next one. Going too fast causes too much confusion and causes you to miss the best parts of a character's unstated reasoning or motives.John Updike, a very fine writer, was wild about Green. He says that if writing could be taught, then Green would have been his teacher. What's interesting in this affinity is that Updike's prose is more studied, more theatrical, often more precious. He did not really learn much from Green's deceptive carelessness.Loving is much ado about nothing except, ultimately, two principal characters realizing that they must flee the castle, head back to England, and take their chances on marriage--small people embarked on one of life's more fundamental journeys.

It's a sequel to a similarly fat anthology called The Art of The Tale, focused primarily on writers born before 1938. In his brief introduction, Daniel Halpern says that the writers in the first volume looked to Anton Chekhov's short stories as their model and thus were writers consciously participating in a literary tradition. But in this sequel, says Halpern, one will read stories more responsive to popular culture and reactive to the media in all its venues, far beyond literary traditions.I found Halpern's distinction provocative and wondered if it would prove true. Would the world's more recent batch of gifted writers prove, in a way, less literary if equally literate? Knowing Chekhov--one of my favorite writers--I also wondered how he could be the key link in a literary chain when his style of writing was not self-consciously ""literary."" To the contrary, Chekhov's stories generally are piercingly direct, concrete, and not allusively dependent on references to great literary predecessors, be they Russian, French, German, English, or Spanish. In Chekhov's plays one encounters comedy kindred to Cervantes. That's not equally true in his stories. My personal opinion is that his stories were in fact shaped by the dominant media venue of his day: he wrote for and published in newspapers. And unless an author is serializing (Dickens), he might well accommodate himself to the narrow column widths and short lengths of a news story.So Chekhov, who was in fact widely read and highly literary, also was reactive to his media environment... and part of that media environment included the readership, looking for images of itself. That is how what we call ""popular"" culture evolved, or at least one dimension of it.I don't fault Halpern for getting this a little bit wrong; he offers a good thought and lots of sensational stories from all over the world.Many of them, especially from Africa, are Chekhovian and conform to economies of continuous action in which character and event intertwine. Some of them are what might be called meta-fictions. I'm thinking of a story about adventures in sexual identities by Patricia Duncker called Betrayal. Other stories like Are These Actual Miles? by Raymond Carver, Optimists by Richard Ford, and Wish by Bobbie Ann Mason, are the evolution and embellishment of the stories of Ernest Hemingway, who pointed to Turgenev as his literary model rather than Chekhov.There are some stories in this collection such as Ysrael by Junot Díaz and Pornography by Ian McEwan and Rara Avis by T.C. Boyle that are miniaturizations of the ethos of Lord of the Flies. The McEwan story is the best, most troubling example of his literary talent that I've read. It's ugly but a knockout. He has said elsewhere that he doesn't really believe in evil, but in his own story, he has proven himself wrong.Here are the advantages of story anthologies: They showcase what Borges called the short story's essential quality. They introduce a reader to writers the reader might want to pursue. (They do the opposite, too.) And in this case they illustrate the adaptability of the story form to all kinds of cultures, societies, and geographies.Short stories of the highest order, as Borges indicated, work and work completely, and whether intentionally or not, they inescapably become part of the literary tradition.

It's a tumultuous, somewhat overwrought book, grounded in Macdonald's passion for hawks and her knowledge of the natural world.The goshawk in question acquires the name Mabel. In beautiful detail, Macdonald describes all of Mabel's features and quirks. She makes no case for the kind of animal-human connection one might find between a person and a dog, but she is superb in anatomizing the elements of having a relationship with a wild, untamable, avian predator. A goshawk, presumably any hawk, participates in such a relationship by habituating itself to incentives, notably pieces of meat. It is not trained; that would be the wrong word. It simply fits its understanding of how it can comfortably survive in the company of a human into various patterns of behavior that end up in having something to eat.Macdonald is a good writer with a keen eye; she describes herself as an observer from childhood and backs this up sentence by sentence. Most of the book transpires in the environs of Cambridge, England, out in the fields, the woods, along marshlands, in and out of hedgerows. If you like rich, specific appreciations of such settings, this is the book for you. MacDonald's descriptions of skies, cloud banks, the vagaries of light at various times of the day, and so forth is superb. She does not claim to have the preternatural vision of a hawk, but in a way, she has it.Inevitably the drama of leading Mabel through the steps of being a hawk in human captivity becomes infused with what's known as the pathetic fallacy, i.e., attributing human characteristics to a nonhuman feature of nature. For instance, ""I climbed a steep hill toward a glowering mass of boulders."" Rocks, of course, don't have eyes and can't see and therefore cannot glower. One might risk saying that a hawk glowers but since glower means to glare angrily or sullenly, it's difficult to be sure that's what a hawk is doing.And yet there are highly cultivated intimacies between humans and animals (humans being animals, of course) that lend themselves to impossible understandings, and a book like H is for Hawk speaks to the desperation that many of us feel about the ongoing destruction of the natural world, its landscapes, its animal life, its waters, and air. If we are not connected to the energy of animals, if we do not recognize that they and we share in the mystery of what is known as life, we end up feeling bereft. Indeed, one might suggest, as Macdonald does, that losing a parent and losing a connection to the natural world are pretty much the same thing...and that one remedy is to soothe human grief by establishing deeper connections with the natural world.Macdonald portrays herself as an expert in falconry, quite believably, and traces some of her fascination with this activity (I hesitate to call it a sport) to her reading of a book by T.H. White, author of The Sword in the Stone and The Once and Future King, about his own experiences with a goshawk, whom he rather unimaginatively called ""Gos."" There's some very good and interesting writing about White here, but in a way it becomes a book about a book, a recounting of White's book lightly interlaced with additional research into White's tortured life. As a literary person, Macdonald probably does feel that reading is living (I feel the same way), but I think she spends too much time on White. He was a wreck and a wretch and a recluse and he did a terrible job with his goshawk. That probably makes him a good symbolic emblem of Macdonald's subjective state during her mourning of her father, but even though she portrays herself as often out of control, obsessive, error prone, antisocial, and generally difficult, she did a splendid job with Mabel and she clearly is not a female analogue to White. She would never be as careless or cruel or stupid or arrogant.I should say that I read this book in large measure because I always have been intrigued by hawks. I spot them before anyone else does and often when no one else does. I see them in branches, in the sky, on telephone polls, all over the place. Their solitude and spectacular maneuvers in flight and even their dry, distinctive calls are magnetic for me. I would never ""fly"" one. I'd rather see them where they belong, feasting on freedom. But when someone as deeply involved and knowledgeable and caring as Macdonald decides to spend weeks, months and years in closer company to hawks, it's all right with me. They are in safe hands....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 11, 2016","Feb 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18803640-h-is-for-hawk

The premise is that Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight, August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India's independence, which couples with the creation of Pakistan (its western portion being what we now know as Pakistan and its eastern portion being what we now know as Bangladesh.) Other children are born at the same time--1000 of them--and Saleem is connected to them by a kind of telepathic (eventually olfactory) unity.This political premise quickly succumbs to its multifaceted cultural variants. There are Hindu variants, Muslim variants and a few Buddhist variants. As time progresses, said variants become intertwined with Saleem's problematic autobiography while radiating through his family and encompassing the complex nature of Kashmir, Bombay, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The peculiarities of Saleem's family, his own unfortunate physical characteristics, and the unruliness of his relations with the other 1000 Midnight's Children make this book comic, ebullient, outrageous, satirical, and yet somehow predictable. As the pages pass by, the reader realizes that Rushdie is going to methodically exploit variant after variant. Inevitably, once all the variants are explored, Saleem will end up being swallowed in ""the annihilating whirlpool of the multitudes,"" whatever that means.At about the midpoint in my reading, I happened to have a conversation about Midnight's Children with an Indian friend of mine. He loves the book because it is a mirror of what he thinks of as India's central feature: its circularity, its eternal return, its lack of interest in or talent for ""progress."" There is no way, he says, to emerge from the timelessness of India, no way to distinguish between its reality and its mythology...and no need to try. In his view, Rushdie captures this truth perfectly, celebrating the quirks, futility, and obscurity of the Indian experience.As a practical matter, he is no doubt right. India goes nowhere as quickly and busily and colorfully as any place on earth. The literary problem Rushdie sets up for himself, however, is that it is almost impossible to write about the totality of India without festooning your story with characters who are fairly shallow, if amusing, and employing a frenetic, sometimes blurry, style of writing. By the end of the book, when Saleem is summing things up, his words tumble forth without much beauty, pungency,or persuasiveness; he has turned his autobiography into a kind of argument, i.e., that his life is identical with all the Indias (and Pakistans), and therefore he has to tie every conceivable previously highlighted character and theme into the finale. It becomes almost impossible to agree with him on this except out of exhaustion.Rushdie, it seems to me, is a wildly talented, mischievous writer who is not quite as serious about his work as his many prizes and accolades would suggest. He likes to poke fun, and he's great at it. But Midnight's Children's ending seems forced and disappointing; essentially it rehashes the conventional wisdom about the subcontinent, making some of its jokes and most of its characters ring hollow. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14836.Midnight_s_Children

These thick illustrated books, driven by dialogue and thoughts in bubbles with a bit of exposition/scene setting here and there, were old things from the '30s, rescued from basements, attics and second-hand shops. I don't think anything held my attention more fiercely than those books. I would devour them. Their illustrations were like seeing my thoughts as I read, aids to the imagination, crude but powerful.From Hell has its origins in those books, subsequent comics, and the explosion of graphic inventiveness that occurred during the sixties. I'm too jaded to be as taken in now by such a book as I was when I was a boy, but even though there's a snowstorm outside, limiting distractions, it's true that I read From Hell in a single day despite the fact that it is a thick, complicated book.Moore refers to it as a melodrama. True. It's also a Masonic conspiracy theory centered on the unsolved crimes of Jack the Ripper. And finally, it's a more than whimsical attempt to use art to push us into a fourth, timeless, dimension.Much of the power of this Victorian-era story derives from Eddie Campbell's brilliant illustrations. Campbell captures London's somber character and moods with exceptional versatility. At times he slashes, at times he washes his images out into almost featureless ghosts, at times he homes in tight on the sordid sex lives of street walkers, at times he plays with the transcendent divinity of Queen Victoria herself. Some of his most brilliant passages are sequences of illustrations conveying no dialogue at all; one drawing after another traces a man's progress walking down a rainy nighttime street, for instance. Or something has just been said that needs to be accompanied by a follow-on illustration wherein everyone present is depicted as speechless.The story's arc takes off on a beach at Bournemouth and lands there, too. This gives From Hell a kind of rainbow effect (reminding me, in fact, of Thomas Pynchon) that is consonant with its atemporal thesis, that is, the notion all things happen all the time not in history but in a kind of eternal present, rising and falling on the same spot.Despite wobbling and dipping into threadbare narrative tricks and deceptions (now I'm reminded of Dickens), From Hell's final passages contain a kind of thrilling, unexpected poetry that is a summons to and realization of Masonry's ultimate deity and Architect. What should be crazy struck me as insistently serious and penetrating.The issue that runs throughout this book is the war between the Sun and the Moon, Apollo and Dionysus, the left brain and the right, the rational and the irrational, the empirical and the mythic. Having fun, but with mastery, Moore uses violent murder, political intrigue, aristocrats and prostitutes to focus on the darker side of the truth. The great conspiracy is not just obfuscating the identity of Jack the Ripper, it is obfuscating the submerged powers of humanity as a whole.Others have said From Hell is the masterwork of the graphic novel genre. Having only read those fat little graphic novelettes when I was a kid, I'm in no position to rate it that way. But I'd say that this lurid, demanding, melodrama finds a way to hold nothing back; it's risk-taking, compelling, intriguing, perceptive and sweeping--not for everyone, but those who pick it up probably won't put it down....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 22, 2016","Jan 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23529.From_Hell

Ballard's complete stories because I've read dozens of them now and won't keep going straight through the 1000+ page edition I have in hand. I'll return to it from time to time; that's a better way to enjoy it.Ballard was a writer of very pure imagination, and the stories that qualify as ""science fiction,"" which I normally do not read, illustrate this best. He creates worlds that he describes with haunting beauty, few of which work out well for their inhabitants, but almost all of them enjoy beautiful deaths.Ultimately his strategy is to generate landscapes, either astrophysical or psychological, that feels dangerous but at the same time are intriguing...and then to feed his characters into their maws, whether they be the maws of time, of aliens, of alienation, or renegade plant life. Even music, it turns out, has a certain voraciousness. Be careful of what you listen to; it may consume you.The curious power of Ballard's stories is that once the story has put down roots, it does not really matter how plausible it is; the issue is how comprehensive and powerful it is.I'm thinking of a way to snuff out weeds: throw a plastic tarp over them, leave it there for a few weeks, remove it, they'll all be dead. Ballard does this again and againHis weakest stories are too closely linked to things like spies, beautiful women, exotic conspiracies that have the scent of reality about them, but even then he writes with a scalpel, his prose is sharp, sneering, commanding.For reasons I'll let others debate, writers who are tagged as producing science fiction (or horror or fantasy) often excluded from the higher ranks of literary writers. Then there is push-back, in which it is argued that a Ballard is equivalent to a Poe, a Kafka, or a Borges. I'll settle the question this way: it's a very fine thing to be mentioned in the company of Poe, Kafka, and Borges.At times Ballard writes like Nabokov, at times like Graham Greene, and at times like his inimitable self, someone who has worked out all the consequences of believing in aliens or the social banishment of time.Ballard's great sin is probably his refusal to commit to character. He's too interested in ideas to let individuality prevail. At times this makes his fictions somewhat airless, even lifeless, although they never lack eeriness and a kind of verbal grandeur.In his introduction to this volume, Martin Amis, who knew Ballard, ventures that he was a bit lame when it came to dialogue. I get the point, but it didn't bother me. The mannered, expository kind of dialogue one finds in a writer like Ballard is inevitable.I'd say that there is a certain kind of reader who, upon reading Ballard, feels a fever that never dies down. I wouldn't say I am exactly that kind of reader. But in due course, I'll finish the 1000+ pages.

But Norm Schriever's book really strikes me as one of the best, most enjoyable advice-on-the-new-world-of-publishing books even though it's exhausting to contemplate how many options and imperatives exist for authors to promote their work, whether they are backed by a publisher or not.What's good about this book is that it is clear and practical. Schriever knows the ropes and how to grab hold of them. The problem is that writers sometimes are writers because they're introverts, and it does not always sound like fun to be Tweeting away, blogging away, making trailer-like promo videos, interviewing oneself, and/or calling on the local mayor. Nonetheless, Schriever does compassionately emphasize that book promotion has to be an opportunity to meet people and have discussions with them--not pressure them to buy something-- or it won't work. His stance is that selling is not what it's about--making contact is what it's about, letting readers know you're there for them if they're interested is what it's about. The sales will follow, and they won't come from bludgeoning one's best friends and relatives; they'll come from self-selecting folks out there who are hunting for information, insight, advice, and literary experience. These folks, the true committeds, are the ones, Schriever persuasively contends, who will make or break a book's success in the marketplace. Some of Schriever's key points:Twitter is a dynamite way to get attention.You have to be the best curator of your own book, know its theme and subject cold, and be willing to talk or write about it whenever and wherever.Authors have to have web sites and their web sites have to have links to points-of-sale and some appealing blogging, which should be single-subject and to the point. Photos make a big difference. Music can, too.The whole point of ancillary social media (Facebook, Tumblr, etc.) is to funnel folks to the author's website and from there, possibly, to a sale. Sounds like a lot of work but much of what the author produces can be used again and again: bio, short synopsis, long synopsis, blurbs, etc.My most gratifying blogging practice is writing s like this, which I then post on my Wordpress website and which in turn is buttressed by my Amazon author's page and a link to my Twitter and Facebook accounts. I gather this is sort of medium-okay. It would be better if I tackled more topics head on, and it would be even better if I did so via Huffington Post. Well, we'll see. I've published feature pieces in the Washington Post and L.A. Times and Die Zeit, but the idea is that there are no laurels in the new publishing world, which is to say you've got to keep pumping things out. But again,Schriever advocates exactly what I would advocate were I writing his book. The idea isn't to sell X copies; the idea is to instigate an indefinite number of encounters. To me this sounds sustainable. What I like about Goodreads is that it's a site for readers, people who care enough about books to share their thoughts. That's excellent because writers write to share, obviously, as well as to press themselves to articulate as well as they can what they find meaningful in life.A point Schriever makes towards the end is that the new publishing technologies mean writing has gone global, it's a post-national cultural reality. To me, that's great. It's like landing on a new planet...and just in time.P.S. (And this is a true P.S.): No sooner did I post this  than I saw it in finished form with a pop-up ad for Schriever's beside it. To me, that's a little much, but it's a good indication of how closely he follows his own advice....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2016","Jan 03, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21405124-the-book-marketing-bible

The colony and early state was dominated by plantation owners in the coastal east who rigged the system to ensure political control over the rest of the population. They had money and slaves, and they were not interested in the transportation/education/social challenges of the settlers in the piedmont and the mountains. North Carolina's enthusiasm for the revolution was anti-tax and soon turned into suspicion and dislike of the federal government. This carried over into North Carolina's stance in the Civil War, or, as this author calls it, the War for Southern Independence. North Carolina was a slave state, but the majority of slave owners were a minority of the white population, and they were concentrated, again, in the plantation zone. Yet these slave owners, and a general antipathy toward government, drew the entire state into revolt against the federal government.Again and again, the wealthiest of the state's residents succeeded in twisting the entire state to serve their purposes. With money, the planters were better educated and better organized,and they were not as disparate in their activities and outlooks as other North Carolinians, who might be subsistence farmers or miners or laborers or small town merchants.The Civil War wrecked North Carolina even though it was not a major battleground state. Then Reconstruction poured salt in the wounds. And then there was a backlash wherein the increasingly affluent industrial class (railroaders, bankers, tobacco conglomerates, textile mill operators) settled in as the heirs to the plantation owners as the monied minority that took control and advantage of the the poor majority.For almost 300 years of North Carolina underperformed its potential and underserved its population.Its literacy rate was abysmal; major economic strengths went unexploited. But in the 20th century, the situation began to change, and here's how in a nutshell:""In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the broad modern social concept of the government as a service agency for community development triumphed for the first time in North Carolina. As the people demanded more and better services from government, its structure expanded, its cost increased, and taxes became heavier. This trend was the inevitable result of the increasing number and complexity of social and economic problems of public interest arising from an expanding population brought closer together by improving transportation and communication facilities.""The Great Depression hurt North Carolina but ultimately helped it in engendering greater statewide cooperation through New Deal programs. World War II brought North Carolina major investments in armed service installations and military suppliers. Then in the 1950s and 1960s, a series of enlightened governors and legislators pushed for better education, better health care, and better social services.During that period, the Democrats gerrymandered electoral districts in their favor. Now (2015) the Republicans have finally gotten the upper hand and re-gerrymandered those districts. They also are pushing back on all fronts against state expenditures on the common good. The new president of the University of North Carolina, for instance, is a former Republican Secretary of Education whose thoughts on retrenchment do not include lowering her $700,000 plus per year salary. For anyone familiar with higher education, it is astounding that anyone could occupy such a prestigious position without holding a PhD. UNC is a major research university. What would its new president have to contribute in managing research programs? Well, she says, jobs like her new one are all political, and that's the fun of it. Is it?North Carolina's deep antipathy toward government, its subservience to the interests of the wealthy, and its complex geography running from the coast to the mountains are permanent features of the state. But at the same time there is a liberal, progressive strain in North Carolina's history that isn't going away either. Initially and for hundreds of years a predominantly rural state, North Carolina's future probably will be most affected by continuing urbanization. The paragraph I quoted above sums up how this inevitably will lead to a more social concept of government.But for the moment, North Carolina has the kind of governor who would turn down federal Medicaid funds, potentially helpful to the state's poor, because he doesn't want the federal government messing around in North Carolina, and he thinks the federal government isn't to be trusted to keep funding this vital expansion of service. As such, he is a true North Carolinian of the old stripe, the kind who, two hundred years ago, saw no need for roads or waterway improvements in the piedmont or mountain regions--that would cost money and the only way you can raise money is through bonds and taxes, so let's just let things be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 26, 2015","Dec 26, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2103213.North_Carolina

She portrays a world in which she lives with equal intensity whether her companion is her cat, Cairo, or a writer, Sylvia Plath, whom she never met but once adored.No one figures more importantly in this reflection than the departed love of her life, her husband Fred. He is a partner, a comforter, and a dream figure, someone who boils complexity down for Smith and gives her mysterious answers on a par with Wittgenstein's famous dictum: The world is that which is the case. (To which we might reply: What else would it be?)On occasion Smith overwrites or bungles a sentence or employs one threadbare formulation or another. I don't know if an editor would dare alter her mistakes, however, because they are remarkably authentic in the context of many, many ""Wow"" images, sentences, paragraphs and short paragraphs.There's a certain literary tribalism here that will be familiar to readers who generally don't distinguish between ""read"" experience and ""lived"" experience. This is Smith's hunting ground, and her burial ground. The names are Camus, Plath, Genet, Burroughs, Henry Miller, other Beats, Paul Bowles, assorted Frenchmen and Englishmen (and women) who died too young, or by suicide, Roberto Bolaño, sundry poets and fictionists, songwriters, and the inhabitants of many other untended graves. One key element in Smith's writing is probably the fact that she accepts death,seeks it out, isn't morbid about it, has come to terms with it, and knows the true Holy Trinity is the Past, Present and Future (that's my line, not hers), time in one dimension that simply stretches in response to thought.The life she describes is fascinating in its minimalism.She travels with the same bag full of nothing (some socks, T-shirts, underwear, books, and notebooks) wherever she goes and her palace is a cup of coffee. As an underground celebrity who emerged from the depths, she is a person of some means who receives interesting invitations all the time but she keeps things simple and is deeply loyal to the things and persons she loves.She does not possess an organized mind, nor does she want one, though she admires such a quality.

Well, that'I see by a sales sticker on the back of my copy of Ovid's Metamorphoses that I have diligently not read it for the 11 years I've owned it. Well, that's not true any longer. Just finished it, certainly one of the major Latin poems and perhaps the only one I had not read since I began learning Latin when I was 13.Fortunately, I didn't read this text in Latin; instead I read a superb translation by the poet/translator Charles Martin, whose unflagging verbal dexterity captures the original's astonishing speed and variety.Metamorphoses differs from the Aeneid (and from the Iliad and Odyssey) in that it is a series of vignettes, legends, lyrical moments, philosophical interventions and bizarre anecdotes that revolve around 250 separate metamorphoses, or transformations, that lead humans to become trees and rivers and birds and demigods while playfully and maliciously being loved, raped, and belittled by the real gods.Here in one sense is a compendium of most of Greek and Roman mythology. In another sense here is a saucy virtuosic poetic disquisition on the flux and folly of all things, none of which can disappear, all of which must change shape.Ovid, whom Augustus exiled apparently for having participated in some of the more scandalous activities of his lascivious daughter, Julia, was the joking genius of Rome. Vladimir Nabokov is one modern writer I can think of with a similar aptitude for endlessly resourceful narrative pyrotechnics that sort of make sense but don't disappoint in their ultimately gauzy, smokey, misty quality. Both writers adored the theme of overwhelming, irrepressible love, that stabbing experience of seeing a man or woman or boy or girl and having to get things going...fast. There are chase scenes, rejections, tricks, deceptions, and scabby revelations that emerge out of this sexual context on almost every page.Scholars seem to tell us a few things about the Romans that are pertinent to Ovid: They did not really believe in the gods but needed Jove, Juno, Venus, Mars, Mercury and others to express their excuses for how they often behaved; they also found the gods highly useful in the ceremonial dimensions of governance. I say ""seem to tell us"" these things because it's very difficult to pin down an Ovid, a Catullus, or a Lucan. Much of what Ovid wrote clearly was meant as commentary on contemporary Rome, and this may have contributed to his exile (Seneca was exiled, too), something that on purely literary grounds is inexcusable. As great as Augustus was (and he was great), he sinned against Ovid and Roman culture in general. To send Ovid off forever was to deprive Rome of a playboy poet who clearly worked like a dog and commanded an extraordinary amount of mythological, geographical, historical, and literary information. This is not the kind of talent to be banished (or maybe it' exactly the kind of talent that ends up being banished).I don't know that I would recommend reading Metamorphoses straight through, as I did. Fairly often, Ovid makes narrative leaps that are taxing to follow and not infrequently he excavates stories (or invents them) that bear little relation to the main storylines in Greek and Roman mythology. That said, Ovid is wonderful at the outset, abstractly describing the creation of the world out of chaos, and he's clear, if idiosyncratic, as he picks at the stories of the Trojan war and the travails of Aeneas. At the poem's end, two major themes present themselves: one is obligatory, a hagiography of Julius and Augustus Caesar; the other is a Pythagorean riff on the circular mutability of things that does veer here and there fairly closely to our current scientific understandings.I guess I would end this comment as follows: it takes a big effort to work one's way through this big book; it might be more easily assimilated and even appreciated through selected passages. Reading it that way, however, would diminish the awe it inspires, and that would be quite a loss....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 08, 2015","Dec 08, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/116503.Metamorphoses

He tells parallel stories of affluent Americans sAlthough it was published in 1995, TC Boyle's The Tortilla Curtain could not be more relevant today. He tells parallel stories of affluent Americans seeking refuge from L.A. in the canyons beyond its perimeter and indigent immigrants also living in those canyons--but not in beautiful homes--while trying to make a life and a family on a day laborer's wages and at the mercy of nature, which is not very merciful.Cándido and América come from Tepotzlan, an enchanting town in Morelos not that far from Mexico City I happen to know fairly well. She is 17. He is in his early 30s. They have entered the U.S. with no formalities, are brutalized in passage, and barely survive on minimal food and in minimal shelter.Delaney is a naturalist and his wife Kyra is a realtor. He's a liberal environmentalist who gradually turns against what he, and others, feel is the endless invasion of what Donald Trump would call crooks, murderers, and rapists.The canyons surrounding L.A. are not ""better"" than Tepotzlan. They are not more beautiful, welcoming, or special, but they are associated with American wealth, and that's what draws Mexicans without visas to the U.S. Boyle describes Cándido and América's plight poignantly, the insults to their dignity and their dreams,their desperation,imagination, and fortitude. Boyle is less kind to Kyra and Delaney, self-absorbed and convinced of the rightness of their wealth and their commitment to pristine nature, far from L.A.'s freeways.Quite skillfully Boyle engineers a plot that generates lots of truths about what both couples feel toward one another, but he tells a tale that is very difficult to resolve.Today (November, 2015), we are witnessing the continuing migration of economic and political refugees from the Middle East, South Asia and Africa into Europe. Their circumstances,and Europe's problems, are extreme, but anyone who knows the U.S.-Mexico border knows that our two countries have been experiencing extreme migratory difficulties for decades.As a diplomat many years ago I had responsibility for certain aspects of U.S.-Mexican border relations. My mandate stretched from Tijuana to Brownsville. I watched Mexicans and others cross into the U.S. at night using infrared binoculars, I visited maquiladoras, universities, elementary schools, city halls, environmental disasters, and the searing, bleached wastes of the desert on which Trump says he will build a beautiful 2,000 mile wall. (This is really, really insulting to the intelligence of the American electorate, by the way. It's shameless buffoonery.)Boyle masterfully gets at all this in fictional terms. He depicts the resentments and struggles in his characters' lives and circumstances with strong, vivid, accurate writing. In the process, he dramatizes the essentially unresolvable dilemmas of human migration between the Third World and the First.What we see in Europe these days is mind boggling, but it is more or less a tenth of what has transpired between Mexico and the U.S for the last five decades. If it is true, and I really don't know that it is, that we have 12 million non-citizen migrants in the U.S. from south of the border, think of how that would look should it make the nightly news on an ongoing basis. But unless a conservative, ill-informed and unrealistic (not to mention heartless) politician is out there throwing red meat to his equally conservative, ill-informed and unrealistic supporters, this wave of humanity is only sporadically covered.Attitudes change in the border zone depending how close you are to the actual line of demarcation. People in Tijuana and San Diego don't look at migration the same way that people in Hermosillo and Calabasas look at it. The same is true when you think of El Paso and Juarez in contrast to Monterrey and Austin. The border zone proper, 25 miles or so on either side, is a world unto itself, comes up with its own solutions, and begs for and seldom receives adequate resources from the federal government. Deeper in either the U.S. and Mexico, the migration phenomenon becomes more alien, spooky, and threatening. Delaney in Boyle's novel does a marvelous job of totally misinterpreting Cándido. He's constantly wrong, which is not to say Cándido really has any idea what he's doing.The problem is survival, it's miscommunication, it's cultural and linguistic differences, it's need on the one side, surfeit on the other.I think it's best that novels do not try to propose policy solutions. Boyle avoids this. He looks at human quandaries and makes them real for the reader.

These adventures are driven by a nephew and a niece and a grand-niece and folks in the neighborhood (booksellers and waitresses) who are no less interesting or plausible than most people in life but not compelling in fiction.Nathan's narrative voice probably is the novel's chief limitation. He reminds me of some of Saul Bellow's narrators but without the edge, panic, and mania. Everything he relates flows fluidly through the pages but is full of hackneyed phrases and cliches and forced witticisms. The nicest of guys,he sees a lot of good in other people, and as they get into jams, he does what he can to help them out, sometimes by listening, sometimes by taking actions. But this is a loose book. Certain minor characters are very minor, to the point that they appear and vanish forever in a few pages. Certain major characters, basically all the major characters, lack depth and are conveyed to the reader by means of flashback speechifying and coincidence.As good as Auster can be, and as noir and cryptic and provocative as he can be, he must have decided to write a novel that was easy on his soul, something he could write and polish and publish quickly.The book's appeal is its defect, I suppose: You don't quite believe what it is telling you, you think a lot is being left out, too much is being wrapped up too neatly, but the tale-teller is a garrulous, energetic and inoffensive fellow and it's a sort of TV-way of sailing through the pages.

As I read it I asked myself how well one must know the Bible to appreciate it. The climax, for instance, comes with the spiritual rebirth of a 14-year-old John couched in the terms of the Book of Revelation. So there's a cultural idiom and background here that in our increasingly secular society might go right over many heads; but the sheer force of the prose, the elegance of the images (and their terror), might also provide the kind of electric shock needed to generate understanding without literal knowledge.Baldwin's decision to give John over to God surprised me somewhat. John had a father, Gabriel, whom he justifiably hated and a brother (a half-brother, we find out) with whom he was deeply out of step. So John is full of negatives and resistance. He wants to be free, not impounded within another domain, however glorious, ruled over by an inscrutable paternal figure. But Baldwin carries this off in an interesting cry of commitment perhaps not so much to the Lord as to John himself, a boy become man with a future that will be his own, not chattel to his father.Does Baldwin remain relevant today? Well, powerful literature always remains relevant; that's my conviction. But I also think that in exploring the deep, overwhelming oppression and alienation and fear and anger that blacks of 50 and 75 years ago experienced, Baldwin gives us insight into persisting questions of oppression, alienation, fear, and anger today. He was not writing about a world that since his time has undergone massive transformation, despite a black president and a growing black middle class. Hard won progress definitely has been won, but we see at the University of Missouri and in Ferguson and Charleston and Baltimore signs of tension, distress, violence and despair that are still too much with us.Curiously, whites appear only a few times in this novel; they don't come off well (associated with a brutal killing) but they don't need to be highlighted to take their place in the long list of oppositions I cited at the outset of this . There has to be something on the other side of the squalor and suffering these characters experience, and it is clearly is a world of opportunity they are so denied that they turn, instead, to spiritual salvation, more or less writing off their chances in this world, a world run by whites, not blacks.This is one of the most powerful elements in Go Tell It On The Mountain: the way it insistently explores frailties within the black community. These characters are lonely and adrift in a hostile world, but they really look inside themselves for answers, hold themselves accountable, are realistic about what they have done or have not done to make the most of their constrained circumstances.Baldwin will always be worth reading for the power of his insight into character and the human condition.

In this fourth ""Frank Bascombe"" book, he has earned his stripes and scars, delights in mocking life, tries to stay on the outskirts of suburban disaster, and is plagued by ex-wives and friends and customers who won't just die and leave him in peace so he can contemplate everything tacky, faux, imported, oversized, undernourished and hurricane-wrecked (Hurricane Sandy is the thematic backdrop to this book) about the United States.A few weeks ago I went to an event where Richard Ford read from this book and answered questions about it and the writing life in general.  I asked him why poor Frank was so bitter. Ford didn't agree that Frank is bitter.  He's just bemused, wise in the travesties of the world, and acerbic. Maybe Ford is right. Either way, the point is that these tales are platforms for Frank to carry on in exquisite detail about the carnival of insignificance that is central New Jersey in these early decades of the 21st century.  Things that might hurt Frank don't really hurt, he assures us; marriages that dried up just dried up, nothing more to it; fake Tudor houses are fine, just fake; and one of the last things to shrink when a man gets very old sometimes is his most useless, refractory organ, tick-tocking between his legs in a permanently dripping fugue state, annoyingly posing as if it could rise again but never will.The writing in this book clearly is a version of John Updike's suburbia, but the difference is that Updike, for whatever reason (probably his primary narcissism), genuinely loved the commercial excrescences of the drive to make a buck that causes suburbia to keep reinventing itself on worse and worse terms. Ford can be wonderfully lyrical and arresting as he ventriloquizes through Frank Bascombe, but he's not in love with the shallowness of American affluence; he doesn't see the spiritual in dreck that Updike, a devout sort of man, found irresistible and redeeming.  Updike wrote as if he knew this joke of contemporary culture was nothing more than a way station on the pathway to transcendence. Ford, or again, Frank Bascombe, comes up short in pushing through folly to faith.This is not really a criticism of Ford; it's just a fact of his character's temperament, worldview, and experience.  He's not Updike in that he's more of a snarky realist.  He's also, and this is probably a strength, more explicit in his judgments, and he provides ten thousand things to think about as he waxes wise.  This collection reads fast.

Recently I read a memoir by Reynolds Price in which he said that she had written stories of the highest order, equal to Chekhov, Faulkner, Joyce and others. So I went looking for her collected stories in this new house of ours and found them right where I had placed them, fully intending to leave them there until we moved somewhere else and took them with us again.Now I've read them and would say that Price had it right. There are stories in this collection--""The Cracked Looking-Glass,"" ""Noon Wine,"" ""Pale Horse, Pale Rider""--as good as stories can get.Porter was born in Texas in 1890 and moved around quite a bit for the next 90 years. She wrote tales of farm children in Texas, communists in Russia, Irish immigrants in Connecticut, and rootless Europeans in Berlin that all have exceptional authenticity. ""The Leaning Tower,"" written in Berlin in 1931, is as close to anything I know predicting the catastrophe of Nazism before it reached its most virulent state.The power of Porter's stories lies not so much in their plots or ""what happens"" as in the firm power of her commanding sentences. She is amazingly able to capture psychological inflections in a few words or sum up the essence of a stage of life or convey the hardness of heart an old woman feels toward her old husband, whom she indifferently abandons. These sentences are stories in themselves and raise questions about the genre overall. Good writing is good writing, short or long.In a marvelous, multi-part tale called ""The Old Order,"" Porter paints an age through characters and generations not through plot. The tale goes nowhere and yet its portraiture is so exacting that it works beautifully in its peculiarly wandering, discursive way. It's hard to imagine a literary journal publishing it today because it is so long and pointless; by the same token, it is so superbly written that it is hard to imagine an editor not breaking all the rules and simply surrendering to the story, giving it the space it needs to be what it is, more or less the fictional equivalent of a Chekhov play.Porter remembered what she saw in train compartments, kitchens, restaurants, and old graveyards; she then recorded those impressions accurately, never letting the virtue of brevity force her into the betrayal of neglecting a telling detail. In a way she wrote stories the way D.H. Lawrence wrote stories, letting them blossom like an English garden, full of interesting things whose theme was totality more than unity. She was apparently unaffected by the modernist age in which she lived, but she wasn't old-fashioned.There's too much spice and candor in her work for that--no covering up the sins and passions and pettinesses of characters who are not at all more heroic or intriguing than the person sitting across from you on a subway car, but no less compelling, either.Thematically, there is a lot of disillusion and death in her work, but it is unsentimental stuff, not tragic stuff. Why wouldn't life wear a person out? Why wouldn't it scare a child? Why wouldn't it make a mother refuse to assume the blame for how her twelve children turned out?Hats off to Reynolds Price for reminding me why I've been carting this book around all these years....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Nov 07, 2015","Nov 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/129671.The_Collected_Stories_of_Katherine_Anne_Porter

It is a tale of prosecutorial abuse, police incompetence/complicity, university spinelessness, and stomach-turning undergraduate excess that culminated in a district attorney's disgrace and a dismissal of charges--after the students had been hounded out of school, subjected to faculty and student vituperation, and pilloried in local and national media for a crime they did not commit.The authors don't hide the fact that they have contempt for the political correctness that led to a widely accepted premise of guilty until proven innocent. Curiously, one of the main villains in the story, Durham, N.C. District Attorney Mike Nifong, receives extensive attention while remaining something of a blank. He seized on the rape allegation--virtually encouraged and developed it--to help him win votes in an election campaign. Clearly he was an arrogant, duplicitous prosecutor, but it's still difficult to understand his reality-denying downward spiral, bad judgment, cynicism, and self-destructive actions. Duke is a nationally prominent, well-endowed university, so this episode made news, generating a media loop that spun around and around for almost a year.

A renowned novelist, essayist and playwright who also taught English literature and writing at Duke, Price had a rich life to lose in his early 50s, and that's just about what happened. Attended by friends and caregivers below the level of M.D., he struggled mightily as his lower half ceased functioning and his upper spine scorched him like scorpion's tail. This account is gruesome but its horror is mitigated to some extent by Price's faith in his dream life and the obvious fact that what he describes is something he survived--otherwise he could not have written such a book.One especially valuable aspect of this medical tale is that it isn't told by a doctor. That makes it easier for mere mortals to identify with, and it also generates some well-deserved criticisms of doctors who were cold, clinical, and insensitive toward Price. He had a surgeon who gradually revealed how much he cared, but he also an oncologist who, like a number of doctors, fled from his failure to meet Price's needs.As Price's legs and excretory functions spun out of control and the pain exceeded 10 on a scale that should have stopped at 10, he spent long months under the ineffective spell of drugs like methadone, dangerous in itself. When his feet and legs swelled to the point of being squishy he was given diuretics that didn't work well either. What he needed was a pair of pressurized leggings that would push the fluids up out of his legs so that they could be eliminated.Somehow, at the halfway point in this journey (and he didn't know he was halfway home, he thought he might never reach home), Price managed to take up writing and then teaching again. And then he was bumped out of traditional Western medical care into the hands of the aforementioned hypnotist and biofeedback specialist. They, in company with unfailingly helpful nurses, orderlies and personal aides, focused on the mind element of the mind-body duality, and that's what gave Price control over his life, if not his lower half, again. He lived on to write not only this book but many others.I should think almost anyone would find this book fascinating. It's richly written, inherently dramatic, and emotionally compelling. A few doctors, perhaps many doctors, might argue that with their caseloads they simply can't be fully available to every patient--their job is to prescribe, cut, radiate, and so forth. But this is a lame excuse. We've all known compassionate doctors who recognize the anxiety we feel when confronted with the mysteries of our own bodies.

I understand it is widely considered one of the best books on Zen, specifically zazen, which is why I turned to it in the middle of a brief course I am taking at the Chapel Hill Zen Center in North Carolina.Kasho Uchiyama was somewhat unique in that he began his studies focused on Western philosophy and Christianity before deciding to become a Zen priest and eventually serving as the abbott of a Zen temple near Kyoto. As a consequence, he had a good handle on many of the left-brain tricks Western civilization plays in highlighting the analytic, rational dimensions of human experience at the expense of the right-brain's tendency to wander in the synthetic, irrational dimensions of experience that emphasize unity over division.His fundamental point, made repeatedly in different ways, is that Zen is the self being the self, meaning that that which we consider our individual self actually is indivisible from the interdependent totality of the universal self. I am inseparable from you, you from me, we from the wind, the present moment, and the peace of recognizing that the best way to understand this is through minimal exertion and ambition, i.e., through zazen, which is sitting quietly for forty and fifty minutes at a time in a certain posture that facilitates our observing the illusory nature of our thoughts coming and going, changing nothing.He draws on sayings of the Buddha and ancient Zen masters deftly, tells tales and recounts parables, and deals with the confusion that words inevitably generate by suggesting we practice zazen to experience the wordless moments that come before and between thoughts.The impact of the book definitely is enhanced by the collaborative translation efforts of Tom Wright, Jisho Warner, and Shohaku Warner. They give Uchiyama a relaxed, personal voice in English that reads almost like a transcript of someone simply thinking out loud.Real masters in a discipline are often this simple and direct. King Lear is more simply written than Hamlet, for example. This is known as ""old age style"" and can be found throughout the arts.A book about zazen is in some ways a non sequitur. As Uchiyama frequently points out, the issue is not really discussing zazen but rather sitting for ten years and then sitting for another ten years. That's when you come to understand the significance of sitting. Enlightenment or mental health or stress reduction are not on his agenda. To the contrary, he maintains that the more goal-oriented you are, aggrandizing your personal self, the less likely you will be to come into touch with the universal self. He contends that zen is more or less a godless religion but a religion nonetheless. The reason for this appears to be that he considers God to be what some others might think of as that fuzzy term, the Godhead, that is, the universal self from which we emerge and to which we return, life and death being a necessary continuum, more peaceful and compassionate and less disturbing when it is thought of as such. There is no apex in this continuum, no crisis, no heaven, no hell, simply an opportunity to pass from one's individual self into the aforementioned universal self.I'm in accord with William James on religions: if they have a positive effect on the believer or practitioner, good. This ""proves"" nothing about metaphysical reality in an empirical sense, but pragmatically, it suggests they ""work."" Almost all of us can tell when a believer or practitioner is happy and at peace. If you read this book, you will see that Uchiyama, whose life was not always easy, clearly found happiness and peace....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 16, 2015","Oct 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1010952.Opening_the_Hand_of_Thought

In some ways the best of them is “Brooksmith,” about a head butler who descends to the depths when the master whom he apparently was made to serve dies. After that comes “The Real Thing” about a socially threadbare couple desperate to find a way to make a living and finding that handsome though they are, they lack the spark and flair necessary to be good artist’s models. And then there is “Mrs.Medwin,” which is less about Mrs. Medwin than about Miss Cutter, an American who helps other Americans get a footing in the English social scene . . . for a fee, of course.But the subject of all these tales is the perennial Jamesian theme of social relations, upside down or downside up, and their essence is not really the story but rather James’s unflagging craftsmanship in turning almost any toy box into a museum quality collection. These are not “great” stories in the way that A Portrait of a Lady or “The Turn of the Screw” are great stories, but they are excellent examples of what a brilliant writer who wrote for a living can do when there is no great story to be written. The “lesser” James is better than most other writers because of his psychological acuity, his skill as a stylist, and his tempo in presenting scene after scene in such a way that a complete fiction comes together at just the right time.There are readers who probably could not care less about many of the characters in this collection who nonetheless will enjoy the way those characters are “worked up,” to use a Jamesian formulation. He is ironic but never unkind, penetrating but never excessively so. He has a knack for pinpointing the meaningful weaknesses of a figure without discrediting completely said figure’s innate dignity. In a sense James’s overarching purpose is to handle his work objectively but morally. He does not need war or political chicanery to hit this note because he is so deft in summoning the metaphors of war and political chicanery as he describes the antics of the drawing room, where ordinary people live subtly extraordinary lives in the works of a master.Don’t read this collection first if you are new to James.

In some ways there is no point in commenting on Nietzsche since he never refrains from commenting on himself and might as well be taken directly. We can always harm his work by attempting to summarize it, but what he is looking for in this volume (written directly after Thus Spake Zarathustra) is basically a recognition that we are the slaves of human customs and beliefs unless we dare to think outside the conventional framework, in this case, of good and evil, setting morality aside altogether and making direct contact with the will to power that lives within every breast but usually remains cooped-up there. To strive is noble, to change is essential, to not let oneself be encumbered by the pettiness of pygmies is so important than the rare masters of human experience don't even consider being less than bold and brave.At various points in this book Nietzsche seems to foreshadow quite clearly the branch of philosophy, or school of philosophy, called phenomenology, which I would explain in shorthand manner as the philosophy of perception. He is looking for, though he might not grin if he heard me say it, the nature of experiencing nature in the raw. I'd go further than that because it occurs to me that it's the best way I can express what reading Beyond Good and Evil is like, and that is as follows:Beyond Good and Evil is a kind of novel without characters, back stories, clear settings, plot or suspense. It is all the things one puts into a novel except the conventional form of book-length fiction. Every sentence is like what a character really means when he says something--here there are a multitude of chattering, nameless characters--and not what the character actually says-- that's left out. In fact, all the provocations and crises that provoke Nietzsche's non-characters to deal in meaning, not human back and forth, are left out. The reader gets the terminus of a dialogue wherein the first part of the dialogue isn't there. Nietzsche doesn't state assumptions, he doesn't waste time on expatiating on why he roars full blast against whatever irks him, he goes right into the slippery business of stating conclusions that are concentrated doses of his life's reflections and experiences.The consequence is that his writing may strike a reader as correct, but Nietzsche will not have justified his correctness. He does away with story in favor of denouement. There are no carefully worked out examples of what he means; there is no scientific history here. He says most men are slaves and find ways to justify their enslavement--that's morality, take it or leave it. And the few men who are masters are too busy riding their will to power to bother with morality, a hoax anyway.Roughly speaking this stripped-down novel is set in the landscape of Western civilization. It is Euro-centric. The United States isn't mentioned that I recall. Some references are made to India and China (Asia) that pack a punch, but again, without a carefully worked-out justification. This all is simply a condensate of what Nietzsche ""knows."" He lampoons Englishmen--Hume, Locke, those guys. He bops Pascal--way too religious. He says Plato invented a self-justifying view of life that celebrates, well, Plato. (But he praises Plato, too.)What Nietzsche does, both as philosopher and literary innovator, is deny not only the framework of morality (good and evil) but also the framework of genre. To get his meaning the reader has to pause frequently and think through what he might be referring to or why he might have written such and such a thing. Of course Nietzsche is brilliant enough to cast a direct, essentially phenomenological spell on the reader. His thunderbolts register. His quips bite. But his presumptuousness sometimes gets him into deep trouble. He writes some of the stupidest things about women I can recall reading; these comments are on a par with the vile idiocies of the otherwise brilliant Dostoevsky's vis-a-vis Jews. Curiously, Nietzsche's own supposed anti-Semitism is blown apart here. In a few paragraphs he lectures the woeful Europeans on why they ought to study, emulate and honor the Jews, a superior ""type.""But there you go: He's always talking about this type or that type. What does he mean by type? No definition. And how could someone as smart as Nietzsche fall prey to the nonsense of Lamarkian inherited characteristics? Types are a certain way because the generations have made them that way, have they? Well, this does sound suspiciously like D.H. Lawrence's later musings on things ""in the blood.""Sometimes Nietzsche allows himself to appear as a character in this book; often he demurs and simply predicts that those who will come later will do the real heavy lifting when it comes to hurling away the metaphysical, made-up stones of Western civilization that are suffocating us.Now, I have somewhat deliberately written this note in Nietzsche's own manner. I give few examples, few quotes, and yet feel free to summarize broadly, but the material is too dense to appreciate unless one actually reads it, not comments on it . . . and then one might not appreciate it at all, who knows?Nietzsche's real running mate when it comes to reconceptualizing the world is not a philosopher or a novelist at all. It's William Blake. Zarathustra and Nietzsche's aphoristic work illustrate this best, but there's a lot of Blake in this volume in that it challenges the reader to think the unthinkable, re-understand the old tales in unprecedented ways, dare to be artistically bold and self-confident. And indeed, as Nietzsche writes here, such a strategy can be and usually is personally catastrophic. Nietzsche self-published this volume; very few people read his work until long after his death. Blake suffered the same fate: too beautiful and powerful a thinker for his contemporaries.

Since they are determinedly fantastical and morbid, I suppose horror is the main ingredient, a horror that there is another world nearby, just across the northern border, where there are grotesque and inexplicable happenings and beings that somehow echo our daily existence and are, in fact, more real or authentic than our daily existence because we can barely see them but they apparently can see us.	Ligotti’s strengths are several. He writes extremely well in a story-telling, as opposed to story-showing, mode. By this I mean his sentences are vivid and strong and almost error-free in maintaining a distinctive tone and rhythm. They are comparable to Kafka in the sense that they powerfully understate the unbelievable, and that’s good, because the unbelievable needs to be whispered, not shouted. In addition, Ligotti’s tales are uniquely atmospheric; he creates wholly self-enclosed worlds that extend themselves, paragraph after paragraph, into deeper and deeper realms of the same thing, turning monotony (up to a point) into a virtue.	If Ligotti has a natural gift for a narrative arc, however, or an interest in a well-prepared “ending,” I can’t say I entirely grasp it. These stories are wonderfully detailed but more suggestive than conclusive. What one learns is what one would suspect all along: the secret-keepers on the other side of the northern border aren’t sharing their secrets, nor are they surrendering to rational interpretation.	So these are enactments, or performance art, meant, I would think, to fire up the reader’s imagination and engage her as a co-teller, someone who would infuse the reading experience with deeply personal anxieties and fears and suspicions.	Certain motifs recur: there are broken puppets, weird artifacts, recurrent bouts of indigestion, mysterious attics and mysterious basements. Doors, of course, are important. So are streets lined by tombstone-like buildings, evidently uninhabited and sometimes seemingly doorless and windowless.	When Ligotti needs to add communal ingredients to the mystery, he simply summons crowds of unintroduced friends of the narrator or inhabitants of the city or folks walking by who stop to watch the enigma stage a parade . . . or procession of the dead and dying.	I think a real Ligotti-lover would be someone who simply enjoyed his well-articulated vision and how it departs from the normal. This would not be someone who took horror seriously but rather someone interested in vacating the premises of quotidian reality.	It seems to me that Ligotti’s real claim and interest, again, has to do with how well and consistently he writes. He is not as ornate and melodious as Poe or as succinct and powerful as Kafka, but he is still like a hum, a drone, with an undeniably unsettling effect. There is no “other” world lying nearby, staring at us and bewildering us, except in work like Ligotti’s, but that raises the question, explicit in several stories, about whether art is more real than reality, likely to take us unawares in strange moments, insist on the truth of dreams, and convince us that we are right when we admit to ourselves that we really don’t know what’s going on as we conduct our daily affairs, barely conscious of what we’re conscious of and significantly unconscious of what we’re really thinking despite all evidence to the contrary. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 26, 2015","Sep 26, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2452401.Teatro_Grottesco

Their stCruisers by Craig Nova dwells principally within the worlds of Russell Boyd, a state trooper, and Frank Kohler, a computer repair specialist. Their stories are told in alternating sections, with an exception or two. Russell is on night patrols and living with a special needs teacher named Zofia. She’s lovely, accommodating, and worried about the dangers of Russell’s work. Her needs and demands are quiescent until midway through she discovers she’s pregnant and thinks it better to have an abortion than have a baby with a man in a line of work as dangerous as Russell’s. Russell is a stoic, deeply taken with Zofia, but a stoic, as many men are: he has a job to do.Frank Kohler is more of an internal exile. His tarty mother was murdered when he was a boy and he saw her body parts crammed into a box on the side of the river. He lives alone but has an explosive quality, searching for conflict. At the same time, he’s lonely, and so he proceeds to obtain a Russian bride named Katryna through an agency. Katryna meets his needs, but not her own. She, too, is pregnant and wants an abortion, perhaps because the father is still in Russia; his name is Dmitri, and when she beckons to him, he manages to visit and disrupt Frank’s marriage and bring the killer in Frank to the fore.This is a well-written, carefully paced story that provides a good natural background (New England in winter, dingy, dark, mucky) to the events that unfold when Frank and Russell ultimately have their foreshadowed encounter, which in itself is an elaborate and graphic scene on the side of a mountain somewhere near the Vermont/New Hampshire border.The writers who come to mind when one reads Nova are DeLillo and Auster, though Nova isn’t as arch in constructing a rationale for his noirish tale: he finds it along the highways lined with Mr. Tire stores and Burger Kings and enlivens it just a bit with a foray into fox hunting.Generally, Nova writes close to the skin of his tale without being minimalist or cute. His characters notice things, scents, colors, patterns of clouds in the sky; they’re fairly direct with one another when they tell the truth and when they lie.At the end, after the crescendo, there’s an odd chapter that dips into an unsolved subplot and resolves it. I suppose it’s there because Nova wants to illustrate the fact that bad things will continue to go on despite the main story’s brutal climax, and Russell is still wedded to his work, looking for meaning in the thought processes of a state trooper engaged with yet another villain—it’s how he interprets or decodes reality, what he’s “about,” I suppose. How he got this way other than time on the job isn’t made clear, but he’s convincingly committed to what he does, and there is a way in which keeps the moral order of the universe under control. Otherwise guys like Frank and women like Katryna would just disruptively “happen,” and screw up a lot of lives in the process....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2015","Sep 23, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/556549.Cruisers

The core triangle of Jake, Sara (his girlfriend), and Jake’s father is amazingly stable and deep at each angle. Sara’s adolescent interest in outlandish scheming is a wonderfully amusing emblem of her fundamental insecurity about life and herself. She’s evasive and compelling. Jake’s father, another male stoic, but a generous one, gently lets his wife drift away into New Age folly. Jake somehow manages to become a persuasively talented astronomer, giving him a rescue route at the end of the book when his father and Sara ultimately leave him on his haunted path into the loneliness of a universe that is speeding, according to Einstein’s disputed constant, away from itself.At the outset, the novel is a funny suburban satire. It then loses its humor when Sara is placed in a series of detention facilities. The focus on Jake’s career takes center stage, then he gets a job back east to be near his father, and a hilarious robbery at a Radio Shack brings Sara back into the picture. She’s trouble, and knows it, but even though her series of misadventures veer close toward a caricature of how her rotten associates secretly run the world, Jake’s steady appraisal of what transpires (bolstered by Nova’s artful prose and gift for pace and description) keeps the mishaps and implausibilities under control. A reader could say, “No, no, a father dying of painful cancer can’t push that far into the woods on a trout-fishing expedition while being pursued by crooks and thugs,” but the details of those woods, the trees, the insects, the behavior of trout, the varying light of day from sunrise to sunset push incredulity aside.It’s not easy to have it both ways: exploring the morality of alienation and the morality of affection at the same time.

He examines the depravity of war clinically. He is superb in recounting the stupidity of a divided Cyprus and the avarice of the diamond trade, both licit and illicit.When Junger writes about war, particularly in Afghanistan, he's superb. He provides the grain and gore of conflict, and he swiftly contextualizes it in cascades of bad policy decisions that turned innocent populations into fresh layers of dust on lands they once owned.My favorite quote from Chekhov is, ""Gentlemen, why do you live your lives so stupidly?""

Why You Should Read Auden:--Auden was a master of virtually all poetic forms employed in English.--Auden's range extended from the melancholy to the cheeky.--Auden made poetry out of everyday life and friendships.--Auden's Dichtung und Wahrheit is a marvelous exploration of the complex statement we all make at one time or another: ""I love You.""--Auden's poem, ""In Memory of Sigmund Freud,"" underscores a fundamental fact about his poetry: he had thought through and gained command over virtually every dimension of human experience.--Auden was not afraid to write biting verse about contemporary issues while preserving poetic distance and form (not giving in to shocking ranting, for example.)--Auden's classical frame of reference could be challenging, but he still managed to write more directly and clearly than T.S. Eliot, whose mantle he was thought to have donned upon Eliot's departure from the scene.--Auden managed to be intelligent in virtually every line he wrote; the connective tissue between his perceptions was his gift for analysis and valuation.--Auden both embraced and transcended his homosexuality, normalizing the facts and truths.II. Why You Should Not Read Auden--Auden's been dead a long time now, so who cares?--Poetic forms have been dead for a long time now, so who cares?--Any poet who is ironically passionate about his passions isn't passionate enough to be passionate about.--A poet who doesn't serve up the same stuff all the time cannot be trusted--did Auden ever have a thought he didn't transform into a line of poetry?--Auden wasn't really the heir to Eliot, and he'd say so himself, challenging the notion of heirs altogether.--Who has time for poetry that has a consistently gentle Olympian quality to it? I mean, who knows who Aphrodite and Achilles were? And again, who cares? Talk about dead, they were never even alive!--Auden might have been gay, but he still was a male WASP who spent a lot of time at Oxford.--Philip Larkin, the most overrated of English poets, has made perfectly clear that he thought Auden was overrated.--Where did Auden come up with this Dictung und Warheit idea anyway? Who was Goethe? How do you even pronounce a name spelled like that?--And he didn't stop at memorializing Sigmund Freud, he carried on about Henry James, as well.

Thereupon Toole's mother took the manuscript to Walker Percy, the novelist, and he was so enthused about it that he arranged for LSU to publish it and it won the Pulitzer Prize.It's not that hard to classify this picaresque book. It reads like Flannery O'Connor on steroids, which is how Thomas Pynchon's V reads and how Ken Kesey's One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest reads and how Catch-22 reads. Literature meets comic book.

Toole was a satirist, but what was he satirizing? He had a wonderful touch with black English, New Orleans style, and he captures the phantasmagoria that is New Orleans spectacularly, but A Confederacy of Dunces just goes on and on until the most unlikely of saviors appears to execute the mercy killing. End of book.Last week when I started reading, I was mumbling to family and friends that I thought I'd finally caught up with the hullabaloo about A Confederacy of Dunces. This week I'm retracting my suggestions that others read it.The pity and tragedy is that Toole was so wildly gifted that he wanted the novel published as he wrote it and couldn't bring himself to revise it sufficiently to enter the comic pantheon of Pynchon, Heller, Kesey, and let's add Vonnegut. That apparently led to a manic-depressive's fatal decline. By this point probably no one but me will risk criticizing a one-book wonder's masterpiece, but I confess I'm hard-hearted about literature.

I'll focus on a few elements that intrigued me most.Foucault, like Nietzsche, was a profound student of the classical world. His scope of knowledge is breathtaking. As he said in one of his interviews, this was attributable to the fact that he worked like a dog. (Others, like Solzhenitsyn and Kant, were just as assiduous in researching and analyzing things that intrigued them; all they did was work. And so, too, almost, Foucault.) I found his observations on the care of the self in the classical world most compelling. He argued convincingly that from Socrates to Seneca to Marcus Aurelius various forms of self-contemplation were disciplines like sitting zazen. Seneca, for instance, would devote hours to the solitary contemplation of his death. He also carried on epistolary relations in which he regarded understanding his own ethics and motivations as crucial to his existence. The Socrates we receive from Plato did the same thing but right out on the streets of Athens, challenging acquaintances with the question: What are you doing to know yourself?What's intriguing here is that self-preoccupation, narcissistic behavior, is both commonplace and criticized today. We think we ought to think about others, not ourselves. This may be a Christian corruption of human possibility, for how can we think about others if we do not first think about ourselves? Ethics, Foucault contended, are the foundation of freedom, or its prerequisite, and ethics in the classical world meant self-knowledge, self-mastery, a refined sense of judgment about what one ought to do to play one's responsible role in one's home and city. Without perfecting oneself (an impossible task) one could not be free (an impossible condition), one would always be hostage to the darker corners of one's soul.Foucault's interest in homosexuality has proven prophetic. He argued that real progress for homosexuals, like himself, would be to move beyond the chance, passionate encounter to more enduring forms of friendship energized by the erotic but not chattel to it. This year in America we have fully entered the realm of gay marriage. Foucault understood that that was where gays really wanted to go, deeply wanted and needed to go--perhaps not to marriage, per se, but to unchallenged lasting relationships, not subject to unjust laws and social opprobrium. And here we are, with so many homosexuals coming not out of the closet as homosexuals but as pairs and partners who have been hidden away sometimes for decades.Foucault's mode of thought is difficult to grasp unless one accepts it as interested in the dynamic and the relational. In other words, he was an historian/philosopher of transformations, not truths. Thus, there is no fixed point in his work; in fact, he rejected fixed points. To Foucault knowledge was not static. All knowledge was relative but within hard won frameworks of understanding. This was not ""anything goes."" Far from it: it hinged on assiduous examination and deep reflection. Truth might be mutable--had to be mutable--but it was not accidental or capricious.I realize this comment is exceedingly abstract, but so was Foucault, who warrants continuing attention....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 27, 2015","Aug 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80379.Ethics

But the focus is on Ronnie Williamson, convicted of a murder he did not commit.We know this from the title and blurb matter on the covers of the book, so this is not a “thriller,” as advertised, nor is it a “true-crime story” because the central crime in question is narrowly focused by the local district attorney, in a town called Ada, on Ronnie, who was innocent. And this is apparent from the outset.So this is a narrative of a gross miscarriage of justice. It is a tale of a prosecutor and a police force prepared to use coerced confessions, paid-off jailhouse snitches, irrelevant witnesses, and unscientific evidence to “get someone convicted” and settle Ada down after two brutal murders of young women.Beyond that, it is a study of appalling legal defense, judges who are not current with Supreme Court decisions (or don’t care), and correctional officials indifferent to Ronnie’s mental and physical condition.Once a fabulous high school baseball player and major league prospect, Ronnie injures himself, underperforms, and is cut from the A’s and the Yankees. He turns to drinking, drugs, and chasing women, but a key development that Grisham doesn’t highlight at the right moment in the story is that he develops schizophrenia—a mental condition that often suddenly appears in a victim’s early twenties (or a bit later). Along with schizophrenia Ronnie develops bipolar disorder, paranoia, mania, and a range of associated disorders. When the first young girl is brutally murdered, he already has made a mess of his life in Ada and appears to be a likely suspect, fingered most heavily by the actual killer.Interestingly, the fact that Grisham makes this clear does not damage the forward momentum of the narrative. There’s no suspense, in a sense, just wonderment at the concatenation of mishaps that are inflicted upon Ronnie (and a buddy, also convicted of murdering Debbie Carter) and brought upon himself by himself.Grisham writes in a succinct, realist style with short sentences, short passages within chapters, and short chapters. Occasionally he intrudes in editorial wonderment at the wretched mistakes of the police, prosecutor, judges, and correctional authorities who ruin twelve years of Ronnie’s life, fail to admit that he is mentally incompetent to defend himself or cooperate with a lawyer, and simply watch as his mind and body deteriorate.Oklahoma’s forensic science establishment skewers itself with unjustified arrogance (along with spending years on getting around to reporting erroneous results). Meanwhile Ronnie languishes in jails and then on Death Row, which is modernized to make it an even worse place to hold prisoners (in underground cells with no windows and no ventilation.) Grisham’s research appears solid. He captures and renders details, especially of life on Death Row, succinctly and efficiently. He never overwrites (perhaps because he does not have to), but in a sense this book is a report that lacks novelistic depth. We really don’t know much about the prosecutor’s motivations, the judges’ incompetence, the pliability of the police. What we have are facts, information, sequences that sum up how things went for Ronnie or his mother or his alleged accomplice, at given points over the years.Comparable books would be The Executioner’s Song by Norman Mailer and In Cold Blood by Truman Capote. Both are much more powerfully written, but both go further into crimes really committed by the actual killers. Ronnie, not having killed anyone and not being of sound mind, becomes a screeching machine of “I’m innocent! I didn’t kill anyone! I didn’t even know Debbie Carter!”Ultimately Ronnie is given 30 days before his execution (here we have some actual suspense) and then a public service lawyer aiding the indigent heroically files an appeal so powerful that a federal judge orders a retrial. This offers valuable insight into a judge’s chambers at that level. As always, Grisham shines in recounting legal procedures, ethically driven reconsideration, and biases.The judge in question doesn’t like these last minute appeals. He turns Ronnie’s over to an assistant who turns it over to an assistant who can’t believe what she’s reading and gets the whole office involved in persuading the judge to overcome his bias. Good stuff. Here we have the real heroes of the story, about whom we might like to know more (or I would).Then comes the famous Innocence Project and the development of effective and conclusive use of DNA analysis. Neither Ronnie nor his buddy have left any of their DNA on the victim or in her apartment. In fact, the relevant DNA sample comes from the individual who fingered Ronnie in the first place.This account of a brutal miscarriage of justice is powerful and painful. Its low-key, factual tone probably helps it more than a higher-register, more eloquent rendering would. The story is an emblem of the vagaries of our system of justice that persist in 2015. In a sense, we are reading about the relative value of ethics versus success in America. Ethics should be but are often not more important than getting a conviction, wrapping things up, and moving on. As the federal judge observes in his call for a retrial, Woe betide us if men and women are condemned to die in this country without a fair trial, safeguarded by the Constitution.So The Innocent Man is a tale more of hypocrisy and indifference to the law on the part of the justice system than on the part of falsely accused and railroaded so-called criminals. We are informed more than thrilled or held in suspense. The facts chastise us. Again, Grisham doesn’t explore the realm of human depravity and frailty as deeply as Mailer or Capote; he’s a good writer if not a superb writer; but he knows how to capture a reader far, far from Ada, Oklahoma, and take her there to witness not what might have happened but what actually happened.The Innocent Man raises the question of the death penalty—and Oklahoma’s distinctive enthusiasm for it—in different ways. It turns out some criminals on Death Row even believe in it and not all of them insist they’re innocent. We go back to the federal judge’s concern, however. Who are we if we make a mistake executing an innocent man?In a global context, the United States’ practice of the death penalty is almost always number one in surveys of other peoples’ negative views of us. The death penalty is administered in some other countries, but generally countries that are comparable to the U.S. in terms of political, economic and social development abhor the practice.The Innocent Man illustrates the horrors of the death penalty as well as any book I have read. Once it is in play, from the jury box forward, it engenders a poisonous and callous contempt for individuals who are still human beings and often are still innocent despite being “proven” guilty....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 24, 2015","Aug 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5345.The_Innocent_Man

My teacher, like most classics teachers, found him indispensable. The proposition he put was twofoldIn high school I read Cicero in third year Latin. My teacher, like most classics teachers, found him indispensable. The proposition he put was twofold:Cicero was a master of Latin prose (very difficult to translate because of his long, complex sentences) and Cicero was a defender of a republic that was more than worth saving--for after Cicero, the republic became an empty, corrupt dictatorship that only went through the motions of giving all citizens a voice and protecting their rights.My impressions many years later are twofold: Cicero was one of the earliest political actors/philosophers who defined what we still understand as conservatism, and Cicero, like many Roman writers, worked in the shadow of the genius of Greece.Cicero's conservatism rested on two pillars as well: respect for Rome's religious practices and respect for Rome's system of government, wherein the aristocracy held the upper hand, the plebeians had some protections, and the general administration of state -- through the Republic and the first emperor /dictator Augustus --was efficient and effective.If we look at Cicero's take on religion in these two tracts (especially the laws) what we see is the conservatism of ritual, not belief. Most people interested in the classical world ask themselves at some point whether sophisticated men and women could have believed in the myths and legends of Olympus or Romulus being suckled by a wolf. I think it's safe to say that few aristocrats did believe. Instead, they promoted ritual observances and religious law as a means of stabilizing a society where the vast majority were subordinate to a tiny minority. At best Cicero held up religion as William James ultimately did: if it works for you, fine; no one can disprove it. So Cicero employed religion as a means of preserving a social structures that had been hollowed out.On the political front, Cicero deeply honored history and believed in its great figures more than he believed in the gods. What he feared was that he was a minority, and that the greatness of Rome, having learned to govern itself without a king, was in free fall. His optimum form of government, therefore, happened to be Rome's history. He was not a Platonist, proposing what never was and never could be. But he was every bit as conservative and elitist as Plato. The wisdom of Rome, for him, was how it used various offices to reflect what he termed the highest justice, i.e., the justice of the natural order. This is a backward looking posture, hingeing on the notion that the one thing divine about humanity is reason, a spark from the gods. Untethered reason, of course, can lead anywhere, but not if it is linked to the wisdom of Zeus, or Jupiter. Then it must come up with a balanced approach to human existence that fends off chaos, accumulates power, wealth and land, and preserves the necessary prerogatives of, in Cicero's case, the Roman Senate.From our perspective 2000 years later we can see that Rome was astonishingly great, even majestic, and that at the height of its powers, it used its power in appalling ways, conquering the Mediterranean and much of western Europe to feed its insatiable appetite so that the rich could become richer and the powerful, ultimately, could become lunatic. The descent from Tiberius through Caligula, Claudius, and Nero was nauseating. Cicero was right back in the days of Pompey and Julius Caesar. Rome was on a precipice, and the free fall was about to begin.Today, in America, conservatism clings hard to God as a living reality and it clings equally hard to history, notably the Founding Fathers, and the Constitution, which has Biblical sanctity that should be read as it was written, not reinvented to accommodate later circumstances. Here we have the Judeo-Christian / Roman approach to standing pat in yesterday. A third element, the market, has been brought in to deal with America's immense complexity, but it functions, as we have seen, more in the interests of the conservative rich -- keeping their wealth--than in the interests of the more liberal poor (although not all poor folk in America are liberal; many are so traditionally religious that they cannot help being conservative in the broadest sense.)Rome was a formal empire in its ultimate decline. America has been an informal empire since the Monroe Doctrine. Does this mean America will decay, too? I tend to think not necessarily, but as I write, the polarization between conservatives and liberals is breathtaking. Conservatives tend to be the anti-scientific party (as in global warming isn't real and maybe evolution isn't real and research with stem cells is sinful.) Liberals tend to be more forward-looking but less well-endowed and more unfocused, lacking the conservatives' deep faith in the constitution and the Bible. They fear the future less and cherish the past less. There is unlikely to be a sweeping, final win by one of these forces over the other, but that is good.

I was skeptical, bA political junkie friend of mine gave me this thick biography of Hillary Clinton published in 2007, telling me it was a good book. I was skeptical, but he was right. It's well-written, well-researched, balanced and yet painful to read because of its detailed account of Hillary Clinton's grim experiences married to Bill Clinton.Hillary Rodham was a smart, take-charge girl who grew up under the heavy thumb of a brutish boor of a father and seemed determined--was determined, I should say--to prove that neither he nor life nor anything could keep her down. She excelled in school, in volunteer political work, in college and law school, and in the early phases of her post-education life, pursuing matters of policy that mattered to her: social justice, children's rights, gender equality, civil rights, and opposing the war in Vietnam. She was not a radical feminist or leftist or anything of the kind. She believed in principles, but she also believed in reason, problem-solving, and dialogue.Along came Bill Clinton and she fell, as we know, madly in love with him, but she hesitated to marry him for a long time. She already knew, everyone knew, that Bill had a thing about fooling around. But he persisted in courting her, and he was brilliant and they agreed on the need for progressive political change. So they got hitched.In a way, Hillary locked herself into an emotionally abusive marriage very similar to her emotionally abusive upbringing. Bernstein doesn't quite say it this way, but there it is. Bill was a test as her father was a test, and no matter how long it took, Hillary was going to pass that test.As Bernstein presents it, the Clintons' cohort considered Hillary as likely to succeed on a national scale as Bill when they were starting out. In some ways, she was better known, and in some ways, she had more political experience, including an intense Washington experience as a staffer on the Senate committee investigating Watergate. But she married Bill, went to Arkansas and passed up a lot of personal opportunities that a more assertive feminist would have seized. Meanwhile, Bill ascended the political ladder from state attorney general to governor, and Hillary had Chelsea and succeeded as an attorney in Little Rock. All the time, however, Bill was wandering, skirmishing with skirts, presenting her with the kinds of challenges she'd been born into: the double bind of loving your father and knowing he is contemptible and loving your husband and knowing he is contemptible, too.Real agony began toward the end of Bill's governorship and intensified in The White House, where Hillary started out making an incredible series of missteps,most significantly bungling national health care even though, smart as she was, she understood the needs and issues as well as or better than anyone.Hillary struck people as bossy, arrogant, and indifferent to the cultural norms of Washington. She assumed she had been elected right along with Bill (Bill thought so, too), but that's not the way it works. There can only be one president at a time even though several hundred people in Washington think that the president ought to be him or her . . . and they didn't think it ought to be Hillary. I frankly cringed as I read about how she treated senior White House staff and Cabinet members. Inevitably, she flamed out in the biggest failure of her life--her national health care proposal was, as they say on Capitol Hill, d.o.a. (dead on arrival.)But that humiliation was just the beginning. There really was (and still is) a vast right wing conspiracy gunning for the Clintons. Whitewater led to Vince Foster's suicide led to Paula Jones led to Monica Lewinsky. Each stop along the way was brutal for Hillary (and Bill, too, but this book is about Hillary).She didn't give in completely because, I think, she had that determination forged in her as a child, a commitment to the same kind of policies as Bill, and a degree of religious faith that might be news to people who have not read this book. Christianity, in fact, is something she has thought about as much as she has thought about health care or education or social justice. It has given her the strength to endure having her privacy and family ripped asunder.Hillary would despair but not give in. She would consider giving in a gift to enemies who did not deserve that gift, so she would rebound, strategize, and re-engage her excellent mind in the eight year battle that was Bill's presidency.Why anyone would sacrifice as much as she did is a good question. In fact, why anyone would want to be president is a good question. A life led at that level does not have to be sordid, but it is fraught with constant pressure, demands, uncertainties, and tests of one's moral compass.Bernstein's book ends with a kind of coda. Hillary escaped Bill's shadow to a certain extent when she ran for and won a senate seat while still First Lady. The degree to which he incinerated himself freed her. She became a thoughtful, courteous, deferential junior senator, but of course, she still had that national standing, which set her apart no matter what she did to observe the senate's written and unwritten rules. And she also had the drive and determination and intelligence that made people think, back in the 60s and 70s, that she would be even more likely to succeed than Bill.Going beyond Bernstein's book, we know Hillary ran for president, wouldn't give in to Obama's obvious victory in the campaign for the Democratic nomination for the longest time (she just isn't built to give in), and then served as a reasonably effective Secretary of State.When she left State (where I worked, too), I thought she was beat, flat-out exhausted, and I was right about that, but I was wrong when I said that she wouldn't have an appetite to campaign for president again. Persisting, unable to yield to her frailties or her foes, Hillary is on the trail again.Fortunately for her, she has learned a lot since her disastrous time as First Lady. She is incomparably prepared to assume the presidency. No competing aspirant knows more about America or the world. Indeed, she may return to The White House, where she will try to run a progressive administration, a problem-solving administration, though probably not an elevating, eloquent, visionary administration because she is a pragmatist and might realize that simply being the first woman elected as president is inspirational enough.Back to Bernstein: Though well-written, this is such a painful and detailed tale that it probably is a book for political junkies, not folks who like light reads. Its relevance today is the account it offers of someone who may be the next president. At times, Bernstein's editor should have insisted on smoothing out the narrative flow, but that's a quibble. I'll give it four stars.

The First Man is an unfinished manuscript Camus was working I thought I had read all of Albert Camus's novels--turns out I was right and I was wrong. The First Man is an unfinished manuscript Camus was working on at the time of his death. It's fairly long for a book by Camus, but based on his notes, it would have been much longer in the final version.Here we have a bildungsroman that is told from Jacques's perspective as a boy and, intermittently, as a 40-year-old man. The novel is written in great detail, all the peculiarities of being French in Algeria--and poor--and all the solemn facts of being poor and fatherless, growing up with a demanding grandmother, a slow-witted uncle, and a half-deaf mother, whom Jacques adores.Algiers is depicted as rough, sun-blasted and coastal. The French are surrounded, naturally, by Arabs, and they are living a shadow life-- a life shadowed by the presence of a France many of them never have seen, although that is where Jacques's father died in WWI.Jacques wins a scholarship to the lycée, which totally changes his life, but from the extant manuscript we can only guess how much since the 40-year-old is a sophisticated fellow with a penetrating moral vision that encompasses not only the contradictions of France and Algeria but also the contradictions of men and women, rich and poor, and war and peace.From the remaining notes, also published in this edition, one can see that Jacques would have lived a complicated life, half on one side of the Mediterranean and half on the other. He would have been accomplished, thoughtful, a devout lover of certain women, and always mindful that the woman he loved the most, his mother, was beyond his reach, as he, on entering the lycée is beyond hers.My thought is that this long manuscript is somewhat like Stephen Hero, Joyce's first version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. That manuscript, too, was ultimately highly compressed, as I would expect Camus to have compressed this one.This partial book is compassionate in the sense that all the characters are given their due; Jacques is aware of all their sacrifices, as well as their shortcomings. And yet he loves them all, and that accounts for the detailed rendering of his family life and his life as a boy among comrades, racing about the streets, exploring the beach, and having, before the lycée, essentially no knowledge of anything beyond his immediate sense perceptions.The concept of ""The First Man"" is a way of conceptualizing everyone as the first person in his or her life, in his or her world. Here we have the essence of the bildungsroman, the awakening to cause and effect, consequences, economic differences, and the nature of relationships between human beings.Oddly, the synthetic notes appended to this manuscript are more eloquent than the extremely well-written manuscript itself. They sum things up. They point to the conflicts that will emerge between the French and the Arabs, and they also suggest ways in which a second or third generation Frenchman born in Algeria is an Algerian, not a Frenchman, a person who must accept the duality of the self and others as the French, in their Cartesian way, tend not to, emphasizing the unity of France (where all students study the same school lessons at the same time all over the country.)I would recommend this book to almost anyone for the graphic quality of its writing and for the insights it offers into a writer's process. What cannot be seen here, which can only be imagined, is the aesthetic choices Camus ultimately would have made in rendering Jacques's tale more compact and comprehensible. As in The Stranger, the sun is a constant companion here, but Jacques is no morally insensible, anesthetized protagonist. He is sweetly real, vulnerable, intelligent, and sensitive. He wants to see the sun, to be in the sun, so he can see more and more of what the sun, light, reveals about life. Some mysteries are enfolded in the embrace of his father's grave (he never knew him), but others, with the glittering intensity of the North African sun's help, come clear: a man can be aware of everything, but he cannot be everything. Writers torture themselves over this point. They want to write faster than they can live so that they can have it all before they die.Unfortunately for us, Camus died young, and here we have only a portion of his final thoughts about what it means to be alive.P.S.

In this book, he writes about a figure, Mensonge, who was elusively not present, almost never spotted, and yet allegedly produced the greatest philosophical tract of the century...if in fact he did produce it ... if in fact anything written can be termed great.Mensonge reads like witty, erudite, academic stand-up comedy. For reasons that remain difficult to grasp Structuralism and Deconstructionism tended to replace traditional ""philosophy,"" particularly the branch known as epistemology with indefiniteness and uncertainty, including uncertainty about whether authors wrote texts or texts wrote authors and whether authors (and others) were the subjects of their own lives (or the toys of crushing powers that had mastered the art of preserving their powers.)There's a weird lucidity to this full-scale, tongue-in-cheek attack on the French and their postulates designed to liberate the powerless from the powerful (by denying subjective authority to everyone).

Something like that.The pleasure of the book lies in the acrobatic slithering of the writing across the face of Italy, noir movies, a California childhood, and towards the end, a giveaway mention of experiences in the dimension of lit (I'll return to this in a moment). Reading it reminded me of Pynchon, Bolaño, Rushdie and William Gass. That's good company. Pynchnon, Bolaño and Rushdie for the over-the-top fascination with the culture of things, references, theories, and implicit self-mockery. Gass for the better spells of moderated lyricism.But still, this volume (coming back to lit again) has a borrowed feeling about it, all the right shots of Italy, gorgeous memories of girlfriends, and references to Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum. These are more or less exactly what a thin layer of recent culture, be it hip or cool or up or down, would hold dear . . . what a hothouse -bred, super-grade MFA writer would whip out to mystify and outrun his readers . . . what an autobiographer would offer as a non-life because all of it, really, is a kind of nothing, simile instead of substance, wisecracks instead of wisdom.Where the author himself stands in all this, I am not sure. This is a droll book, for sure. As they used to say (and I don't know if they still say it), it is on to itself, it doesn't let itself get away with its feints and tricks. But again, the self-mockery does not feel real; it feels hyped--talent too much in love with its gift for rendering emptiness, dead ends, and the experience of traveling all over the world and getting nowhere....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2015","Jul 23, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1296786.The_Face

This is one of them. The name Saxe Commins rang a bell--one of a generation of great editors during the 30s, 40s, Used book stores contain treasures. This is one of them. The name Saxe Commins rang a bell--one of a generation of great editors during the 30s, 40s, and 50s--and so for $2 I bought it. I just checked on Amazon to make sure it's still available there, and yes, it is, so if you are interested in the work of an editor who worked closely with Eugene O'Neill, William Faulkner, Sinclair Lewis, and many others, I would recommend purchasing it.Commins' s wife Dorothy combined her own memories, Commins's notes and letters, letters from many authors and publishers, and created a short book with deep insight into the hidden work of an author's alter ego. Perhaps today such editors are scarce, but in Commins's day, editorial work often included the closest, almost familial, kind of labor in giving birth to whatever an author was trying to say--and get it said well.The major stories here are two: Commins's engagement with the three Nobel Prize winners named above.The O'Neill story is the most compelling. O'Neill was an established dramatist when Commins came along, but they soon became virtual best friends, someone O'Neill trusted implicitly. In the period leading up and through Long Day's Journey into Night, Commins would travel to wherever O'Neill was living (he moved around a lot) and literally type his handwritten manuscripts, ing O'Neill's words with him as he proceeded.I'm not O'Neill's greatest fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed insights into his work process. He often took notes, made character sketches, framed scenes, etc., in word counts up to 100,000 before deciding a play idea would not succeed. He sometimes wrote plays for his own private enjoyment. In the case of Long Day's Journey into Night, he famously wrote a will forbidding it be published or performed until 25 years after his death. Commins and Random House were to ensure this.But O'Neill's disastrous marriage to a sometimes psychotic harridan self-named Carlotta Monterrey, detailed in horrifying depth here, enabled his will to be violated within two years after he was gone. The negative impact on Commins and Bennett Cerf was palpable. They declined to do what Carlotta insisted as executrix, so the play, O'Neill's masterpiece, was brought out by Yale University Press. Commins, by this time, had long since been banned from contact with his good friend by Carlotta with no family, friends, or supporters present.The sickening intimacy with greatness manifested itself in the case of Sinclair Lewis, too. Here poor Lewis, world-renowned, considered himself the loneliest man on earth. And he was lonely, not just making it up. He'd move and invite friends to visit, but the visits inevitably came to an end, and that left the author facing the blank page by himself again and again. During one period, Commins not only edited Lewis's work, but he also exchanged visits with him several times a week in the evening (they both lived in New York at the time). The point was to keep Red, as he was known, company and let him win at chess now and then. Commins couldn't fix Red's existential misery, but he was a good guy, a good friend.Many other authors from W.H. Auden to Irwin Shaw to John O'Hara were touched by Commins' blue pencil. They all had large egos, Auden's the best of them, O'Hara the worst of them.Then along came William Faulkner. I have read almost all of Faulkner's work, taught it (even taught his grandson ""The Bear), and know a lot about him, but the portrait of Faulkner here is as good as any I have read. Commins took Faulkner in on trips north, visited him in Mississippi, and basically was ""family."" The featured piece in this book is Faulkner's flop, in my opinion, A Fable. He apparently thought a) he was running out of gas but b) A Fable was the biggest and best book he had ever undertaken. Commins's view on this isn't clear, but of course, an editor of a work in progress is not going to take his author down a peg. To the contrary, he'll try to push him up a peg, or several pegs, and that's what Commins did for Faulkner, dealing with his alcoholism, his sartorial needs for receiving the Nobel Prize, and spreading manuscript all over his dining room so that he and Faulkner could debate where something fit, where it didn't, and where it was lacking.If you are intrigued by the behind the scenes of literary publishing and still revere its mid-century giants, this is a book worth reading. Editors often get a bad rap (though not as bad as agents) in part because they have to pass on so much work and sometimes make howling mistakes. Commins is not presented as error-free here, but he does come through as an exemplar of flexible support, sternness where necessary, and deep sympathy with writers wrestling with their demons. These days I would venture that no publishing house could afford to devote a senior editor so fully to its authors, Nobel-prize winning or not. More to the point, being bottom-line corporations, the remaining New York publishers would not, as a matter of principle, let intimacy and allegiance suck up so much staff time.Well, things were different then. It's nice to read about how things were, even though much of this book reveals the pain of the literary life as opposed to the fleeting moments of triumph.The absolute killer coda to the entire book is Faulkner's telegram of condolence to Commins's wife when Commins died. It read in full: THE FINEST EPITAPH EVERYONE WHO EVER KNEW SAXE WILL HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT QUOTE HE LOVED ME UNQUOTE BILL FAULKNER.Commins was that kind of guy. He appears to have worked himself to death in support of others' genius.P.S. For some reason Goodreads insists on indicating that I give this book 3 stars. In fact, I give it 4, not that I think this star business is as important as a written evaluation that gives readers much more information about whether to read a book or pass it by....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 21, 2015",not set,"Jul 21, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3131977-what-is-an-editor

As always, Updike displays his astoThis is an erratic, unsuccessful novel that demonstrates that great writing is not enough to generate great books. As always, Updike displays his astonishing eye for detail--and couples it with an unusually thoughtful approach to American history--but the parts do not add up to a whole despite twenty pages at the end that serve to complete, or partially save, the text surprisingly well.Here we have one Alf, an historian obsessed with James Buchanan (the only president from Pennsylvania) conflating his failed attempts to write a unique book about Buchanan with his failed attempt to carry off an affair with another man's wife (while abandoning his own and his children.) All this occurs during Gerald Ford's presidency, hence the title, but Ford gets little play here.Written in the weakly comic form of a memo to a New England historical association, Alf sometimes reflects on Genevieve, his lover, and their affair, and sometimes offers long historical reflections on Buchanan. There's no one-to-one correspondence between the two parallel stories, just some interstitial ice-dancing by Alf in his attempts to combine the two.That said, once the lugubrious Buchanan finally achieves the presidency and is faced with the trouble brewing in South Carolina, the actual history here is interesting--as well-informed and better written than similar pieces by Gore Vidal (Burr, etc.). And Alf's broader reflections on his own self-indulgent behavior and the haplessness of contemporary American culture and politics reflect Updike's deep, amused interest in almost everything from the fashions of the day to the performance of Volvos to the varieties of religious experience to be obtained by munching on the part of a woman that is to be found between her legs.Just reading Updike is to ask yourself how much you miss in a given day that he always captures and puts to use. It is also, in this particular book, to be exposed not only to his supple intellect but also to his firm judgment. He was a devout middle-of-the-roader, perhaps accounting for his interest in the sorely tried Buchanan (caught between north and south). For him (Updike's gone now), the sky was never quite falling and yet bliss--especially the sexual kind of bliss--was dependably transient. The amount of research Updike must have put into generating this novel is somewhat mind-boggling. Even though Buchanan, like Alf, is not an interesting character in and of himself, his times, more than Alf's times, were interesting. Romance was not so easy back in the 19th century, gossip was more harmful, and one had to be more careful of one's reputation. By the same token, politics had a certain dignity and formality--and skullduggery, one must admit--that cost Buchanan a lot of effort. He, too, wanted to be in the middle, but where was the middle?The middle in Alf's case seems to have been the general muddle of the Ford administration. In some ways, the most intriguing moment in Alf's affair with Genevieve comes at its end. He wants to disbelieve her call to order, but she has had enough and does not believe (as he does and thinks everyone in the Ford era does) that his unfaithfulness to her (he's not quite a serial offender, but when he gets a chance, he is) is no big deal.Both of them go back to their flawed mates and confused children, but in Updike's world, this is okay, how things go, something to observe and ponder, not dramatize.Updike's essentially benign view of humanity's imperfections derives from two things: 1) his comic spirit and 2) the undamaged narcissism of being an only child.This probably explains why he brings his story to the edge of divorce and total rupture within two families and to the edge of civil war and total rupture within a nation but does not go into the gory, permanently damaging realities of maimed children and soldiers and societies. Updike was no Ingmar Bergman or William Styron. He was not a writer interested in total darkness taking over his imagination, but it can't be said that he didn't have a well-conceived position on rejecting tragedy. And there's something to what he seems to say: ""Life goes on, like it or not.""This novel? Well, I've said it doesn't work, but yet as an artifact of the times and of aesthetic failure, it probably is worth reading all the way through, but that presupposes a willingness to be pleased more by dazzling detail and observation than repelled by a narrative conceit yielding two books, each half written, within the cover of one....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2015","Jul 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/677946.Memories_of_the_Ford_Administration

It is well-written and draws on personal encounters and insight as well as the larger, well-known contours of Clinton's up and down presidency.Entering office with large aspirations, Clinton and his wife failed at health care reform through arrogance, secrecy, and wonkiness. But Clinton succeeded with NAFTA (about which I have some questions, and I was present at the creation under the first Bush), welfare reform, Americorps, balancing the budget, and inventions like the egregiously named earned income tax credit, which was meant to help low-income workers, and did, without alerting the nation to the fact that it was a tax breakThe Clinton administration was conducted at a time of peace and prosperity. America was #1 again. We were, in Madeleine Albright's stupid phrasing, the indispensable nation, but the challenges abroad were not great, and the challenges at home were opposed ferociously by the Gingrich-led Republican party.Ultimately Gingrich self-destructed. Clinton tried to follow him with Monica Lewinsky, but the ""Comeback Kid"" survived impeachment.We more or less know all this. We know Clinton was a creature of private desires and appetites.The arresting aspects of this book go back to the ""small ball"" theme. Clinton accomplished a lot. He balanced the budget and audaciously targeting the surplus on ""Save Social Security First,"" a state of the union phrase that represented, in itself, a way of thwarting Republicans from taking a trillion out of the public coffers and redistributing it to the wealthy.Clever move. Meaningful move. Clinton flew under the radar a lot, believe it or not, and Klein portrays an administration that became increasingly more disciplined as it matured (to the point that Clinton, apparently, could not stand his success and unzipped his pants in the wrong place.) In so doing, he did not become a great leader. Having achieved much, he failed to make clear that the Republican opposition to redistribution is based on America already had redistributed wealth to the rich. He also failed to make clear that when Republicans howled against class warfare, they were the experts at it. And he was inattentive to the mess Hillary was making of health care reform or the progress of his unifying project, AmeriCorps.Without saying so explicitly--and I don't know why--Klein clearly portrays Clinton as a man who hated to say no to anyone and would rather accommodate than aggravate. He was a fighter more with himself and his staff than with his adversaries. He was shrewd, unbelievably well-informed, and relatively indifferent to the world. The terror that we live with today was born during his times. It wasn't his fault, but he showed little leadership in dealing with it as he let the intelligence community shrink and the Pentagon shirk. Blackhawk Down in Somalia was a grim moment of retreat (not that we should have been there in the first place) and his waxing/waning enthusiasm for China's markets certainly made the Japanese wonder who our strategic partner was.The portrait of Al Gore here is good: here was a man who did not really want to be president as much as he could demonstrate his ability to boot away an election by himself.The phenomenon of the politics of personal destruction is recounted as a decades-long polarization that was effective, and nauseating. The Republicans planned Clinton's downfall from day one. They did the same thing with Obama, a different man in different times, from day one. Both presidents inherited economies that were faltering or plummeting and turned them around. It makes you wonder how they could get a single vote in 2016.This brings us to Hillary, Clinton's wife and soulmate and sparring partner. Presumably she'll be the Democratic nominee in 2016 and the odds are she will win. Does that mean she will repeat Clinton's presidency? It's really not a sound question. Hillary learned a lot from her husband's travails in The White House, as a senator, and as secretary of state. She was, to begin with, much more disciplined and focused than her husband and remains so. She lacks his ""touch,"" which is what Klein finds ""natural"" about Bill Clinton the politician, but I have spent time with both of them, and I can tell you they both have an electric effect on people, even if Hillary is an introvert and Bill is an extravert.Klein's book ends well before the second and third and possibly fourth phases of Hillary's career presented themselves. His assessment focuses on Bill, not Hillary. He finds Bill to be more accomplished than people think and just as defective and disappointing as they think. He is a man to be measured against his astonishing strengths and resiliency and his equally astonishing weaknesses and demons. Did he have the ""stuff"" to really lead the nation? He would like to think so, and I suspect Klein thinks so, but the 90s were a political food fight, a disgrace on both parties, and a period of post-Cold War consolidation with which we still have yet to come to terms. An Eisenhower or Truman might have tamed the decade with security about who they were. As Lloyd Bentsen is quoted, the WWII generation might not have felt it had so much to prove. Bill Clinton was insecure, and he sailed again and again into trouble before tacking out toward calmer waters....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 14, 2015","Jul 14, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49199.The_Natural

(whoever he was) produced a book, in two volumes, that does two things: #1 Demonstrates that Mrs. Hester Thrale did not jilt or mistreat Dr. Samuel Johnson upon her husband's death and #2 that Mrs. Thrale (to become Mrs. Piozzi) was a delightful and articulate and intelligent diarist and letter-writer. Volume I, on which I am commenting now, is an extended compilation of extracts from the writings of Mrs. Thrale, Johnson, and others, with extensive editorial commentary that focuses most explicitly on #1 above. Implicitly, however, #2 comes into sharp focus, along with a wide range of social questions, chief among them the features of sexism in late 18th, early 19th century England.James Boswell, Dr. Johnson's best-known biographer, did not like Mrs. Thrale for the transparently obvious reason that he was jealous of how much he thought Dr. Johnson did like Mrs. Thrale. Boswell spent about a half year in Johnson's company, spread over a number of years. Mrs. Thrale had the laborious pleasure of serving as hostess to Johnson for some 18 years because he was given living quarters in the large establishment of the Thrales (which were financed by Mr. Thrale through his successful brewery.) So Boswell worked in a number of digs at Mrs. Thrale, particularly when Mr.Thrale died and he intimated that Mrs.Thrale cast Johnson off (preferring an accomplished Italian musician named Piozzi). Boswell's digs were amplified and extended later on by Lord Macaulay, who knew less about Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson than Boswell and many others--but that didn't stop him from having his opinions.In this choppy but vivid volume, we meet Hester Thrale in her own words and can't help but be charmed by her spirit and vivacity. She gave birth to 8 children (4 of whom survived) but she managed to be a dazzling, quick-witted hostess who tolerated the brilliant but obnoxious Johnson primarily at her husband's wishes. That is not to say that Mrs. Thrale did not adore Johnson or that Johnson did not adore Mrs. Thrale. It is to say that the key figure in the Thrale household was Mr.Thrale, a quiet but strong-minded man whom Mrs. Thrale also tolerated.She did not portray or conceive of herself as a martyr, but she was higher born than Thrale or Johnson, smarter than Thrale and at least able to keep up with Johnson, and yet subordinate to male dominance.Her sin was to follow her heart after Thrale died and marry Piozzi instead of tying herself to another overwhelming husband, i.e., Dr. Johnson.This presupposes that Mrs. Thrale and Johnson were some kind of love match or secret lovers or burning to have one another once Thrale was out of the way. That clearly was not the case. Johnson was a compassionate egocentric literary genius who suffered endless maladies and was obsessed with the dark consequences of his own death. He had been married to an older woman once, and from all appearances, he dabbled in street women now and then but didn't see himself as a lord and master of the likes of Mrs. Thrale, considerably younger.Johnson was what we can no longer call a queer bird so we'll have to settle for an odd duck. He is famous for his quips and pronouncements, his practice of speaking his mind, and his dog-like interest in his dinner plate. Having Johnson at your table was a coup, of sorts, because he was a box of verbal fireworks that could go off at any time. He was, to introduce some other animals, like a bear or bull whom people enjoyed baiting, a polymath of the literary style, a killer in argument, and a sad, self-condemning man who always questioned his worth, if not his judgments.Mrs.Thrale was vivacious, impish, didn't take herself too seriously, and possessed the kind of intellect that is reactive,switch-blade quick. She ultimately, in later life, wrote things that were beyond her capacity, but for the better part of twenty years she served as a kind of foil and intimate friend to the giant Johnson--and then she published some of her memoirs and exchanges with Johnson and fanned the fires of London's resentment that she married an Italian, of all people, and did not sacrifice herself to Johnson.In one dismaying entry in her diary, she recounts her realization after Mr. Thrale's death that Dr. Johnson depended on him much more than on her and was not affected much at all by the end of his time under their roof. This hurt her, but it did not crush her. Similarly, her daughters' coldness toward her second husband hurt her but did not crush her. She deferred marrying Piozzi for a time and then couldn't bear it any more. She sent to him in Italy, telling him to come get her. There's really no other explanation than the fact that she loved Piozzi madly and ultimately did not care what London thought--she would move to Italy, London be damned.This is what I mean by spirit. Some, though not all, of us are intrigued by the social structures within which the characters Jane Austen, George Eliot, and Henry James met their fates. Here is a character straight of that literary line who writes herself, can be bowed but not broken, and remains vivid into her eighties, long after the departure of Johnson.Did Mrs.Thrale have an intimate understanding of Johnson? One can assume that having a bear in the house for 18 years (for months at a time, not the entire year) gives one glimpses of both the bear's body and soul, but that isn't the sort of thing Mrs. Thrale would more than hint at and it is the sort of thing that would mortify Johnson, so we can't know if on certain desperate nights Johnson begged to be tied up and whipped or spanked and Mrs. Thrale complied with his wishes. And if so, that wouldn't form much of a basis for subsequent marriage, would it? This is by no means a book for everyone. It jumps around; it doesn't always make clear who is being cited or quoted; and it demands a lot of co-writing, which is to say it's not fully realized, not equal to something produced by Austen, Eliot or James. But Mrs. Thrale is a gem of a person. The odds were always against her, men and her daughters freely censured her, and yet she pushes ahead. And her ""literary remains"" give us a broad picture of her times....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 12, 2015","Jul 12, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20878046-autobiography-letters-and-literary-remains-of-mrs-piozzi-thrale-2nd

He reports periods of indolence, no doubt depression, that make his work on The Lives of the Poets fitful going, but he is still a paragon of industry. At least when Boswell is with him, he dines with interesting men—mostly—night after night. London is his beloved feast. If he thinks he may be bored at the table, he brings along a book that he keeps in his lap and can read without anyone but Boswell knowing. If he arrives at a new house and comes across a new book and it interests him, he attacks it with his eyes, isolating himself from the gathering crowd, asking the text questions, judging it, bringing it into focus. He still has the queer way of tilting his head when he thinks through his response to good ideas and bad over the dinner table. He is querulous when provoked by bad manners and insolent questions. Sometimes people gather around him after dinner four deep, and he is a kind of television show in which the host is asked questions by the audience.	The consistency of Johnson’s character befits a man at the end of his seventh decade, but at the same time, it is challenged by his key principle: honesty. He won’t say what he does not believe. Sometimes what he believes is disruptive or inconvenient to himself and others, so he has to be agile in expressing himself. This is the age of reason, and he is reason. If he were other than reason, he would betray himself. So he condemns some writers and poets while insisting on the virtues of others. Goldsmith was a poet he held in low regard. The great actor Garrick wins him over with his generosity, more than his stagecraft. Men like Johnson—Adam Smith, Edmund Burke—populate this age. There are only glancing references to these giants. But Sir Joshua Reynolds pops up again and again, and he, Boswell notes, is similar to Johnson. Always the same. Catch him when you will, Reynolds does not change.	This firmness of personality, held in place by reason, judgment, principles, values, is quite different from what we see and encounter today. Public life is a sad spectacle of ducking and dodging; it is shallow, not grounded in erudition; and it is personality-based in an arbitrary way, meaning that the inner life of a public figure, be it intellectual, politician, artist, actor, seems always in the foreground. A friend commented to me yesterday—a friend who is Indian—that we seem so wrapped up in our multiple narcissisms that no one really cares about larger issues.	Johnson would not have it so. We sense, and can read elsewhere,that he was a massively disturbed individual. He feared death and he feared being judged and he wrestled with a sense that he should be punished. Possibly, one later critic has suggested, he found some relief and perverse satisfaction in being bound and struck or whipped. That’s the kind of stuff that grabs us today. Johnson did everything he could to keep his doldrums and self-condemnation out of the conversation. He did not believe in ad hominem arguments. To the contrary, he despised them. To him an opinion praised or dismissed because its author was such and such a person who acted hypocritically was still an opinion, to be dealt with on its own terms, not on the basis a single man’s life.	Johnson was, in sociologist Richard Sennett’s terms, a public man. The business of being himself involved participating in the overall civic enterprise of London, England, and the world (but mostly London.) To be such a man, one must have read, thought, and developed a worthy persona, if you will, that does not descend into the trivia of one’s private affairs. The issue is not oneself. Oneself is inadequate, too small a canvas, to represent the fundamental challenges everyone faces. Bloviating won’t do it. Considered judgments are in order, and no one was quicker in offering considered judgments than Johnson. He was a learned wit and a sage and a person of seemingly infinite curiosity.	All this comes through in this third volume of Boswell’s Life of Johnson, but at the same time, there are other aspects of Johnson’s life and writings I plan to look into. Next up is probably Mrs. Thrale. She and her husband offered Johnson lodgings for years. When her husband died, one might have thought she would respond to Johnson’s suit, but if he offered such a suit, and to me that’s not clear, she chose another man, a much lesser man, a more ordinary man.	What is striking about Mrs. Thrale in this book is that she is often reported to be incapable of keeping her facts straight, telling a story as something actually happened, or even worrying that she was, contrary to Johnson and Reynolds, inconstant. In a way she is a complement to men like Johnson, and we can sense that Johnson found her a kind of amusing relief. He was not an unfunny man—all wits are funny—but he was deadly serious, and Mrs. Thrale was not a serious person, yet she was dear to Johnson.	Other figures appear in this volume who are, to be anachronistic, Dickensian. His household was half-possessed by others. He may have dined out so often in part because the food at home was so bad. But he generously tolerated and cohabited with odd figures who were always in some kind of pain or debt. A Christian would do this, Johnson would say, and he was a Christian, a sinner, a person who gave and forgave as a matter of course.	Boswell writes beautifully. He reports Johnsonian exchanges with such clarity that they must have been conducted exactly as he shares them with us. It would appear that he not only was well-born but also a reasonably successful attorney. Something else to look into.	I noticed another er saying that one read Boswell on Johnson for the same reason that one read Jane Austen—the straightforward elegance of expression and judgment.	The facts, I think, are as follows: An Age of Reason is not enough to create a Johnson or an Austen or a Smith. The society in which they lived and symbolized is a creation over time. The balance in a Johnsonian sentence, its weight and counterweight, its assertiveness and reserve, reflects centuries of reflection.	Romanticism in the early 19th century and Freud toward the end of the 19th century pushed the western world toward a sense of existence—psychic existence—where private experience trumped public history. In fact, history dwindles along with public discourse because there is no way to track and catalog the vagaries and incidents of hundreds of millions and billions of “I’s.” 	It is devilishly hard work to be other than who you are in a personal sense. Not everyone is up to it. And when there is a societal shift away from privileging that which we have in common to that which makes us unique, it’s all the more difficult to insist on the greatness of things versus the smallness.	Johnson, of course, was a genius and an exemplar of good judgment and sweeping eloquence. We see that here. But we also see glimpses of social context almost diametrically opposed to the context of the 21st century. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 05, 2015","Jul 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11005912-the-life-of-samuel-johnson-ll-d-vol-3

For some reason I came up with a thought that does not bear directly on Foucault's work but may have some relation to it.The thought was: Literature is that which otherwise would not be said.I turned this thought over in my mind and was not sure that I knew how I could contradict it and might possibly believe it. In fact, I am still wondering if I will use it as my motto instead of the one that appears at the top of this blog: Why pick up a pen if not to change the world?The point may be that there is in the world a division between two modes of speech: that which is utilitarian and that which is not. The utilitarian must be said. Pass me the salt. I need aspirin. Are you going my way? The gross national product is 14.5 trillion dollars. These are useful statements and need saying. Statements that do not need saying are everything we think about the world and cannot even express except indirectly, through stories, or poems, or plays. Now, as we know, literature originally was closely aligned with religion, as were all the arts, but Foucault pinpoints a 16th-18th century period in which the divinity of literature was cast aside, and the post-Renaissance rumble that came to be ""life today"" began expressing itself.He is not preoccupied with literature or its fate--I am-- but he pursues an analytic method that sidelines it in a curious and interesting way. He choses the word ""archeology"" advisedly. What he is looking for is a kind of sedimentary evidence of change that propelled us into the modern age, and he seeks to find it in odd pairings like grammar on the one hand and exchange on the other. His focus on grammar, and ""speaking,"" is profoundly important to this study. The core insight here is that humankind experienced a shift through the Renaissance away from ""likeness"" to ""representation."" ""Likeness"" is a two thousand year old way of understanding the world. This is like that. This is similar to that. Therefore this and that are related. One can never fully abandon that mode of thought but thought itself is more ore less unlike anything. When we speak or write, we are using grammatical conventions to represent thought. Thought is faster that its written or oral expression; it is instantaneous and sometimes has to wait a long time for someone to give it grammatical form, which is merely a representation of thought, not thought itself. So words come to signify something and do so arbitrarily and in those 16th-18th centuries referred to above, we began to realize that there was no such thing as a universal grammar that expressed itself uniformly through all post-Babel languages. As economies burgeoned, we also faced a challenge we still have not mastered: what is the value of something? Is there a universal value? Gold, for instance? Silver? Not really. Think of going into your driveway and getting into a solid gold car. It would go nowhere, weighing too much. But if we perform two operations that Foucault attributes to the segment of human archeology on which he is focused, we can solve the problem of gold: first, we assign it mathematical values, and then we establish an order that encompasses these values. Again, this is imperfectly achieved even today, otherwise we would not have billionaires profiting from what are called exchange rate fluctuations. But we have moved from likeness--fool's gold to real gold--to representation grounded in the relative stability of mathematics and order.When I was in eighth grade I learned something called the ""new math."" I was taught that you could perform any mathematical operation on an other than decimal system. This proved abysmally pointless except that tonight I recall that our standard math is arbitrary, as is the grammar of one language versus another.This is a long, erudite, possibly correct book. Foucault has had his ups and downs as a socio-intellectual historian and philosopher. Without question, he has done his homework and there are ample instances of him supporting his thesis with myriad persuasive examples. His focus is not on literature. His focus is on explaining the zeitgeist that unified disparate disciplines in creating our analytic, empirically-based and yet highly relative and somewhat arbitrary modern world. He makes the point at the end, per Nietzsche, that we may wake up some day and be other than we are, throwing out all of our presuppositions, and establishing new methods for representing our thoughts, or our forms of knowledge.I tend to think he is right up to a point in this. When I publish this comment, it will be available worldwide. Very few people will read it, but still, those who do will be joining me in a global community that could conceivably chuck the nation state idea and turn its back on the idea of monetizing the air we breathe (carbon marketing) . . . or accept the idea of monetizing air. I don't know. What I do know is that there is a connection between those of us who read and think and my general reaction: Literature is that which otherwise would not be said. We did not need Foucault in a utilitarian sense, but we do need writers whose knowledge and curiosity are so great that the things about which we are both unaware and incapable of expressing do get said. That's literature, and ultimately it may change the world....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2015","Jun 20, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/119561.The_Order_of_Things

In the last decade we have become more familiar with the violent reactionary nature of fundamentalism, especially the Islamic variant.As Armstrong puts it, the fundamentalists are committed to reviving a world of mythos, where the original truth was first spoken. Secular humanists are committed to logos, the man-made exploration of cause and effect, rational explanations and processes, and the future, where we will discover and invent more of the unfolding truth.She excels in explaining how these worldviews infuriate each other and does a good job explaining what has brought turmoil to the Middle East, Israel, and the polarized politics of the United States. Colonialism, anti-Semitism and science have backed many religious peoples into a corner. Secular humanists have pursued agendas that include abortion, evolution, feminism, environmentalism, and international cooperation. None of these things are blessed by the monotheistic God. Where do they figure in the Old and New Testaments or the Koran?Iran and Egypt were poor countries exploited by great powers--Great Britain, the U.S., and the USSR. They were pushed out of their comfort zone from an Islamic point of view. Some got rich, most stayed poor. Most felt degraded.Israel suffered internal and external challenges. The external challenges are obvious. The internal challenges are the divisions between ultra-orthodox believers who don't even think a Jewish state is necessary. Yes, there are anti-Zionist Jews who regard Zionism as a political reality divorced from God's greater plan.The United States's predominant secular humanists mocked the ""backwards"" Bible-believing creationists to the point where they gathered together, began voting as a bloc, and have polarized American politics by diminishing the Republican party as anti-scientific and yet hardening it as a tough adversary for the Democratic party.The point is that there is no ground for compromise between modernists and fundamentalists. Difficult as it is for the United States to accept, Americans are not welcome or very effective in the Middle East. We think we have a better way; others disagree. Muslims do not wish to be ""free."" They wish to submit to Allah.This has led to perversions of faith in all three domains--America, Israel, and the Middle East. It has been said, and bears saying again, that Islam does not call for violent jihad. By the same token, our Founding Fathers were explicit in separating church and state, infuriating many church-going believers. And we support an Israel that treats Palestinians with brutal indifference. Netanyahu calls for settlements on the West Bank that are the result of ""natural growth."" Do only Jews experience natural growth? Palestinians don't?To her credit, Armstrong did not foresee any reconciliation between the fundamentalists and the secular humanists. We are experiencing an upheaval likely to last many decades in the Middle East and Africa. Many U.S. Republicans and fundamentalists think our military is a solution. That's wrong. We made things worse by invading Iraq; we shouldn't make the same mistake twice.

The chapters are entitled things like ""Mourning and Hospitality,"" ""The Context of Communication,"" and ""Giving and Forgiving.""Here is an approach to Derrida that is not as twisted and turgid as Derrida himself but focuses, as Derrida did, on lasting issues in the philosophical journey that are not hopelessly minute, self-referential, and irrelevant to the task of being human.Derrida is best portrayed here in certain very focused phrases and comments. He's well-known for his overall approach--deconstructionism--but that approach long ago got lost in the fog of nothing meaning anything and the irrelevance of the text (whatever text, be it Shakespeare or the Yellow Pages.)At the end of this book, Deutscher highlights the simple formula: respect difference. In a way this sums Derrida up well. He is the philosopher of uncertainty (so was Socrates). His premise that nothing means anything in itself but depends on all its contradictions for meaning suggests that what we think, how we interpret, should be with done with great caution.Here's how the principle of uncertainty applies: I have long believed, before and beside Derrida, that justice is a a relative term and the law is an arbitrary, malleable phenomenon. Courts render decisions in accord with laws; they don't render justice. What does justice mean? Fairness? The sanctity of property? The ability of 12 jurors to know exactly what happened during the commission of a ""crime""? All of the above? Reference to a preexisting ideal handed down by ""nature"" or the Bible or English common law? If I push at the term justice long enough, I can make it impossible to define in itself or in contradistinction to something else. Writing this, I might quickly be dismissed as an anti-authoritarian malcontent, as was Derrida on occasion. But I'm only suggesting that there are differences in everyone's approach to justice and that these differences should be dealt with respectfully and cautiously.Deutscher successfully points out that Derrida was basically positing the need for continuous debate and negotiation as we humans manage our affairs imperfectly. In epistemological terms, Derrida questioned how anyone could know anything for certain.An example comes with the chapter on forgiveness. I say, ""I forgive you."" Does that mean I have erased the act that irritated or offended me? Does that mean that on being forgiven you really accept the fact that you have transgressed against me? Are we negotiating a truce, each of us sidestepping whatever it was because we want our relationship to go on, regardless of what you believe and I believe? Is forgiveness even meaningful when the context is something trivial as opposed to something that really is unforgivable? You murdered my daughter. I tell the cameras that I forgive you. This does happen. As a philosopher,Derrida would like to interrogate this happening. The fact is, I suspect, that Derrida accepts no facts. He sees factual assertions as provisional . . . there is more to be said.The current trial of mass murderer James Holmes is fascinating for many reasons, one of which is the insanity defense. The question a court privileges is whether the perpetrator knew right from right, or could know right from wrong, at the time of the act. A court appointed psychiatrist says Holmes knew right from wrong and therefore was sane. We can expect that judgment to be bolstered in the jurors' minds by Holmes' notebooks, which are frequently quite rational. There was rational planning involved. There was a rational estimation of which movie theater to strike for maximum effect. Is rationality the same as sanity? It could and will be argued that rationality can be overridden by compulsions and obsessions.Derrida does not want to tell us what to think about all this; he wants to tell us to think about it; he wants us to consider the imperfection of our systems in order to improve them, be they systems of justice, education, property protection/ownership, whatever.His view, as Deutscher presents it, is that we all must recognize our bad conscience and personal contradictions. For example, there are few states in the world that did not have their origins in colonization that displaced earlier inhabitants. In Australia and Canada, this realization has caused significant changes in public policy. In the United States, we're done with that. The indigenous peoples get some help and pseudo-sovereign recognition, but they get no more land, and as far as reparations go, nope.Deutscher presents a Derrida who would urge us to keep working on such an issue, recognizing that any success we achieved (or negotiated) would be bounded by failure. Part of that failure would come from incomplete cross-cultural communication. As often as non-indigenous people in the U.S. hear it, how many really feel they understand the meaning of a sacred mountain to people whose ancestors lived here long before the arrival of Europeans?So this is a rich little book, very well done, very much worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 30, 2015","May 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/167505.How_to_Read_Derrida

This means that virtually no one, certainly not me, always knows what is being said except through contextual interpretation.As someone who has learned four foreign languages, I'm pretty good at holding onto narrative flow even when I don't know a few words, but I would have to say that this aspect of Sea of Poppies is disagreeable.There are numerous interesting characters who are fleeing disaster in Bengal (chiefly because of poppy market failures) and some who are of high status brought low by the avarice and nastiness of others. This is a cruel world that gets crueler as the Ibis is fitted out and takes off for Mauritius. Shipboard discipline, misery, and arbitrary rule are degrading to everyone from the captain on down.One key element of the story is an unintentional reprise of Melville's Billy Budd (at least I think it is unintentional.) Another element is the transformation of a man who is occupied by the spirit of a woman, and thereby acquires quasi-magical instincts and powers.The story ends with a kind of thud. Mauritius, a penal sort of place, is not reached. The fate of numerous characters is left up in the air . . . or at sea, if you will. This is the first book I've read by Ghosh. He's got some problems in storytelling. That's the simplest way of putting it.

It's a story recounted through the memories, observations and conclusions The Man Who Was Late is an early novel by the lawyer-novelist Louis Begley. It's a story recounted through the memories, observations and conclusions of a lawyer named Jack, a New York sophisticate much like Begley, about his friend, a banker and fellow Harvard grad, named Ben.Ben is the man who was late, the man who escaped the slaughter of the Jews in Central Europe in WWII with his parents, and arrived on U.S. shores always a touch out of sync with the society he entered the meritocratic way, not the to-the-manor-born way like Jack, and Jack's cousin, Veronique, with whom Ben conducts an affair.The virtues of this novel are its fluid prose and knowledge of the societies in America and abroad (largely France) where Ben is successful but doesn't fit in. His marriage was ill-fated, he wanted his stepdaughters to love him, but they didn't, and despite his banking acumen and privileges, he's somewhat dark and guilt-ridden, a heavy drinker, a man with a taste for illicit sex, and generally self-castigating in the notes he leaves behind. Suicide is the climax of this novel, of course.It could be said that another virtue of the novel is that it hews tightly to the middle-class ethos of the novel form itself. That's where it gets its strength and ethos and where Ben runs afoul. He feels judged because he wriggled his way into a world of privilege where he did not belong. Like everyone else in the book, he knows all the right wines, restaurants, resorts, and ultimately, tailors, but he has this need for bad women until he hits upon Veronique, a provocative, unhappy, but more or less good woman. And so he doesn't feel fit for decent society, and he boots his chance with Veronique away.In one sense this is an enjoyable book to read. Begley tells the tale astutely, drawing on face-to-face encounters between Jack and Ben, Ben's helpfully left-behind notes, and even some letters and confessions to Jack by Veronique.In another sense, these are people who are full of themselves, who do things just right, belong to the right clubs, handle multinational negotiations with consummate skill, and yet are empty. Ben, in particular, is all over the place without really exploring the source of his confounding ""otherness."" The fact that he is Jew has something to do with, a big something to do with it, but in the main, his Jewishness and Central European background are just statements, not developed themes. No one is actively persecuting Ben anymore. He's cleared all the hurdles. So what is the wish to be degraded, to be soiled, or defiled all about? It a way it seems to be about nothing, about too much freedom, too much money, too many opportunities to resolve a day's tensions in bed on a strictly I-come/you-come basis.Begley himself, having escaped the Nazi's during WW II as a boy, may have felt that the mere shadow of these events was sufficient to give Ben a lasting piquancy. I should think it probably would be enough if it were not the mere shadow but the inky shadow, a shadow brought to the surface through moral self-questioning and perhaps explicit disdain for people like Jack, the erudite lawyer, well-read, well-married, pretty faithful to the interests of his tortured cousin Veronique.So this is a kind of novel that refers to Rilke but has closer connections to Trollope or Thackeray or Henry James and Edith Wharton. It offers incidents that are more vile than anyone would find explicitly addressed by those novelists, but it holds itself together the way their novels did, and Ben finally conducts his revolution not against the status quo but himself. And one doesn't care enough for Ben to take this too hard. His pain doesn't break boundaries, only his own unresolved life.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 16, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45380.The_Man_Who_Was_Late

In New York Pam works in the World Trade Center and has premonitions that buildings like this are too tall, fragile, inviting of destruction. Lyle works on Wall Street, where he is present during an office murder and ineffective bombing attempt. So...terrorists. And they invite him into their world, and he is bored and curious enough to accept, though he hedges his bets by loosely informing the CIA what's going on.Meanwhile Pam goes to Maine with two homosexual friends and has a sexual encounter with one of them, who apparently tips over into self-destructiveness, committing suicide.And Lyle reencounters the feminine lure that drew him into the idea of getting the bombing right, but for reasons obscure to me, he is left dangling in a motel with her, where she has taunted him with a plastic dildo. Hmmmm.Having written this, I'm uncertain whether you will want to read Players, but that would be a mistake. Curiously DeLillo wrote somewhat better forty years ago than he does now. The novel has a luscious abstraction to it, a sensuousness, a fine phrasing and coolness that is not so cool as to be frigid and lifeless. DeLillo captures the vagueness of New York's atmosphere, its suggestiveness, the cascades of florescence, the shadows at the back of the bar, the mysteries of touch, sweat, stride, bodies that are beautiful to look at and bodies that are not beautiful but are powerful, wide-hipped and thick-thighed.As remains the case, DeLillo is persistently and tenaciously skeptical of plot. In some senses, this is a weakness, but I tend to think plot is overrated in fiction. What fiction offers best is an opening onto new vistas, not a set of fixed conclusions. People are that way because they are so complex and ultimately intangible, and characters are that way, too. They think and at the same time don't know what else they are thinking and end up saying something else altogether. They joke and are serious. They strain to master irony because mystery is too hard. DeLillo is effortlessly good at this sort of thing. I spent some time pondering his style and found that its pace came from its punchy short sentences punctuated by verbless sentences. Like this. And that.Ultimately DeLillo's constant subject has been the conspiracy of modernity that masquerades as harmless entropy but actually is full of intent. Someone knows what's going on.

Here is a man who is much like Sherlock Holmes in the sense that he has great strengths in some areas and none in others. He cannot recognize faces but he can read minds, let's put it that way--literally, facial recognition is tough for him.Born to doctors, he seemed destined to become a doctor, but the higher calling seemed to be some kind of medical researcher, given his extraordinary knowledge and curiosity about the natural world. Today we may think of him as a towering literary scientific figure, but his career was full of ups and downs. His true calling was not what is called ""bench science,"" where on careful experiment leads to another, nor was it theoretical work in neurology. Rather, it was observing patients in clinical settings and then vividly presenting him to his colleagues and the general pubic in compelling books about the enigmas of the human brain and associated behavior.Sacks is gay, something his mother detested, but a subject he deals with in a straightforward way here. He also is a past wild rider of motorcycles, a past drug addict, a past weightlifting champion and a lifelong swimmer of epic predilections.He writes with such clarity and sensitivity that one quickly grasps how much his patients, all individuals, and his famous and not so famous friends meant to him. There are great portraits of two great poets, W. H. Auden and Thom Gunn, here. There also is a great portrait of Francis Crick, one of the discovers of the double helix at the core of our DNA. Fundamentally, Sacks discovered that he was, and remains, a writer. He always was drawn to the narrative science of the 19th century--Darwin, in particular--which placed him somewhat at odds with the lab scientists of the later part of the 20th century. Intuitive and inquisitive, with a polymath's command of facts, he bounced around the medical field for a long time before he became, many years ago, a renowned nonfiction writer. At the core of his work, this memoir included, is a belief that human beings require stories to nourish and sustain consciousness. Possibly we see things in nanosecond frames--still shots--but we insist on the connectivity of phenomena that underpins both logic and literature. So life for us is a movie that can be viewed again and again; it is a construct; it is a composition. Without stories there is no ""sense,"" and as Crick once said to Sacks, ""Tell me some stories,"" which Sacks gladly did.Books like Awakenings and The Man Who Thought His Wife Was a Hat enabled Sacks to gain a readership and a deluge of new material in the form of letters written to him from all corners of the earth, asking the same question about different conditions: How can such and such be? Is such and such even human? How can a person not know she does not have a left side? How can a person who is blind somehow see blindsightedly? What is autism? What does congenital deafness do to the visual centers of the brain? Can the visual become auditory? Ultimately Sacks has come to believe the best model of the brain is that of a series of floating maps, or archipelagos, that are capable of resonating with one another and altering one another. Human nature, according to this view, is particular. Many things can happen to shape you, me and the person next to us,but the same thing will not happen to all of us. With our endowment of mental plasticity, all of us will learn to move in slightly different ways, speak in slightly different ways, and ""be"" in slightly different ways. Consciousness thus is born again and again with each child, giving each of us our style, our flavor, our interests, and so forth.This is not an especially taxing book to read, however. The simple human portraits, the examinations of Sacks' frailties and needs, and the disjunctures that characterize all of our lives come through clearly. I didn't set out to read the book quickly, but I read it, a medium length book, in two days. Here is a life built of passions, pains, and surprising resilience.Once his mother had verbally slapped him for being gay, she never mentioned the subject to Sacks again, and they never stopped loving each other. Her death, recounted here, was the hardest on him of all. So it's a compassionate book, as one would expect of someone who managed to awaken the living dead and free them of the paralysis that had consigned them to society's dustbin.I rarely give a book 5 stars. In Duke Ellington's phrase, something has to be ""beyond category"" for that. Well, Sacks, his life and his book are exactly that--beyond category....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 09, 2015","May 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24972194-on-the-move

The authors take great pains at the outset to specify how they obtained said quotes, private thoughts, and conflicts. I think we can take what we read here as accurate . . . and pretty grim.As we all know, Obama prevailed in a thunderous victory in 2008. His strategy was to round up delegates so that he could take the Democratic nomination away from Hillary Clinton and win by points, and that's what he did. Next, nomination in hand, Obama faced an easier task, defeating the scattershot combo of McCain and Palin in the general election.The heart of the book focuses on how Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic nomination. Then, as now, she was the prohibitive favorite, and she worked herself to exhaustion only to be done in by three things: her husband, her divided if excellent staff, and of course, the phenomenon of Barrack Obama.What we saw on the Democratic side of the election was a yearning for change, and although she was,and remains, a woman, Hillary Clinton was not new. Nor was she as well-supported by her strategists and operatives. The ordeal she went through in 2008, followed by a demanding 4 years as Secretary of State, makes me wonder why she wants to do it again in 2016. Running for office and governing are two separate things. Running for office is an abysmal experience of one smile after another, one sound bite after another, one media attack after another, and one fundraising calamity after another. There's never enough time or money or, quite importantly, ideas, and the ideas that do present themselves are responses to political exigencies, not challenges of governance. Even the thoughtful Obama could not believe how little intellectual support he received in his successful campaign. Were there specific plans for health care reform, immigration reform, winding down two wars, and facing the financial/economic crisis that had just exploded? Not really. The same thing was true on the Republican side. Campaigning is about connecting with and wooing voters, not laying out detailed agendas, and the McCain we meet here would hardly be the person to plan ahead for victory anyway. He was, and remains, a fighter pilot. Get me off the carrier deck and I'll shoot down the bad guys. How did he get the Republican nomination? As we read here, A lot of luck helped McCain along. He had to hit bottom before he bounced high enough to grab the brass ring. And then who did he give the ring to? Sarah Palin. The portrait here is nauseating. The poor woman was overwhelmed, out of her league, exploited, angry, lonely, and humiliated. That tart-tongued, plucky, screechy persona we have come to accept as Sarah Palin in 2016 was not really the middle-aged mom who governed the largely empty state of Alaska in 2008. She had will, but she lacked substance. There was no way someone who did not know why there are two Koreas could hold her own, and of course, she didn't.As I read along, I tried to boil down the basic framework for how America chooses its presidents. I came up with three fundamental issues:1) Party affiliation. Being a Democrat or a Republican may not mean much, but without being one or the other, there's no chance of being elected.2) Character in context. By this I mean the public examines the traits and qualities of a candidate and judges his or her suitability for facing the challenges of the moment. Obama was a great orator and campaigner, true, but what he really had going for him was embodying change--generational change, party change, and racial change. That's what America wanted; that was the context; and he knew how to respond in a cool, measured, self-controlled way that appealed to 53% of the voters.3) General political philosophy. Presidential campaigns are superficial glimpses of how a candidate would govern, if elected. Candidates don't want to say too much and box themselves in or alienate independent or crossover voters. No candidate, however well connected, can put together a brain trust that will respond to policy dilemmas with the force of the entire Executive Branch. You have to be elected to get beyond generalities, but your generalities matter. Is big government really the problem? Is domestic policy a greater priority than foreign policy? What do you think about the present division of spoils in Washington, where the rich exercise so much influence and thereby ensure that their spoils are the lion's share . . . or the devil's share?In a way, this book is a political junkie's book. In another way, it is a primer for the average, literate citizen interested in the costs imposed on candidates who wish to become president. This is a book full of humiliations, broken dreams, squabbles, cynicism, heroic effort and remarkable loyalty. The question ultimately revolves around what makes a person say, ""I want to be president. I should be president."" This requires an outsized ego, nerves of steel, physical and psychological stamina, and will, lots of it.In the U.S., the president of the United States at the time is the most accomplished politician in the country. That does not always speak well for the political class or for the electorate, but this is a brutal undertaking. One of my favorite moments in U.S. political history came in 1980 when Teddy Kennedy was asked why he wanted to be president. He stumbled around and obviously couldn't answer. Ergo, he did not become president. You've got to be able to answer that question through your party affiliation, the way your character meets the context of the day, and how your general political philosophy will bring peace and prosperity to the country. That's all it takes, but it's not a simple thing to do....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 04, 2015","May 04, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6694937-game-change

Its principles are those of most strategies, culminating in the overriding edict: fight when you will win; don't fight when you won't.In John Minford's excellent Penguin edition, we encounter a series of observations bordering on truisms that are meant to point out the variables of conflict, leadership, loyalty, natural fact, and informed judgment. Here we have sayings that probably are an accretion or compendium of many different Chinese military thinkers perfectly at ease with war--and diametrically opposed by non-military thinkers like Confucius and Mencius who preferred peaceful means of rule and leadership.For psychological depth, I prefer the meditations of the Roman general and emperor Marcus Aurelius, but for glittering opacity, The Art of War stands up well in comparison with any epigrammatic work, Blake and Nietzsche included. It is so general and yet assertive that war need not be how it is put to use. It can equally serve as a stimulus to good financial planning or gardening; one must simply have a talent for taking martial pronouncements and bending them to different purposes.Strategy, after all, is strategy. It is the admission to oneself that one wants something of vital importance and one is unlikely to have it fall in one's lap without a plan, discipline, a sense of tempo, a restless eye and sufficient support in the rear. Generals don't win wars on their own. They have rulers behind them and troops ahead of them. One must therefore think holistically; that's the essence of strategy--determining an objective, deciding on necessary resources, devising tactics, and showing flexibility and cunning when an enemy or opponent tries to outwit or deny you.My observation is that there has been a widespread militarization in American life and worldwide over the last 20 or 30 years. This certainly is true in the corporate world, where Sun-tzu is quite popular, but it's also true in football, police work, journalism, and even the latest stages of the eternal war between the sexes. How does one fight to win, not come out a loser, get the story, the touchdown, the respect, the money, whatever is most desired? What wisdom can one draw on to sustain a battle of years and even decades? When is it time to build alliances? When is it time to admit the terrain ahead is sub-optimal? What does sub-optimal terrain mean anyway, in a metaphorical sense?Modern weaponry, from nuclear weapons on down, would appear to represent that most powerful force on earth and what is thought of first when one considers, for example, the meaning of American power, and yet is it, really? Stalin wryly asked, in dismissing the force of the Roman Catholic Church, ""How many divisions does the pope have?"" Well, Stalin's gone, communism is gone, and the pope's successor is still standing. By the same token, one can see easily enough that it is a bad thing to have too many weapons. That can break budgets,and it also can become a crutch, causing leaders to resort to force before they fully explore the possibilities of peace.The Art of War really doesn't advocate settling everything by war, either explicitly or implicitly. To read it carefully is to realize the folly of the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. had the wrong forces, did not understand its enemy, did not know the terrain, and went too far, trapping itself in costly mistakes for more than a decade in both cases. Sun-tzu warns against all this. He urges reflection with an almost divine insistence. He predicts disaster in certain cases with equal certainty.Sun-tzu has always been a favorite in China (and Japan), and the breadth of his terse thought seems to have had more effect there than elsewhere in the world. Mao revered Sun-tzu, and how many years did he spend attempting to gain control over China? As long as it took; that would be the best answer. His successors, it seems to me, are equally patient and tenacious. They do not envision war as necessarily a fatal military engagement. They think about China's economic strength, its diplomatic resources, its human capital, and the terrain upon which its interests lie . . . or where they would like to think their interests lie.This is wise, and The Art of War is above all things a wisdom book. These many pronouncements have a proverbial quality to them. They are meant not just to launch the ship but provision it properly and adjust its course adeptly. Corporate leaders in the early 1970s began massively diversifying their business lines. Now they are well-represented by GE's recent decision to divest itself of its financial arm. GM did the same in its recent moments of near-death experience. This is called ""spinning off"" or in a more negative phrase, ""learning to stick to your knitting."" Politically, the analogy would be pursing an imperial course of domination or focusing on strength at home that works well in cooperation with the strength of others abroad.These days we are constantly reminded of China's rise and the implicit threat of it become Asia's bully, if not the entire world's bully. I personally think this is a hangover from Cold War thinking: the West always needs an existential enemy against which it must brace itself.Despite the fierce certainty with which Sun-tzu presents his observations, there are many hues and options in his thinking. War, he counsels, is a grave thing. Indeed, it is the gravest of things and potentially ruinously costly, diverting national strength into conflict at the cost of systemic weakness at home.I recently heard an internationally respected Harvard academic comment that he could think of nine ways China and the U.S. might clash militarily. I frankly think this is an overstatement. It would be much better to say there were nine or ninety ways for the U.S. and China and the region's other countries and the global community to cooperate. This would be to take Sun-tzu's thinking, his subtlety, his aversion to courting defeat and apply them to international relations creatively rather than destructively.A final word: It's fascinating that this edition of The Art of War follows Chinese custom in presenting the text twice: once by itself and a second time with the interpolated comments of subsequent thinkers. It struck me that here we have the mirror image of Talmudic interpretation of previous texts and questions and Muslim commentaries on the Koran. This is a rich way to go about tangling with the perplexing yin/yang dynamics of Sun-Tzu's thoughts. What did he mean? When does the Old Testament mean? What did Mohammed mean? They all meant many things, and it is a better place to fight it out-- on the fields of thought as opposed to the fields of battle....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 26, 2015","Apr 26, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War

Afraid I did, somewhat tongue-in-cheek. There are so many complex but intersecting issues thrown up by this ambitious novel that it seems to answer every imaginable question without, I fear, resolving any of them persuasively. Powers is a successful writer who probably is too accomplished and sure of himself to accept editing, both when he writes silly love scenes and when he hammers his intricate plot into an unbelievable cycle of coincidences.The Echo Maker won the National Book Award a few years ago. I suspect that this acclaim came as much for its stunning display of neuroscientific data and naturalist's acumen as it did for its generally engaging characters and often (but not always) powerful prose. Here is a book that protests too much, melodramatically placing said characters in the context of both the microscopic intricacies of the brain and the imponderables of 60 million years of evolution. No doubt we need to know what's offered about the brain and evolution here, but even the Sacks-based character can't handle it, and he, like Powers, is a polymath.What am I saying? I'm saying Powers sacrifices his novel to what he wants to get off his chest and yet what he has on his chest is important and fascinating, not trivial. He keeps pace with the front pages, including the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but at an artistic cost. Had he restrained himself, had he not ginned up an obvious and coy mishmash of suspense-filled subplots, had he not brought everything together so neatly at the end, had he not written so many breathless sentences, this novel would have been a knockout.A few decades ago the naturalist/adventurer/novelist Peter Matthiesson wrote a novel of the sea called Far Tortuga. What it offered was a fine lyricism that conveyed the story line quite deftly without overindulging in data and scientific surprises. Powers might have taken a book like that into account, surrendering his grand finale and letting the mysteries he had developed breathe a little more easily in the reader's mind.I would say seven out of ten novel readers would enjoy this book despite my reservations, but the other three might put it aside and look for something tighter, swifter, and more plausible....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 21, 2015","Apr 21, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19794.The_Echo_Maker

Descended from two presidents--John Adams and John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was deeply schooled in American political life, and that, in a sense, is what this ambivalent novel is about.On the one hand it is a tale of the ambitious Silas Ratcliffe and his efforts to become president. He is well-decribed as a politician more interested in power than principle. On the other hand, it is a tale of Madelaine Lee, a widow, who comes to Washington fantasizing that somehow she can learn enough about America's democratic system to affect it. These two figures are unintentionally (I suspect) quite similar to Isabel Archer and Gilbert Osmond of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady. Ratcliffe wants to use Mrs. Lee, and Mrs. Lee, for a time, foolishly thinks she wants to be used.The narrative is well-paced and conveys a gristly disdain for democracy, 19th century American style. Adams has to have had his doubts about the common man deciding the terms of his life. There's no great issue,fortunately, because that would turn it into a kind of dreary policy tract. Rather, the core of the tale is one of sentiment, moral values, and what kind of life one wants to lead.The final exchange between Ratcliffe, who never loses a gambit, and Mrs. Lee, who finds him almost overwhelming, is a virtual business-negotiation nonetheless. The nicety of 19th century marital propositions, underpinned by not so much as a kiss or embrace, raises dark questions in the 21st century reader's mind. What on earth is it going to be like if these two people ever touch each other?Henry Adams is most famous for his autobiography and massive history of the Jefferson administration. He also was a medievalist who taught at Harvard. He was an accomplished writer best described as a man of letters. In this case, he slips into the novel form with grace, numerous cliches, and a purpose: he loathed Washington in its grubby dealmaking and wanted his battered heroine to help the reader understand that D.C. was in his eyes a place where foul arrangements, partisanship, and power weren't worth the candle....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2015","Apr 09, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/341726.Democracy

It is a book that begins just as TR assumes the presidency after President McKinley's assassination and sees TR through his first tumultuous term of three years and second term of four.During these 7+ years, TR was a whirlwind of initiative, both domestic and foreign. He settled the Russo-Japanese War, headed off a war that might have enveloped Venezuela, engineered the politics and chicanery that led to the United States building the Panama Canal, advanced workers' rights, and many other important issues, none more important than setting aside vast tracts of the United States as national monuments and parks.As with FDR, TR was loved or hated but almost everyone liked him whether they hated him or not. He seemed to have a decency, a bon homie, that drew everyone's attention the moment he entered the room. He liked to laugh, play with children, and enjoy conversation with exceptional peers. I can't think of anyone who read more books as president, certainly not in as many languages.This likeability factor contributed a great deal to TR's success. Wall Streeters mistrusted him,but he got along with them well enough; foreign sovereigns swallowed some of his tougher messages; and the common man (excepting white Southerners) thought he was a straight-talker, the man who offered them ""a square deal.""Morris captures all this in exuberant detail. It's not his fault that TR is a great subject, and he only occasionally writes ""over the top"" in trying to explain the whirlwind (which Job wasn't able to explain to God.)A few insights in this book are invaluable. Overall it makes clear that the robber barons having made more money than Bill Gates, the time had come for reining them in. TR did that to an extent, but not as much as one might think. He was always a man of the middle, the golden mean. TR's genius, as Morris puts it, was to understand knowledge as a platform for action, not for further introspection. The great writer Henry Adams captured this Rooseveltian quality with the word dynamo. He seemed to see in Roosevelt a major turn in history, a symbol of modern industrial/economic strength as capable of plotting quietly as roaring loudly.Bill Clinton's fundamental political thesis is that the candidate who is most positive about America will win the election. He may have been thinking about Reagan, but TR and FDR were even more convincing in their determination to prove that America, when it put its mind to it, could do anything.TR's diplomacy in mediating a final settlement of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 is expertly rendered here. The trial of diplomacy (and it's a trial in war, too) is making a move and then giving it time to ripen and take effect. TR had the kind of strategic mind necessary to play the diplomatic game. He was far-sighted and he was objective. He fundamental conclusion was that for the first time in history Asia had bested Europe. That's a major development and one that Euro-centric Americans might not like to accept, but TR took the world as it was, not as it had been, or as he wished it were.In the course of a year this safari-master of a hunter might also read dozens of books about ancient Rome, Persia, the Incas, and the Spanish empire at its height and depth (to which he contributed). One would think this propensity to be bookish and an outdoorsman would be almost impossible, but TR somehow managed it. In most photographs, he exhibits a quality of bursting at the seams. His smile bursts at the seams. His suits seem to burst at the seams. The crowds that surrounded him seem to burst at the seams. But this was a larger-than-life figure, determined to define the boundaries of his own seams, and they were distant boundaries, indeed....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Apr 01, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40923.Theodore_Rex

Her story itself is scattered throughout this collection: She married a good man, a pharmacist named Henry, and loved him without much passion. They had a son who moved away--to California and New York--who largely proved uncommunicative as he grew older and passed through his first to his second marriage. At midlife, Olive fell in love with a man (a fellow teacher) who seems to have committed suicide by driving into a tree, perhaps out of guilt about his feelings for Olive. And after Henry dies in a nursing home (a stroke victim), Olive tumbles into the arms of a man she doesn’t much like but needs--she’s 74, he’s about the same age, a widow and a widower seeking solace from their grief and loneliness.	Olive’s spitefulness, her sharp tongue, her deflating views on the follies of life make her an interesting character. She has the whiff of reality about her and perhaps some of the laconic humor that characterizes many of the citizens of Maine.	Other characters in the book exhibit similar qualities of longing, desperation, and self-contradictoriness. They populate their town the way Sherwood Anderson’s characters populated Winesburg, Ohio--all of them, all of us, are somewhat freakish when seen up close and in private, which is one of Strout’s greatest strengths as a writer. She proves once again the novelistic fullness of the short story form when one tale is linked together. Think Alice Munro. Think Flannery O’Connor. Not as good as either of these writers, but very good, especially in her ability to find a polyvalent ending for her stories.	The narrowness of life in a small town in Maine is seldom penetrated. From time to time someone leaves by bus or appears from New York or Boston, and this provides a certain relief, but the essence of this book is its quality of people going nowhere, deeply ingrained in their families, habits, community, and sometimes their jobs. 	In one outstanding story, Olive visits a woman whose son is in prison for stabbing a woman to death 29 times. The woman lives in self-ostracized seclusion, somewhat like a poisonous spider in an out-of-the-way web, just waiting for anyone to get close enough to bite, because she knows the whole town is curious about her and not very sympathetic. Her bite--what she does to Olive, a formidable person--is spectacular. Of course she’s a lunatic but a crafty one, and her sense of timing as she lets Olive have it repeatedly is exquisite. Here’s where Strout reminds me of Flannery O’Connor exploring the damned delights of wickedness.

An adolescent, even an emperor, could not have absorbed it all.The advice here, regardless of its immediate recipient, clearly was being directed at Roman society at large, which makes us understand that Rome in the times of the Caesars was angry, not merciful, stinting on private life and downright cheap when it came to favors.Seneca wrote these essays as philosophy, apologia pro sua vita, and exhortation. In American public life, the only comparable documents produced by statesmen-level individuals would be, in my experience, the majority and dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court, which aren't written by the justices, but rather by their brilliant ""clerks."" One exception to this thought would be--at the risk of offending some of my readers--Henry Kissinger, whose books are broad in scope and profound in insight, whether one agrees with their conclusions or not.In simplest terms,Seneca is advising his readers on how to behave, on what is good and what is bad, on how to distinguish between the good and the bad. His Stoic view was essentially that all emotions are distractions. Reasoning should prevail, and he is on hand to provide that reasoning.Here's a current example: The Clinton Foundation took money from the Saudi Arabian government. That government endorses unfair treatment of women. The Clinton Foundation supports the rights of women. Is it better to take money for a good purpose from a bad donor, or turn it down, and not advance your good purpose? Here's another example: When Michael Dukakis was asked in a televised debate how he would respond to his wife having been raped and murdered, he took the reasonable position that he would want justice to take its course and displayed no anger . . . for which he was belittled.I could go on,but the point is that the issues are real, and, as far as I know, we do not have in American public life the equivalent of a Seneca, someone whose monumental rhetorical gifts and intellectual thoroughness would let no question rest. BUT, I hasten to add, someone who assisted Nero in some of his worst crimes; for instance, Seneca wrote the false explanation of why and how Nero's mother met her untimely death.Going back to the church reference I made earlier, I went to church six days a week for five years when I was at boarding school. I haven't been back since. But it's possible that some of our preachers get after things like anger, mercy, and favors from the pulpit with Seneca's vigor, albeit in an attenuated fashion. The point Seneca obsessively makes is that one can think one's way into doing the right thing in accord with the order of the cosmos and the most temperate, middle-of-the-road path available to a man or woman. But this can only result from the exercise of reasoning.I wonder about this. I have two forms of anger. In a given instance, once every five or ten years, I will explode in anger. I undoubtedly have my reasons, but they are not in the forefront of my explosions. Generally, after this happens, I'm not entirely happy with myself. In fact, I'd advise against outbursts of anger, small or large. But I have another kind of anger that essentially nourishes me over decades. This is anger--real anger--against guns, racism, discrimination, exploitation, violence, war, and self-serving sanctimony. I don't think divorcing this kind of anger from reasoning makes sense. Emotions matter. Thinking matters. Stoics like Seneca, in much less regulated and policed circumstances than 21st century America, fought hard on behalf of reason over anger because there was so much anger, caprice, sadism, etc., all around them all the time.Ultimately Nero asked Seneca if he had ever considered suicide--hint, hint--and Seneca complied. Yet Seneca clearly was a man determined to have the last word, and he did . . . he just didn't take a realistic view of who should live or die--a statesman philosopher or a sadistic emperor. We can be consoled, I suppose, that Nero was hounded into death only a few years after Seneca's demise.Read this book if you want a synthesis of Stoicism or an indirect picture of what it was like to live in the Rome of the Caesars--an abysmal, cruel, selfish fiefdom that ruled by force and cunning, not reason....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2015","Mar 10, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20789504-moral-and-political-essays

Borges wrote in a class occupied by Anton Chekhov, Franz Kafka, Flannery O'Connor, James Joyce, Edgar Allan Poe, and few others.As always I find it difficult to summarize dozens of stories in a single volume, so I thought I would approach this work thematically.The Themes Themselves: Borges' themes were the doubleness of consciousness, the unreliability of memory, the simplicity of perfect narrative, the interaction of dreams and waking life, labyrinths, time, the Arabs and the Jews of centuries ago, and death--both permanent and impermanent, which is to say: cyclical.The Literary Antecedents: Borges surely had read as much as anyone. I think only Harold Bloom has read as much, and I may be wrong about that. His tastes were both catholic and refined. He loved Chesterton, Stevenson, and Kipling. Some of his stories consequently are mystery stories or misadventure stories or accounts of simple actions in which the tale virtually tells itself.The Approaches: Per the above, Borges liked mystery, misadventure and pure action. He also liked enveloping his tale in a Conradesque ""Once upon a time, I heard a man tell this story. I don't know whether I believe it, but I thought I would pass it along."" Borges could be antiquarian, mischievous, fantastical and metaphysical. A writer with similar breadth of approach is Margaret Atwood. Another is Joyce Carol Oates.The Style: I first read Borges many years ago in English. Then I read him in Spanish. This volume is a translation by Andrew Hurley, a very fine translation. Borges comes across spectacularly well in both languages but best, of course, in Spanish. Every sentence has an economy and specificity that is remarkable, especially when it appears in a story enshrouded in ambiguity. Borges also eschewed words like eschew. He created learned effects and ambiences with pertinent simplicity, not exotic words. One might argue that Borges was the best prose stylist ever because his artifices are so whole, so consistent, and so vivid. Such arguments are pointless in terms of winning and losing, but they can be educational.The Imagination: Borges' imagination, his ability to conceive a situation out of sheer thought, or sheer fantasy, or sheer erudition, or sheer envy, operates at the highest level. Why do I include ""envy"" in this list? Because Borges was a bookish, eventually blind, urban man who often dwelled on the tango of knife-fights between gauchos. He would have to have been the last man on earth to experience a knife fight, but he wrote about such subjects with a kind of love.Reading Borges: My sense is that one never stops reading Borges. He's Shakespearian in a way, or Cervantino. He has that kind of range and subtlety despite his preference for compact fictions.The Argentine Background: Argentina (and Latin American history) plays a major role in Borges. He presents Buenos Aires as a New York, London, or Rome. It's a thing of his imagination but real. Argentina's perpetual torment, its suffering, its self-destructiveness, isn't really part of this. In Borges, all that is lost will some day be found; that which is harmed will be healed. This is the permanent magic of literature, of course. Literature in Borges' terms is like St.Anselm's God: That than which nothing greater can be imagined.Oh, I should mention: I'm a short story writer myself. My latest, ""What Made You Ask Me to Dance?"" appears in the current issue of 34th Parallel. I'll also be releasing a novel soon, Suffer the Children. More about that later....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2015","Mar 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17961.Collected_Fictions

It draws on known facts and makes good The Greatest Empire is an excellent biographical account of Seneca, the Roman philosopher and advisor to Nero. It draws on known facts and makes good use of Seneca's writings to flesh out the gaps, notably his essays and his plays.I've ed other books about Seneca and Roman stoics recently, so I want to spend a little time here focusing on a few issues rather than taking on Wilson's book as a whole. If you are interested in Rome, the emperor's, or stoicism, by all means read it yourself. The best chapter is the epilogue, which traces Seneca's influence over the subsequent 2,000 years.The Greatest Empire refers to Seneca's contention to that the inner life was much more important than external affairs. His life problems, of course, were that he ran afoul of the emperor Claudius and after compromising himself as Nero's apologist, he received Nero's order to commit suicide, an order he obeyed. Nonetheless he lived into his 60s, wrote widely and extensively, and became fabulously wealthy, all of which represents his quick wits, pliability, and intellectual energy.The major question about Seneca is whether he was a hypocrite, dismissing worldly affairs in his writings while submerging himself in them in his personal comings and goings. At least, he was a compromised individual. More generously, one might say he was overwhelmed by imperial power and didn't always have much choice about his fate, except in what he wrote. But something occurs to me when I compare the stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius with Seneca. Seneca's writing is polished, clever, virtually a new style of writing Latin (he was a key figure in what is known as the Silver Age of Latin literature). Marcus Aurelius didn't conceive of himself as a major literary or philosophical figure,but he wrote much more directly and honestly about his struggles.This leads one to the question not so much of Seneca's hypocrisy as his staginess, his coyness, his loftiness. There is a great, great deal of wisdom in his writing and it includes spectacular self-awareness and depth perception in terms of human nature in general. But as a reader, does one trust him, does one take him to heart, does one feel on some kind of a level with him? In a way, all pronounced exercises in literary style must meet two tests: One test is transient and the results rise and fall with time. By that I mean tastes change. Going in and out of fashion is an unreliable measure of an author's worth. More important is the issue of whether an author's style emerges out of a desire to take a reader into his depths or is designed to delight and intrigue the reader at a distance. In a sense, this makes us judge a writer's honesty, whether he is writing for show and admiration or in search of connection and communication. The Greatest Empire as a phrase conveys something of what I mean. It's a ludicrous phrase, grand, pretentious, and somewhat empty.One more point, however: it has to be conceded that as the ancient Greeks felt less in control of their fate, they became more inward-looking and, to use Seneca's favorite word, indifferent to what was going on in the world around them. The same thing happened in Rome under the Caesars. There was a still a Senate,but it had no power. This rendered the nobility much less influential and certainly encouraged a philosophy of indifference such as Stoicism. So Seneca was compromised, twisted, and tormented by enormous political forces that no one--in fact, not even emperors--could bring to heel. In this context, what we have is not so much an issue of the validity of Seneca's writing but a connection to his mortal personality, one we may not like. He was just a man, and no matter how showy he could be, he seems to have realized that....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 22, 2015","Feb 22, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21977717-the-greatest-empire

When you read it, you will be engrossed, grossed out, appalled or amazed. Depending on who you are, one of these emotions is likely to be the dominant one while the others play back-up.This is an expressionistic novel published in the 60s describing lower class life in Brooklyn in the 50s. Some of the characters are exquisite self-creations; others are uneducated abominations. Two writers quickly came to my mind as I worked my way into Last Exit to Brooklyn -- Jean Genet and John Dos Pasos. Genet's Our Lady of the Flowers finds a kindred spirit here in a long section about cross-dressers, queens, and heterosexual fascination with a little bisexual experimentation. A lot of what goes on is boring exhibitionism--but it's realistic and vivid and pulsing; and a lot of what goes on edges into what's called ""rough trade,"" which could mean physical violence, sexual perversion, or crudeness.Dos Pasos hovers spiritually over Last Exit to Brooklyn because of his USA Trilogy, which is written in a wild pastiche, one narrative strand smacking into another, the continuity being provided by the steamy ambiance of New York being New York-- a place of dark excess, secrets, frustration, big money, and empty fantasy.One of the longer sections of the book focuses on a foolish union underling barely surviving his responsibilities during a strike of his metalworking plant. Harry, like Georgina (the queen), and Tralala (a prostitute), and Mike and Vinny (no good husbands) is persuasively self-delusional. His arousal in a bisexual sense creeps into his thoughts and then his actions. He takes foolish risks for lust but he likes the results even though a part of him remains in denial. He's not a fag; the man dressed as a woman he's having sex with is a fag, and he's not even having sex with her, he's just doing things and having things done to him. Besides, he's drunk. The general sexual frankness, frustration and excess works its way into many of these narrative riffs, expressed in the vile language of the day and the culture and further bastardized by Selby's disregard for grammar and great ear for Brooklynese. Every mangled sentence and word makes sense somehow. It all adds up to an exercise in swollen bombast as men insult women, women insult men, police crack heads, and criminals steal, burn, engage in gang rape, and celebrate with long, soggy, senseless spells of drunkenness.Today I guess there's little shock value in all this. More to the point is the question of whether Selby is dead on or exaggerating. Was the life he witnessed and expressed that raw, naked, aggressive, and humiliating? I'd say he's fairly convincing. In one choral sequence he has women gathered on a bench on the grounds of a housing project: they're almost wonderful in their cynical heartlessness and low expectations. Who has a husband who works? Not many. Who has a husband interested in fulfilling his wife's sexual desires? Not many. Who has a husband who plays around, drinks too much, and lives in debt while making the wife do all the work both at home and in part-time tedious jobs? Most of these women do. So most of them express a noisy fatalism and omnidirectional derision toward the facts of life.Ultimately Last Exit to Brooklyn is a highly moral book in the sense that it makes seamy behavior visible, impossible to ignore. This is what you get when city life is tough, people are detached from sustaining institutions and any sense of community. Here's a cackling cry from hell--Don't forget about us! We're here, too!Actually, I'm giving this book 3.5 stars, not 3.

He had a taste for turbulence in out of the way places--in this case, Haiti. His narrator, named Brown, was born and abandoned to the Jesuits in Monaco, only to learn that his runaway mother intended to leave him a hotel she'd bought in Port au Prince. She dies early on in the novel, and here we have Brown in his hotel with two guests--bumbling but somehow noble Americans--under the watchful eyes of the Tontons Macoute, Haiti's bogey-men at the service of Papa Doc Duvalier.The setting is splendidly decaying. Brown's love affair, with the German wife of a Latin American ambassador, is quintessential Greene: doomed, emotionally incomplete. As often is the case in a Greene novel, his anti-hero has no faith, no connection with his abandoned Catholicism, and therefore no place in a world full of flux and incoherence. His careless attitude sometimes undermines the story but connects directly to the theme of role playing, being an entertainer, falsely representing oneself to others in the hopes of receiving a kiss or a laugh.Ultimately Mr. Brown, age 60, succumbs to lack of faith in his mistress and himself. He thinks she is cheating on him and arranges to have her suspected lover join some rebels in the hills. In fact, Mr. Jones, the mystery man in question, isn't anyone's lover and isn't a veteran of the Burma campaign in any sense of the word. So he dies out there in the hills but not before serving as an excuse for Brown and his mistress to have the final falling out they both knew was coming.Greene clearly knew he wasn't writing one of his tighter, more excruciating novels. This isn't The End of the Affair or The Power and the Glory, but the novel flows through some of its improbabilities like water cascading down a rocky stream bed, and there are a few sentences or images on most pages that are vivid, evocative, and compelling.

The unifying theme is TheInsurrections of the Mind is an excellent anthology of diverse essays published in The New Republic over the last 100 years. The unifying theme is The New Republic's ongoing effort to open new avenues for advancing liberalism American-style. As we all know, liberalism became the ""L-Word"" somewhere during the Reagan/Bush years, but The New Republic's version of liberalism lives on and can be succinctly defined as an attempt to insure big government helps little people while protecting everyone's civil liberties. Mix in a little idealism in foreign policy, and you have the general formula in hand. The New Republic has always insisted, however, that public life involves more than politics, so there are many essays that focus on literature and the arts in this anthology.Reviewing anthologies presents a problem: do you try to be comprehensive or do you focus on the high and low spots? I try to be brief in general terms -- about 75% of the essays here are excellent to outstanding---and call attention to such a volume's strengths and weaknesses.The best essays from my perspective include Zadie Smith on Kafka, Jed Perl on Gerhard Richter, Otis Ferguson on Bix Beiderbecke,Hendrick Hertzberg on Ronald Reagan, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan on, you guessed it, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.Smith captures what V.S. Naipul might call the ""nullity"" of Kafka and explains his difficulty with the novel form. Perl tears Richter to pieces as a paint-slapping phony while lambasting the Museum of Modern Art for featuring him so prominently. Ferguson catches the genius and misery of Beiderbecke. Hertzberg slashes into Reagan of his shallowness, self-centeredness, and general ability to mystify his staff, which constantly tried to advance ideas better than his, but not always with success. Moynihan takes stock of liberalism's failures to deliver on its promises and suggests ways in which it, and he, can push for better results, not just more results and more dollars spent.There are some turgid pieces here by Hans Morgenthau on the failures of democracy, J.M. Keynes on Soviet Russia, and I'm afraid, Vladimir Nabokov on translation. This is to be expected, and my taste may differ from yours in these cases just as it differs from the editor's, Franklin Foer.A theme throughout The New Republic's 100 years is the impending demise of liberalism and how to save it. The answer seems to be coming after the book's publication in the form of things like Obamacare and assertive executive action on immigration, Cuba, and climate change. (Before the book's publication, big government plus the Federal Reserve pulled the U.S. out of a frightening economic nosedive, but I don't find that well-covered here.)In many ways, this volume sets the table nicely for the 2016 election. America will face a choice between rigid conservatism and fuzzy liberalism. What's needed is a fresh look at what these political perspectives can actually achieve in a country where the middle class has lost so much ground and the relatively simple calculations of the Cold War have yielded to much more complex challenges abroad.

His subject was the lack of a body, a name, a whereabouts, a direction, and any means of surviving except through gnarled being.Samuel Beckett was a writer from the first. He came to Paris and became a kind of assistant to James Joyce, high praise in itself. He did not write as obscurely as Joyce in Finnegans Wake or as assiduously as in Ulysses or as conventionally as in Dubliners. Rather, he perfected this middle ground. He reminds one of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Franz Kafka, but in the end, he was and remains inimitably himself, satisfied with word upon word, kicked out of the world, longing for a view, buried sometimes, aloft sometimes, wondering where he'd left his coat.

It isThe Cave and the Light by Arthur Herman is 570 page book that examines the respective influences of Plato and Aristotle on western civilization. It is a tour de force. Herman has mastered everything from the pre-Socratics through St. Augustine to Descartes to the French Revolution to Hegel, Marx, Hayek, and Popper.At bottom this is an argument that ideas matter, that they endure, that they affect human, political and economic outcomes. It is persuasive intellectual history and traces my own preoccupations since I was thirteen and began to study Latin, ancient history, and eventually Greek, reading Plato and Aristotle in the original.The fundamental difference between Aristotle and Plato can be stated in less than 570 pages and less than 570 words. Plato conceived the highest order of reality to be the limits of our rational imagination. He posited propositions and then attempted to prove them. He used the deductive method of reasoning as his primary means of suggesting that things that can be perfectly thought can be perfectly realized. Aristotle took a simpler, inductive approach. He looked at what existed and accepted it as reality; then he compared and categorized and analyzed. He did not presuppose things. He saw freedom in diversity and he saw truth there, too. Herman examines their cyclical rises and falls in western history. He explains Plato's decisive effect on Christianity. He explains Aristotle's ascendency in the Middle Ages. He finds Plato in the French and Russian Revolutions and other mass phenomena that have tended toward totalitarianism. Think of Hitler, think of Mussolini, think of anyone who would seek to make the individual fit the system. By contrast, think of Aristotle when you think of major historical actors and moments where the system is forced to adjust to the individual. One extended portion of Herman's book focuses on the checks and balances James Madison built into the U.S. Constitution, those checks and balances being designed to thwart and excessive concentration of power and rule of the few over the many.At the end of the book, Herman plays his personal hand too forcefully, it seems to me. He praises Ayn Rand, whom I take for narrow-minded and unoriginal (and verbose), and he tends to pretend that there is something called ""the free market"" and that it is information (not interest) driven.So Herman is what we in the U.S. call a conservative, but in fairness, he's a good kind of conservative, one who believes that there is room for the dreams of Plato in the human soul and one who clearly believes that preserving our understanding of ourselves is of vital importance.The erudition in this book will shock some readers, but it is clearly written, well-paced, and if it has an intellectual flaw, it's too short. Nonetheless, if you don't know much about Abelard or Rousseau or Socrates, here's a chance to meet them. This is no screed. It's not a lecture in the form of a study. It's fair-minded and compelling, and it hangs together.We can take Plato and Aristotle as metaphors for two human intellectual capacities: the ability to imagine and deduce what it would take to fulfill our dreams and the ability to see one thing and examine its relationship to another. Or we can consider them and their followers, as Herman does, in their historical contexts, and that's a rich road to travel.For more of my s, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle).

I have now finished Tacitus’s masterwork and want to reflect on two aspects of it: the challenges of writing history in ancient times and the brutal severity of Tacitus’s judgments on the emperors Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero.	Tacitus’s Annals, like the four gospels of the New Testament, were composed decades after the fact. We don’t know his source material, though there is a tightness and consistency in what he writes that persuades us he somehow was very close, intellectually, to the period he described. What a fantastically difficult feat! I can tell personal stories from thirty or forty years ago with reasonable (I think) accuracy but chiefly because I was present. I also heard family stories from my parents going back a hundred years ago that I’ve been known to repeat, but in such cases, I can only say that’s what I was told, not necessarily what actually happened. If I were pressed to recount events and speeches that were not personal- or family-based but involved some governor of Pennsylvania in 1964 or the mayor of Philadelphia at the time, my stories would be thin, mere anecdotes at best. Of course I could research an incident, read the newspapers of the day and perhaps relevant reports and memoirs, and even view videotape. And that’s how I would go about writing non-personal history	Tacitus certainly had some written documentation to draw on—he must have—but nothing like what presently exists. So I deduce that he dwelled in an oral culture that sustained facts and stories more thoroughly than ours does. In other words, educated men and women must have carried forward every bit and piece of imperial history, passing it along through the generations, getting some things right and some things wrong. Tacitus’s Annals contain hundreds of names, vignettes, and statements of lineage. They are replete with detail. The great events of the early imperial period that he recounts read, in some sense, like a digest compressed from a more encyclopedic narrative. But there was, to our knowledge, no such encyclopedic narrative. More likely there were long nights of verbal exchange, reflection and correction and numerous sketchy lists of who begat whom—as in the Bible. That Tacitus was able to sift through this relatively thin source material and write a text as rich and dense as he did strikes me as a testament to his moral imagination and determination. It’s a certain kind of genius at work.	This brings me to my second point. The Tiberius, Claudius and Nero we encounter in the Annals of Tacitus were hideous individuals (and this isn’t to mention the brief focus on Caligula). It’s striking that Tacitus had the conviction and sense of intellectual independence necessary to be so open and critical of post-Augustus imperial Rome. Things written and said today about national and international leaders are often condemnatory but no more so than what Tacitus wrote about Roman emperors who were killers, megalomaniacs, matricides, fratricides and uxoricides (wife murderers). The vice of Rome’s early emperors clearly was sustained by two things: 1) a cowardly and cowed senate and 2) an ever-obedient Praetorian guard. Domitian, under whose reign Tacitus himself no doubt cowered, was bad, too. But Tacitus did not dare criticize him, so he resorted to criticizing his predecessors as a way of raising important questions about how decadent Rome became when it made the transition from republic to, essentially, dictatorship. The impact of Tacitus’s work on his contemporary audience must have been profound. He delineated depravity in the mirror of the past so that it could be better seen through the windows of the present. As an historian, he could not retroactively impose justice on imperial miscreants, but he could, and did, sully them forever with accounts of what they’d done and why they’d done it. This had to make his contemporaries pause to consider their own rulers and make them do so within the concise, utterly clear moral terms Tacitus used to dramatize and evaluate his subjects from the past. In short, Tacitus is very difficult to translate, but he’s wonderful to read. His kind of tough-mindedness remains an important lesson to us today. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 30, 2014","Dec 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/448718.The_Annals_of_Imperial_Rome

The book focuses more on Nero than on Seneca for various reasons, chief among them that more is known about Nero, despite the fact that Seneca wrote a half million words of literary philosophy that reflected his personal Stoic values.The crises of this history, then, move from Nero's accession to his decision to kill his step-brother, his mother, and others in the Julio-Claudian clan who might try to take his throne from him. Nero's use of his throne is better termed an abuse of his throne. He was 17 when he assumed power and 32 when he lost it--to a suicide that was as complicated and botched as the suicide he pressed upon Seneca a few years earlier.The issue Romm emphasizes with respect to Seneca is whether he was a hypocritical wealth-and- power-seeker or a virtuous man caught in the toils of power, forced to try to ameliorate Nero's excesses by virtue of his ever-waning influence over him.The facts are that Seneca produced a great deal of lucid, compelling Stoic writing while amassing fabulous wealth and enormous influence, not something the normal Stoic would aspire to. This has always been the criticism of Seneca, even in his day. Knowing what was said of him and that Nero mistrusted and resented him, Seneca offered Nero all his riches if he could be permitted to leave his court and end his days in solitary peace. Nero declined the offer.Ultimately Nero associated Seneca with a conspiracy against him, however, and commanded that Seneca do away with himself. As in so many other instances, Seneca's role in the conspiracy (Piso's Conspiracy) is not quite clear. He was a cautious, wary, experienced man who may have wanted to stay clear of taking Nero on or who may have conceived of himself as the ultimate beneficiary of the conspiracy . . . thereby becoming the next Roman princeps, or emperor.Romm relies heavily on the Annals of Tacitus, which I'm reading concurrently in English fifty years after I translated Tacitus from the Latin. Going straight to Tacitus is in some ways more engaging than reading his work filtered through (but amplified by) Romm.Those who are fascinated with Rome and its emperors will find this a worthwhile book. It doesn't have the panache of its title from front to back, but it does put us in touch with the barbarism of one of the world's first great ""civilizations.""The question the classics often pose to us is how we compare with ancient manners and morals. This is particularly true in the case of Stoicism, which is an ascetic, self-denying philosophy that requires an individual to live modestly but nobly at the same time. Seneca's gift was phrasing the moral dimensions of Stoicism in tight, epigrammatic style. What he points to constantly are issues of self-restraint, detachment, and what might be called integrity, or honor. Coupling this kind of philosopher with Nero generated conflicts. Nero was a vapid Narcissist who didn't hesitate to poison, torture, or simply intimidate someone into committing suicide. As he grew older (I won't say matured) he found Seneca's presence less useful and more irritating. Seneca understood the dynamic. He had outlived his usefulness to the emperor, worn out his welcome.Having been party to some of Nero's excesses, one might have expected some kind of remorse on Seneca's part, some expression of guilt. But he wouldn't do it, and perhaps he couldn't, for if he did, Nero would have seen him dead sooner rather than later. This leads me to a basic question: who among recent and historical figures has really confronted his mistakes and taken himself to task for them? Robert McNamara comes to mind; he ended his life unable to find justification for the policies he advocated in Vietnam. But there aren't many other rulers, or advisors or philosophers who have summed things up negatively. Today George Bush, Dick Cheney and others maintain that their interrogation policies didn't include torture. Nixon didn't repudiate Vietnam as McNamara did. A few of Nixon's Watergate henchmen accepted their punishment without crying foul, but not many. I don't know whether Neville Chamberlain ever publicly addressed his misjudgment of Hitler (this would be worth looking into). It's not an easy thing to do--say you were wrong--but it's not an easy thing to rule and always be right or philosophize and always be right. From Socrates we receive the word ""apology,"" as in ""Socrates's Apology."" In fact, this just means ""explanation"" or ""personal account of the facts."" And in fact, Socrates's apologized by going on the offensive. But at least he set a standard for not expecting much of men who judge other men. He went to his trial expecting to be condemned, perhaps even wanting to be condemned, and he wasn't disappointed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2014","Dec 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18077789-dying-every-day

It is a book that is scientific, humanistic, and philosophical. The sBeing Mortal by Atul Gawande is subtitled, Medicine and What Matters in the End. It is a book that is scientific, humanistic, and philosophical. The subject is how to deal with death. As a surgeon, Gawande brings a special perspective to bear on this topic because, as he illustrates, we in the U.S (and the West in general) have pathologized death. This is to say that we treat death as a medical issue, something we can treat and put off and perhaps even defeat.Gawande argues that there is more to death than thwarting it, postponing it, or ignoring it by warehousing it in nursing homes where the corridors are lined with aged, infirm men and women in their wheelchairs.He offers many compelling case studies that illustrate ways to provide better end-of-life care than simply trying the next exotic medical technique or pharmaceutical. He describes nursing homes that are more like homes than hospitals. He examines the statistical facts about hospice programs that often prolong and improve life better than desperate measures.None of us likes to talk about death or imagine our demise or put our affairs and relations in order, and the worst time to do any of this is after receiving a grim diagnosis of cancer, heart failure, or some other fatal malady. Gawande can't overcome this, but he does show ways in which end-of-life conversations can take place that focus on the priorities and quality of a given life as opposed to the protocols and pretensions of advanced medicine.This isn't a book that damns medicine. Medicine is a wonderful thing that offers cures in so many ways that it couldn't be called into question except in this particular case: when death is almost certain, regardless of medical measures, how should the doctor, patient, and family proceed?Gawande advances the argument, compiled by many experienced practitioners he has studied, that the most important thing to do when dealing with a dying person is to ask questions and listen, not push answers and talk. He notes that when we ship our mortally ill to hospitals, we sometimes rescue them, but in many, many cases we divorce them from the very stuff of their lives, meaning their familiar surroundings, their loved ones, their little pleasures, and their memories.This is truly a profound book that reflects wisely on an issue the United States (and the West in general) has not come to terms with, although promising initiatives have been taken all over the country. When there is no reasonable expectation of survival, isn't it best to focus not on the length of time remaining but rather on the quality of time at hand?For those of us who have dealt with parents or loved ones who have died, this book speaks to a great deal of anguish. One of the maddening things about dying when you are old is that often you die of many things at once. This sometimes is called systemic collapse. That means that the bowels stop functioning and the blood stops flowing and the nerves stop working and the lungs stop pumping air, and everything becomes jumbled--what do you deal with first, second, third? When do you recognize that palliative care, which is care focused on minimizing suffering, is better than curative care?Toward the end of the book, Gawande emphasizes the need for every individual to come to terms with the end of his/her life's narrative, to find an ending appropriate to his/her values and responsibilities and aspirations. Medical schools too often fail when it comes to the meaning of existence; experienced doctors don't know how to confront the dying on the dying's terms, not on the terms established by their training. In this book, Gawande offers a different approach, one he has observed acutely and experienced just as acutely in losing his father. Again, ask, don't tell; listen, don't talk; try to find a way to do for the patient what the patient really wants in his/her final experience of life. A side benefit to this approach is that six months after someone passes away, the survivor's are less likely to feel guilty and depressed because they know they forced senseless medical treatment on a loved one that made things worse, not better, in the final days of life....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20696006-being-mortal

Phillips, a psychoanalyst and writer/editor, takes a uniquely thoughtful approach to Freud, however. He recognizes that Freud himself had little time for biography in the sense that biography is something we all choose about ourselves. We have many biographies and decide which one works best, discarding irrelevant material and highlighting what we take to be the essential. This gives us the birth of today’s trope “the narrative,” as in Obama’s narrative and Oprah’s narrative and so forth.	As a practitioner and man of letters, Phillips homes in on Freud's rich contradictions. Yes, sexuality plays a determinative role in Freudian thought, but beyond that we enter a world of representations, diversions, symptoms, jokes and dreams, all of us struggling with two fundamental things: need and desire. In a sense this is the human evolution of Darwinian evolution, the way we humans do it. Freud struggled early in his career to be part of what we now call “hard science,” the process of discovering universal facts that can be reconfirmed through subsequent experimentation. He became a doctor for this reason, but late in his life, he wryly commented that he hadn’t much use for his medical degree and hadn’t been much of a doctor.	The problem with Freud (and Jung and many others) is that he saw relatively few patients, each of whom was incomparable, so he had no way of testing his findings except through observation. And then he stopped trying to test findings because his observations proved sufficient for the enveloping theories he constructed.	Phillips deals with this issue head-on. We’re a hundred years into true brain science, but the matter of a human body is easier to confirm than interpret, and here is where Freud excelled, using language (“the talking cure”) to probe what language conceals . . . or letting the patient achieve that end.	Phillips writes subtly. Sometimes he is so subtle and precise that the book is slow going, but always interesting. He spends time on “the dog that didn’t bark.” Freud wrote little about his wife, for example. That’s a dog that didn’t bark. Or his six children, six puppies who didn’t bark. But he was a man so focused on his work that he not only paid them as little attention as possible but also played no role in the intellectual/artistic world of Vienna, sticking to his patients and his writing. 	For me one of the key sentences in the book is Freud’s view that we don’t live so much in culture as culture lives in us—and therefore each of us has problems fitting culture’s demands within our needs and desires. Culture is a generality. We are specific. Our lives, shorn of overarching religious interpretation in a secular world, therefore require multiple forms of narrative construction, sometimes contradictory, and our narratives inevitably change somewhat as we move through the life cycle. The fact that our awareness is greater than our immediate consciousness is obvious to us; we pick up more than we know. Thank Freud for that. When we joke, we are attempting to make unacceptable views acceptable. Thank Freud for that. When we dream, we are redescribing the previous day’s events and also demonstrating, though our fantastic imagery and bizarre stories, tremendous artistic powers, hard to understand and harder to access and employ when we are awake. Thank Freud for that.	Phillips follows Freud through his most productive psychoanalytic phase up to age fifty. After that Freud began applying his interpretations to broader life matters—“Civilization and Its Discontents,” for example. Phillips makes the canny point, however, that if Freud had died at fifty, he’d still be a foundational thinker. And he was—a thinker, a philosopher, a mind in search of meaning more than facts.	If you’re still interested in Freud, this is a good book to read. If you’re not still interested in Freud, it’s also a good book to read. I’d like to know Adam Phillips. The quotes he places at the head of his chapters, for example, demonstrate exceptional breadth of knowledge and wide reading. They alone would merit a few hours discussion. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2014","Dec 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18723435-becoming-freud

The booIn Conspirata Robert Harris has again written a novel of classical Rome that is rich with characters, atmosphere, historical detail, and plot. The book focuses on Cicero’s attempts to preserve the authority of the Roman Senate, and the Republic, against Caesar’s dictatorial machinations that flexibly reached both certain patrician quarters and vast tracts of the disenfranchised (but traditionally protected) popular classes, or plebes.The major figures here are Cicero, Pompey the Great, Crassus, Cicero’s secretary Tiro, his wife Terentia, Cataline (here called Catalina), and many others, including the amoral Clodius and his sister Clodia.Cicero is an unlikely hero in many ways, astute and yet shaky politically, not a soldier in a martial culture, and given to anxiety and unattractive dealmaking. But this makes him all the more interesting. He detects Cataline’s plot to storm and dismantle Rome and thwarts it, but this goes too much to his head, so he isn’t quick or flexible enough to outwit the triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey and Crassus, and by the end of this book, he is heading into exile (though history tells us he came back, perhaps as influential as ever.)The novel is fast-paced and well-informed without being too technical and overly detailed. Harris does an excellent job in fleshing out characters like Crassus, Cato (the very younger), Caesar, and a raft of miscreants and plotters.My passage through translating Cicero’s great speeches from Latin into English fifty years ago did seem to me more vivid than what I encounter here, but I’m not sure there’s much a modern author can do about this. A single Ciceronian sentence can go on for ten or fifteen lines of text. That doesn’t make for good novelizing. But at the same time, Cicero would pack so much into his long sentences that finding an end to them brought a fantastic sense of relief and understanding. He possessed a rhetorical mind equal to any. Think of Churchill because Churchill thought of Cicero; think of many another great Western orator, because they, too, thought of Cicero.One aspect of life in Cicero’s Rome that comes through Conspirata with disturbing clarity is how dangerous and fickle it was. Cicero defended governance by the upper class, not a popular stance today, but one can see how tense and ready to burst Rome was as its wealth and decadence grew. Pompey the Great brought fantastic riches to an empire that still thought of itself as a kind of city. Caesar capitalized on the instability this wealth engendered. Then he was killed. Finally, Augustus established order, but the beloved Roman Republic was dead. One of Cicero’s greatest legacies was bringing Greek philosophy into the Latin language and amplifying Latin to accommodate it. He was, as Harris portrays him, a thoughtful man of public affairs. Today we can look around and find few public leaders with a broad intellectual horizon. Though he does not flaunt it, Obama has such an horizon. Churchill had it and so did Woodrow Wilson. Sometimes this is a weakness, perhaps more often than not, but it’s a fascinating characteristic and introduces a kind of melancholy into learned leadership. Such figures know the outer limits of what philosophers can dream, and they know the limits of what politicians can accomplish. All too often the ultimate agent of change is war, and no one who is widely read can be an enthusiast of violence rather than reason....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2014","Nov 27, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3629971-conspirata

The most extraordinary thing that can be said about them, and this should be said quickly, is that what Marcus Aurelius thought in his maturity (165-175 A.D.) prefigures some of the best thinking current today. His version of Stoicism in many ways is virtually identical to what goes by the name of cognitive behavioral therapy. In fact, the Meditations are representative of the best of many traditions, East and West. Their core concern is right thinking, stripping away illusions and misconceptions, identifying reason with the wisdom of nature, and using the fact of constant flux, whereby life implies death and vice versa, as an antidote to anxiety and depression.	Because this is a short work, its repetitiveness is tolerable. But it evidently is repetitive because the emperor needed to jot these insights down over and over again to make them stick not only in his mind but in his life. 	One of the shallowest formulas one has heard in recent decades goes something like, “Perception is everything.” I heard a lecture earlier this week to which I objected because part of its thesis was that Ronald Reagan was a “great” president because he “performed the presidency” brilliantly. This is the mental masturbation of the twentieth century’s marketing mentality and feeds right into the primacy of money, associating value with transient grandeur, showiness, and the divinity of things in general--the more you have, the more godly you are.	Perception is critical to Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome, in an entirely different sense. For him the key is to perceive the truth of things, their littleness (his own included) in the scheme of eternity, and as a consequence to attain peace of mind, not be troubled by gossip, jealousy, the fact that ultimately Alexander the Great, Augustus, and everyone else will die and be transmuted by nature into something else.	Here we see the connection to cognitive behavioral therapy, which emphasizes using reason to dissect troubling distortions in one’s thinking, imagining one has failed, or is disliked, or always comes up short, or is bound to fall short when, in fact, each of these distortions can be shown to be unreasonable.	The existential element in Marcus Aurelius’s approach is clear and explicit: if you have in fact fallen short to this point, take a different path from here on; don’t permit yourself to dwell on the irrecoverable past since it can’t be changed; let it go; face the fact that everyone fails without generalizing that into total self-condemnation.	 But at the same time, realize that your desires, your lusts, your anger, your obsessions will not alter the fact that your time as a human being is limited. So don’t get too down on yourself, but don’t get too full of yourself . . . again, even if you are an emperor.	There is no doubt that Marcus Aurelius remains one of the more unique ruler/leaders in history. I can’t think of a comparable political figure, so penetrating and severe with himself, so learned, and so articulate. The Meditations remind me in many ways of Tolstoy’s notebooks for eloquence, self-criticism, and erudition. The difference of course is that initially Tolstoy lived the life of a famous literary figure; then he became a religious leader. But Tolstoy never had to bear the responsibility of governance. He was more free to think as his spirit moved him. Marcus Aurelius had to steal moments from his public existence to anchor himself in these private reflections. That’s not easy for anyone to do. As Kissinger said once, you assume office and from that point forward you draw on what you learned beforehand; it isn’t possible to develop new insights and act at the same time. The profundity of the Meditations suggests that Marcus Aurelius was an exception to this rule, always striving for new formulations of eternal truths in order to perform his official functions justly and effectively....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Nov 23, 2014","Nov 23, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1920125.Meditations

Seventy years later it remains a distinctive book, rich with erudition about the Rome of Augustus, Tiberius and Caligula, and somewhat contrarian in that it “tells” more than it “shows.” Some critics and publishers consider this a no-no, but it works. Claudius, who succeeded Caligula, was an historian, and so his account of Rome at its peak and Rome at a nadir, is a history, not a drama.	And yet there is plenty of drama here, buttressed by Claudius’s sharp wit, knack for moving the tale along, and ability to make characters real. After you read it, you’ll feel you know Augustus for his cautious, equivocations, Livia, his wife, for her cunning and ruthlessness, Tiberius for his balky, perverse arrogance, and Caligula, possibly the best portrait in the gallery although it’s the shortest, for his vicious madness.	With rulers like these, all of them carelessly bloodthirsty and self-interested, it’s a wonder that Rome retains even today a certain luster. Its empire was extensive, to be sure, but the number of minor and unnamed figures thoughtlessly beheaded and tortured in I, Claudius might run into the thousands.	Claudius pauses at one point in the narrative to note that he is focusing on a small ruling class which isn’t representative of the millions who lived under Rome’s rule, but it was that capricious, violent ruling class that we think of, perversely, when we think of Augustus as the wisest of the Caesars and Livia, his consort, as the most able and insightful of the general nobility that, by marriage found its way into near divinity.	The reason Claudius can tell all these tales is twofold: First, Graves, his puppeteer, possessed exceptional knowledge of the ancient world. He knew Rome’s customs, its landscape, its families, and its wars in Germany, France, the Balkans, and North Africa. Second, Claudius the character in the novel is happy to cede the stage to relatives who are not cursed by lameness and stuttering from infancy on. This gives Claudius perspective, and when he surprisingly finds himself named emperor after Caligula is murdered, he has the trained eye of the library researcher to rely upon now that he possesses access to Rome’s most secret archives.	Rome’s decay actually began earlier than many might think. At one and the same time, Augustus was the steadiest of emperors and the beginning of the end. He wasn’t personally corrupted by power to the extent that Tiberius and Caligula were; it didn’t lodge itself in his sexual organs or take over his brain, but Livia did a lot of dirty work so that Augustus didn’t have to, and therein lies the problem: she was determined to see her son by a first marriage, Tiberius, succeed Augustus, and that was at best a mixed blessing. Tiberius himself knew it would be better for Rome to return to being a republic; he said as much; but he played along, ever more remote, ever more decadent.	In fact it was hundreds of years of institutional structure building that saw Rome through its imperial phase to the end. First and foremost, Rome had great military institutions. Second, it had mastered engineering and shipbuilding. Third, it had a corrupt but effective way of exacting taxes and grain from its imperial subordinates. Fourth, the Romans learned how to think and write from the Greeks, and this helped them develop a great literary tradition, including Virgil, Catullus, Cicero, Horace, Livy and Tacitus. One might ask, “What’s so important about a literary tradition?” I suppose I would say that in the case of Rome it was essential to its sense of identity and it also was essential, from time to time, in generating self-criticism that was, to use a Latin-based word, salubrious. 	Through Claudius, Graves gives us all this and relates how a fantastically complex society managed and abused itself. The shock to today’s reader is that the Romans can be seen as a template for terrorist organizations like ISIL. The challenge implicit in Graves’ novel is for us to recognize the dangers of responding to terror with terror and creating a governmental structure that rots from the top down out of fear that it will not be privy to every secret, every threat, every real or imagined assault on its secure grasp of power. The lands over which the West and ISIL, Hamas, Hezbollah, and others struggle are exactly the lands where Rome suffered some of its cruelest defeats and learned lessons in applying unbridled power that it would have been better off not learning.	But enough of the political comparisons. It’s a solid novel written with authority and wit. In a way it has to tell the tale it tells because the facts it presents are better than most fictions....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2014","Nov 19, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18765.I_Claudius

Burr was a Revolutionary Wa	Gore Vidal’s historical novel, Burr is a first-rate account of one of the most controversial figures in American history. Burr was a Revolutionary War officer, a N.Y. state assemblyman and senator, and a vice president (under Thomas Jefferson). He famously killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel because Hamilton would not explain or apologize for a remark he made discrediting Burr’s honor. Later, he became entangled in a wild effort to somehow conquer Mexico, seizing it and other Spanish possessions (Texas, for instance), and ruling it, not necessarily annexing it to the U.S.	Aside from being a master novelist with a great sense of scene and pace, Vidal excelled in characterization. He wrote his various books about U.S. history with a purpose in mind. He wanted to present George Washington as a lucky dunderhead who never really won a battle but won the Revolutionary War and the presidency. He wanted to present Thomas Jefferson as a repellant, manipulative hypocrite. He wanted to offer up Alexander Hamilton as emblematic of a centralizing, almost monarchical view of the United States that found its finest expression in Abraham Lincoln’s refusal to allow the southern states to secede. By contrast he accurately presents Jefferson as of the view that a state that joined the union could leave the union. Obviously Jefferson, the more democratically-oriented of the two, had little in common with Hamilton.	These are compelling portraits. They capture the contingencies of American history, the near-collapses, the manipulations, the limited rights of early Americans to vote. The problem I think Vidal had with how U.S. history developed was that the country became too powerful, too arrogant, too Washington-centric, and too imperialistic.	Burr is the most intriguing figure in the book named for him, although he challenges credulity in many respects. Time and again, he turns the other cheek, simply turns away, laughs off setbacks and chicanery, and generally is not disposed to take life too seriously, especially when he is broke and has to do almost anything to satisfy his creditors. This is appealing and vaguely comical even if the events in play were deadly serious. Again, I suppose one could say Vidal uses Burr to mock the U.S. and bring it down to size. There are no heroes here, Burr included, who do not have feet of clay.	William Styron once said that if you are going to write an historical novel, it may be best not to know too much history. In this case, I suspect Vidal knew plenty of U.S. history. His command of central relationships and events is firm. Burr may come across as a bit too whimsical, but he does not escape the mishaps of his biography.	The book is largely narrated by one Charles Schuyler, a law clerk under Burr who wants to become a journalist and is tempted to research Burr’s relationship with Martin Van Buren by higher-level journalists who want to stop Van Buren from reaching The White House. These editors suspect Van Buren is Burr’s illegitimate son, and of course, any relationship to Burr would be poison for a presidential candidate. Schuyler has his own life, which comprises an interesting subplot, but he also displays the skill of enticing Burr to write many passages of memoir that are regularly inserted into the novel, carrying the action forward from Burr’s perspective and in his own words.	Burr frequently opines that the constitution won’t last. Others agree with him. He gives it fifty years or so, but ultimately secession movements in both New England and the south will tear it apart. Or it will be torn apart fighting over which of those two regions would gain control of the west. History proves this wrong, but again, Vidal enjoys toying with the counter-factual possibilities in a book written during the Vietnam War when America’s huge size, resources and power did it, and Vietnam, more harm than good.	The anti-hero Burr is a perfect focal point for revisionism. Was he wrong to kill Hamilton in a duel of honor? Did anything he attempted vis-a-vis Mexico justify being tried for treason against the United States? (He was acquitted, but the stain of the trial lingered.) Are we justified in thinking of Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison and other Founding Fathers as men of impeccable ethics, deep wisdom, great objectivity and so forth? Vidal reminds us, as a novelist can do so well, that these men were men, mortals, self-contradictory, magnificent in some ways, but in other ways not so splendid.	The novel’s ending, which is unexpected, crashes down fast but convincingly. It is something Vidal made up, pure fancy, but provocative. I won’t spoil it here, but I will say I liked it. From beginning to end, this is a novel preoccupied with the earthiness of history. Its research is done well; its perspectives may drive some readers crazy (politically, I mean); but its strength of narrative and characterization keep you turning the pages with interest....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 11, 2014","Nov 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8722.Burr

Stone represents one of the most extraordinary late career transitions I know of. For decades Stone was a tireless journalist,covering the major issues of his day. He wrote about Senator McCarthy, Vietnam, Nixon, everything, always from a rigorous but definitely liberal, or left, perspective with a strong emphasis on free speech and the public's right and need to know if a democracy is to function.At one point Stone launched I.F. Stone's Weekly, which he wrote by himself over an 18 year period. Dostoevsky did something similar, but only for a few years and from a right-wing, nationalist perspective. Entering old age, slowed by heart issues, Stone went into semi-retirement and returned to his college passion for philosophy. This led, ultimately, to a book set two thousand years ago focused on Socrates and buttressed by an extraordinary intellectual effort by Stone, who learned Greek well enough to read some of the greatest writers who have ever written.This book is a strong reproach both for Socrates and the citizens of Athens who condemned him to death for not believing in the gods and corrupting the city's youth. The reproach aimed at Socrates is that he refused to play politics or enter into the city's great issues, siding too often with anti-democratic oligarchs. The reproach aimed at the citizens of Athens is that they convicted him for breaking a law that had never been written (Aristophanes had great fun mocking the gods) and denying him the right to say to the youth of the city whatever he wanted.I studied Latin and Greek intensively long ago and can verify that Stone makes exceptional use of literary, historical and philosophical sources both from Greece and Rome. Somehow he converted himself into a PhD quality expert while passing through his seventies. To me there are multiple ironies in his approach. First, the case he makes against Socrates' anti-democratic views is pretty light when divorced (which of course is impossible) from Plato's presentation of him. Plato absolutely had no time for the rabble making civic decisions. Read his Republic or The Laws and you will run into an other-wordly tyranny, impossible to enact. Second, Stone takes the activist citizen's approach that everyone should play a role in the life of a city or state, especially someone as gifted as Socrates. I would dispute that. It's entirely acceptable and even necessary for certain individuals to stand outside the fray as best they can in order to think as purely as they can. Proof of this is Stone himself. This ferociously written book is based on research, logic, and persuasive inference. It is a masterpiece of spotting moments in Athenian history when there was a dog that didn't bark. Who originally developed the kind of relentless pursuit of knowledge Stone exhibits? I can't think of anyone more likely than Socrates. So perhaps Socrates sneered at his fellow citizens and perhaps he baited them into condemning him to death. How important is that when viewed against the backdrop of thousands of years of influence on human thought and inquiry?Stone was a crusader. I would agree with most of his views as a critic of contemporary America, but I think he simply rules out the role someone like Socrates has to play if he is going to pioneer utterly new modes of thought.At the end of the book, Stone brilliantly--just like Socrates--sketches out how Socrates could have persuaded the citizens of Athens to set him free. He is not unsympathetic toward Socrates, obviously, except on the cardinal points of insisting on speaking up, exercising one's right to free speech, and conceding the wisdom of democracy.Frankly, this is a hell of a book, a tour de force by an aging man searching for the truth two millennia and more ago. I just think it's one-sided, despite the virtuoso advice Stone would have offered Socrates had he been fortunate enough to be his lawyer. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 04, 2014","Nov 04, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51330.The_Trial_of_Socrates

Improbably, she begins to pass the time, when she has enough energy, by carving boats and attaching messages to them in little bottles. She then sets them afloat where, downstream, they are received and cherished by two children who come to see her and convey to her how much they have meant to them. In addition, they perform chores and provide company that sustains her as winter hits the mountains hard. The story ends hard, too, but I won’t spoil it.Often Bass indulges in improbability without really accommodating it to his realistic style of writing. The first story, “Pagans,” suffers from this defect. Certain actions take place that just are believable but are not couched in a tone that invites the willing suspension of disbelief. The same problem shows up in a story called “Fiber,” which is more a rant than a story. Here the narrator tells of hoisting 400 pound logs on his shoulders. Nope, not happening.I don’t know if the events in “Titan” are founded in fact, but here Bass so carefully presents a weather phenomenon that I was prepared to swallow the story whole.“The Canoeists” gives Bass an opportunity to unfold his true command of the natural world with great lyrical effect. He can be a terrifically moving writer when he understates things, underplays them, and does not introduce “tall tale” elements that raise questions about his intentions.One consistent strength of Bass’s writing is the clarity and force of his sentences. They are solid and read well aloud. Politically or culturally, I’m not sure which, Bass is on the side of nature and the grand scheme of the cosmos. He’s on solid ground here because he knows the ground, the rivers, the skies, the coasts, and mountains, but one beautifully paced and written story, “Her First Elk,” concerns a young girl--the character he calls Jyl--shooting an elk and building a set of relationships upon this act that to me represents an unimaginative approach to the spiritual. Since Bass rants a bit in a few places in this collection, I will rant. I don’t see how sneaking up on beautiful animals and slaughtering them with high-powered rifles can lead to spiritual fulfillment and deep knowledge. To me that’s hogwash, infantile and cruel. It certainly undermines an otherwise subtly written story about a girl ultimately meeting two neighbors who become more important to her than the dead elk....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 28, 2014","Oct 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14223.The_Lives_of_Rocks

The other girl and the guys are students at a Buffalo university. Guy number one, Nathaniel, first falls for good-looking girl number one, Theresa, when they help each other find a party they’re going to. She’s a knock-out, flip, provocative, and Nathaniel thinks immediately he loves her. Waiting at the party is guy number two, Jerome, who has some mysterious appeal to everyone, including Theresa, and apparently has decided he’s going to haunt Nathaniel, assume his identity, work something out with Theresa, and generally make an eccentric asshole of himself in the service of art . . . or philosophy . . . or soul-work.The setting is early 70s. I was in college then. The references are generally accurate, if overblown, as is the entire short novel. The idea is that the receding tide of the 60s still kept people turned-on, enlightened, and so forth. Well, sort of, yes, but not with the phony pomposity of this crew. For reasons that aren’t clear, Nathaniel decides Theresa is just a physical wonder and drops her. Instead, he falls in love with Jamie, the lesbian cab driver, who tells him it’s not going to work but sleeps with him anyway.All the while Jerome is in the background, engineering personal problems for Nathaniel, such as having his apartment burglarized and, ultimately, having Jamie mugged and raped.The chattering and very normal style of the narration buckles under these events, as does Nathaniel. He has some kind of break-down and drifts off campus into a series of mindless jobs that ultimately lead to satisfaction with a wife and two kids--very bourgeois.Nothing is very well-developed but fortunately the story moves quickly into a recap of Nathaniel’s recovery and, years later, an invitation from Jerome to visit him in L.A., where he hosts a radio program called American Evenings. Long story short: Jerome pursued Nathaniel because of a gay attraction. He also wrote a manuscript that detailed the ins and outs of what happened in Buffalo, pretending that Nathaniel was the narrator. Nathaniel hates this. What he loves, by now, is the endearments of his very average family life. He doesn’t care about Norman O. Brown or Nietzsche anymore. He just wants to climb out of Jerome’s sick narrativeWhat ultimately happened to Theresa and Jamie? In various ways, they don’t make it through the story. Jamie left Nathaniel a goodbye letter, but he chose not to open it. To me this is a bit of authorial negligence, if not cowardice. There are a number of Baxter’s literary jokes embedded in this text; maybe this is one of them. If so, it falls as flat as the others. We don’t need strange intrusions by Jane Austen’s fiction. Nor do we need Nathaniel’s sister, who has been mute for years, suddenly regaining her voice when she rushes to him after his breakdown.

Naipaul is a travel book focused on a contemplation of African religions and beliefs. It begins in Uganda and continues on through Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Gabon, and South Africa.As with all Naipaul’s books, this one achieves its authority with an understated but stately consistency and knack for the telling detail. He is a master stylist in that he maintains the same tone and pace regardless of what he’s writing about, and he is uncompromising in his reporting.There’s very little about Islam in this book, which is good, because Naipaul is relentlessly negative about Islam; the one vivid story he tells here about a South African woman of mixed race seeking an identity by marrying a Muslim cleric illustrates this perfectly: the woman fails to achieve a thing.The spice of the book is its colorful rendition of animistic, spiritual beliefs, which vary from place to place but follow the same pattern of initiation, belief in “the ancestors,” bloody sacrifices of innocent animals, and lots and lots of superstition and fear of magic and demons, some of which can hide right under your foot.Naipaul begins in Uganda because he had a fellowship there forty years ago and wants to start this trek in a place where he might feel somewhat at home. Not the case. The population in Uganda has exploded, AIDS and Idi Amin notwithstanding, and crowded into cities like Kampala,once beautiful, no longer so.At each stop Naipaul has a guide or what anthropologists (and spies) call an informant. Not infrequently these informants are misinformed, and the results are distressingly comical. What he sees are often enactments, not the real thing; shows, not true frenzy.The best part of the book deals with Gabon. Here the world is really the forest, which is dark and deep, full of mystery, endless, and yet endlessly carved up by Chinese and Japanese industry. Naipaul nonetheless creates a sense of totally integrated life where one form of energy is transmuted into another, and the blackness of night is as complete as the din of the animal and bird cries.At certain points Naipaul finds interlocutors who are political. Jerry Rawlings is one, Winnie Mandela is another. Winnie Mandela, who appears near the end of the book, is vivid and real and, as Naipaul presents her, a great antidote to the westernized image of her as someone who simply rode on Nelson Mandela’s coattails. She’s bitter and eloquent and realistic and disarming. A great portrait.Another figure who appears is one of our own “ancestors” Albert Schweitzer. I hadn’t known he was more missionary than medical figure, nor had I ever had the sense that he was less than a great, self-sacrificing humanitarian. Naipaul raises questions about this, good ones.The problem of South Africa in many ways is a good way to end this book. The figures portrayed here are the ones least integrated in the old traditions, and the prospects for a multi-cultural society are dubious. Having not ended apartheid by means of a civil war, the two major groups, whites and blacks, don’t know what they’re all about. Meanwhile South Africa winds down like a watch that needs some attention, but no one is giving it that attention.For sheer ebullience, there is always Nigeria, the other great giant of Africa. Here, as in other countries, Naipaul sometimes has to back away from his quest--he’s facing too much, knows that there is a point when, as he puts it, an observer becomes an intruder,wears out his welcome.For those who know something about Naipaul’s personal character and behavior, it will come as no shock that I found his recurrent expressions of sympathy for cats and dogs (both animal types are appallingly regarded and treated in Africa) rather disarming. He genuinely seems moved by small, fury creatures living on the knife edge of sacrifice.Overall, I’d say this book wouldn’t impress an anthropologist. There is no theory of religion and society here. It’s an eloquent travelogue that seems honest in its reporting, acute in its judgments, and not prone to distortion. For those of us who have spent some time traveling in difficult countries, The Masque of Africa will save us some discomfort.

The book comprises two parts.FiKeynes by Peter Clarke is a relatively short study of what Clarke calls the 20th century’s most influential economist. The book comprises two parts.First, Clarke offers Keynes’ biography, including his emergence as a major figure in British and international life. Next, Clarke s Keynes’ evolution as an economist.Keynes the man was active socially and bisexually, ultimately settling into an apparently happy marriage with a Russian ballerina whom his Bloomsbury friends did not much like but Keynes adored. He was a great figure at his university, Cambridge, and in the British treasury at Whitehall, and in the counsels of industry, as well. He sponsored and fostered the arts, he made millions as an investor, and he lived well, owning a town and a country house and commuting by Rolls Royce. His quick-witted but apparently amiable disposition made him easy to like and difficult to defeat in debate. He had a mind that broke many molds, pushing people to understand that a government, by stimulating demand, could bring down unemployment and thereby repay the government’s investment in its own society. But Keynes was an active representative of the nation, as well. He was a key interlocutor with the U.S. in the Lend Lease arrangements that helped Britain get through WWII and he performed heroically after WWII in helping give birth to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.What more could you ask from life than to be so engaged in both thought and action while maintaining a circle of friends in high politics, literature and the arts? Clarke’s book isn’t hagiography primarily because Keynes wasn’t a saint. He didn’t always have the right answers and he changed his mind as economic conditions mandated. He was generous in acknowledging the contributions of other economists, and he left a legacy that was so broad that the monetarist Milton Friedman said that in one sense we were all Keynesians and in another sense none of us were Keynesians.In the US it appears to me that Keynes largely is understood as favoring deficit spending to help economies get out of recessions. Today one would think of Paul Krugman, who has cogently argued that the Obama Administration did many of the right things in dealing with the Great Recession, but not enough of the right things.Like Keynes, Krugman focuses hard on unemployment. Janet Yellen, chairperson of the FED, does the same. She has a dual mandate from Congress: maintain the stability of the currency (fight inflation, in other words) and also promote employment. In a sense, these are are conflicting tasks. The stability of the currency, or low inflation, matters a lot to the rich. Jobs matter a lot to the poor and out of work. If Keynes has a general influence over what has happened in the U.S. in the last six years, it’s been to keep trying things, even as the Republican House of Representatives believes we’ve outspent our means and should cut back--which would protect the currency’s value but worsen the unemployment numbers. In Europe Keynes may have been less influential than in the U.S. (remember, Keynes died seventy years ago). Only now, as Europe flirts with a second recession have policymakers there begun letting more money flow. It’s obviously needed. Germany has terrible memories of inflation in the 1920s. France is right, though, in refusing to accept the disciplines implicit in the EU’s unsuccessful efforts to get the continent moving again.I’d recommend Clarke’s book to anyone interested in Keynes, or to anyone who wants to learn about him. It happens that I read this book right after reading an excellent book about Jean-Paul Sartre, and I asked myself which of these giants of the 20th century mattered the most and made the most sense. The fact is that Sartre’s leftism was informed but not highly educated in matters of economics and finance. That does not disqualify him from competing with Keynes in the sense that Keynes himself placed great emphasis on the hard to estimate impact of expectations and outlooks on economic futures. What Sartre stood for was socio-economic equality, and he linked this to the ethics of everyone’s individual freedom and dignity. This has left a powerful legacy. Keynes, by contrast, understood the minutiae of how economies work, and they don’t work with the egalitarian elegance of Sartre’s propositions. Sartre liked to style himself a rationalist, not a metaphysical dreamer. We can grant him that but not in comparison to the multi-decade intellectual leadership Keynes gave the world. He took “the animal spirits” of humanity and developed macroeconomic understandings we still rely upon. By the same token, we still rely upon the IMF and World Bank. In addition, Keynes took the trouble to understand that writing well matters, so while he was not the imaginative equal of Sartre, he was good with the pen as well....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 09, 2014","Oct 09, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21303504-keynes

Political scientist John Gerassi's father, Fernando, was one of Jean-Paul Sartre's closest friends, and Gerassi grew up as a member of what Simone de Beauvoir referred to as ""the family.""At the end of Sartre's life, Gerassi, by then an American, had an extended series of conversations with Sartre that form the body of this book. It's a wonderful reflection on the intellectual, cultural, and historical issues that were central to the 20th century. Or should I say that were to the left of the center of the 20th century?In this wide-ranging sequence, Sartre is completely honest in his self-criticism, criticisms of others, and of history itself. Gerassi, who taught at Queens College in New York, displays a range and subtlety of understanding that to me, at least, makes me think he must have held back most of what he knew from his students. He was exceptionally informed and engaged. It's hard to imagine the average undergraduate being able to follow him . . . or, of course, Sartre.Sartre by now is more or less a name. In his heyday, he was the most famous intellectual in France, Europe and the world. He wrote serious plays, novels, and philosophy. He commented on all the major issues of the day. He wasn't a communist, but he appreciated communism. Toward the end of his life he spurred on what became a kind of fashion in France, anarchistic Maoism. His issue from the beginning was freedom. First man accepts that he is free. Then he must commit to the action that his freedom suggests to him. In a nutshell, that's Sartre's philosophy.He felt that all of history, to the present day, represented a class struggle that kept the lower class unaware of its freedom, and he also felt that as the prime capitalist nation, the United States bore great responsibility for the persistence of classes in modern society. He was no ingenue. He understood the power of capital. But he was something of a Quixote, dreaming of a spontaneous revolution that would disallow and disobey the controlling regimes of finance, trade, labor, currency values, and the like.I hesitate to go on about Sartre's thoughts because they are so much more clearly and simply represented in this remarkable book. Sartre rightly held Gerassi as a valid interlocutor, someone with whom he could debate, be frank, laugh, and ask important questions.Part of the vitality of this book comes from the intellectual vitality of Europe from the 30s through the 70s. We have nothing similar in the U.S. today. The crudeness of sound bite politics here is dreadful. This is why it's so important to be reminded that there are alternatives.In Europe one can have private conversations on this level, but European politics aren't much better than North American politics. At best we all have begun to focus on one central issue: income inequality. It's a valid and important issue. Why should a CEO make 400 times more than a plant manager or assembly-line worker? Why should five percent of Americans control over twenty-five percent of the wealth (much more)? At a point in time, around 1960, Sartre accepted the fact, philosophically, that everything is politics, and he made his case incessantly on behalf of limitless freedom. He considered himself a realist, but in fact he was more of an idealist. A more realistic critique comes from economists like Paul Krugman, who points out that in America, at least, the less the income inequality, the better the overall economy performs. It literally grows faster for obvious reasons: more people have more money to spend. (The rich don't much like Krugman; even Obama keeps his distance,but like Sartre, Krugman won a Nobel Prize, too.)Anyone interested in the history of the 20th century, World War II, the Cold War, and/or France will find this an exceptionally engaging book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 06, 2014",not set,"Oct 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6764486-talking-with-sartre

I suppose I wanted to see if I was wrong when I first wrote him off. Well, I wasn't. It's just that over time he has become a much better writer. Back then Martin Amis wrote stories as if they were basically jokes. He'd develop a counterfactual conceit--for instance, that poems were treated like blockbusters by Hollywood moguls--and explore how weird that would be. Pretty weird. Or he would spin out a tale told by a janitor on Mars, eager to communicate with earth (or earthlings). Or he would describe a world in which the gays dominated the scene and the heterosexuals (the hets) were forced to play the role of the gays (mocked, dissed, what have you.) Lots of upside down and inside out stuff. Wouldn't it be funny if this . . . ? Wouldn't it be funny if that . . . ? I won't belabor the point. One can see even in Amis's early stories the striking wit, gift with words and images, and pulsing cultural awareness that ultimately made him a significant writer. But he wasn't really interesting; he was the son of a better-known writer who worked his way through his apprenticeship and kept going. Good for him.

Schmidt is lonely, rich, and lost. He and Mary were a good pair although he fooled around on most business trips. They had a large income, a large NY apartment, and a large house on Long Island. None of this means much to him with her passing. He isn’t much of an anti-Semite but enough of one, by rumor at least, to turn Charlotte’s fiancee’s family against him. Having retired a bit early and spent his entire life being a lawyer, just a a lawyer, he doesn’t know what to do with himself except start up an affair with an avid Puerto Rican waitress at the local mid-quality restaurant, O’Henry’s.	The curiosity of this novel is that it’s more a narrative sequence than a novel. Schmidt has some encounters with his college roommate, he is haunted by a bum who moved into the nearest Long Island village, he fends off his daughter’s future mother-in-law who either wants to screw him or cure him (she’s a psychoanalyst), he takes a brief vacation on a distant island far, far up the Amazon, he drinks a lot, he wrestles with estate issues and how to give Charlotte what’s her due without lowering his own standard of living, he has wild, abundant sex with Carrie, the waitress, while allowing her to continue to sleep with her sometimes boyfriend, a leech and a nuisance. But in his sixties, should Schmidt care, or simply be grateful for the kindness of young girls?	My sense is that the key to the story is the bum who appears now and then and whom, one foggy night, Schmidt, kills in a car accident. He’s Schmidt’s alter ego, his Id, the sloppy, smelly, disagreeable interior personality normally kept under wraps beneath Schmidt’s Harvard education and carefully developed legal persona. 	The point of this book--you’ll notice I keep changing the way I refer to it, first a novel, then a narrative sequence, then a story,and now a book--seems to be that it’s disagreeable and somewhat degrading to enter retirement alone. Schmidt is a cultivated but not very sympathetic man. He plots a lot. He keeps his daughter (also not very sympathetic) at arm’s length. And yet he remembers how one is supposed to act and chastises himself for falling short, which he often does. Almost everyone on earth, except the waitress, is a nuisance or a menace or a blighted memory to him. He doesn’t like his house cleaning crew. He doesn’t like his former partners. He doesn’t want to go to Venice with his one true friend--the college roommate--because the traveling party will all be married, and if there’s a single woman involved, Schmidt will have to be gallant and might not enjoy that.	So here is a self-centered, highly intelligent man who is dimly aware that the forces stirring within him don’t correspond at all to the way he’s lived his life, or what’s expected of him, and ultimately, he doesn’t care. He’s going to have things the way he wants them anyway.	The crisis hovers around this tale but never quite lands. In a way, that’s subtle.

He, in turn, is an addictive gambler who is ruined by one of Dickens’ more intriguing villains, Daniel Quilp, a vile dwarf and old-time loan shark.The novel was a sensation when it was released in serial form. The question on both sides of the Atlantic was whether Nell died or survived in the end.Of course, she died, an angel incarnate who had to fly away to some Dickensian version of heaven, far, far from the terrible world in which we live.Almost nothing Dickens wrote better illustrates the way he transformed Romanticism into Sentimentalism. Lurking behind the twisting, turning plot, full of good and bad characters, one can detect a theatrical urge to outwit some of the horrors of existence by means of lachrymose melodrama.As Dickens’ fourth novel, The Old Curiosity Shop displays the power and progress of a genius finding his voice. For me the best passages come on the very first pages when an unnamed narrator sets the stage--London--for what ultimately becomes Nell’s demise. Throughout the novel similar passages yield an eerie, suffocating atmosphere that reflect Dickens at his best. But at the same time, the heroine is virtually an allegorical figure of no intrinsic interest or credibility, and it does take an awfully long time for an unnamed, mysterious family member to emerge in full . . . too late to save Nell or the grandfather who was, in fact, the mysterious fellow’s brother.There are scenes and characters in this novel that are funny, biting, and supremely self-confident. Dickens more or less grew up as a court reporter, and he’s never better than when he is satirizing the ways of English justice.But the heart of the affair is the desperate attempt to find and save the little girl, and as we know, Dickens undoubtedly chose to foreground such a situation because he felt abandoned by his indigent father and forced to work in a miserable factory as a child. Like Dostoevsky, Dickens had a simple ethic in some senses: God can only be God if children are safe. Also like Dostoevsky, Dickens had the ability to abstract himself from his convictions in order for the darker images within him to emerge. Ultimately, this is what gave his later, greater novels their power. The Old Curiosity Shop is a tear-jerker, and as such it is a kind of early moral surrender. Reductionism of this kind is something that an artist cannot afford.

Kennedy is a succinct and balanced account of an enormously complex, cunning and yet cautious man whose attitude toward the American presidency seems to have been that power, once attained, is better preserved than employed. He won The White House by a very narrow margin, never had control of his own party in Congress, and saw more wisdom in postponing battles than taking them on.In a sense Kennedy wasn’t the liberal, activist politician that is part of his legend. He spoke better than he acted. He did two or three remarkable things as president. The Cuban Missile Crisis, which helped provoke by letting the Soviets think he was a push-over, may have been his greatest moment on the world stage. As we now know, he got the best out of his divided advisors, kept his own counsel, relied heavily on his brother, Robert, and ultimately made the right moves to avert a terrible escalation. Domestic affairs did not interest JFK much, nor did he really understanding the workings of the American economy. He was slow to embrace the Civil Rights movement, and one could say he never really did. He always feared a white Southern backlash against him in his own party. The strongest things his administration did for black Americans were driven by Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General.JFK’s charm, wit, good looks and eloquence had their dark sides. He was a pathological womanizer who had grown up rich, spoiled, and sickly. He chased women to make up for lost time, because he could get away with it, and perhaps because he was hyper-sexed due to the drugs that kept him upright. He also could be vulgar in word and behavior, a spoiled brat kind of man.Brinkley does a good job of incorporating the views of other policymakers and historians in his mixed account of JFK. The final chapters dwell on Vietnam. Kennedy had traveled the world and met many world leaders. He wasn’t ignorant, but he was as naive about Vietnam as his successor, Lyndon Johnson, and lacked the cynical but strategic mind of Johnson’s successor, Richard Nixon. Brinkley reserves judgment, but it is difficult to believe that Kennedy would not have taken us further into Vietnam had he been reelected. Having endured the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba, he wanted to win something somewhere, and he did not know enough about Asia to realize that it wasn’t a good place for him to take a stand.JFK’s popularity was remarkably high throughout his presidency. People liked what they saw of him, his wife and children. The public had no idea that he carried on more sordidly than any president before or after him, though I’m sure he would have defended himself by saying it was all in good fun.Then came JFK’s death. If you were alive then, as I was, you remember everything because you saw it all non-stop. It was a shocking, searing event. The country (and the world) was riveted to the TV and filled with a sense of loss and confusion and disgust and dismay. Brinkley doesn’t go into, “Who shot JFK?”, so I won’t either. The problem was that he was dead, the king was dead, and the heir apparent was a titanic, unappealing political force who did great things in terms of Civil Rights and other social programs and terrible things in terms of Vietnam.Brinkley’s book is a good, quick refresher course in the contradictions of JFK. It’s well-written and fair. JFK may have been the most charismatic of our presidents, but he only began to grow into his job toward the end of his time in office. I suspect his second term, however, would have been less productive than his first. By Brinkley’s account, he couldn’t have handled the Civil Rights movement, continuing Soviet provocations, and Vietnam. He didn’t really like problems and didn’t really understand that problems are the essence of the presidency....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 26, 2014","Aug 26, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10082281-john-f-kennedy

This story, originating in a 16th century legend about a wronged horse dealer, has a modern, bureaucratic ring to to it. Though written in the early 19th century, it presents the city-state realms of disunified Germany as controlled by an endlessly devious and contradictory set of aristocratic courts, seats of judgment, higher authorities, and obscure religious influences. There’s a strong element of Kafka’s The Trial in this tale. There also is an element of Kafka’s dark and bitter humor. In the end, Kohlhaas essentially receives justice (in terms of compensation for losses inflicted on him by a Saxon nobleman) minutes before he is hanged (in punishment for the wild raids and uproar he provoked prior to receiving any justice at all.)This is a story about the little man and the big men, but it’s also a story about how big the little man is. In Kafka, of course, the victims (Joseph K, for instance) don’t fight back. Kohlhaas’s rebellion is appealing because it is right, even if it is overdone. Certain peculiarities of the legend/ballad tradition appear untouched here, i.e., certain events just happen, aren’t explained . . . a figure like Martin Luther appears, then recedes . . . and the nobility of Kohlhaas’s death, its stoicism, has a crude if helpless and hopeless grandeur about it. Of course a reader wants the higher authorities to die, not Kohlhaas, but they don’t. Kleist lets this injustice stand.The stylistic strength of Michael Kohlhaas relies, it seems to me, on its compactness, even density. There are sentences in it that rival Cicero for their length and complexity. This, of course, is a feature of the German language, but it’s rare that a German writer exploits the language’s characteristics with such strength and firmness. A great deal of this work contradicts the “show/don’t tell” mania that afflicts contemporary editorial tastes in America, particularly in university writing programs. Kleist tells his tale with speed and completeness. He manages reversals in two or three muscular sentences and then he’s off, telling us what happened next . . . and next . . . .

He famously championed the League of Nations after WWI to prevent a similar war from occurring, and he famously failed to achieve Senate ratification of what he had negotiated in Paris. A “coven” (not an inappropriate word used by Berg) of Republican senators actedunder the leadership of Henry Cabot Lodge just as Republican senators have acted under the direction of current senator Mitch McConnell, who vowed the day Barrack Obama was inaugurated that the priority was to ensure he would not be re-elected. Lodge’s pre-Versailles plan was to scuttle whatever Wilson negotiated, not knowing what that would be. This kind of cheap partisanship found its target more fatally in Wilson’s case than Obama’s. But Obama has paid a steep price nonetheless.What Wilson foresaw was that Europe and the world would head into another terrible war if the peace of 1919 was not just and far-sighted. He was right. He also predicted that the United States, if it withdrew into itself, soon would head into a domestic depression. Right again.But history makes it almost impossible to explain exactly what Wilson had in mind. By this I mean, he envisioned the impossible. He wanted a community of nations to act in concert, preserving peace and declining to pursue narrow national interests. Clemenceau of France and Lloyd George of England said yes to this but were lying even as they spoke. They had revenge and imperial interests on their minds. The latest example of such cynical leadership is Vladimir Putin, who is pressuring Ukraine because it boosts him politically, if not economically, at home, and accords with a sense of Russian grandeur. Meanwhile, Ukraine struggles to stay afloat. The United Nations, which finally came into being post-WWII and assumed the mantle of the League of Nations with greater authority and more “buy-in” is effectively helpless in thwarting Putin. Large powers like the U.S. and the E.U. have to resist him on Ukraine’s behalf, but the game is a delicate balance of interests. The U.S. objects to the bullying and destabilizing effect Putin is having not only on Ukraine but Europe at large. The E.U., more cautiously, needs to preserve natural gas flows from Russia while struggling to keep Ukraine oriented in Europe’s direction. What we see here is not egalitarian democracy, self-determination, and the rights of the small against the large, and it’s almost 100 years since Wilson offered us what seems, in truth, an ethereal vision of a world that can never be so pure, so self-restrained, so lacking in vindictiveness and overwhelming self-interest. The affairs of humankind do not seem destined to work that way . . . ever. This applies domestically in curious, perverse ways as well. If a president today attempted to champion a campaign to save us from climate change spoke with the eloquence, tenacity, and passion of Wilson championing the League of Nations, he or she would meet the same fate as Wilson. He or she would fall to “interests.”Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR were three U.S. leaders who had to take the United States into and through great wars that Americans questioned and resisted. Each literally gave his life to his cause, assassinated or so worn out with the effort that he expired .When we look at the craven stupidity of George Bush in Iraq or the naiveté of JFK and Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam, we see American presidents behaving more like the leaders of other countries. This is not to say that there have not been great idealists elsewhere or that all leaders of other countries are craven and naive. It’s only to say that the idealistic exceptions are few.Berg presents a Wilson I didn’t know: he had his light side, his deeply romantic side, and apparently a spellbinding eloquence both as a college professor and president. The secret to his effectiveness as a speaker is one I’ve always believed in: talk to a thousand people as if you are talking to one, don’t talk down, the more extreme your rhetoric, the more quietly you should express it, give people a simple scheme of what you intend to say at the outset so that they can better understand what you will say at greater length later on.Wilson’s complexity is more than I could address in a book , but it seems that Wilson’s experience growing up in the defeated American South deeply affected his vision of how reconciliation should proceed. He agreed that slavery was an abomination and worth fighting against; in other words, he was a southerner who did not defend the practice, but he was a paternalistic figure who pushed the full integration of African-Americans into U.S. society very, very slowly. He did not give American blacks the respect he accorded citizens of other countries: the right to self-determination, protection from larger powers, and full participation in the democratic process. This, he believed, would take time, more time than he had at his disposal. Segregation in various forms made sense to him. Perhaps he was only a realist about this. Decades would pass in America before the Civil Rights movement. More decades would pass before Obama would be elected, and even then an undercurrent of persistent racism has trebled the difficulty of his job.The most compelling portions of Berg’s book are the penultimate chapters following Wilson on his train campaign across America, preaching to huge crowds that the League of Nations was the right answer for America and the world. He had not been a well man for many years. He had had strokes and he had intestinal problems and he had severe headaches. But the crowds drew the best from him until he ultimately could not leave his train to undertake the last five or six scheduled events.At that point he rolled back to Washington and remained in seclusion for months, and we come to the passages where his second wife, Edith, and his doctor, Admiral Grayson, conspired to shield him from prying eyes and assist him in carrying out the functions of his office.The poet who most reminds me of Wilson is Rilke. Rilke had the same ethereal qualities, the same impossible-to-pinpoint faith in spirits and angels and ideals. It strains the mind to follow his otherworldly visions, and yet there is beauty and hope, passion and desperation, that make Rilke intriguing. The same can be said for the professor who became president. He always wanted to be a politician, but that did not enable him to do what he set out to do–change the world....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2014","Aug 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17239865-wilson

The concept here is that a “sport of nature” is an aberration, perhaps a felicitous aberration, and that Hillela mysteriously adapts to mysterious circumstances, becoming a political force in her own right--well-versed in international affairs as well as in romantic affairs.	In a sense, she is a natural blank slate upon which many different individuals are permitted to write. Her cousin, Sasha, is one. A South African informer, pretending to be a journalist in sympathy with anti-apartheid forces, is another. Then comes the love of her life, the high-ranking black South African who is assassinated on the threshold of their temporary home in exile, where he is planning and executing military actions against the white South African government.	All this makes for colorful, interesting reading. Hillela never resolves into what Gordimer claims for her--a personage who really understands her own purposes and is obscure simply because she keeps her own counsel--but she gets caught up in the spirit of the times and is willing to cross boundaries few white women would cross in the apartheid days of South Africa.	The peculiar quality of the novel’s heroine is matched in some ways by Gordimer’s curious style. She writes as if she’s taking notes, jumping here and there, starting sentences she doesn’t quite know how to finish, all in the service of exploring the intimacy of life under oppression and in revolt. I’ve read other novels and stories written by Gordimer that were not so distractingly expressed. In the end, I can’t help but feel that her inability to really get at Hillela (as Henry James got at Isabel Archer, for instance) made her stumble.	Having said that, A Sport of Nature has fascinating scope, many fine passages, and historical value. Here we encounter the conscience of anti-apartheid whites, their frustrations, the risks they took, and the limits of what they could contribute to the cause.	Gordimer takes some pains at one point to almost marry Hillela off to a New Republic-style American liberal who lives in a fine brownstone and knows all the right people. Given Hillela’s exotic past and taste in men, these passages read like a lame attempt to work in some anti-Americanism. Naturally Hillela breaks off their engagement when she falls in love with the revolutionary who would become president (for the second time) of the aforementioned neighboring country. This fellow is a lion of a man who is tough to take, or believe in: he’s shrewd, tenacious, brave, and wise. With Hillela as his mate, he does a hell of a lot of good for his country. I spent some time trying to determine what country Gordimer had in mind because I’m not aware of many countries in Southern Africa where things have turned out well.	At novel’s end, Mandela takes the stage and the overthrow of the whites is complete. Structurally, this is odd. Gordimer clearly is determined to focus on the politics of South Africa per se rather than on the psychology and personal life of Hillela the presidential consort who has, by this time, not that much to contribute to what her assassinated first husband helped bring about. She lives elsewhere, after all. By way of compensation, Gordimer focuses on the miserable fate of the one cousin (Sasha) who stayed behind and really suffered (and was imprisoned) as a result of his anti-apartheid efforts.	For about two-thirds of this almost 19th century novel, I thought I was reading something exceptionally good, and I’m still sure I was reading something interesting. But what I now think is that the conclusion devolves into a kind of sloganeering posing as a novel. In different contexts, Solzhenitsyn and Dos Passos actually used journalistic excerpts from the times about which they wrote as a way of penetrating further into their stories. That wouldn’t work here because, despite Gordimer’s themes, she really doesn’t seem to have been a deeply political writer. This isn’t to question the staunchness of her beliefs--it’s to suggest she wanted to have her cake and eat it, too. Her strong literary personality leaves the stage at the end of A Sport of Nature and it’s just too late in the book to bow down before History and serve as its rapporteur. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 04, 2014","Aug 04, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/111048.A_Sport_of_Nature

Each story seems to be based on a strong centraThe Angel Esmeralda by Don DeLillo is a collection of stories written between the late 1970s and 2011. Each story seems to be based on a strong central idea–a story idea–that decays into DeLillo’s vision of the world and his way of expressing it. When he writes novels, there are enough events to give this DeLillo vision a kind of rhythm that rescues it from its monotony and repetitiveness. Here, the singularity of the story-idea gradually erodes even as it crests. I know that’s contradictory, but I don’t know a better way to express the effect of story after story.The flatness, the dullness, the boringness of DeLillo’s prose in this collection points in the direction of his central theme–estrangement–and his secondary theme (which is is his primary theme in novels)–conspiracy.DeLillo’s estrangement is somewhat different from what Camus offered in The Stranger. It is the constant representation of life and things and people as unique and fascinating and bewildering and not belonging to any controlling order. Much of what DeLillo depicts is grubby urban reality (New York reality) that feels momentary and arbitrary, as though buildings were the mourners at a funeral, gathered around a grave, who soon will all go off in different directions and may never meet again. DeLillo’s characters are equally estranged from one another, arbitrarily, coincidentally, or perhaps indifferently tied together. I could love you, I could love someone else, it doesn’t matter because I don’t know what love means in the first place.In story after story, the cadence of details and exchanges seems to be building toward a release DeLillo deliberately subverts. Estrangement always leads to the revelation of vacancy. The final story, “The Starveling,” reveals the backbone of this march toward emptiness. That backbone is a code of conduct, almost a religious rite, that disallows variations. One must always do the same things and expect the same thing, nothing.The face of conspiracy in DeLillo is variable. Sometimes it is the unknown and unknowable, sometimes it is the intrusion of mystery, sometimes it is the laughter of a parallel world recorded and projected in the media. In one story, “The Ivory Acrobat,” conspiracy even takes the form of post-earthquake aftershocks. These earthly rumblings must be telling us something, mustn’t they? The question is whether they are telling us about the arbitrariness of nature or the desperate contingency of self.So there is something grueling about The Angel Esmeralda, but in that there are rewards. The first reward is that we all see things we don’t see. We are unobservant. We don’t have room in our thoughts for the mute statements that hurtle at us all the time. DeLillo rectifies that. The second reward is DeLillo’s apparent belief that we should not force a malign interpretation on the weirdness of the world. Many of his characters are frozen in a protective, paranoid crouch, but their discomfort is not necessarily terminal or definitive. In DeLillo’s world, it’s possible that what seems to be be really isn’t, and it’s possible that what happens doesn’t happen because a cosmic hostility is pursuing us, and it’s possible that the ultimate emptiness of things isn’t so ultimate. He seems to be saying that whatever we have invented and allowed to become our internal guidance system could have been, and still could be, invented otherwise. So we’re trapped–another contradiction, I admit....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2014","Jul 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11447958-the-angel-esmeralda

Or maybe it’s a game of tag . . . could be.Munro writes with specificity about faces, moods, landscapes, and characteristics. Her subjects have not yet found the homogenizing effect of Prozac and other hi-tech drugs that squeeze the weirdness out of them. A girl from an orphanage is married to a young man setting out in the wilds to build a farm with his brother, but as the story unfolds, great uncertainty develops as to how the young married man actually died. At the end, we know, although the girl from the orphanage still keeps many secrets to herself.I particularly like two tricks Munro plays with time: Sometimes she shifts into the present tense without explanation, only to return to the past tense, also without explanation. No explanation is necessary, of course. The present tense, when used judiciously, intensifies a story. Munro also occasionally drops a piece of a narrative in a spot that is chronologically all wrong but creates an out-of-time fulness and completion, even though it suggests the same story, the one that has just been told, is now going to be told all over again.Without a doubt, Munro is a lady, meaning a gentlewoman, but her writing can be earthy and spicy and quite realistic about old men who want their younger wives to talk dirty to them or boys who want to jump girls so bad they call them ugly first, as if to drive them away, not embrace them.Not infrequently Munro flashes forward toward the end of a story to show how things turned out decades after the main events. Two things stand out about this: the characters have gotten old and feeble and suffered many losses . . . and hypocrites usually receive what they always had coming to them.Perhaps Munro’s effectiveness in deploying all these techniques lies in the humbleness and unpretentiousness of her principal characters and settings and her straightforward, clean style.She goes to the heart of the matter—how life grabs you there and makes your pulse race or seize up. She’s not a writer who blinks at joy or misery. She lets each have its due....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 24, 2014","Jul 24, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14286.Open_Secrets

He had many literary friends and admirers throughout his career, of course. Perhaps the most famous, and famously arrogant, was Edmund Wilson, a man of letters equal to Nabokov in many ways but not, as he stupidly insisted, in his knowledge of the Russian language.	But the fact is that Nabokov’s own stories tell the tale of his melancholy moments in Europe—especially in Berlin—better than a deservedly proud man would like to tell them directly, in his own voice.	He wrote about lots and lots of losers, losers who missed their main chance at love, a career, exotic travel, a good friendship. And he wrote about lots of romantics who yearned for the kind of explosive aesthetic revelation that only a master like Nabokov could really concoct.	I don’t see any point in retelling any of the dozens of stories in this volume. They’re there to be read, not summarized. Early in his career Nabokov clearly had some Chekhov in him. As he hit stride, one senses an affinity for Turgenev. Someone like Dostoevsky would have appalled him, only to be treated with comedy. Tolstoy? Well, Tolstoy did have that drop-dead lucidity about him; the problem with him, though, was that like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy became a devout moralist and refused to do what Nabokov consistently did—use his powers to transcend the little good and bad distinctions and glory in the pure beauty of life observed and described for and of itself.	At one point in these stories a character is dismissed because he relates to the world through feelings, not concrete, scientific assessment. Here’s a key to Nabokov. He was an expert lepidopterist (butterfly expert), and as such he was more exacting and precise than mere feelings permit. That’s where his famous—almost unbelievable—style explodes on the page; he captures tiny, intriguing details and fits them within a kind of narrative nomenclature that doesn’t really require plot. The thing is the thing. It was self-evident to Nabokov that demonstrable existence—the existence of clouds, of rain, of trams, of long flabby chins, of self-pity, of lies—possesses an inherent aesthetic thrill that required no trumped-up metaphysical, moral or religious justification. All he had to do was find the right words and fit them into the right moments, and voila, a story was born.	These days we hear over and over again “show, don’t tell.” It’s so boring, and it’s so wrong. Nabokov told plenty of tales, he summarized, he leaped forward in time, he sniggered, he forced the reader to agree, the woman was beautiful, the man was doomed.	What Nabokov could not abide, says his son in the introduction to this volume, was cruelty. I found that an interesting revelation. In fact, there is everything in Nabokov except cruelty, or its endorsement. This matches well with his need for aesthetic freedom. He simply avoided certain subjects without, I must say, failing to belittle the dolts who stole Russia from him.	The other major man of letters who has taken a similar position on cruelty is the philosopher Richard Rorty. He recognizes that it is difficult not to be cruel by accident or unintentionally, but he insists this is the great human project: to imagine human experience devoid of cruelty. Realistic? No, but if you have Nabokov’s talent, you can still make the proposition believable....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 20, 2014",not set,"Jul 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8146.The_Stories_of_Vladimir_Nabokov

In this novel, we’re in today’s world—and tomorrow’s.Hoffman, the main character, is a genius level mathematician/physicist who has set up a hedge fund with a partner named Quarry. The key is an algorithm Hoffman developed that, aided by computers, learns market patterns and generates wild returns. As a scientist, Hoffman is more interested in artificial intelligence than he is in money, but he’s become a billionaire . . . and he’s in trouble in three ways: First, his marriage to an artist is rocky. Second, he may be returning to a depressed state of mind, with the suggestion of schizophrenia. Third, if he’s not a paranoid schizophrenic, he’s being pursued by someone who plays with his mind, has penetrated his computer systems, and even attacked him in his $60 million home in Geneva.This is a fast-paced story with a thoughtful police detective involved and a burgeoning theme of the algorithm varying its strategy so that it piles up the firm’s risk factors as it pursues huge profits on a given day by short-selling.In effect the algorithm manages to take over Hoffman’s identity and begin giving instructions to people designed to get Hoffman out of its way. In other words, artificial intelligence becomes real intelligence; it absorbs or possesses what Schopenhauer called “will.”Schopenhauer isn’t the intellectual backdrop to all this. Rather, Harris draws expertly on Darwin for most of the provocative quotes at the beginning of his chapters. In a sense this makes no difference because Darwin described naturalistically exactly what Schopenhauer theorized philosophically—some powerful force pushes through existence on earth, having its way and its say, indifferent to the survival of any given species.Reading The Fear Index is fun if repellant because Harris unravels his plot skillfully and there is enough character-development around him (he’s not so intriguing as a person) to make the dramatis personae interesting.The repellant dimension is two-fold: What we have here explicitly falls into the general scheme of popular fixations on the world coming to an end; fear attracts people; they like to be scared, but they also like to survive in the end. The question is whether it’s worth surviving in a world that actually comes pretty close to this speculative proposition. Computing and mathematics, coupled with money, have generated a non-governmental, world-ruling autonomy wherein the rich get so rich it’s unimaginable and the not-rich have no competitive chance.As a good writer, deft in the use of setting, Harris matches stride with the best of what I would call TV-writing. This novel cries out to become a mini-series. It is entertainment of a relatively high order, though it sacrifices depth for pace, plausibility for possibility, and originality for somewhat generic conventionality....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2014","Jul 02, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11429709-the-fear-index

It’s been thirteen years, and we’ve seen the mega-banks and mega-investors (and all the little guys beneath them) crushed by a cataclysm of greed, but serious reforms were fought off, tax adjustments to realign the burdens on taxpayers more equitably have been booed out of the stadium, and the notion of a super-investor spending an entire day riding around in a stretch limo in Manhattan, running his currency and investing operations from there, remains comically plausible.	Our anti-hero, Eric Packer suffers from what could be called the DeLillo disease or the Pynchon disease or the Orwell or Gaddis or NSA disease, namely the fantasy that somehow there is a code in the universe that can be deciphered ahead of time, and it will either make you almost meaninglessly rich or meaninglessly dead.	DeLillo’s minimalist satire of such fantasists is all the sharper and more deadly for its doses of sympathy for Eric who displays a keen eye for the grandeur in the metaphysical workings of the world economy, yes, but also for the little folk and foibles of New York City. His flat writing––DeLillo’s––accentuates the cultural and technological gaudiness of New York as well as its human richness. There are theorists, assassins, bodyguards, poets, broken-down barbers, and unruly protestors in this densely packed novel who achieve a strange kind of unbelievable credibility because Eric has a death wish (for himself and for his business) that sharpens his perceptions and appreciation of almost everything in gusts of detail that are, undeniably, New York-like.	When we see this stuff in movies––the private limos, the predictable sexual encounters with red hot lovers, the all-knowing screens full of encyclopedic data––we take it as schtick, at least by now, I would think. But prose works harder than movies. Prose takes work to create every single image, inflection, adjective, and event. There are no contextual gifts caused by the camera or the simple natural beauty of women who wouldn’t even require make-up to seem divine. In prose everything happens through word after word, not all at once.	I don’t mean to denigrate movies. I know how hard it is to make one. In fact, I’d never want to make one because it is the most tedious business imaginable. But the fact is that a face or a backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge or a half-empty parking lot on the Lower East Side comes naturally to the lens, and it’s not the way for writers. A DeLillo, who writes and writes about vague conspiracies, has to earn the full engagement of his readers with just the right word, the word that is what the reader would have used had the reader possessed DeLillo’s gifts.	Again, the edginess of Cosmopolis is its sharp proximity to revolting reality, the sense that the totality of control in the world rests uncomfortably in a few frail, mortal hands, and that it can all come crashing down in an instant.	DeLillo’s approach to this notion is powerful because the odious Eric festers with lusts and inadequacies and jealousies that make him human, if barely.	Eric’s nemesis, on the other hand, is less persuasive. This is an individual who is identified in separate sections of the narrative as someone who once worked for Eric and lost his position and now lives in the scummiest, most desperate of circumstances. In literary terms, he is Dostoevsky’s Underground Man or Ellison’s Invisible Man. This is forced, not persuasive. The most curious thing about the end of the book is how superior Eric is in comparison to his assassin. He makes good points in trying to defuse the confrontation; but the suggestion is that the very far-seeing talent that made him rich is also what, in a ghoulish set of images, makes him dead. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 21, 2014",not set,"Jun 21, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28703.Cosmopolis

It’s a romance in that the beleaguered, noble hero outwits all odds and enemies and the ending is improbably “happy.” In a sense, this had to be the novel’s outcome because anything less would have yielded ground to some truly perfidious villains, not least of whom is Nicholas’s usurer Uncle Ralph, a figure of frigid calculations and no kindness.	Inter alia Nicholas must survive his father’s indigent death, predations focused on his sister Kate (some of which are really brilliantly hideous, led by Sir Mulberry Hawk), and a personal conscience that never lets him take the easy way out. He also has an hysterically obtuse mother whose monologues are masterpieces of irrelevance.	Today’s reader has to find this book too long while forgiving the coincidences and digressions. It’s a period piece, serialized and melodramatic. But at the same time, even some of its excesses display a genius giving birth to himself.	Throughout his career, Dickens had an affinity for the theater. There’s a theater troupe involved in this novel, but more to the point, many of the scenes are clearly designed for, or inspired by, the limelight. These entail verbal struggles of histrionic ingenuity and grandiosity. The feeling of the prose changes as a consequence. Dialogue becomes speeches, characters become caricatures.	Of course there are abused boys, reflecting Dickens unhappy experiences as a child laborer, and yet there are too-good-to-be-true angels as compensation. The best, perhaps, is a Yorkshireman whom Dickens replicates in pitch-perfect dialect. One can easily imagine him letting his pen dance whenever he had the opportunity to twist words the way they’re twisted in Yorkshire.	The list of minor characters, each distinctive in traits and role, runs to the dozens, accompanied by subplots, flurries of irony, and, in the end, a symphonic summing up wherein almost all of them are accounted for. Dickens doesn’t let the bad guys off. Uncle Ralph succumbs to his own hand. One of his chief accomplices is murdered in his bed. Perhaps only Sir Mulberry Hawk continues to operate nefariously in the shadows of a Continental exile.	One chapter in particular intrigued me. Its title suggests that it will relate a moment when Nicholas and Kate will forfeit the good opinion of mankind. In fact, what it relates is them pledging to one another that neither will marry; instead, they’ll live together in perfect harmony as brother and sister. That’s not how things turn out, but it seems to me that Dickens is hinting, though not substantiating, an incestuous entanglement. I’m not sure why he decided to flirt with this theme late in the book, but again, it’s only a flirtation.	Nicholas Nickleby is basically a “read” for Dickens’ fans, and not the best way to begin a relationship with him. Bleak House, Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield and Great Expectations are more consistently realized, troubling, and engrossing. But if you’ve read all those novels, there’s a kind of satisfaction in witnessing Dickens become Dickens, watching him indulge himself, make mistakes, and yet still attack, attack, attack the villains he wanted to banish from the earth. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2014","Jun 12, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/325085.Nicholas_Nickleby

As humans	The Contest of the Century––U.S. vs. China by journalist Geoff Dyer is a well-written, interesting book about a somewhat imaginary subject.	As humans, we are given to fallacies. One of our fallacies is to think that the way we conceptualize the world is how the world “is.” That fallacy leads to the tired, smug saying, “Perception is reality.” 	Not so within the scope of history. By twisting and turning, many writers on the U.S. and China find ways to link them, sometimes fatally. We read that China’s military is on the rise; we read (and know) that China’s economy is on the rise; but we also have the sense that we have seen the China movie before, and it ends when economic growth in China forces political liberalization and that, in turn, erodes the power of the Chinese Communist Party. Can a case be made that China isn’t the Soviet Union? Sure, a good case can be made to that effect. I am simply say that China’s mastery of future events is going to be shaken by untoward developments.	The same is true in the United States. We will pay the piper for our deteriorating infrastructure and huge contribution to global warming. We will be forced to cooperate more and dictate less when it comes to resolving conflicts abroad. That’s already happening. 	The starkness of U.S.-China competition, its Manichean fascination, diminishes when we realistically admit that neither country has to butt heads with the other to achieve its goals. In fact, we would both be better off cooperating on legal, ecological, energy, and political matters.	China wants to be recognized as the new super-power, but saying so doesn’t make it so, and the real test of being a super-power is acting like one. Once China does that, and once the U.S. has satisfied itself that cooperation with China is worthwhile, the “world” will indeed be different . . . but not to the exclusion of Russia, the European Union, India, Brazil, and many other important nations and regions.	On balance, Dyer’s book is better than its title, subtitled: The New Era of Competition with China––and How America Can Win.	Win? Keep China poor? Ensure that it asphyxiates the residents of its huge new cities with unbreathable pollution? Push it into backing North Korea in a war on South Korea? 	What does win mean when two dramatically unequal and different nations are pursuing paths of development that presumably are good for their citizens––and not necessarily bad for the citizens of other countries?	So Dyer has a jingoistic title, and I’m sure it wasn’t his idea. That’s publisher’s marketing. By his well-written account, China is going to be forced to behave itself by its neighbors and domestic circumstances while the U.S. is going to have to climb down off the heights of “American exceptionalism.” This will take decades.

The real reason HIaasen played golf in the first place was to spend time with his father out on the course. That's one of, again, two reasons to love golf: A) many of us, myself included, fell under its spell because we were out there on the course with dad; dad was teaching us things and listening to us; dad was all ours; B) golf is a unique blend of nature and geometry, both beautiful realities; as John Updike even more memorably wrote about golf, the point is to draw lines across the universe with a white ball instead of a pen or pencil; that gives you, on occasion, a godly feeling.	To Hiaasen's credit, he understands both these things about golf	, or at least he remembers them. He makes much of his anxieties and frustrations about being no good, but he is happy to play by himself. Golfers who enjoy the game most for its social aspects conform to a lot of its upper class snootiness and exclusivity. Golfers who play by themselves are in touch with their dead fathers and the compelling worlds of physical and metaphysical reality; in other words, they are engaging in rites that are both religious and artistic.	I'm serious about this. I guess you can tell this. Tiger Woods, about whom Hiaasen writes, clearly drives himself and his golf balls for these two reasons: to stay close to the father who taught him golf and to struggle with the mind and matter. He could care less about social status. He's a loner in a group game. Yes, he's rich and famous, but his yacht is called Privacy; he wants to get away from the world except in terms of father/son relations and cosmic engagement.	Of course, anyone who wants can flip this scenario and make it a story focused on women feeling the same way about golf. I am making it a man's story because Hiaasen is a man, and so am I. Gender, in fact, has little to do with it.	The story-line here is that Hiaasen wants to prepare for a club championship and acquit himself well. Naturally, he flops at that. This is funny to an extent but rather familiar to most golfers and probably bewildering to most non-golfers. Non-golfers cannot be persuaded by anyone that miserable failure is worthwhile.They also do not understand that on a golf course you might see an eagle or a fox or a deer or fascinating banks of clouds.	Again, the wealthier you become, the worse golf becomes. First, you have the money to rent golf carts, or even own them. That ruins the tempo and engagement of the game. Second, you play in a context of peer competitors who do not love you wildly. Third, you eat and drink too well before, during the turn after the ninth hole, and at what is called the 19th hole, which is the country club bar and grill where you and your buddies laugh at one another and talk about equipment or lessons you lust after.	True golf, in my experience, is going to a public course, playing alone or with strangers, and meditating. At times even a crappy golfer like Hiaasen can hit a ball as well as anyone in the world. He could never hit a major league pitcher's fast ball, but a golf ball just sits there and luck intervenes in your favor. Off goes a shot that is lovely to watch and remember. Tiger Woods couldn't hit it better (but at least he knows how he did it).	The book wisely ends with Hiaasen falling in deeper love with his son, teaching him golf, or simply finding his way into the game or into his dad's love. Hiaasen is a kind of skipping stone as a writer so he doesn't go deep into the meaning of love, but his instincts are good. He knows that his deteriorated state as a middle-aged man is not significant. It happens to all of us unless we die young. What's important about golf are those eagles and foxes and soaring shots and memories of having your father's eyes fixed on you as though you were the center of the universe, which is what a young boy or girl really is.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 09, 2014",not set,"May 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2062743.The_Downhill_Lie

In fact, The second volume of Boswell's life of Samuel Johnson portrays Johnson as a man who, although growing older, retains extraordinary vitality. In fact, Johnson by this point has ceased to write so much and begun to talk even more, always demonstrating a rapier-like personality, not full of opinions so much as reasoned judgments, never making a statement without quickly backing it up with one, two, or more justifications.The Johnson here strikes me as almost Falstaffian, not in the bawdy sense, but in the sense of pressing volubility, self-assurance, and all the color of a peacock's tail.In some ways, he already seems dated by virtue of his obstinate Toryism. Could any king have ever merited such allegiance? It's difficult to think of one. By the same token, it's difficult for me, at least, to concur in Johnson's confidence that men of property are better equipped to make judgments about national issues than men of the street (or women, for whom Johnson has great regard but not much respect).One of the central issues addressed in this volume is Johnson's trip to the Hebrides with Boswell, which provided him at the same time with a broader perspective on Scotland. Johnson comes to terms with the Scots quite well, but it's clear that the English and Scottish had low opinions of one another in the 18th century, something that seems to remain alive today as the Scots head toward a referendum next September on independence, perhaps leaving ""the United Kingdom"" to consist, essentially, of just England and Wales.Courtous though he was to his Scottish hosts, Johnson was fearless in declaring the infamous ""Ossian"" epic a fraud. He wasn't taken in by James Macpherson's discovery of manuscripts written at a time in the Scottish past when no manuscripts of any other type were found to have existed. How could this be then? Johnson asked. Answer: it couldn't.This is an episodic book, undoubtedly accurate in its reportage, but lacking, as Johnson himself might say, in judgment. From time to time Boswell falls afoul of Johnson or states his disagreements with Johnson's views, but he doesn't synthesize or analyze much, leaving the reader to imagine what impression Johnson really made on his contemporaries rather than offering the reader a conclusion or two about this superabundent human being.The dark side of Johnson is mentioned almost in passing. He was a depressive who like most depressives withdrew when he felt worst. This probably explains best why Boswell has little to offer on the subject: he wasn't with Johnson when Johnson spiraled downward, he didn't have access to those black thoughts that make you your own worst enemy.I'm probably saying, then, that Johnson was man of Shakespearian proportions without a Shakespeare near at hand to intuit his fundamental inner workings. The sparks that fly here all the time are social and conversational in nature; they don't come in the form of soliloquies, and they don't come in the form of his equals commenting on him. This isn't a pity, though. Johnson presented by Boswell and Johnson presented by himself in his own writing is quite enough. He was his own pagaent, blunt, observant, learned, witty, tough-minded and somewhat old-fashioned in the way he clung to conservativism and tradition when confronted with matters that reason alone could not resolve.That's why, of course, the age that followed the Age of Johnson was the Romantic Age, a turn within from which we have not yet fully emerged. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 03, 2014","May 03, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17942289-boswell-s-life-of-johnson

But at the same time the impetus also was historical revelation, access to sealed archives, verifiable allegations, and the undying need of survivors and their heirs to ensure that the Holocaust not be concealed in some way or other by economic and political interests.In some ways, this is a technical, diplomatic book. Eizenstat does all he can not to portray himself as a hero in it, but he clearly is a hero for what he endured and accomplished by way of achieving what he rightly calls “imperfect justice.” Many Holocaust survivors disliked the notion of monetizing what happened. Curiously, though, what happened did have a great deal to do with money, not just hatred.The Swiss were Hitler’s bankers. They accepted stolen gold, laundered it into Swiss francs, and moved it along to third countries as payment for materiel the Nazi war machine desperately needed.In Germany, Austria, and Vichy France, Jews lost their apartments, their jobs, and their savings as well as, of course, their lives. They were not all sent into gas chambers; many were sent into factories so ghastly that they were doomed to die there anyway, not seeing the light of day again, not breathing fresh air again, not receiving more than starvation-level nutrition again.In this straightforward, detailed book, Eizenstat lets us see how stand-offish and greedy the Swiss were for decades after their complicity with Hitler. He dramatizes the process of prying off the lid of the Austrian myth that Austria was Hitler’s first victim, not his first accomplice (and of course, his birth place––he was an Austrian, not a German). Eizenstat also probes Germany’s industrial landscape and reveals the brutality of dozens of household name corporations . . . and their tough bargaining not to be forced to pay too much by way of reparation to survivors and the Jewish community at large. He recounts the core story of what we now see in theaters (I’m referring to the film, Monuments Men). For reasons that defy reason, Hitler and his gang of killers and thugs saw themselves as connoisseurs of fine art, especially stolen and pillaged art, much belonging to Jews. And finally Eizenstat tells the tale of French president Jacques Chirac being the first French politician willing to admit Vichy France’s culpability in kowtowing to Hitler.Again, most of this book focuses on thievery, economic rape, if you will, so it’s not as graphically disturbing as Schindler’s List. Imperfect Justice excavates what the Nazis did in suborning their neighbors and enlisting them in pillaging the Jewish community economically before attempting to totally annihilate it.I lived and worked as a U. S. diplomat in Germany for three years and had contact with some of the figures Eizenstat mentions here––Jewish leaders in Germany, Jewish leaders from the U.S., and many of the Germans who, a generation after the war, began the painful process of acknowledging their familial link to horror. The Holocaust was for me not a major foreign policy theme––not in the mid-90s––but it was inescapable and had to be dealt with in one way or another every week. The more I learned about the Holocaust and the more I thought I knew, the more I realized I still had to learn. I worked with survivors, and I facilitated German-Jewish encounters that still needed to happen, because they’d never happened, not in all the years since WWII came to an end.After I left Germany, Eizenstat, a really remarkable servant of the American people appointed by Bill Clinton, dug into things that I did not know until just finishing his book a few minutes ago. The predations of the Nazis were overwhelming; their voracity insatiable; and other nations helped them in feeding their greed and stoking their ambitions.One dimension of this book has to do with the American legal process and the lawyers who became involved in trying to extract reparations for their injured clients. I think we all know the adversarial legal system employed in the U.S. often isn’t pretty, but it was worse than usual when associated with the Holocaust. Again, I know some of the lawyers who were on the victims’ side and I know some of them who were on the accused side––representing major banks, insurance companies, and corporations.Eizenstat asks himself if these lawyers and this legal process was too sordid to really matter, a puny thing when compared to the millions of dead who wouldn’t collect a penny stolen from them. He’s a realist, and I think correct, in assessing what occurred in wild rounds of legal diplomacy as necessary to getting at the truth as well as returning stolen goods to the injured who still lived. Certainly it wouldn’t be right for Swiss banks to keep playing a game best outlined in Dickens’ Bleak House; they couldn’t be permitted to squeeze estates dry with fees for doing nothing and hiding everything.Then Eizenstat deals somewhat obliquely with what might be called the singularity or uniqueness of the Holocaust that some argue sets it apart from other acts of genocide. He’s not one to insist on that. What he seems to see is the necessity of facing the Holocaust as a means of learning how to face other horrors--Rwanda, Armenia, the list is long.I tend to think that the immorality of the Holocaust really is transcendent and a thing apart, something beyond the beyond of the worst nightmare, but at the same time, Eizenstat is right: we who follow need to take on the task of remembrance in practical as well as moral and spiritual terms; we need to force questions of human rights and liberty deep into the political and economic structures of our fast-moving world. Otherwise, obscenities can and will occur again....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 25, 2014","Apr 25, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/926208.Imperfect_Justice

This book is a drumbeat of well-researched data emanating from a wide array of studies that demonstrate the wisdom of the U.S. engaging in the world, not shunning it. For example, over 160 countries have ratified the Law of the Seas treaty, but not the U.S. I know, because I worked a bit on this issue, that four senators are the holdouts. Their reasoning--we might be agreeing to give away things that might be valuable--is superficial. Every secretary of state from Henry Kissinger on, and most senior Navy officers, have said that the Law of the Sea treaty is a good idea. It provides a framework for cooperation that might head off conflicts that could have military consequences for the U.S., and it certainly will not restrain the U.S. from exploiting technical advantages in exploiting the world’s seabeds economically and scientifically.I can’t say reading this book is fun for two reasons. First, I spent twenty-five years as a diplomat being smacked in the face by this stuff. Second, there are so many good ideas, worth exploring in greater depth, that the text wears you out.I do think this is an incredibly worthwhile book, another important contribution to whittling down overblown American exceptionalism ( a fantasy that in some Platonic cave somewhere America is the “greatest” country on earth, created to be followed, not to be constrained.) It also is a book that demonstrates again and again the still valid economic principle of competitive advantage, i.e., if you are good at something, do a lot of it and sell the surplus at a profit to someone who has a surplus of something he is good at.Inevitably, Kenny cites the sad statistics about the U.S. relating to income inequality. “...from 1979 to 2007 the richest 1 percent saw their after-tax income climb 275 percent but over the same period the rise was just 18 percent for the poorest one-fifth. The median American’s income actually fell by 7 percent from 1999 to 2010.”One would hope that an economist of Kenny’s scope and lucidity has a future as economic advisor to a future U.S. president or secretary of state. He is not conceding anything as far as the U.S. goes when he refuses to accept world economics as a zero-sum game. From the environment to trade to job creation, we can win through competitive cooperation and lose through stubborn conflict. America won’t soon find itself in the situation of Shelley’s Ozymandias, a relic by-passed by history, but it will do better, much better, if it finds points of positive engagement with the world, fights off domestic special interests, and takes an open stance in approaching the future....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 15, 2014",not set,"Apr 15, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19872952-the-upside-of-down

In fact, it is prescient in two major ways.First, Krugman focuses hard on income inequality, which is a hot topic in 2014. His argument is that over the last 30+ years, taxes on the wealthy have gone down, social programs have been constrained, unions have been busted, and the middle class has shrunk. He shows that in the 1950s and 1960s, when CEOs made less relative to workers than they do today, the U.S. economy performed better. The thesis is basically this: the more people in our economy who make a decent wage, the more we spend and the more we save--while also insuring good education and other public services.So Krugman focuses tightly on superrich CEOs and money managers (Wall Streeters) and the benefits they enjoy as a result of fierce efforts by what he calls movement conservatives, these being the conservatives who are determined to hamstring government at every turn, cut the deficit, and oppose things like Obamacare.Secondly, Krugman predicted Obamacare as the coming social policy innovation that would match, in some ways, FDR's Social Security initiative. Remember, this was in 2007, before Obama was elected. His demographic analysis still pertains: the committed conservatives, though wildly well funded, are a shrinking minority. Not just African-Americans but Latinos and Asian-Americans are more sympathetic to the Democratic party than the Republican party.Since movement conservatives don't like immigration, either, they have a problem they can't fix at the polls with recent immigrant groups and long-standing minorities.Krugman's analysis of national health programs in France, the U.K., Germany, Canada and other highly developed nations shows quite clearly that if we work together we can have more and better health care for less. In fact, we're hugely overinvested in our old system, and Obamacare is the first step toward the better health outcomes and lower expenses our peer competitors enjoy.This is a refreshingly straightforward book. The few tables are easy to read. The anecdotes are pertinent and persuasive. Most disturbing, but not surprising, is the emphasis Krugman places on racism in the south as a reason for the Republican resurgence there since 1968.But again, things are changing. We've re-elected a black president. Here in Virginia, where I live, a bastion of the south, we're purple, not red or blue.The way income inequality retards our national competitiveness and productivity is easy to see and understand. When you ship jobs off-shore and lower wages at home (partially through union-busting), you've got a population that struggles with basics, not with ambitious socio-economic advancement.In the meantime, of course, we had the colossal debacle of the Great Recession right after Krugman's book was published. But he's written a lot about that, too, and we all know his general thesis: the Obama administration and Congress probably spent about half what it should have in helping people out of work and facing foreclosure. And in the meantime, we ran up a $3 trillion unfunded debt fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama didn't start either war, but he did well to get us out of Iraq and not as well continuing to waste treasure and lives in Afghanistan.Krugman likes to season his brew with reminscences about the social consensus that Eisenhower accepted on the part of the Republicans. That's when Krugman was a boy, and we had far less income inquality. I was a boy then, too, and I recall quite clearly that Krugman has it right. We had yet to go through some bitter social struggles, including civil rights, feminism, and gay rights, so we were far, far from the perfect nation, but we still felt more committed to good national outcomes than we have since then. Warren Buffet is on the same wavelength. As he puts it, he doesn't need all his billions and he doesn't see why he should pay lower taxes than his secretary.In closing, just another word on Buffet. I was coming out of the Russell Senate building one day when Buffet walked past me and hailed a cab. He got in the cab and drove away. The point? Where was his limo? Where were his aides? Where was the press his P.R. department had cooked up? They didn't exist. It was just Warren Buffet being a sensible man. Taxis are a good way to get around Washington,D.C.

So he goes along with it, transforming Julia's thread and oddities shop into a framing shop, and then becoming a fortune-teller in drag. Meanwhile Chantal and her husband Paul strike it rich in the armaments business, where Paul goes into business making rifle stocks.This inconsequential bit of writing, wherein Queneau deliberately messes around with people's names and backgrounds, is simply charming, and it falls into a category.First, if you like films by François Trauffaut or Éric Roemer, you'll recognize a certain French artistic gift for exploring the uniquely intriguing characteristics of ""nobodies.""

They take themselves seriously, but not too seriously. They develop, but they sometimes just give up.Second, in literary terms, the novels of Henry Greene (British) are like this and Laurence Sterne (also British) are like this. These are novels that play with words and perspectives and capture every imaginable ironic twist, joke, reversal, and utter impossibility.

H. LawrenceI’m not sure about the best way to enjoy writing this comment on D.H. Lawrence’s second novel, The Trespasser. With LaThe Trespasser by D. H. LawrenceI’m not sure about the best way to enjoy writing this comment on D.H. Lawrence’s second novel, The Trespasser. With Lawrence it seems to easy to say it is a very fine, intensely wrought novel that presaged even greater work to follow. If you were an editor/publisher and received this work from a relatively unknown writer, for instance, you’d know right away that the man had immense and peculiar talent. You’d question the narrow focus of the plot and the confusing opening and ending of the manuscript, but you’d have no doubt, sentence after sentence, that Lawrence understood early in his career that you could write about things in the English language that normally are ineffable.The story is fairly simple. A musician in a bad early marriage falls in love with a younger musician, spends a week on the Isle of Wight with her, and realizes, upon returning home, that he can’t go on without her (Helena) or abandon Beatrice (his wife) and the children he shares with Beatrice. So he commits suicide. Hangs himself. Within a year, Beatrice has moved on with help from her family, and Helena has found a new suitor who slowly, slowly, is getting his fingers in position to pry her fingers off Siegmund’s memory.There is something intentionally Wagnerian about this, but let’s skip that and go back to this peculiar quality of Lawrence’s writing. He manages, in describing the week on the Isle of Wight, to describe the moment to moment rise and fall all lovers experience in their earliest passion. He relates a passing glance to nothing less than death. He grants the sky and sun and waves outrageous primacy in reflecting human emotions to which, we probably believe, nature is utterly indifferent. He simply has the tenacity to not let go of what happens between two erotically engaged people taking a walk, lying on the beach, wondering privately to themselves whether there is a future to this passion or an onrushing calamity. Carrying this emotional nothingness, devoid of clear action and certain outcome for the longest time, is a very difficult task for a writer. But Lawrence, like some other English writers before him (Blake comes to mind) had the gift of re-valuing his native language itself. Yes, Nietzsche theorized and practiced such revaluation in German, too; I’m conscious of that and want to bring him into the discussion just a bit, especially because he first loved and then hated Wagner, and the young Lawrence wasn’t nearly as astute and bitter and learned as Nietzsche.No matter, here is a novel by Lawrence I had never heard of before that isn’t infected by some of his later histrionics and excesses. Curiously, the smaller Lawrence wrote (some of the short stories and The Fox come to mind), the more purely he wrote, with less affectation and overt criticism of almost everyone who couldn’t quite believe in his theories of “the blood.”The Trespasser reaches an appalling high point toward the end as Siegmund realizes he can’t go on. His analysis is clear and deadly. His relations with his wife, who is fed up with him, and his children, who are fed up with him, are dreadful. He is truly someone who at least should run away, and we know he will do that, we just don’t know, until the beautifully awkward discovery of his body, how he will do it.Those of us who would condemn him in principle are likely to stop condemning him as they get as good a look at his home life when he returns from the Isle of Wight. That’s when Lawrence’s drama becomes action, not metaphysics, logic, not fantasy, and my God, by God, he’s going to do it...he’s going to do it...he’s done it...he’s dead.And then? This business of Beatrice refusing to mourn him, this business of Helena contemplating, within a year, the advances of a new lover. Actually, it’s a little brutal, a little too realistic, a little disappointing in a way that puts the whole of our little lives into an unpleasant perspective.The first time I ran into such an ethos--the ethos of so what if we live, so what if we die--occurred during my freshman year in college. My roommate informed me that if I were to die, he wouldn’t care in the least; he wouldn’t care if anyone died, himself or his family included. Life to him was a material phenomenon, and so if Earle was dead, big deal. He wasn’t being histrionic, nor was Lawrence being histrionic in The Trespasser He really meant that in the context of the sun and stars and galaxies, we don’t matter, so those of us who survive a little longer should just get on with it.This anecdote of mine ends badly. Obviously I didn’t die. My roommate died. He already, at seventeen (he was a math prodigy), was on the road to alcoholism. By his late forties, he would call me and talk about things drunkenly, and because somehow we’d remained friends, I would listen, and then he got around to telling me his liver was shot and there was no remedy and by fifty, he was gone. That’s a brutal death. My mother, who was a nurse, once told me that cirrhosis of the liver causes the worst death of all. She’d seen it and many other kinds of death and that was her opinion.In the case of The Trespasser, the approach to suicide is as finely recounted as moments of erotic bliss just a few days earlier on the Isle of Wight. The only error our editor/publisher might have made upon receiving this exceptional early novel was not insisting Lawrence get into it and out of it more cleanly and quickly. But the young Lawrence wanted some irony and distance from his dismal vision, and so only ninety percent of the text is unremittingly acute. The other ten percent is novelizing. Ultimately with Women in Love, Lawrence spat the novelizing out. All he gave his readers was his really unusual rendition of relentless passion lurking beneath everything we say and do....more",Notes are private!,2,5,1,not set,"Mar 26, 2014","Mar 26, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19376748-the-trespasser

He depicts beauty, tranquility, boredom, discipline, contentiousness and the travails of the human psyche out there, all in beautifully cadenced sentences that capture the rhythms of life aboard ship under hot suns and fickle winds.In this case, Conrad adds piquancy. A young captain finds himself harboring a man who has fled another ship because he had murdered a shipmate during a storm. He keeps this man, who swims to him, hidden in his compartment, and the man becomes something like a double--he’s often referred to as such--but even better something like the Cain in everyone, the dark side of the captain, his doubts about his worthiness to command a vessel, his questions about his judgments and authority, the pressures placed on anyone, really, who is wallowing about the seas and has too much time to think and too little to think with or about...except himself.The double is a seemingly inexhaustible fixture in literature. Writers use it to get at aspects of a character that can’t be deployed in a single personality. They use it to posit innocence on the one hand and original sin on the other. They use it to make irony concrete and capture the unease that underlies almost every personality. There is waking life and there is dream life. There is private life and there is public life. Humor and tragedy. Doubles serve all these features of existence.The beauty of Conrad’s writing is that his thoughtfulness is embedded in the events of the narrative. There are certainly moments when he pauses to let a narrator philosophize, but his real gift is to turn a ship, or a city, into a kind of a stage where the action unfolds the meaning without calling excessive attention to itself.What any double does for each of us, of course, is bring us to the fork in the road, Frost’s road not taken, and push us to ask whether it matters what destiny holds in store for us...if it could just as well be quite different in the life of the double.Yet at the same time, Conrad finds a kind of adhesion between his two figures, the captain and the stowaway, a moral bond, an element of concern. They part ways and yet they don’t. Years later they will remember this peculiar episode, and the risks each took to arrange a final parting.For his clarity, his descriptiveness, his insight, his economy of plot and symbol, Conrad has always represented for me a writer of fiction of the first order. Yes, he’s a romantic of sorts, but the discipline of the ship keeps him honest.If you’ve read The Secret Sharer, it’s worth rereading. If not, it’s worth taking up for a first time. Here is fiction that is one thing, a single piece of tapestry, that unfolds with uninterrupted excellence, the diction right, the minor characters right, the deeper quandaries of the main characters right....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 18, 2014",not set,"Mar 18, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2179336.The_Secret_Sharer

This occurs in the 1970s in Istanbul when “European” customs and morals were not commonly accepted. Kemal’s fiancé Sibel has been to Europe (meaning Paris) and without intervening in his questionable activities goes through with a major engagement party at the Hilton. In theory this commits them to one another once and for all, leaving Füsan out in the cold. Sibel, however, comes to understand that going through with marriage to Kemal is not a very good idea. So she sends him back his engagement ring. Rich as Croesus or not, Kemal isn’t worth her time.What is Kemal to do? He really loves Füsan, and he’s not that sorry to see Sibel go, but where the devil is Füsan? First, her parents rescue her from social opprobrium by arranging that she marry a not very promising filmmaker, and then they move to an obscure part of the city to keep their daughter away from Kemal. But Kemal finds them, eventually, and for eight years he follows the custom of visiting them for dinner because they are vaguely his relatives. And all the while he’s stealing little objects from their apartment, objects which he hides in his own little hideaway apartment, developing the beginnings of the collection that will become, in time, The Museum of Innocence.Anyway, Füsan’s marriage falls apart, and Kemal, fixated on her, finally gets her to agree to a divorce so that the two of them can marry. But en route to Paris as part of their engagement celebration, Füsan reveals what she really thinks of Kemal for having ruined both their lives--she drives directly into a tree, killing herself and almost killing him.Too bad he lives because he is a narcissistic self-indulgent romantic whom Pamuk obviously wants us to like but is basically infantile and worthless and not redeemed in the least by his Proustian fixations, his theories of memory, his fetishism, or his final passage through thousands of museums all over the world, studying them in preparation for launching The Museum of Innocence which will celebrate the intimate life of his beloved Füsan.This is a powerfully stupid novel by a Nobel prize winner. It becomes even more stupid when Pamuk, who appears earlier at Kemal’s engagement party, returns to reveal that he has been the “I” writing Kemal’s story for him--a touch of pointless post-modernism that rivals the dumb idea of The Museum of Innocence itself.At the very end of the novel, Pamuk provides two separate sets of dates during which he wrote this ode to his fantasies. I take it he had trouble getting it going, set it aside, and unfortunately returned to finish it.I am no expert on Pamuk or Turkish writing, but I do know that his “brand” is being fascinated by Istanbul as Balzac was with Paris, Dickens with London, and Naguib Mahfouz, an infinitely more profound and penetrating novelist than Pamuk, with Cairo.My impression, because many scenes and minor characters are strong, is that Pamuk badly, badly needed an editor to shorten this novel by a third, throw out The Museum of Innocence idea, and push Kemal into realizing what a predatory shit he is. Füsan really doesn’t come alive until she tries to kill them both, but when she does, she’s great. Her anger soars when she puts her foot on the floor and hits that tree. It’s tragic that Pamuk didn’t understand the obvious: almost any reader (other than the writer himself) would rather have seen this novel conclude with her alive and Kemal smashed to bits.In the odds and ends department, I’d conclude with this observation: Kemal refers to being drunk so many times over so many years that it is difficult to believe he doesn’t become his own alcoholic self-revelation while he is sitting around, waiting for Füsan’s doomed marriage to fail. I’d venture a hundred nights or more are referred to as being surrendered to alcohol, gallons of it, but the horror of such abuse, the kind of degradation that Malcolm Lowry explored in Under the Volcano, is absent here. There’s a headache or two, or a day’s work missed, but what does it matter when Daddy left you the company?And as a final comment, I’d answer the question you may already be asking: why did I finish reading The Museum of Innocence if I hated it so much? The possibilities are multiple, but the basic answer is that I hoped Pamuk would find his way out of the morass he was creating. Nope, he was so wedded to Kemal’s narcissism that it sank him. A feeble pirouette of post-modernism and irony at the end arrive too late to save this novel from disaster.	...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 11, 2014","Mar 11, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6282753-the-museum-of-innocence

These are simple, as is village life, and yet complex with inexplicable portents, happenings, mishaps, and conflicts beneath the surface of things.	One story, simply called “Digging” never gets into exactly what the residents of a certain house think they are hearing in the middle of the night, but it sounds like shovels and picks, and this takes on a life of its own in the reader’s might as one wonders if he’s talking about Israel’s past or its future or its unresolved present--everything being undermined, nothing being what it seems.	The lead story, “Heirs,” is my favorite for its deadpan Kafkaesque conclusion. A pushy Jew who claims to be related to the prime occupant of a house has come down from somewhere in Russia to lay claim to co-ownership. Only one problem: the house still really belongs to the owner’s mother. Said prime occupant is irritated, infuriated, and then ultimately melts out of a kind of indifference and surrender.	In another story, “Waiting,” the village mayor receives a note from his wife that says, “Don’t worry about me.” He goes looking for her in all the usual places. He never finds her. Oz doesn’t say what doesn’t have to be said: she’s left him.	The Palestinian-Israeli dispute is treated lightly but not ignored in this collection. It’s more than background noise but only bursts into plain view once or twice. The focus really is on the simplicity of doctors, teachers, widowers, adolescents, etc., pursuing lives that are very elemental, full of routines, shifts in the weather from sizzling to misty, and marked by stray bits of news from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem but not much changed by larger events. This is a village that has all but abandoned agriculture for retail ventures and the various professions. It’s a village where the older generation still gets together and sings melancholy songs and tries, with no success, to keep its ailments and disappointments secret.	One must think of Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson when reading Scenes from a Village Life. There are odd characters here, complainers, connivers, and lots of lonely, reflective, yearning folk.	A few stories don’t quite work. For me the last story, a kind of fable, was a disappointment and shouldn’t have been included. There’s an odd note of moralism in it that the other stories hint at but evade, leaving things more up in the air and ambiguous. That’s Oz at his most artful and his best, when he’s writing about something and you know he’s writing about something else, but he doesn’t tell you that, he lets you fill in the blanks...the haunting something else in life that always is the most important part of an average day.

Its hero is a wandering Russian named Serebin. Serebin's lover is named Marie-Galante, who sometimes has to switch roles and attend to her husband instead of helping Serebin do his part in the war. Ostensibly that role centers on assisting Russians stranded abroad, but in fact, he is linked to a shadowy network of subversives who recognize what everyone recognizes: Germany has lots of coal, but not much, if any, oil.Writing with a degree of historical accuracy that sometimes is astounding, Furst can't be counterfactual. There's no way this novel could end in Hitler running out of gas, but in layer after layer of intrigue, there undoubtedly was an ongoing obsession with bringing that about. HIs trucks, his tanks, and his troops would have been paralyzed, not to mention the Luftwaffe.Serebin has numerous moody adventures, a lot of patience, a great tolerance for ambiguity, and a great deal of luck, if not a great deal of success.Furst writes so well that I found myself wondering why his novels don't read at the level of, say, Joseph Conrad. I suppose the answer would be twofold. He writes well, but not with Conrad's awesome precision and authority. And there is something unexplored about a character like Serebin. Why does he take the risks he does? It is simply assumed everyone would do so under the same circumstances? I don't think so. Is it because Serebin has a deep vision of the evil being perpetrated by the Nazis? Again, I don't think so. There is a careless passion about this man that Conrad would have worked up in greater detail. At times he wouldn't fall into the next sequence of action but rather into a period of reflection, uncertainty, fear or bitterness.The effect in this particular novel is a little bit like what we get in James Bond stories. There is a lot of drama and risk but less emotional impact than we might like...or that I might like, to be more direct.That said, I enjoy Furst's novels a great deal. He makes the Danube interesting in this book; he captures, somewhat broadly, the role of disparate connivers who'd do anything to stop Germany; he's good at shadows, mists, and darkness.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 22, 2014","Feb 20, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/345354.Blood_of_Victory

He's a retired literary agent, now living with his wife Ruth in California and still depressed about their son's early death in a surfing accident, which Joe thinks might have been suicide.The Penguin paperback edition I read has an introduction by Jane Smiley that is really good. It situates Stegner in the context of his literary times, noting his feeling that the Eastern establishment (aka New York Times) didn't have much use for western writers like him. Smiley also points out how prolific and expert Stegner was in his sixties. I generally skip introductions so I can form my own opinion about a book; in this case, I just happened to fall into Smiley's comments, and I'm glad I did.Joe Allston in this book is still a cantankerous crank who hates getting old, hates the loose morals and aesthetics of the younger generation, and conceives of himself as a nonparticipant in the game of life--a spectator, in other words.The heart of this novel has to do with Joe reading aloud to Ruth some journals he kept about a trip he and Ruth took to Denmark decades earlier. These journals are revealing and strange. Joe and Ruth lodged with a countess whose husband was a quisling in WWII (German sympathizer) and whose father was a peculiar scientist interested in evolution and genetics. His experiments, including exercise of droit de seigneur, are unpleasant and have wretched outcomes, including his suicide (his wife commited suicide, too). In short, Joe fell for the countess, had a brief touching of lips, and Ruth got him out of town before things grew too serious to damage their marriage. But they never discussed what happened…not until Joe reads, somewhat against his will, his journals to Ruth.Joe's vulnerability to impossible passion is well-rendered here. We've seen Stegner handle this topic marvelously before in The Angle of Repose. Then it was a woman's decision to withhold herself from a man. In this case, Joe probably would have wrecked everything if the countess had let him--and Ruth knows it and is jealous about it but also, in a way, glad there is an element of the romantic in Joe.The Spectator Bird is compact, a bit discursive when not devoted to the journals, and written with Stegner's great authority as a prose master. He's a genius at describing nature, and he's an excellent psychologist. Karen Blixen, the Danish writer of things African, makes a pungent appearance. The weirdness of the countess's family is clearly delineated. Narratively, I would say Stegner took a great risk writing two books in one--old age in California, middle-age in Denmark--but he was rewarded for it with the National Book Award.If you like Stegner, read this book. If you like Walker Percy, whom Stegner resembled in a way, read this book. If you like Jane Smiley, read this book. There are many paths into it. Stegner groused a lot, but he was a major writer.For more of my comments on contemporary literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle.)

It's a book that exploits childhood demons, ripping them out of a little boy's head and sending them spinning into the Sussex countryside. That done, the straightforward writing reveals stranger and stranger realities...and a contest between good forces and bad.There are wormholes, weird shape-shifting beings, self-sacrificing bursts of energy, and scenes where our little boy isn't on solid ground, not at all.Overall, I thought the book was entertaining, imaginative, and somewhat self-limiting. By that I mean the underlying genre requires the boy survive even if other characters don't.Gaiman has, without question, a wonderful sense of imagery, a firm touch with character, and a high degree of comfort with the ambiguous.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2014","Feb 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane

It puts on full display allBefore I write anything else, I want to emphasize that Alexander Solzhenitsyn's August 1914 is a splendid, ambitious book. It puts on full display all of his talents as a novelist who creates intriguing characters, moves easily through different dimensions of society (rural, urban, upper class, military class, aristocracy, intelligentsia), and carries heavy narrative burdens with unflagging strength. By the end of his life, Solzhenitsyn was considered something of a nationalistic, messianic crank who had gotten himself in a multi-volume historical writing project he couldn't pull off. I'll note that judgment and perhaps address it another time. Now I'd like to place August 1914, the first volume of this project, in the context of a long stream of great Russian novels. Beyond that, I'd like to note that as conventional a writer as Solzhenitsyn could be, he also was willing to take risks--not as experiments in aesthetic form but as attempts to get deeper into his subject.His subject in this novel, obviously, is Russia's role in the first phase of World War I. The main focus of the novel is her abysmal failure in the attempt to break through East Prussia and set up an assault on Berlin. Before conflict begins, however, Solzhenitsyn surveys a number of characters and families much as Tolstoy did in War and Peace. In fact, Tolstoy plays a cameo role in this novel, and credibly so. It seems to me that Solzhenitsyn portrays him exactly as he came to be at the end of his life: perplexed, convinced that love was the answer, ashamed of his wealth and stature, a great novelist and a worldwide religious leader with no prentions to either role.These early chapters contain some of the best elements of August 1914. We see a Russia that following the debacle of Russia's defeat by Japan in 1905 had little trust in Nicholas II and his aristocratic cronies. There's lots of ferment, open criticism, and interest in reordering society along different lines, especially among the younger generation. Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn both spent grueling years in prison camps before and after this period for expressing their dissent in milder forms. Nicholas II's reign was less severe than that of his predecessors and successors, i.e., Lenin and then Stalin (the worst of the worst).Logically some of these characters introduced early in the novel are then fed into the war--the young men to fight, the young women to wonder when the fighting would end.The war, specifically General Samsonov's loss of the Second Russian army largely as a result of the incompetence and cowardice of his superiors, is the heart of the novel. I don't know, but I assume the maneuvering herein described is historically accurate. More than accurate, it's detailed, and it's peopled by fascinating characters. Samsonov, an honest man, being one, and Vorotynstev, a general staff colonel, being another.The problem with war novels in general is keeping track of the action, imagining the landscape, the roadways, the forests, the implications of going north or south, the lakes, and so forth. This makes August 1914 heavy going at times, but it's Solzhenitsyn's objective that we, the readers, fully understand the complexity and ambiguity of war, its consequences, its heroism and its stupidities. So he needs the fabric of the fight. If that likely will bore you, you won't finish August 1914 and might as well not start.This would be a pity because the final section of the book is a magnificent study and dramatization of the frailty of power. Samsonov having committed suicide, it's left to Vorotynstev to confront the General Staff and Grand-Duke Nikolai-Nikolaevich in order to explain what really happened to Samsonov's army. He does this at his peril, but he can't abide the lies and distortions higher levels of command heap on Samsonov ex post facto when they were the ones who let Samsonov perish.Solzehnitsyn's analysis of what goes into ""telling truth to power"" is brilliant. I know exactly what he's talking about because I tried it in the early stages of the Iraq war. Power wins, truth be damned, simple as that, whether the leadership is born into authority or elected to it. Solzehnitsyn's portrayal of Samsonov, Vorotynstev, and the Grand Duke are highest order literature and analysis of human relations and motivations.The tedious twisting and turning and thrashing and suffering that go into making war are, as Solzhenitsyn concludes, a mixture of fog and folly. In this case, it soon will lead to the overthrow of the old regime and the new order of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism. This won't be a welcome development for the Russian people, with whom Solzhenitsyn's (like Dostoevsky's) sympathies lie. But in the imagination of many great Russian writers and thinkers, suffering is one of the Russian people's greatest virtues and vices, fostered by authoritarianism above and, I would speculate, Orthodox Christianity below. Neither Dostoevsky nor Solzhenitsyn would agree with me on this latter point. They'd both turn their backs on me exactly as, in the end, Grand-Duke Nikolai-Nikolaevich turned his back on Vorotynstev.For more of my comments on literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 06, 2014","Feb 06, 2014","Feb 06, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/216512.August_1914

Is amateurism the element of doom in all marriages, or just this one, the one Tyler describes?In her novel, Tyler has Michael meet Pauline just after Pearl Harbor is attacked. Like everyone just out of high school in Baltimore, Michael rushes to enlist. This foreshortens the time available for Michael and Pauline to get to know one another really well (not much of an option in those days, anyway) and leads to several decades of mismatch. Their oldest daughter, Lindy, runs away in her late teens and stays disappeared for twenty-nine years. When she returns, she sums up the relationship between Michael and Pauline as like glass and ice...similar in appearance but different in essence.Michael is methodical, steady, withdrawn, introverted. Pauline is inventive, curious, expressive, and extraverted. She gets through life by quarreling and then moving on. Michael doesn't move on. The quarrels mount up. One quarrel too many does it. She says he can leave if he wants, and that's exactly what he wants. Their marriage has been hell (not helped by having that run-away daughter who also abandoned a 3-year old they had to raise) and he wants out. For real.This novel reminds me of several similar novels: Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates, American Pastoral by Philip Roth, and different elements of John Updike's Rabbit books. They all have a rise and fall that matches rhythms in American life. They all take you through time, decades, and create the sensation that you have lived with their principal characters and will miss them, in some cases a great deal.I'd say that Pauline and Michael are among the least inherently interesting lead characters among these books, but one understands their impulse to marry, to have someone to hold onto, and then their process of discovery: I don't get along with this person, I'm never happy, I never say the right thing, I don't know what to do. The radical inflection in the narrative is Lindy's disappearance, and it turns out, predictably, that she fled in large part because she thought her family was one huge trap. At least this pushes Pauline and Michael to work together in raising ""Pagan,"" Lindy's abandoned son, for a while before their divorce, and in the process they discover moments of affection and inspiration that are good, not bad...just as not all of their marriage was bad, some of it was good...just not good enough.Typically Anne Tyler sets her novels in Baltimore, a city I've lived in, too. She uses the setting well and traces the flight to the suburbs that occurred in the fifties perfectly. Her writing is steady and firm. She makes good use of short sentences in both exposition and dialogue without creating an excessively spare effect. Her compassion for these troubled souls is real yet irreverent; she moves smoothly from the pre-divorce life of the parents to the post-divorce life of the parents to the life of the next generation and even the generation after that. Ultimately she allows Michael to find a soulmate. Pauline doesn't fare so well. This may reflect some kind of moral balancing on Tyler's part. After all, Pauline got more out of life than Michael when she was alive, and he needs more time to catch up, which he never will....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 26, 2014","Jan 26, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15764.The_Amateur_Marriage

Some say this is perhaps the first great novel in a long string of great Russian novels…except that it isn't a great novel…it is a patchwork, a kind of romance…either beautifully written, according to some, or, according to a great Russian stylist, Vladimir Nabokov, an atrociously written novel, full of cliches and malapropisms. The setting is the Caucasus region where Russians liked both to bully the indigenous peoples and restore themselves with fresh air and fresh water…battlefields and spas, in other words…full of Chechens who had the misfortune of living in a beautiful place the Russians wanted for their own.The hero is one Pechorin, a military officer on some kind of extended leave, or intermittent duty. He slips into the narrative when it's already moving in another direction but manages to leave behind, carelessly and arrogantly, a kind of diary that forms the bulk of the book.In the diary he tells a tale of humiliating a young princess, restoring her honor with a cynical duel, and then throwing his hands up and marching away. Pechorin does all this for the fun of it and to disguise his real passion for another woman, a married one, staying at the same spa. That woman, in turn, is humiliated before her husband and escapes Pechorin's grasp, but remember, this is a romance, so of course Pechorin only loses her by literally riding his horse to death in pursuit.What to make of this? My sense is that romanticism--the Byronesque cult of the exceptional man and his exalted sensibility--runs smack into difficulties on two sides. First, if you weren't the czar or a great aristocrat in Russia in those days, your greatness had its wings clipped. Second, if you were a Russian, not an Englishman, you harbored an internal, psychological sense of littleness, pointlessness, and self-alienation.A Hero of Our Time really anticipates, despite its exalted language and romantic setting, Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground, exhibiting fierce futility, megalomania, and wicked irony. Through Gogol to Dostoevsky a sense of dark humor entered Russian literature. It wasn't quite there in Lermontov's time, but Pechorin does laugh at himself mercilessly as he goes about tearing himself and others down. He's got the lowest opinion of himself and cannot explain his perversity, but his perversity, the sense of the romantic hero being turned against himself, is what he's all about. The book ends with an authorial statement in which the supposed narrator--in effect, I would guess, Lermontov himself--explains his attempt to portray something real, not hold up a moral example. The title of the book, of course, is ironic, and so we're led to conclude that Lermontov was pessimistic about the evolution of Russian culture…and yet--here we have the perversity again--he celebrates Pechorin's lacerating but icy disdain for himself, for others, for customs and conventions. There's the man from underground muttering: let me out, I'm coming, fool and loser that I am. At least that's what I hear.For more of my comments on literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2014","Jan 23, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/226378.A_Hero_of_Our_Time

Its strength derives from the fact that her approach is inductive, i.e., she offers historically-grounded case studies of the warlordism phenomenon without forcing it within a pre-cooked theory of international relations. This makes the book readable, colorful, sometimes excessively abundant in detail, but generally illuminating.	Having spent twenty-five years as a diplomat, and having worked on the Iraq issue in particular, I found Warlords useful and insightful.	Basically a warlord is an individual who can contest sovereignty within a state by means of violence that is funded by crime and sometimes fueled by religious or nationalistic passions. Within the warlord's region, he exercises a brutal, exploitative degree of control that a state often cannot subdue. At the same time, however, warlords often look for and require external patrons to hold their ground. This was true in Chechnya, Iraq, and Pakistan, and less true in Georgia, where a nationalist/populist leader took on pre-existing warlords and more or less put them in their place on his own .	Marten wisely draws the conclusion that warlordism is not a good precursor to long-term state stability; warlordism will exploit any patron and switch sides in the blink of an eye; in effect, a strong state with strong institutions is the warlord’s greatest enemy.	In the Chechen case, the Russians decided to end their long-term conflict with separatists by creating their own warlord and letting him operate independently without declaring Chechnya's independence. That's an interesting approach, but there will come a day when the warlord in question will die or be assassinated, and instability and conflict will resume.	In the case of Iraq, U.S. policy supporting the so-called Sunni Sons of Iraq as a means of crippling al-Qaeda in Iraq always had limits. Yes, al-Qaeda in Iraq was beaten down by Iraqi sheiks acting like warlords, but those sheiks quickly found themselves unloved by the ruling Shia majority despite their contribution to a temporary pacification of the country. Today we see the fundamental problems of Iraq--sectarian and ethnic--resurfacing. Al-Qaeda is back, too.	In the Pakistani case, Marten explores a fascinating alternative to warlordism in unruly areas. There was a period in the late 1970s and 80s when Pakistani migration to the Gulf States eased political pressures and spurred economic development through remittances to the Federally Administered Tribal Area and Northwest Frontier Provinces. The idea of eluding warlords’ grasp through economically-driven emigration is an interesting one. The emigrants then send back enough money to enable their families to build independent lives, or at least that is what happened for a period of some years in Pakistan. But then oil booms petered out and many jobs that once were available in the Gulf disappeared. So the conflict-prone areas of Pakistan had nowhere to send their young men and many of them had begun pursuing lives as students of Islam in madrassas. This facilitated radicalism because madrassa graduates knew nothing but the Quran. They were not equipped to do much more than become footsoldiers in decades-long fighting that led to the Taliban, who became al-Qaeda's hosts and America’s enemy. We live with the consequences to this day.	There are many other cases of warlordism in the world Marten could have explored. Africa is full of such cases. The southern tier of the former-Soviet Union has, in certain instances, been hijacked by warlords. Their perniciousness is, of course, the arbitrary use of violence and economic exploitation as a means of exercising de facto, not de jure, control of subjugated populations.	Warlords is a specialized book but not really a specialist's book. It's accessible and performs a great service in tackling a protean pox on the affairs of vast regions of the world. The ultimate answer is the rule of law, with full respect for civil and human rights. This requires a level of fair, effecgtive governance, however, that exceeds the abilities of many states around the globe.	One more point: Marten emphasizes that trying to spur economic development through assistance and development programs flowing through the hands of warlords and traditional bosses is simply doomed to failure. The money is quickly stolen, and corruption becomes the real enterprise it stimulates, not the development of useful businesses and social institutions like schools, hospitals, and transportation systems.

The story focuses on Victor Maskell, looselyThe Untouchable by John Banville is an exceptionally good book, one of the best I've read in a long time. The story focuses on Victor Maskell, loosely based on the figure of Anthony Blunt, one of the infamous Cambridge Five, or Six…or Seven…, who in the 1930s began spying for the Soviets and continued to do so right through WWII, when Maskell indicates that he'd had enough, he wanted to live out his life as an art historian (keeper of the King of England's drawings and paintings and director of an art institute.)Setting the historical spy ring aside and focusing on the novel, Banville creates a marvelous, multi-faceted, cheeky, proud, insecure, and eloquent figure in Maskell. Like Banville, Maskell writes beautifully about the sky's soaring commentary on the earth (how the clouds scudded along, how the sun blazed, how the mists and fogs and shadows drifted down upon mortals in imitation of their engimas and flaws). Beyond that, he captures complex action involving English folk who seem to become more and more irritating the higher they rise in society and more vicious and cynical the lower they fall (or were born). The dialogue is great--fast, to the point, always in character--and there is a pretty convincing rendition of what spying in those days was all about: filching decoded documents, reporting on who was up and who was down, correcting Soviet misapprehensions about Great Britain's capabilities and intentions. Lots of this is what spies call pocket litter, stuff you snatch without seeing any value in it, just letting the analysts figure it out.Maskell was born to a prelate in Ireland, went to Cambridge, and fell into a situation that was wrong-headed but made a certain sense at the time. He and his fellows saw the 1930s as a period when socialism and fascism were going head-to-head, England was too weak-kneed to deal with this battle, and America had no appetite for recrossing the Atlantic as well. The Spanish Civil War had an incendiary effect on these young men and women. They didn't like the Soviet Union and, as it is phrased in the book, wish socialism had prevailed somewhere else, but it didn't, so they sided with Stalin and stuck to him and each other through the ultimate struggle with Hitler.Maskell becomes a respected art historian, a lover of Poussin, in particular, and marries. He may or may not have been the father of his children. Probably not. Soon after marriage, he realizes he's gay. A lot of his crowd is gay. So there are two undersides to respectability here: the refined Cambridge/Oxford class spying and the refined Cambridge/Oxford class slumming for homosexual opportunities.Maskell is cheeky, diffident, candid, eloquent, snotty and wise about his situation. Coming from Northern Ireland, he's ""all right,"" meaning he isn't Catholic, but his brain leads him upward and gets him, too smart by half, into a situation that has to turn out badly.Passages in this book wherein the rain falls on windows and glistens on the street and is reflected in unsympathetic eyes are wonderful. Banville is a superb stylist. He refers to Blake now and then, but not too often. He describes Poussin and others in terms befitting a true art historian. He captures the misery, fatalism, and luck of living through the London Blitz persuasively.Some of the characters in the book are fully realized the moment they walk on stage. Others, Maskell's wife, doesn't really come through until the end. And still others, it seems to me (I'm thinking of his brother-in-law) are a bit too archly and indefinitely drawn. Maskell isn't meant to understand exactly how and why his brother-in-law must come out on top, must have been the one who sold him out, and the confrontation with Mark at the end of the book is blown off in a kind of summary rather than a real scene, which is unfortunate.The novel is written as a memoir after Maskell has been outed as a spy many years after making a deal to turn over what he knew in exchange for maintaining his place (and job) in society. He has some kind of cancer, but he has, befitting an art historian, an astonishing memory, and he wants what he's gone through to be known. The words ""traitor"" and ""spy"" thrown at him in the press are too simple; they don't convey the legitimate moral complexity or the substance of a life over which Maskell didn't have full control.In the book, Maskell acknowledges that his actions must have led to certain deaths. Sir Anthony Blunt denied this. Both would agree they were out of their depth. Banville's Maskell is by far the more interesting character, though. The Untouchable is a book worth reading.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2014","Jan 21, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/163.The_Untouchable

ThAs I was saying when I recently ed Ford Madox Ford's novel, Parade's End, I hadn't read anything else by him since I was a senior in college. Then I read The Good Soldier, which Ford wanted to call The Saddest Story, as one of the forty-two novels I needed to have ""under my belt"" to take my comprehensive exam.Well, now I've read it again, and I have fairly good idea about why it is so deliberately confused and confusing, and I also think that in the spring of 1972 as I read a novel a day to catch up I can't possibly have had much insight into its perplexing inconsistencies. The Oddest Story, I would call it, not without some grudging admiration and suspicion.Here's how it goes: An American millionaire named Dowell narrates a story in fits and starts about how his wife Florence betrayed him with a feckless English gentleman named Edward whose wife Leonora knew all about it without telling Dowell for years. Upshot: Florence and Edward commit suicide. Leonora marries a dolt from a nearby country estate, and Dowell, fed up with life, buys Edward's old estate and lives there by himself, grousing his way through this sad, sad tale.He is, our Dowell, an ""unreliable narrator,"" not through cunning, more through an absent-mindedness and species of carelessness found in royalty and the very rich. But he is also an ""unreliable narrator"" because Ford wanted to write what became a kind of pre-modern novel, a vague, wandering tale, not at all stream-of-consciousness, more stream-of-forgetfulness, impressionistic. He is blessed with a strong prose style. (Ford was close to Conrad, a great master of prose style.) And yet that prose style is prone to fey contradictions as in: I loved him terribly. And yet I don't know why I loved him. Actually, I hated him. But for all that, he was admirable, you know, terribly admirable, the kind of man upon which a nation can depend, if not a wife. (I wrote that, by the way, but it's a pretty good imitation.)So at spas and on estates the story of this quartet loops around, a kind of wild lariat in Dowell's hands, putting nooses around the delicate necks of young women, married and unmarried, and choking the life out of them before, in the end, it does itself in, too. You see the philandering Edward didn't just have at Florence, Dowell's wife. There were others, several of them. He was, in Dowell's estimation, the best of men, the epitome of the good soldier, just not when it came to his self-indulgent sentimentality.Am I saying you should read this novel? I am not saying that. I am wondering why, fifty years ago, my professors thought I should read it. In the particular edition I have just finished, there is abundant commentary in agreement with my professors--what a masterpiece, how brilliant--and one (to me) peculiar dissent.Let me go into this a bit and expose my suspicions. The praise from many well-known literati (Joseph Conrad, Rebecca West, etc.) may have been the result of Ford's unbelievable helpfulness to the literary world. He was a great, great supporter of indigent writers, underestimated writers, writers who would become great, truly great. And I suspect they all went along with this peculiarly affected experiment of a novel out of loyalty. In fact, I think that often happens in the literary world (shame on me, I know, but I've heard writers are human, too; being one, I can testify to that.)And yet, to my discomfort, the dissent came from Theodore Dreiser, one of the worst novelists, if not the worst, on my canonical list of forty-two. Dreiser, in his novels, wrote so badly that I would want to gargle and shower after an hour reading him. But the damnation Dreiser offers in the selected comments appended to this Barnes & Noble Classic is, to my astonishment, very well written, and I agree with it. He says there might be a worthwhile story in The Good Soldier if someone who knew how to write wrote it.Hmmm. What was I saying? I hate Dreiser, but I love Dreiser? Dreiser wrote appallingly but Dreiser wrote trenchantly?Let me shoot this  right now with a final bullet: The Good Soldier is important because it marks a transition from Edwardian writing to modern writing; it's pivotal in that sense, but dear lord, Dreiser was right: it wasn't Ford's best novel, even if Ford and all his cronies and all my professors thought it was....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 06, 2017","Jan 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7628.The_Good_Soldier

He is a hinge figure, in some senses, between the classical era (still a great influence on the educated classes of Europe) and the subsequent ventures into the Age of Reason and Romanticism.Montaigne isn't a writer to be read front to back. He's to be read a little bit at a time. His chief subject is how he fits into the world, what kind of man he is, his defects, his influences, his virtues--if there be any--and his persuit of a kind of wholeness or completeness that could be said to be best found in his great hero, Socrates.Like Socrates, Montaigne was imperturbable when encountering his own ignorance. In the ""Selected Essays"" I recently read, I found him deeply passionate about one thing only: friendship. Here he reflects his feelings for Estienne de la Boetie in terms that amount to a merger of wills, identities, sensibilities, world views, moods and humors. He is clear about this kind of friendship. You look at one another and know what you're both thinking or will both say. Almost all of us have had, however briefly, such an attachment. It's not romantic or sexual; again, it's a congruence of selves, a happy happenstance, something one can trust (and something that, when it dissapears, is a bitter loss.)Montaigne goes so far as to say--and I agree with him--that the best thing you can do as a friend is ask your friend to do something for you. He explains the paradox as follows: Allowing your friend to help you is a gift, as giving is a gift. There's meaning in a gesture that benefits another one cannot obtain from doing something for oneself.Somewhat unfortunately Montaigne is the author who focused on Aristotle's peculiar statement--""O friends, there is no friend!""--because this enignma gave birth to one of the most tedious books I've ever wrestled with, Jacques Derrida's The Politics of Friendship. What, Derrida asks for hundreds of pages, could Aristotle have meant? If you are addressing friends, then you cannot say there are no friends, can you?I still don't have the answer to this conundrum, but I eventually concluded that from the title forward Derrida had everything wrong: there are, in fact, no politics in friendship, there are no trade-offs, deals, alliances, competitions. The fact that Aristotle seems to have said otherwise would point, I should think, to the fundamental Aristotelian premise that man is a political animal. A deeper soul-to-soul interpenetration wasn't his chief subject.Above I used the word ""discursive"" advisedly. Montaigne maintains in ""On Books"" that he is an intermittent, scatter-shot reader, but this isn't quite true, given his mastery of the classics and the apposite stories and quotes he draws on, mostly from the Latin authors because his Greek wasn't strong. What he seems to mean in observing himself closely is that the mind wanders and ""bloweth where it listeth."" He's suggesting that there are impentrable mysteries in everyone, perhaps divine, perhaps originating in study or that modern rarity, solitude.""On Solitude"" is one of Montaigne's more famous essays; it's a theme he returns to elsewhere as well. How can one be alone and what comes of being alone? How do you manage being alone? What do you think when your purpose is neither to speak nor write but simply understand the peculiarities of your being? In ""Of Three Commerces"" Montaigne writes about his famous tower, where he often hid himself with his books or simply secluded himself to reflect toward no specific end. I have long thought that in the pre-Internet age, or let's go further: in the pre-Information Age, men and women expressed themselves with more clarity, more definition. Why? Because they were less distracted by trivia--and perhaps also because the better-educated classes were….well, better educated.Montaigne makes a point of saying that it's possible to maintain one's solitary integrity in a royal court, more difficult to do so in the presence of a beautiful woman, and almost impossible to do so when wrestling with what he and we both would call business--the getting and spending of things.As an essayist and a person, what interested him was the core, sentient self, nourshing and expressing it. He valued life, as he makes clear in ""On Cruelty."" He saw enormities in a man as complexly simple as Socrates. By the same token (and I am not the only one to sense this) he served as a kind of moderate precursor to what Shakespeare had in mind when he created Hamlet. I say ""moderate"" because Montaigne was temperate,never rash, and little provoked. But when you read him and encounter him thinking…and thinking…and thinking…it's almost inevitable that you wonder if an unprovoked Hamlet wouldn't have been somewhat like him. (Though of course Hamlet was provoked, and therein lay the tragedy.)The balance we had in Western Civilization in Montaigne's time was provided by classical precedents that had not yet succumbed to the self-absorption of Romanticism, yielding wild claims to the meaning of indvidual sovereignty (U.S. insistence on democracy for everyone) and a counter-reaction emphasizing unity of all beneath one God/Allah/state (Islamacism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism).Montaigne always found ways to lean forward and yet hold himself back at the same time. He was acute,but he was cautious. He had a sense of the golden mean, the desirable middle between two extremes. Not being systematic, he could continue to explore, and that's precisely what he thought he should do, as laid out in ""That It Is Folly to Measure Truth and Error by Our Own Capacity.""For more of my comments on literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2014","Jan 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18691256-selected-essays

Having spent twenty-five years in foreign affairs, I can say these things, or you can deduce them on your own by reflecting on the newspapers you’ve read over the last ten, twenty, or thirty years.	Some features of le Carré’s characters--the good ones--don’t quite reach me. There are some major crises of conscience at the center of the story that strike me as forced, if not not naive. The fact that innocent people die when private security firms execute an operation is deplorable but commonplace. Sometimes semi-intentional mistakes are made, as in the case of this novel’s key operation. Sometimes people with automatic weapons simply break. This is nothing to be blasé about. I don’t fault le Carré for presenting agitated good guys; they just seem a bit uninformed about what they themselves have been doing.	The novel concludes with an Assange/Snowden moment. To me this seems more borrowed than built. It’s narratively logical, but there’s that old tension in novels by writers like le Carré, as good as he is: do you serve the plot or do you end the story in the ambiguities of your principal characters?	By now I think you’ve deduced what this novel focuses on, and if you find yourself interested in such things, you’ll like A Delicate Truth. There’s not a lame sentence in it.

I first readGraham Green has long been one of my favorite writers, and re-reading The End of the Affair enables me to say how long--over forty years. I first read this novel as a sophomore in college and liked its moody directness, the way it tore into very human problems, and its awkward mess of several lives thrown together into a story that somehow achieved a wholeness.We don’t actually live the way writers write, of course, because life itself is so full of irrelevant distractions and endless back-stories that don’t merit the telling. There has to be selection and compression--a theme, almost a hostage-taking--that puts fiction right.Greene wrote this novel around the theme of passion, though he never quite stated it that way, calling the emotions in question love and hate, and he concentrated hardest on a brief affair that a writer had with a civil servant’s wife while framing it within the larger question of whether events occur because chance would have it so or God is somehow involved.Bendrix, the lover, is a sour, fierce, self-hating kind of man and he shares his bent toward hatred liberally with almost everyone he meets, and even those he loves. The novel opens in the spirit not of Othello jealous but of Iago jealous--jealous and impotent and furious--because Desdemona/Sarah has eluded his traps. How dare she make a pact with God that if Bendrix survived a bombing in London’s WWII Blitz, she would give him up? Why would she do such a thing? How could she begin to believe that God was more real than Bendrix, much less more important?For two years after their parting, Bendrix tortures himself with suspicions about Sarah’s deepest motives. Another lover in a series of lovers? A reignited loyalty to her husband Henry? An attraction to an atheistic rationalist who falls in love with her and asks her to marry him?Ultimately Bendrix hires a private investigator and gets his hands on Sarah’s diary. There he reads about her commitment to him and pledge to God, in whom she barely believes and yet cannot jettison. So he’s been wrong in his hatred and becomes quite bitter that events play out so that Sarah leaves this earth before he can make another plea for their reunion.If the book were to end with Part III, I think would be better written and more stinging, but no, it goes on into the afterlife of Sarah’s survivors as recounted by Bendrix who keeps talking about love and hate when he really means passion, which is the sum of both emotions. And oddly Part IV makes the novel more ambitious and important if not, technically, better. For it’s in Part IV that every survivor has to push at every other survivor, trying to squeeze out the truth of what Sarah’s life really meant, if it meant anything at all. And it’s in Part IV that Greene, an anguished Catholic himself, gets deep into the solitary struggles of the human soul where even lovers do not tread.Greene famously wrote 500 words a day, no more, no less, and he gives Bendrix the same trait. It’s a cold, mechanical, almost unbelievable way to write, but I would think it quite wonderful if you could do it--500 words done, never to be revisited. He also, as he reveals in this novel, sometimes found a character or two who wouldn’t come alive, wouldn’t do or say the right things, and that’s where he undoubtedly brought the most craft and force to bear, trying to break into this character’s secret places.The question and triumph of The End of the Affair is “Who is the recalcitrant character--Bendrix or Sarah”? In my view their intensity is well-matched, but since Sarah exhibits more self-control, it’s the lurching Bendrix, the indispensable narrator, with whom Greene wrestled the hardest--because Bendrix and Greene were one and the same.For more of my comments on literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 04, 2014","Jan 04, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29641.The_End_of_the_Affair

As we all know from long ago, this man can write, he can really write. His sentences twist, sparkle, crackle, double-back on themselves and are full of wise-guy stuff that’s bound to make almost anyone with a pulse laugh.	All that said, this is still a Pynchon novel which means that there is something going on, it’s disturbing, almost no one knows what it is, and at the end of the day the mystery subsides into perpetual...well, into perpetual mystery. There’s no “solution” here. The people who are scamming one another, stealing money, creating a Hades-like world of Deep Internet, dying and virtually dying suffer some losses, but the beat goes on.	The protagonist is Maxine Tarnow, or Loeffler, depending on whether she and her husband are on the same page or not. She’s a decertified fraud investigator who stumbles into the misdeeds of one Gabriel Ice, who is up to no good. The difference between Maxine and Gabriel is that Maxine is a novelistic character in the round with two kids, friends, parents, a secretary, etc., and Gabriel Ice is a phantom-like predator who seems to be one thing...then another...then a third. Is he working for the U.S. Government? Seems so. Is he being betrayed by an employee who diverts some of his funds to bad guys? Seems so. Do people get whacked as a result? Seems so. But we care about the indomitable, witty, daring Maxine, and Gabriel? Nah, he’s a nothing. Likewise a creep Maxine lets into her life named Windust.	No one in a Pynchon novel, certainly in this novel, is in control. There’s a parallel world going on which achieves weird cross-over effects between reality and virtual reality, both accessible, neither entirely believable...although reality, as we in America have experienced it in the last thirty years, populates so much of Pynchon’s fiction that it pleasingly smacks us in the face paragraph by paragraph.	End game? End game is for those who read the book, though I found it a little homey, flat and tame. One curious aspect of the novel, which I appreciated, is that it traipses through 9/11 without really giving it center stage. I like this because a lot has been written about 9/11 and not a lot more has to be written about it. For Pynchon to underplay it is a smart move. His general message is larger: we are in a kind of hyper-space now that requires a blend of street smarts and PhD level insight if we are going to survive. Mystery isn’t a religious thing, it’s a man-made permanent, legitimate, every day kind of thing. Not getting involved in trying to figure something out is boring, and Maxine is the exemplar of not-boring. She wields a pen, a keyboard, a gun, and a strip-house pole with equal aplomb. She has feelings but resists them when she knows she should and gives into them when she just has to.	On balance, I’d say this is a fun read but it becomes fitful toward the end. We are brought to earth in a kind of stumbling way. One character, wonderfully named Tallis, surfaces in full after not playing much of a role for the previous two hundred pages. New York itself achieves a kind of delicate quiescence. Things are bound to go wrong, kids are bound to grow up, life, too, will make its way ahead. As I say, not much of an ending, but a lot of fun getting there.

It’s also a novel about statelessness, inhumanity, good and bad luck, forgery versus forging, and the petty vanities and whims of the least consequential human beings--least consequential except to themselves.	Gass, the author of one of the best short stories ever written, “In the Heart of the Heart of the Country,” is a master prose stylist, philosopher, and conscientious objector who plays with the character of Joey (Dr. Joseph) Skizzen, his mother, his sister, and the small-time merchants and academics and librarians and junk sellers of middle America in such a way as to milk his text for minor episodes of suspense, conflict, rivalry, musical history, philosophy and moral theory. Joey doesn’t earn a doctorate but obtains a professorship at a small college teaching the history of music. He knows he’s a fraud, lacks a Social Security number, and so forth, yet has a way of narrowly escaping being exposed even as he self-teaches his way into becoming a reasonably effective musical historian and teacher.	Given Joey’s abandonment by his father and the horrors of living through the Blitz in WWII London, there’s a good general reason for him to maintain in his attic a kind of archive or museum of man’s inhumanity to man. This repository is a collection of accounts of all the senseless killings and acts of brutality that occur everywhere on earth all the time. It resonated with me perhaps because I’ve lived much of my life abroad and am aware that Americans aren’t the only people who die violent, unfair deaths, but there’s a lack of narrative connectedness uniting Joey’s story to the horrors of the world. He’s not an angry figure, he’s a frightened one, a timid one, and there is, finally, no crescendo wherein he is the one who unmasks the world for what it is as opposed to the world doing it to him.	So that’s a weak element in the text, but Gass really isn’t a novelist so much as a sentence and paragraph writer, someone who selects words with care and bundles them together with even greater care. In his early critical writings, he proposed that what fiction gives you is only what it gives you, which is to say that if a character is described as having red hair, you have a character with red hair, nothing more, no noticeable veins in his eyeballs, no limp, no flap of fat dripping over his belt, no disease of the moral organs wherever they are to be found in the human body. So Joey Skizzen sounds like a rich character as he floats through the text on puffs of words, but he, like most of Gass’s fictional characters, is flat, perhaps the ultimate example of “show don’t tell,” and yet rendered in baroque way because of Gass’s language. Middle C, in fact, is a kind of baroque Winesburg, Ohio without the pathos. It’s a bonanza of allusions, images, and provocative juxtapositions, not a novel wherein Joey’s fate becomes empathetically the reader’s fate.	Gass’s last novel, The Tunnel, was an unreadable screed that many critics hailed as a triumph. Like Middle C, it featured someone intensely aware of man’s inhumanity to man. Gass, in fact, has said he can’t really write unless he’s angry about something, and this accounts for the humorous and extensive variations of a sentence that Joey Skizzen obsessively rewrites having to do with the contradiction between one’s concern about humanity not surviving on this planet for long and one’s simultaneous hope that it makes its exit quickly.	Middle C is agreeably, musically readable; the prose dances; the narrative treats itself as a series of sketches that accord well with the meaning of “skizzen” in German--sketches. I wouldn’t call this novel a masterpiece, but even though Gass is 88, I wouldn’t call it a swan song, either. He’s a writer of seemingly infinite verbal resources; whatever he wants to do, he can do; and I see no sign that he won’t keep doing it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 25, 2013","Dec 25, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15741474-middle-c

He spends a good bit of time describing the ways in which Israel has battered and isolated the Gaza Strip, now governed by the anti-Israel Hamas party. He also spends a good bit of time presenting the Israeli right as utterly heartless, justifying itself by referring to what happened to the Jewish people in the Holocaust and vowing, “never again.”The tragedy in all this is that the Holocaust did happen, six million Jews died, and that the result was a Jewish state that did in fact displace Palestinians, push them off their lands, and make them feel existentially wronged to this day, so many years later.No one would want any of this to happen, but no one knows how to resolve it. Blumenthal presents an Israeli political class that has, in the interest of the Jewish state’s survival, no sympathy for the Palestinians’ plight. By the same token, many who have followed this conflict for a long time can point to instances of Palestinian aggression, or resistance, that have had ghastly consequences for Israelis.Ultimately, this combination of stand-off and struggle has had negative impact on both Israelis and Palestinians. The circumstances of their existence have coarsened them both, and that’s understandable.The underlying purpose of Goliath is no doubt to inform the American people that their Israeli “friends” are not liberal democrats and a bastion of freedom and stability in the autocratic, violent Middle East. Many details here are fresh and disturbing, but the overall “narrative” to this effect has been emerging for a long time. Currently Secretary of State John Kerry is expending a lot energy on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. He would seem to have two overriding motivations: first, simply to settle things in a non-violent way that both sides can accept; second, to demonstrate to the Arab/Muslim world that supports the Palestinians’ cause that the United States is an honest broker, a friend to Muslims as well as to Jews.Kerry’s chances are slim. He indicates that any time left for a “two-state solution” may be running out. In this he’s probably right in one sense and wrong in another. If his efforts bear no fruit within nine months to a year, the Obama administration will have to take a step back and probably not readdress the question. That’s the sense in which he’s right. The sense in which he’s wrong is that time will go on, the tragedy of competing claims will continue to fester, and the idea that the Palestinians might one day govern their own sovereign, internationally recognized state won’t disappear any more than Israel’s determination to survive will disappear....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2013","Dec 20, 2013",,MP3 CD,view (with text),/book/show/17366045-goliath

AreEvil Eye, a collection of four novellas by Joyce Carol Oates, is a study in the tricky malice of egotists, stalkers, killers, and child molesters. Are you surprised? This is Joyce Carol Oates we’re talking about. In her persistent fictional scenarios over many years a young girl (not always, but usually) is brutalized and exploited by males. In this collection, three of the novellas are related from the young woman’s point of view. To a certain extent, this makes their predators opaque, but Oates stays close to the action, writes in many one and two sentence paragraphs, and there is plenty of material presented that makes these men ogres. The one exception, “The Execution,” focuses on the plan a lifelong disturbed young male carries out to kill his parents; here we go into the feckless brutality and amorality of a narcissistic killer who does not even seem smart enough to appreciate the magnitude of his actions.“Evil Eye,” the lead novella, is probably the most tantalizing piece here. It’s an intriguing study of a young woman’s mistake in becoming the fourth wife of a man who has gone through so many women for a reason. He wants them in the house, but it’s his house and his life, and that’s the problem. The first wife explains this to the fourth wife. That provides an interesting juxtaposition since the first wife is an older woman now and she seems to have an excellent appreciation of how “the evil eye” keeps watch on her ex-husband.The last three novellas, “So Near...Any Time...Always,” “The Execution,” and “The Flatbed” are written with skill and concision. Short stories and novellas seem to bring out the best in Oates. When she writes a full-scale novel, she often writes carelessly; in fact, I don’t know of a major writer who has written more unfortunate sentences than Joyce Carol Oates. The oddity is that she is a highly knowledgeable literary critic and yet lacks good sense when it comes to her novels.In this case, she seems to be writing within a noir genre framework, her publisher being “The Mysterious Press,” an imprint of Grove/Atlantic, Inc. I’m not sure exactly how she distinguishes between more “literary” writing and this kind of writing, but it is true that here she stays very close to the topical horrors of our times. “The Flatbed” opens with a marvelously conceived image of how a child molester should be punished. In fact it’s much better than what actually happens to him, so possibly we can say that she is writing in hybrid forms here, partly literary and partly genre, the genre being rooted in the banality of the noir, the way it leaks out and infiltrates day-to-day living.I don’t think I have to recommend this book or counsel against it. By now you know if it’s your cup of malice or not.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 16, 2013","Dec 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14928740-evil-eye

This in itself is notable because Tom had been from the wrong side of the tracks in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the son of a gas station operator and went to Harvard on a scholarship, so his success was nothing short of spectacular, ending up in a second marriage (after the divorce from Lucy) to a good-looking,intelligent, well-grounded woman named Jane.	In a sense this is a novel of manners--bad manners. Indeed, the narrator, Philip, is a novelist, one who has won prizes and survived financially without becoming truly famous or celebrated. He re-encounters Lucy when both are entering old age, and much of the story, at the beginning, entails her laying out for him how badly Tom treated her. Sex and alcohol, but mainly sex, are featured elements in her recollection. Tom, she says, was insatiable, and learned how to do things she rather liked. (What those things were isn’t quite clear but the topic comes up again and again.) But even so, she was gorgeous and had had a lot of lovers, and there was one Swiss journalist who really, really knew how to do things sexually, and as the narrative progresses, he keeps cropping up.	A certain clubbiness begins to inform the story. The Harvard gang, transplanted to New York, meets for lunch and dinner and reminisces and Philip becomes more intrigued. Did Tom beat Lucy? Did Tom mistreat her in other ways? Some of his old college classmates warn him not to take her too seriously. Over the decades, they’d all been to bed with her, Philip included, so watch out, there are always two sides to any marital story.	Philip eventually ferrets out confirmation that Tom awkwardly, abruptly but justifiably left Lucy one day (and left his teenage son), upon having learned with certainty that she was carrying on again with the Swiss Lothario. This isn’t entirely surprising, nor is it, novelistically speaking, entirely interesting. We already know that Lucy has been seeing a therapist for a long time, and we already know that she drinks too much and reminisces too frequently about sex...sex...sex.	The core mystery of her dysfunction isn’t fully explored as far as I can tell. By the same token, it’s not clear to me why the novel must so decidedly come down on Tom’s side (with corroborating testimony in the form of a letter from the now adult son Tom ‘abandoned.’) Two-sided marital disputes are always the case. My point isn’t otherwise. My point is that Philip and others, including Lucy and Tom, essentially agree it was a bad match to begin with. That being so, how much really was lost? Or, to put it another way, how much did either of them gamble in the first place?	The general backdrop of moneyed cosmopolitans having at it in Paris, New York, Long Island, Rhode Island, and Connecticut left me unimpressed. It isn’t overdrawn; in fact, there’s a restrained modesty evident in some of these clubs and finer restaurants and apartments with exceptional views. But still, it’s little wonder that the overlarge lives of the rich go off the track. With money comes luxurious complications.	My disappointment in this book is influenced to a certain extent by a few very significant encounters I had with Louis Begley in the 1990s. I was a diplomat in Germany who oversaw cultural programs, and Begley’s first novel, Wartime Lies, had just come out in German. That’s when I met him: he was in Bonn and then Frankfurt to promote it.	The backdrop to Wartime Lies and Begely’s own life is this: Louis Begley was born a Jew in Poland in the 1930s, and he was fortunate to get out. Not all of his relatives did. He has said he doesn’t see himself as a Holocaust writer, but that couldn’t really be the case during his visit to Germany. I hosted a lunch for him at my house in Bonn and one extremely significant exchange took place. A young, very successful German diplomat participated and to everyone’s shock, she said something that reflected a lack of awareness about the Holocaust. Begley could hardly beg her pardon for upsetting her, but neither he nor the rest of us, Germans and Americans, could believe how upset she became on hearing a few widely known facts. He asked if she wasn’t told these things in school. She said no and was in tears. Her generation would have been what is known as “the grandchildren.” 	Begley was and remains a fine writer, but his case is so much more interesting than that. He took up fiction rather late in life, already having become a distinguished and successful international lawyer. By this I mean he was an extraordinarily sophisticated man of the world, based in both New York and Paris. Even so, how could he deal with or accept this German diplomat’s ignorance and distress? All he could do was shake his head. That’s all any of us could do.	The follow-up to this exchange took place a few days later in Frankfurt. Our America House director had worked with the Jewish community there to arrange a reading. I was responsible for the America Houses and took a great interest in promoting American literature. So I went down to Frankfurt for the night to hear Begley read from Wartime Lies and then answer questions. More “grandchildren” were present, lots of them, to their credit. Inevitably the subject of the Holocaust came up and what followed illustrated, to my mind, the centrality of literature in human experience. The occasion of Wartime Lies and the stories told within it caused one audience member to ask Begley how he felt about visiting Germany and what he took for his purpose. His answer was magnificent. He said he was a Jew, one who survived, and he thought it was critically important for him to come to Germany and let Germans look into his eyes as he looked into theirs, each aware of the history they shared. When he said that, the audience grew utterly quiet, Begley held everyone in his thrall, and a tremendous point was made, a moral point, a point that stories keep alive. All of us play a role in each other’s lives. What we do and what is done to us must be remembered, told and retold, and some day understood.

The end result, as in The Optimist’s Daughter, generally was close to perfection. In synthesis, The Optimist’s Daughter tells the tale of Laurel returning to Mississippi from Chicago when her elderly father, a judge, has a problem with his vision--a tear in the retina. He has remarried--a woman named Fay--and isn’t up to the procedure. He dies in the hospital, not without the selfish Fay complaining that his death is unfair to her. The novel continues to recount his funeral, Fay’s god-awful relatives showing up from Texas, and Laurel’s process of committing to heart the tangible things that Fay, by inheritance, has now “won.”	The novel is told in parts--the hospital, the death, the funeral, a period of reuniting with old friends, a period of recollecting family origins, and a final battle between Laurel and Fay. Southern, character-based “humor” weaves in and out of all these segments. At times the humor seems a bit too broad, at other times it’s simply devastating, though not as wicked as the dark humor in Flannery O’Connor.	The core value in this novel, if I can put it that way, is Laurel’s ultimate realism about the continuities of life, despite death, and the unimportance of small people laying claim to large truths. She is a character, like most of us, who finds both hello and goodbye in dying. The things the dead leave behind often reveal more than they wanted revealed in life...or were able to reveal in life. The fact that Laurel sorts through all this and ultimately decides to hang onto almost nothing is what gives her moral and emotional claim on everything. Her father made a mistake in both his marriages, most definitely in his second marriage to Fay. He was a revered but flawed figure. Fay comes to terms with that. She also finds solace in memories of the husband she lost in WWII and realizes that what he gave her, his love,his approach to life, remains with her and can’t be taken away.	One of the loveliest parts of the novel has to do with her mother’s trips home to West Virginia. These trips are reflected in Laurel’s childhood memories, and there is an eerie, lovely quietness about them. The mountain folk of West Virginia weren’t like the talkative, gossipy people she knew in small town Mississippi. They had a touch of wild nature in them that stilled their tongues and let events speak for themselves. Returning to what I mentioned earlier about Welty’s mode of composition, I can see her pausing at length over how to splice this sequence of memories and reflections into Laurel’s character and the ultimate wholeness she achieves. The tonalities are quite different, likewise the prose. In a sense, this part of the book rescues the story from the clutches of MIssissippi, which by the time of the funeral verges on a hysterical caricature of small town customs and insensitivity. 	The fascination of Fay, self-interested and narrow-minded, is also worth noting. Here is a woman who actually hits the old judge to try to stir him up and keep him from dying, but when the final battle between her and Laurel takes place, she seems to have the ability to fight more fairly. Of course there shouldn’t be any fighting at all, but at funerals and after deaths, there often is. Fortunately, in this case, Laurel has grown enough to understand she’ll get more by letting go than trying to hold on. What Fay receives is worthless, what Laurel receives is priceless.

Politkovskaya was a distiA Russian Diary by Anna Politkovskaya takes us into the Russia dominated by Vladimir Putin between 2003 through August 2005. Politkovskaya was a distinguished journalist by the time she began keeping this diaries, and she was murdered before the pre-publication editing process was complete.These are not self-oriented diaries in the least; they more closely resemble a reporter’s notebooks. The dominant theme is how Putin turned Russia into a FSB-state; the FSB, of course, is the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, of which Putin was an officer. Thus Putin turned the Russia duma, its parliament, into his puppet, the regional governors into his puppets, the courts into his puppets, and Chechnya into an overarching rationale for such fierce, mean-spirited oppression.We know this not only through Politkovskaya’s diaries, but the grinding, ludicrous, cynical behavior Putin exhibited during his first tours in power--following Yeltsin--is made brutally clear here.Entry after entry recounts arbitrary arrests, arbitrary torture, arbitrary judicial processes and a double-edged process in which Putin reduced social benefits on the one hand while pulling privatized corporations back into governmental control on the other. His aim was to undo the kleptocratic enrichment of Russian mega-billionaires under Yeltsin and add the spoils to his crony-government’s treasury along with dollars and sometimes pennies pulled out of the pockets of disabled war veterans, their widows, and families.This makes for discouraging but fascinating reading. There are stories told here that remind me of Solzhenitsyn. For instance, consider the conscript who was crippled by being forced to wear size ten boots when he had size thirteen feet. Or consider the judicial process in which lawyers were never given official, accurate transcripts of trial documents with which to prepare their clients’ defense. Or consider Russian brutality and corruption in Chechnya and the suggestion, time and again, that certain terrorist acts attributed to Chechnyan “terrorists” were perpetrated by various secret Russian services, not always Putin’s FSB.Again and again Politkovskaya surveys the landscape for some kind of effective political opposition. There isn’t any. Putin crushes real opponents, creates phony opponents, and has, it would seem only one ineffective but notable critic, Gary Kasparov, the former world champion grand chess master.The same situation prevails in the media. Only Politkovskaya’s newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reports the truth, but of course, that is stopped when she is shot to death in an elevator, a story she obviously would have reported with her succinct, ironic candor had she survived to write it.But she didn’t survive, and her international fame didn’t protect her any more than hundreds of Russians in search of freedom and democracy were protected.There are some issues in this book that warrant broader reflection. As a diary, it’s full of stories and anecdotes and reports that are not sourced. I have no doubt there’s little here that is inaccurate, but you’d like to know more about how Politkovskaya obtained her information. Naturally that would put sources’s lives at risk, so it’s understandable that many sources wouldn’t want to be named, but still, this is journalism, so every once in a while you do scratch your head.The overall picture Politkovskaya paints, however, is remarkably consistent with what we know through thousands of sources going back through the entire communist era and deep into the times of the tzars. She often notes this, and she also often notes that autocratic rule is largely accepted by Russians. The idea that George W. Bush could look into Putin’s eyes and recognize a well-intentioned man is hilarious in this context.Three previous Russian writers come to mind when considering Politkovskaya’s diaries. Dostoevsky published massive diaries that were, like hers, intensely focused on issues of public import. LIke her he castigated the judicial system; but he was a nationalist and found ways to forgive Russia while condemning enemies of its autocratic character and rule. Tolstoy kept eloquent diaries that brooded on his sins and the general sin of inequality throughout Russian society. Like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy had deep religious preoccupations and could not reconcile the precepts of Christianity with the masses living in abject poverty while a few danced minuets in grand ballrooms. The Russian voice closest to Politkovskaya’s among the great Russian writers is that of Chekhov, particularly his account of visiting the prison colony on the island of Sakhalin at the far edge of Siberia.The BIG question is how a nation as rich in natural resources and brilliant people and splendid cultural and intellectual institutions can be so insecure, cruel, and suspicious of its own population.We now have seen Putin surrender the Russian presidency and resume it yet again. He was “elected” but he’s the anti-democrat’s anti-democrat. There’s zero chance that he’s changed since Politkovskaya wrote about him. Do you have to ask whether her assassins were ever convicted?

That might not be the best formula for praising this fine novel, but let me play with it a bit.	Paul Tarrant is the Maugham figure, an aspiring artist who, in pre-WWI London, has technical talent but no feeling, no subject. Elinor Brooke is another aspiring artist with more fully developed painting gifts, and she’s doing better at the Slade School of Art under a benevolent tyrant named Tonks. Her parameters, allowing for a hundred years of social development, are Austenesque. She’s pretty, rational, cautious, and yet deeply committed to art, perhaps as a defense mechanism against the unhappiness of her unhappily married parents.	At the outset of the novel, Paul has noticed Elinor but is pursuing a questionable model named Teresa, who is fleeing a miserable sod of a husband. (This is more Maugham). Then that blows up, and the unappetizing but successful artist Neville finds himself rejected by Elinor. He’s no go for her; she really values her freedom and isn’t compelled, apparently, to engage in the nighttime activities of twenty-year-olds in a place like London where there’s no adult supervision. (Back to Austen.)	Then Barker brings Elinor and Paul slowly and skillfully together. Each finds in the other a degree of sympathy and understanding and desire that makes this a good match.	But...WWI intercedes, and Paul goes off to Belgium as a medical orderly and ambulance driver while Elinor, who doesn’t want to volunteer as a nurse, stays in London.	Barker has written about WWI on numerous occasions. Once again she does so with great skill, not overstating its horror but letting its horror be seen. Elinor visits Paul once in “the Forbidden Zone”--no wives, no girlfriends allowed--and their relationship deepens, but the inconvenient truth is that wars end when wars end. It becomes difficult, if not impossible, to sustain the relationship, and then Paul is wounded, and the novel concludes with his extremely reencounter with Elinor in London.	I won’t describe that encounter or speculate about its meaning much, but I will say that I like it very much because WWI was an overwhelming and ghastly tragedy, and its survivors suffered from it a long time after its conclusion.	One intriguing question at the heart of the novel is Elinor’s insistence on the importance of art when almost everyone else in England had abandoned such things to concentrate on the war. It’s easy to be dismissive of painters at such times, yet why fight horrendous battles only to come home and find that we lived in a society without art? Art to enlighten and inspire us, art to affirm us in our sorrow, art to open pathways into the grim suffering and heroism that must be acknowledged if we aren’t to go, quite frankly, out of our minds?	Barker does a good job of handling this delicate question. There’s something steely about Elinor in refusing to get involved in the war. Likewise, the war is what gives Paul, ultimately, the feeling and subject he needs to reinvigorate his own painting. 	Life Class shows off Barker’s psychological insight, her historical knowledge, her excellent prose, and her gift in structuring a novel so that you simply want to keep on reading. The restraint and intelligence and some of the narrowness of Austen is to be found in it. By the same token, there is some of Maugham’s sordidness, his skepticism, and his broader view of human events.	Life Class is definitely worth reading. It probes important wounds, discomforts, passions, and confusions; it also reaches beyond some of what’s worst in life for what’s best in it.

The second challenge is that it is too silly. The third challenge is that it is too true.	This is a book with deep roots in the summer of 1970 when a group of prickly friends, male and female, took stock of what the sexual revolution of the 1960s had wrought in terms of where things stood, male- and female-wise. The friends are largely, but not exclusively, English, and they are mostly twenty years old, and there are unanswered questions in the air not only about whether women had finally become the ""cocks"" of the bedroom but also about the extent to which sexual interaction defines an individual in his or her essence, erasing all that had gone into getting to twenty and settling down hard on what he or she gained or lost by handling intimacy in a more or less aggressive way.	Amis and I are contemporaries, more or less, and I do recall the microscopic looks people in their twenties cast at one another in 1970. These were not profound inspections, however. They were largely superficial questions of attraction, social status within a group, and whether such and such a relationship would work or just be a night or a weekend together. Lots of sex, but perhaps not sex that was as rigorously regulated (by the women) as is the case in The Pregnant Widow.	The key figures in the novel--Keith, Gloria, Lily, Scheherazade (yep,that's the name of the girl with the mammoth, constantly displayed and commented upon breasts)--are very verbal, analytic types. Keith, the key figure of all, is really not sure, however, what good his brooding does him when, in the end, he will have access to these and other women largely on their peculiar terms.	So we're in a castle in Italy, there's a midget count on the scene, a few tower bedrooms connected by a shared bathroom, a swimming pool, and some coming and going that follows the general trend-lines of the English novels of manners that Keith must read as he prepares himself for the life he foresees as a critic and poet. This, the heart of the book, is the most tedious part.	The better parts are the opening, wherein Keith has reached his fifties and is looking back on that pivotal year, and then a series of chapters that trace the evolution of the group post-1970, taking them all the way to 2009.	A theme that connects some of this action is Narcissus. When he looks into the water, does he fall in love with himself, or is that a female self he sees looking back at him? Of course gender roles and rights are big questions, and they merit reflection, but the trouble is that in 1970, if one was twenty, one was hardly in a position to comprehend the magnitude of what the 1960s had done to western mores. One could act, but think and hesitate and worry and fret and see oneself as central to a big cultural shift as occurs in this novel? I'm not so sure. But I am definitely sure that the endless game-playing Amis engages in vis-a-vis Scheherazade's mammaries and Gloria's buttocks is too much.	The truth of the novel crawls on its belly out of that summer in Italy into a series of interesting re-couplings, divorces, binges, disappointments, births and deaths. Here's the magic of the novel form: you spend so much time with characters that even when they irritate you, they begin to interest you, and what happens to them matters. Amis is puckish and nimble and ironic and sharp, but he still holds onto that gravity life acquires over a span of decades and makes it work.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 29, 2013","Nov 29, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1456757.The_Pregnant_Widow

Beyond thDrama City by George Pelecanos is an absorbing crime novel because it focuses more on intricacies of character than it does on crime itself. Beyond that, it shines a bright light on two protagonists who are in the struggling phase of crime-blemished life where, from the beginning, one senses they may have an opportunity for modest redemption.The lack of strut, the accurate rendering of drug-dealers’ street-wise speech, the way Pelecanos begins the novel focusing on Lorenzo Brown, an animal protection officer, and Rachel Lopez, a probation officer, and only then tumbles into a well-prepared series of violent acts all make this an unusually intimate work of crime fiction, given the hard edges of its genre.In fact, Drama City is about sixty percent literary fiction and forty percent crime fiction. It is set, as I gather is true of most of Pelecanos’s novels, in a city I know well, Washington, D.C., because I have lived here for many decades. Early on in my residency here, I sometimes got lost in the neighborhoods Pelecanos describes. They are two-story, humble, ragged, lifeless-looking places where you would only go if you were temporarily (my case) or permanently (the case of Pelecanos’s cast of characters) lost.I’m long since expert in navigating Washington and know it’s a dual city. There is what I call the federal diamond, which is the northwest sector that hosts The White House and Georgetown and Dupont Circle, and then there are the other three quadrants, northeast, southeast, and southwest. These are not, generally, happy places, with a few exceptions, though Washington has changed dramatically during the last forty years and a process of gentrification, yuppification, and corporate-exploitation can be seen almost everywhere.The real question Drama City poses is not who killed whom or who will be caught and who will get away--although the twists and turns associated with these issues are expertly presented. No, what we want to know is whether Lorenzo is going to hold onto his new fragile self as a modest animal protection officer and whether Rachel is going to emerge from her nighttime bad habits of getting drunk and preying on transients in hotel bars.They each know and associate with bad characters, and there is always the threat that their pasts will catch up with them and bury them. Pelecanos does an excellent job of presenting his obviously intense research into how dogs and cats are treated in Washington, D.C. Nothing sexy about that, but if you like dogs and cats (and I do), you pull for him as he makes his rounds. Similarly, Rachel is portrayed well as a diligent parole officer with a plausible secret self. One thing that ties them together is participation in meetings for substance abusers. Again, Pelecanos fills his canvas with real people struggling against real demons. He makes them sound real, act real, and tell real stories.In many ways this novel could be set in Baltimore, Philadelphia, or Boston. (I’ve lived in all those places, too.) The key dimension, found all over America, in fact, is jurisdictional: my turf for peddling drugs versus yours, the arrangements between overlords, the roles of underlings, and the price paid for encroachment. There’s the world of law, in other words, and the world of coke, meth, heroin, and marijuana. They are parallel, aware of one another and cautious about intersecting. You leave me alone, I leave you alone. But then there are the poor souls trapped in the middle.Back in the seventies my brother took me into a nightmarish neighborhood in Philadelphia. This was a bad place. When we arrived at the address we were seeking, multiple locks were clicked and we were pulled in fast. What a surprise to find a house chock full of the latest, newest everything money could buy, more food than we could eat, liquor than we could drink, and friendliness than we could believe. My brother and I had both attended a boarding school on scholarship, you see, and he’d heard from an African-American coworker that she had a son who was just too bright to be left in the Philadelphia public school system. So my brother nominated him for a scholarship to our alma mater, I seconded the nomination, and the young man successfully graduated.When we left that night, we were watched from the front door by about eight pairs of eyes, making sure we got into our car and out of the neighborhood in safety. Then I’m sure the locks started clicking and the party went on.Pelecanos’s novel is written in this key. There’s some hope in it amidst the struggle.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 23, 2013","Nov 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/346176.Drama_City

That figure could be a Washington operator, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, now-Senator Elizabeth Warren, writer Raymond Carver, or the desperation of a building-boom collapse that brought down Tampa, Florida and its environs.Succinctly Packer sums everything up in three lines on page 347 writing about “Prairie Populist Elizabeth Warren.” He writes:	“The Great Depression produced three regulations:	The FDIC--your bank deposits were safe.	Glass-Steagall--banks couldn’t go crazy with your money.	The SEC--stock markets would be tightly controlled.”In effect, Packer contends, the dismantling of these regulations (which is not strictly true regarding the FDIC, as far as I know) led to the downfall of our economy and, in this particular chapter, the rise of consumer advocate-politician Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts.The thematic framework for this book isn’t built to withstand heavy winds. Packer opens with a weak prologue that says we’ve always had booms and busts and we’ve just been through a terrible bust (or at least 99% of us have) and here are stories that will help us understand what happened to us. I’ll try to summarize the elements in play.We turned corporations into profit-only mechanisms; we handed political control of the country over to Wall Street; we out-sourced labor; and we watched Silicon Valley do amazing things that enable me to write this  and distribute it worldwide quite easily but aren’t really tangible, labor intensive, or financially beneficial except to wildly, wildly rich entrepreneurs and visionary engineers.If you have been following the news the last six years, lost your job or your house or your retirement savings, or seen your net worth grow a thousand-fold, you already know much of what Packer writes in highly readable, character-based narrative style. That doesn’t mean the book isn’t worth reading. There are characters here I doubt you’ve heard of--I certainly hadn’t--who are fascinating in their dreams and despair. And there are characters you may know one way or another who come off rather differently than one would expect.Going into the political area, Packer writes about a journeyman operative who attaches himself to Joe Biden for decades, raising millions for him and working on his staff. I’ve met Biden several times and seen him in candid moments. Initially I found him sententious and full of himself. Gradually I found him to be direct and sincere. Then I read Packer’s account of a cold, self-interested pol who wouldn’t give one of his key supporters a kind word or the time of day. Packard sways me, I must admit.In the Wall Street dimension, there is a tongue-in-cheek satirical chapter on Robert Rubin, one of the guys who broke through the restraining regulations of the Great Depression and brought us the Great Recession. Rubin got rich; the rest of us didn’t; but Rubin has never accepted his share of the blame, always skipped away.Down on the farm a fellow named Dean Price, working the North Carolina/Virginia borderlands, becomes convinced he can make a profitable contribution to society by promoting biofuels. He gets the last chapter of the book, and he seems to have finally succeeded after many, many setbacks.Youngstown, Ohio, is deindustrialized in chapters focused on Tammy Thomas. It’s a sobering tale. Tampa, Florida, sells itself out to developers who overbuild housing stock for speculators financed by liar’s loans from creepy “bankers”. Silicon Valley produces a character named Peter Thiel who scored big with PayPal and an investment bank and many other technology-based initiatives. He sees himself as a philosopher of the future and is quite critical of technology. What does it add? Why not focus on extending human life to 150 years and raise the bar of human expectations (what are you going to do with all that extra time, in other words)?This is fact-based journalism. Walmart is portrayed as a despicable, fascistic company that succeeds because it manages to pay its employees little and sell its goods (or China’s goods) cheap...yet still make the Walton family one of the richest in America.The skewed inequality between the richest and poorest of us has roots in the early ‘70s. The ability of bankers to financially “engineer” take-overs and mergers that cut costs and raised profits began to flourish back then. Reaganism made this Americanism. Bill Clinton couldn’t change it. George Bush loved it. Barack Obama can’t change it. These presidents represent our downward slide and minor comebacks. The U.S. middle class is stuck in the mud and has been for decades. The super-rich have become even more super-rich.In a nutshell, that’s Packer’s lively, depressing, detail-filled story. Going back in time, Edmund Wilson’s collected notebooks from the 1930s tell a similar story. Hedrick Smith’s recent book, Who Stole the American Dream?, essentially overlaps with Packer’s account.Now we are in a polarized situation where the two major political parties can’t work together (and one of the parties, the Republican, can’t work within itself) and money is God in Washington. The chapter in Packer’s book on financial reform illustrates how Wall Street owned Senator Chris Dodd (and Teddy Kennedy and Hillary Clinton) so that the reform act Obama ultimately signed was a toothless tiger, much of it written by big bank lobbyists.At the moment, we are not going up and down in noticeable increments. Slowly I think we’re creeping upward, but a better description might be that we’re going around and around, telling ourselves Packer’s stories in our own way and desperately trying to figure out how to break the vicious loop we’re in as the mega-rich look on from their fantasy-land and “average” Americans wonder, as Hedrick Smith put it, who stole the American dream?

It’s effectively written, highly controlled, Peace is a novel by Richard Bausch that captures the brutality, loneliness, and moral complexity of war. It’s effectively written, highly controlled, vivid, and disturbing. There’s really no peace at all in this novel. The setting is Italy, WWII. Three GIs are sent ahead to scout the German retreat. They’ve already witnessed their sergeant unjustifiably murder a woman traveling with a German officer they found hiding in a peasant’s cart, and they don’t like each other. Marson, the corporal, is a Catholic whose faith is shaken to the foundations. Asch is a Jew who finds himself in the company of Joyner, an anti-Semite. And now they’re climbing a drenched mountain at night, can barely see, soaked through, and find themselves subject to the predations of a sniper, who strikes as snow begins to fall on them.As an additional twist, the three GIs come across an Italian, Angelo, who seems to understand more English than he’ll admit. The question arises: Is Angelo leading the GIs into a trap? At one point, they hold still, hearing firing that can only mean an entire village is being executed not far away by the Germans. This goes on for an hour, or an eternity.War novels of this type have certain virtues and certain limitations. The virtues entail concrete details that resonate with meaning because any step you take can get you killed. They also entail riveting descriptions of pain, soldiers stretched far past their limits. Bausch expertly exploits the challenge of the mountain, the rain, the snow, the moonlight and the cover that clouds afford at critical moments in the action. He doesn’t stray from the unfolding scene much. This isn’t a book like The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien. There are few lyrical riffs even though inevitably each of the three GIs is explored thoroughly, especially Marson.The limitations of war novels like this have to do with a writer’s natural tendency to explore psychic, and in some ways romantic, breakthroughs that may or may not occur on the field of battle. I won’t reveal the ending, which in some ways is well done and yet in other ways raises doubts about Marson’s capacity for contemptuous pity.Yesterday I attended a lecture given by Rick Atkinson, one of the preeminent historians of WW II. Afterward he and I had an exchange about something that has long perplexed me. Today we are highly aware of post-traumatic shock disorder afflicting U.S. forces returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet Atkinson told me he wasn’t aware of a good study of post-traumatic shock disorder following WW II. In fact, my father was in WW II for four and a half years, and so were all the other fathers in my community. My father flew in and out of battle constantly during that time; afterward he never got on an airplane--wouldn’t and couldn’t. The other fathers in the community, like my own, didn’t talk a lot about what they’d been through. The one really painful distinction I observed was between those who had served and those who, for whatever reason, had not served. Those men who didn’t serve in WW II were lesser beings. In a peculiar way they seemed more damaged than the men who served.What I wondered, in my discussion with Atkinson, was whether the unity America felt about its commitment to WWII healed a lot of soldiers. They carried awful memories, I know, but they were honored, and they’d won a war worth winning...that had to be won. But as Atkinson commented, this hasn’t really been studied.There’s no clear answer here. Pat Barker, the British novelist, has written eloquently about post-traumatic shock disorder following WW I. In some ways the extended inhumanity of that war may have had a more terrible impact on its participants than other wars. Remember, mustard gas was used in WWI, and the war lasted for months and years as men essentially rotted in opposing trenches. For a horrible struggle, remember that our own Civil War generated more American losses than any other war in which the United States was involved. Perhaps PTSD was limited not only by the lack of a diagnosis but also by the number of combatants who did not survive to suffer a long twilight of trauma. One of our best, and most disturbing, writers on the Civil War was Walt Whitman. Essentially he functioned as a nurse, but his observations range more broadly than that. One problem that Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan have presented us is the questionable rationale for U.S. engagement. These have been vicious wars, and the veterans of these wars often don’t feel the sense of pride and community support experienced by WW II veterans. Another issue I brought up with Atkinson is whether the 360 degree threat level in Iraq and Afghanistan has intensified and broadened instances of post-traumatic shock. By this I mean that in WWII soldiers generally went head to head against counterpart armies. In Iraq and Afghanistan you could be killed anywhere at any time--taking a shower, swimming in a pool, walking across a base, driving down a road, working at your desk: anywhere. Suddenly there would be a rocket. Suddenly there would be an IED. Suddenly there would be a mortar shell or a car bomb. The space around you fractured in an instant. That’s the nature of asymmetrical warfare. Our soldiers march in armed and ready to fight, the enemy soldier doesn’t look like a soldier and doesn’t want to fight, only wants to inflict casualties at minimal cost to his side. Having been involved in the Iraq war (see my book Nights in the Pink Motel), I found the stoicism and bravery of our wounded warriors humbling.To return to Bausch’s novel, Peace, the principal character, Marson, carries out a dangerous, difficult mission. He sees death, and he must kill or be killed. He wants something from his Catholic faith to help him deal with what happens to him, but he can’t even remember prayers in English anymore, he’s heard too much praying in Italian. We must assume that he will return to the U.S., if he returns to the U.S., a permanently altered man. For the better or for the worse? That’s perhaps the key question the novel asks. Atkinson included in his lecture a provocative thought: We call ourselves Homo Sapiens (the man who thinks). Perhaps we ought to call ourselves Homo Furens (the man who fights). There have been precious few years in recent centuries when there wasn’t a war going on somewhere. In fact, we’ve been been seeing war-like conflict in the double-digits for decades. We fight and fight, and it’s brutal, essentially an experience no individual can pass through without suffering scars that don’t go away.

Joyce through sheer economy and prose music comes out ahead, but this doesn’t discredit Trevor much. Both writers focus on the private moments of private people, looking for some miracle of happiness or sadness in life, something special, some kind of revelation or resignation, and both create a kind of silence around their characters, such that when they speak, the reader really hears the fullness of what they say, or think.	Many of Trevor’s stories in this collection, if not all, are downhill tales, by which I mean we see a recent widow revealing her loathing of her former husband, a poor couple unable to get a desperately needed loan, a cad exploiting lonely women, and the decline both of a great Irish house and a small affair.	The essence of good short stories--their focus on details and intimate characterization--underpins all of the stories here. The title story, “A Bit on the Side,” is a case in point. Here it’s that miserable phrase describing a married man’s secret lover--his bit on the side--around which the whole affair collapses. It makes our protagonist worry that he’s dishonoring a woman he really loves; he can see that judgment in the eyes of others who think they know what he’s up to; and he can’t bear demeaning her.	Mentioning Joyce raises the bar high. No one else need clear it, unless Chekhov did. Getting close is enough. Among younger writers, Colm Tóibín, another Irish writer, captures some of the desperation that goes into being Irish. For the sensitive, observant writer, this can be an advantage. Poverty strips things to the bone; attempts to get settled in America as an immigrant sharpen the senses and instantly create sympathy; the flourishes of life are seen as empty, all flash, no substance; and characters have no choice but to interact directly, if subtly--there’s no beating about the bush when you’re in trouble.	One story, “Solitude,” is an understated tale whose contours are worthy of Henry James. The central incident is tawdry, but the protagonist’s reaction reaches deep into that haunting category, the imaginary friend. When she’s a child she has two of them; when she is an aging lady, she only has one, a different one, but this is her solitude, her portion of life despite the fact that she is rich in financial terms.	So if you like quiet short stories, A Bit on the Side will please you a great deal.

That’s the gist of this tale, which does not descend into real darkness until the very last pages, when the young writer, looking back on things twenty years later, pieces together the realities in much the same fashion that a master detective unravels a mystery while everyone stands around waiting for him to finally point to the real demon, or demons, responsible for the crime.	The result, for me, is a book that makes writing yourself into a corner its theme, ending with a too pat denouement. I regret that because the first nine tenths of the novel are fun to read. Even as imaginary dead ends show up, fragments of stories are left hanging, the book still has élan, vividness, and elegance, giving one confidence that Auster will have something good up his sleeve when he finally interweaves all the tales within the tales he’s spun. But as fewer and fewer pages are left to read, one begins to realize that he won’t have time to do that; he’ll have to take a shortcut, sharply altering the tone of the book and making the normal difficulties of life (of which there are many) absolutely tragic.	This is ineffective trickery, high-handedness, and an option to go noir instead of ironic because irony is a more delicate operation. I just didn’t buy the systematic exposition of why so and so did such and such, and the abandonment of three or four story lines (admittedly or apparently fictionalized by our narrator Sid) left me dissatisfied. There are lots--lots!--of figures and characters and incidents whose intrusion into this text ultimately are not justified, and that’s a pity because many of them offer a lot of promise when they’re introduced. Not even a concerted effort to analogize the fictional with the factual (although of course the whole novel is fictional) is likely to render some kind of thematic, if not narrative, consistency.	For some reason this book’s genially hurtling style reminded me of Poe, specifically The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, although I should have taken that as a warning. The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym also has a bewildering ending, short on clarity, but at least Poe makes no attempt to spell things out, much less depict a brief moment of happiness after a cascade of horrors.

In numerous stories a questionable protagonist is trapped in some kind of commercial re-creation of another time and place, or is faced with an organized opposition determined to pursue cynical and irrelevant enterprises for their morbid gratification.	The protagonist may weigh 400 pounds or be scared to death of his superior or defective in some other way--very, very old, for example. His or her chances are slim. Saunders takes the worst of American schlock, historical or otherwise, and scavenges it for laughs.	The strategy or obsession is to demean the good guys but demean the bad guys even more. Ultimately the good guys attain some measure of vindication or self-respect or simple escape, but prospects for more than that are slim.	There’s a silliness and perversity in Saunders’ propositions, a cleverness of phrasing and a bit of sentimentality. Again, the strategy: once upon a time, things must have been better, but that’s a long, long time gone, and now look at this mess.	I didn’t find myself deeply engaged in most of the stories. The novella, Bounty, is in many ways a rehash of what’s come before, but it has more depth and, for lack of a better word, feeling. In Bounty there are Flawed people (people with birth defects) and people who are not Flawed. Flawed people are exploited everywhere and can be sold into slavery if they wander too far west. Our Flawed hero has claws on his feet instead of toes. He is sold, rescued, escapes from rescue, and beats a tortured path to the place where his Flawed sister is being held--by a man who is not Flawed. The world of this novel is not much different than the world of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, a much more sinister, not at all comic novel. This is a dystopic world. The question is whether our hero is going to stay with his sister and have a soft job under the care of the man who has fallen for her or head back out in search of rebellious Flawed folk who demand justice and respect. I won’t reveal his decision.	Some of the blurb language associates Saunders with Nathaniel West and Kurt Vonnegut. West, I think, was a more economical, understated, and effective satirist. He wrote in a dry way, never overplaying his hand. Vonnegut is the better comparison. His work, it seems to me, is tighter and angrier, but Saunders does have a quicker trigger-finger when it comes to the surprising phrase or image.	Here’s a funny final thought: perhaps some short story writers should not issue collections of their work. Saunders, for example, might have more impact if a reader took on one of his stories every six months or so in a magazine.

Ou	All the Little Live Things by Wallace Stegner is a mid-career novel written in the middle of the 1960s, with all that era entailed as its subject. Our narrator, Joe, has moved to California with his wife, Ruth, and hopes to enjoy a restful retirement. He’s a naturalist, not by vocation but by avocation. He likes to walk, and he possesses (courtesy of Stegner) an astounding fount of botanical knowledge. The countryside he and Ruth have chosen accommodate his interests, but two things occur to disrupt his peace of mind (which is fragile for a reason I’ll get to in a moment.) First an aspiring drop-out hippie guru manages to set up an encampment on some of Joe’s land--with Joe’s grudging permission. Second a young family rents a nearby house. And it’s a troubled family. The wife, Marian, is bursting with life and cancer at the same time. The husband, John, is trying to pursue a successful career as a kind of marine biologist-and therefore away in the field quite a bit-and he and Marian have a young daughter, Debby, as well as prospects of another child if Marian lives long enough to give birth.	The backstory on Joe’s discontent, shared implicitly by Ruth, is that their son Curtis was a drop-out under-performer himself, and he died in a surfing accident in his thirties, having accomplished next to nothing in his life.	So Joe is bitter when confronted by people who think they can get by without working hard at living (Peck) and also when confronted by people with lots of faith in life (Marian). He is the dominant figure in this novel because he narrates it, apparently falls in love with Marian (without really admitting it to her or to himself), and clearly hates the sight of Peck.	The novel moves slowly and has a querulous tone. It embraces Joe’s complaint and reflects the kinds of conflicts that did occur in the 1960s. Some of the key passages involving Joe and Marian are forced oppositional conversations where both sides know better; her appeal to him is fuzzy for me, at least; and he is pretty harsh and boorish in judging the care her husband John is giving her. Peck is portrayed from the start as a mischief-making Bacchus figure, a disturber of the natural peace, a freeloader, a parasite. Joe says he can’t through Peck off his property because it would hurt Marian and disappoint Ruth, but of course he’s still working out some kind of conflict with his dead son through Peck.	Did self-appointed gurus flit around in the 1960s? Sure, and still do. This one is a particularly irritating one, however, and his activities have a pernicious effect on the surrounding, spread-out countryside.	All the Little Live Things seemed forced to me. Labored. I found the first half hard going. It then moved from stagey speechifying to unfurling events and picked up steam. The penultimate chapter is a tour de force, complex, incredible but credible...and very painful. And then the epilogue comes through well, I’d say, because Joe does sell out his skepticism and cynicism and wariness. He’s a moralist who wants to see human effort invested in fulfilling the world’s promise. He doesn’t trust nature to succeed on its own; bad things will happen if good people don’t succeed in accomplishing good things...both with the land and with each other.	As usual, Stegner’s prose is firm and vivid. He describes physical settings with complete mastery. And he’s quite good at exploring complex moments in human exchanges, contextualizing a smile, a laugh, an expression of regret or joy.	Soon after All the Little Live Things Stegner would write his masterpiece, Angle of Repose. This novel isn’t as good as that one.

Doctorow's new collection of short stories, All the Time in the World, starts out well with a very interesting preface comparing novel writing and short story writing, then wobbles, then gains strength, a lot of it.	Basically Doctorow sees novels as evolutionary and stories as situational. In stories he sees characters in conflict with the world somehow...and there is a continuous path to resolution...or not. Novels? Well, this isn't one of his novels, so let's pass on that.	The first story three or four stories are propositions. Here's a proposition: A man who doesn't have a good relationship with his wife comes home one night and decides that instead of going in the front door he'll hide in the garage attic. He stays there for months, become feral at night, feeding out of garbage cans, deteriorates, monitors his wife and daughters without revealing himself, and only reappears, as himself again, when his wife has one of her old boyfriends to dinner. In short: silly. He may hate his wife, but does he hate his daughters? Why does he do this? How interesting is the underside of the suburbs? Etc., etc.	In the second story a man parks an ancient Ford Falcon outside a house in which he once lived and spooks the current owners. Again, just something odd that Doctorow plays with. 	We move on through an arranged bride episode to a stay in a cult camp where the cult leader takes off with the narrator's wife...and everyone's money.	So...blah. BUT deep in the book, with a story called Jolene: A life, about an abused girl, Doctorow really hits his stride. This is a moving tale that ends with the very suggestive proposition that her life might make a good graphic novel. In fact, it would.	Then there are acerbic, provocative ""experimental"" stories like ""The Writer in the Family,"" ""The Hunter,"" and the title story, ""All the Time in the World,"" that get at the watery quality of life,how it slips through your fingers, is never specific and trustworthy because the present is a passing fiction. These are robust bursts of Doctorow letting loose. I won't press this point but they seem to refer in some measure to the philosopher Wittgenstein--reality is that which is.It's easy to bungle that kind of writing in fictional form, but Doctorow is a formidable writer. He can be Whitmanesque, he can be city smart, he can write in tighter and tighter loops like a first-class ice skater spinning at speeds beyond belief.	I haven't read his novel Billy Bathgate, but there is one story in the collection called ""LINER NOTES:The Songs of Billy Bathgate"" that foreshadows the interesting adventures in thought and language that mark the last third of the book. It's not much of a story, but sometimes strong writing is enough.	These stories, Doctorow notes, were written over a number of years. Some have been included in a previous collection. I do not think that as a book, All the Time in the World, is successful except, perhaps, as a way of marketing and remarketing his work. That said, a handful of stories here are special....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 28, 2013","Oct 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8808148-all-the-time-in-the-world

For him the political challenge usually involves an initial ten to fifty disaffected activists who are skilled in reaching out to a generally disaffected populace. Polk estimates that a successful insurgency ultimately is 80% political, adopting Mao’s dictum that insurgency (or revolution) is a mixture of fish (insurgents) in need of a sea (the public) in which to swim. Once the fish begin swimming, they must communicate their discontent--again, a political task--in such a way that their message is securely conveyed and that they are housed, fed, equipped, and hidden during their initial phase of weakness. This blends into the administrative task, which entails killing off the current government and providing substitute services, from health clinics to schools to sanitation. Administration is 15% of the successful insurgent’s job. Then comes the remaining 5%, fighting. Here Polk observes--remember, he’s an historian, and a good one--the successful insurgent should hit and run, not confront a sitting regime or puppet regime or invading foreign force for as long as it takes to demoralize it politically. Head-on battles between insurgents and well-equipped, highly trained armies are not good for the insurgents’ health. What the insurgent must do is keep pushing, pushing, pushing...counting on the populace to feed it intelligence as well as food...steal the enemy’s arms...lure the enemy into a fatal show of force and then pounce...all the while hoping for an indication that somehow the insurgency will be able to obtain broad political recognition, inside and outside the country.There are very few individuals as knowledgeable as Polk on this subject; that’s why he can be so detailed and yet so concise. This is a fascinating book for Americans who have recently been through the Iraq War, are winding down their failed efforts in Afghanistan, and contemplating future counterinsurgencies in Africa ...not to mention the raging civil war in Syria.The bottom line is that insurgencies can be snuffed out by strong governments within their own borders, but they seldom can be stopped by foreign powers. The United States, Great Britain, France, and Russia, all great powers, have failed many times in trying to put down foreign insurgencies either directly or through puppet governments. The core reason for this is that in the final analysis the politics of a given country are determined by the people of that country. If a military machine only has 5% of the overall conflict to work with, no military machine can really succeed--not when deployed from abroad.I’ve spent a lot of time working on the insurgency/counterinsurgency issue--once in a way that was very up close and personal (see my book Nights in the Pink Motel about Iraq)--and have nothing but admiration for Polk’s swift survey of how the world really works. In his final chapter, he properly debunks the verbiage contained in the U.S. Army’s new manual on counterinsurgency. There is no way a military machine, even one as gigantic as the United States’ defense establishment, can prevail in an internal conflict abroad. Diplomacy, backed by military power, can be helpful, but ultimately the neoconservative fantasy of the U.S. fighting a “long war” (forty years?) to put the world right is just that--a fantasy.Violent Politics is the kind of book you can trust, read quickly, and measure based on your own knowledge, whether you are twenty-three or seventy-three. There’s essentially nothing in here that’s off-base. A good bit of it has happened in your lifetime, and it will keep happening, unfortunately. Often a great power’s best option is not to make things better, but try to ensure we don’t make them worse.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 24, 2013","Oct 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1949722.Violent_Politics

I just read those famous final words, “I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate,” and it seemed to me that I did, in fact, understand the burden Camus places on Meursault’s shoulders better than the last time.	This short, famous novel is novel about the inadequacy of fiction itself; it is a novel in which Meursault, convicted of almost absently-mindedly killing an Arab on the beach, must deny the significance of anything that could have happened otherwise, or might happen otherwise, in his life (perhaps his appeal will succeed, perhaps he will be pardoned) or any other life.	In Part I of the novel, Meursault is an opaque figure. We are told by the translator, Matthew Ward, that Camus wanted to report the story the way Hemingway would report it. He did this...He did that...The bird looked at him from the windowsill...The teapot began to boil...Salamano’s dog barked... That sort of writing--flat, self-limiting, factual and indisputable as to the events and characters it memorializes. Hemingway did write this way, of course, and so did Raymond Carver. There is an ethos of objectivity here, and a certain sensation of all other possible scenarios being crushed and kicked away, inapplicable to character A. The reader doesn’t go inside character A’s mind or receive commentaries on the emotional probing character A must be engaging in as he wonders why he can’t stop drinking or his woman has left him.	In Part II of the novel, Meursault goes through his trial, hears extraneous elements of character assassination leveled at him, notes that everyone in the room has come to hate him, and is taken off to a cell to wait for that appeal to proceed...or the pardon to be granted...or the guillotine to fall. A priest pushes his way into his cell and tries to persuade Meursault there is a God. Meursault isn’t having it. The reader is inside Meursault’s reasoning now as he flails about searching for the intricate, inexplicable outcome of each and every human life, which can only be one thing, of course: death. So what is the difference? Everything that seems like an alternative really isn’t, not fundamentally. There is no real value in fictionalizing--imagining--things as though they were different because they are not, and if they do become different, they always would have become different, not because of your thoughts, but because eternal circumstances, impossible to decipher, took an unexpected turn. But whatever the case, embrace that which is, don’t think past it, extract from it the fullness of its ultimate finality, celebrate the fact that at least in your case (meaning Meursault’s), you’ll be greeted with cries of hate.	When I read The Stranger long ago, I read Stuart Gilbert’s translation. Stuart Gilbert was a Brit, incapable of not insinuating elements of familiarity into Camus’s prose, cushioning it a little bit, filing down the sharp edges of its strangeness. The Matthew Ward translation I’ve just read is much, much better. It captures the anti-social, indifferent alienation of a man like Meursault--and his odd lot of comrades. It also does a fine job of underlining how bizarre it is when an ornate, imperious, hoary institution like a court of justice suddenly appears in one’s life, referring to laws, rules, and protocols that don’t come up very often.	Meursault, from the start, claims to be indifferent. Marry or not marry? Doesn’t matter. Take a job in Paris or stay in Algiers? Doesn’t matter. But there is one difference, or distinction, of which neither Meursault nor Camus make much, that does seem to ingrain itself into the text. There are characters in it who are Arabs. Arabs are not French-origin; they are “other,” and when conflict boils over between these two types of humanity, the French answer is to shoot the Arab, not once but many times. Doesn’t matter, does it? The Arab would die at some point anyway, wouldn’t he? Why not now? Thus, in Part II, more is made of Meursault’s questionable attentions to his French-Algerian mother, recently deceased, than to the dead Arab, and it is difficult to discern--Meursault can’t--whether Meursault is to have his head removed because he offended French proprieties or killed an Arab.	I don’t think Camus was unaware of this unpleasant irony, but I also don’t think he saw it as a central feature of his meditation. More important to him was telling a story in which he demonstrated the limits of story-telling. Accept what is; face it; abandon metaphysics, rationalization, God, and justice: that is the story, and the only story: what is. Executions, Meursault writes, tell you this; they all should be witnessed, every one of them...but for him, this realization comes too late; he’s the one to be executed, and he just hopes everyone who sees it happen gets as much out of it as possible, for it would be a pity not to howl with hate at the epitome of what truly is: one man dies, all men die, end of story.	Coming back to myself and what I thought long ago and what I think now, I suppose I’d say this: I enjoyed reading this fable-like novel a great deal; it has a deceptively sharp edge to it, and it’s definitely worth rereading. Camus did not exclude acts of conscience and moral resistance in all of his fiction--see The Plague--but here he depicts the dry reality of inexplicable fate with masterful economy and impact. But that’s only because he was fundamentally wrong as he wrestled with what came to be known as existentialism. Stories are at least half, perhaps much more, of what human experience is all about.

At timeElie Wiesel’s novel, The Sonderberg Case, moves in fits and starts between fiction and rumination rooted in Jewish theology and story-telling. At times it seems to be genuinely post-modern in its self-reflexive irony and stubborn air of mystery. The narrator is Yedidyah who writes alternately in the first and third person with no apparent justification for the switch. He’s a theater critic--because his prospects as an actor were dim-- when suddenly he’s asked to fill in for his newspaper’s court reporter. Thus he comes to the Sonderberg case in which a young man apparently has abruptly left the scene of an older man’s death in the woods...but there is no evidence as to whether the young man killed the old man by pushing him off a cliff...and when asked his plea, he answers that he is both innocent and guilty, causing the judge to record “innocent” on his behalf. Not incidentally, the two men in the woods, old and young, are German.A puzzler? Sort of, and sort of a mishmash. The themes Wiesel appears to juggle have to do with individual versus collective guilt, the mystery of God’s purpose, and the necessity of personal memory, which, in the case of European Jews, was denied by virtue of what, in this book, is called the Tragedy, more commonly referred to as the Holocaust.At different points in this jumpy story Yedidyah is in New York, Jerusalem, and in Eastern Europe seeking the Christian woman who saved him from the death camps that consumed the rest of his family. The real conflict, however, seems to be between carrying the story through, on its own terms, and making it fuzzy with opaque rabbinical sayings and fables. Yedidayah is troubled, this we know. The young German turns out to be innocent, as we suspect. The essence of life, we learn, is living it deeply moment by moment, which means that happiness is a species of travail, because the more successful you are in life, the deeper you probe its incontestable mysteries, what ifs, and serendipities, sometimes pleasing, sometimes tragic.The fun of the book lies in its lively voice, no matter whether in the first or third person, and its sudden hopeful leaps, albeit ultimately deeper into disappointment. The book’s deficiency is something I allude to above: anecdotes seldom are fully developed, characters seldom are fully developed, even the Sonderberg case itself is a sketch pad on which its details are overwhelmed by historical events and allusions that overshadow the text itself.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7715654-the-sonderberg-case

These scenes are graphic but not overdrawn, despite the mayhem. The novel then adopts an elegiac tone--smooth, precise, unhurried--as it traces Bowman’s life as he rises to become a significant editor in a high-brow New York publishing house. His marriage, to a vapid but pretty girl from the Virginia horse country (not far from where I’m writing this ), comes to an ending that is soft, not wounding. The girl, Vivian, simply realizes that she and Philip don’t have much in common, aren’t right for one another, and Philip tends to agree. He then proceeds, through the course of the book, to mark the stages of his life by gradually ascending the editorial ladder and becoming involved in passionate affairs with women who are just a little bit out of his reach; these women are married, or they are double-crossers, or they are stand-ins for whatever really burns in his heart.	Something does seem to burn in Bowman’s heart because he (aided by Salter’s solid prose) takes things seriously: the olive trees of Andalusia, the George Washington Bridge lit up at night, the rather endless descriptions of his lovemaking (which on occasion strays dangerously close to Hemingway in its self-satisfied romanticism and mastery).	But this is a funny kind of novel that really doesn’t deserve the over-the-top praise it receives on the dust jacket-- Tim O’Brien referring to “the highest artistry” and John Irving suggesting Salter’s “euphoria of prose” would have satisfied Shakespeare.	In fact, the novel wanders, inserts stray anecdotes that don’t seem to fit the narrative flow, blows up Bowman’s love life without much justification, and seems affectionately out-of-date, a loving anachronism, when it dwells on the 50s through the 90s in New York publishing--the point being, true enough, that publishing is in turmoil now, there are very few grand masters running publishing houses or editors who make literary decisions against the grain of market prospects.	Given that an entire life is being examined here, one has to step back a moment and contemplate the narcissism on display. During the opening war scenes, yes, Bowman was involved in an undertaking that exceeded himself on behalf of others, but once these scenes have flashed past, the story becomes a portrait gallery of a man and his pals who display their most important energies in bed. Bowman gets books published, God bless him, but he raises no children, undertakes no great project, overcomes no devastating setback (except at the hands of a duplicitous woman against whom he retaliates by bedding and abandoning her daughter), and is all tied up in his knowledge of the good life. By this I mean knowing the restaurants and cafes and hotels of Paris, London, Spain, and New York City and a fair stretch of the beautiful landscape up the Hudson River from New York. These are the places where people of sensibility and appeal drink together, judge one another, seduce one another, and have their lyrical moments of revelation watching the snow fall or the sun rise or the sea go quiet from waves to gentle swells.	Some months ago I went to a memorial service for a man like Bowman. He was a bon vivant. He had pals. He could get you tickets anywhere at any time. I didn’t know the guy that well, and I only went to the service because I had no idea how important folks in Washington took him to be--I didn’t feel his family deserved a poor turn-out, in other words. Was I ever mistaken. A very large hall was cram packed. This guy had been fun, fun, fun. He’d gotten away with everything, what a splendid bad boy with a by-line he’d been. His admirers really loved him and spoke wonderfully about him.	I published a piece afterward called “Playing the Fool” in which I tried to capture the essence of a person who is a brilliant entertainer, someone smart enough to taunt King Lear if necessary. I think that’s about who this fellow was, and I don’t really mean it as any kind of insult. Fools aren’t dummies; and since most of us aren’t kings, we often dote on them, repeat their witticisms and bits of wisdom, and cry real tears when they leave us.	My sense is that James Salter is a serious man and accomplished writer who, at the end of his life, has now written a book saying goodbye to the best of times. This is his Moveable Feast, if you will, and my sense also is that a band of literary friends are prepared to defend him to the death. He’s no fool; he’s more of a duke, a senior counselor, in the literary courts of the last four decades, and his pals wouldn’t think of sending him off without a rousing “Hurrah!”	Okay, but writing about writing focuses on the writing, not the man, or it should. This particular novel isn’t as good as the publicists and loyalists have made it seem to be. It’s pleasurable to read, but that narcissism gnaws at me, likewise the general notion that the literary life is, at its best, a kind of fascinating glide path, a trip through the clouds, with very few storms.

By this I don’t refer to the early skirmishes, I rThe Foreign Correspondent by Alan Furst is a novel about the little wars that precede the big ones. By this I don’t refer to the early skirmishes, I refer to wars of information, propaganda, subversive and unifying communication. As often is the case with Furst, the setting is pre-World War II Europe. Paris and Berlin play central roles, but the focus is on Carlo Weisz, an “Italian” from Trieste who is a multi-lingual Reuters correspondent who also helps edit a small anti-Mussolini newspaper in Paris and has, as fate would dictate, a lover trapped in Berlin. The overarching political idea is to keep Mussolini from signing a pact with Hitler. We know that in fact this happened, so once it occurs in the novel, the action shifts to British “helping hands,” aiding Weisz with both his undertakings--reviving his small newspaper and helping Christa escape the Nazis now in full control of Berlin and aware that she is working against them.Once again Furst proves a master of pre-WWII European politics. He creates a main character, Carlo, who doesn’t quite feel like an Italian (he spent two years at Oxford, perhaps that’s why, and it’s also true that Trieste is a liminal city), and realizes disproportionate attention is being paid to what he is up to. He’s being followed, spied upon, crossed-up, and suborned, but all this occurs in such a natural, deft way he doesn’t come across as someone larger than he is. He’s just a man caught in the crossfire, someone able to mar the perfect image Hitler and the Italian fascists want to project, a symbol, if you will, that they do not have complete control of their populations, are not 100% backed by Hitler and Mussolini’s grandiose visions.Furst’s narrative scheme is smoothly handled by presenting certain sections identified by dates and other, larger portions of the book, captured under provocative subtitles. He’s a good writer, gifted at sketching out the way a woman is dressed, the way the clouds move across the Paris sky, and how one realizes that one is in a situation justifying a sense of fear and wariness. In general he is understated, and this is good, given his subject. I wasn’t involved in pre-World War II Europe, but I was active as a diplomat in Cold War Europe, and I spent a lot of time with foreign correspondents, some from the U.S., some from other countries. Most of the things that happen in such circles do so without a bang. More important is the day to day debate, the new point, the fresh fact, the marathon-scale demonstration of political tenacity and will. Never giving up has a lot to do with who ultimately wins wars, large or small, just as constant engagement frequently breeds a familiarity between adversaries that isn’t contemptuous at all. The best political debates I had, scores of them, occurred in Spain in the 1980s. Spain also figures in Furst’s novel--what a difference between his Spain, with Franco ascendant, and the Spain I experienced, led by the Spanish Socialist party in the wake of Franco’s death. In this case, it’s clear the good guys won, though it took them forty years.Ultimately, Furst’s tendency to focus on a little guy in a big context is a great strategy. Carlo Weisz is very much a human being as well as a political actor. He has only so much to give, though he can be pushed and is smart about pushing back. I have yet to read a book by Furst that isn’t good and that doesn’t bear the mark of deep familiarity with European history, culture and geography. He’s worth reading.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 12, 2013","Oct 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/253555.The_Foreign_Correspondent

Phillips demonstrates in documented detail that t1775: A Good Year for Revolution by Kevin Phillips is an ambitious book that fulfills its ambitions. Phillips demonstrates in documented detail that the critical mass of the American Revolution came together in 1775, not 1776. Indeed, he traces the development of revolutionary sentiment and action well back into the 1760s and spends a good bit of time on 1774.Like many histories, this book isn’t for everyone because it is so full of detail and information, designed to bolster its argument, that is difficult for the non-specialist to keep track of who did what and when.Phillips’s point in one sense can be summarized as follows: we date our birth as a nation on July 4, 1776; indeed the birth had been going on for some time; there is little in the Declaration of Independence that had not been said repeatedly in previous years; King George III already had declared the colonies in rebellion; a great deal of fighting already had taken place...and most importantly....most importantly...the colonies had begun long since a process of coming together by means of committees of correspondence and conventions so that a political compact among them, and in defiance of the King, was inevitable.What is described here wavers between civil war, insurrection, rebellion and outright war. Most importantly there was a meeting of the minds in the colonies and a muddle in London. Many more colonists were loyal to the King than commonly thought, and many more rebels were amenable to a new arrangement of affiliation with England than one might suspect. Phillips documents this. But there was preponderance of mistrust and resentment in the colonies that the King kept inflaming. Each time the colonies did something offensive, the King did something more offensive. The English attitude was that the colonies were there to support England economically and geopolitically; the English intruded upon and controlled almost all of the colonies’ commercial arrangements; they gave no weight to the colonies’ political sentiments. The colonies, viewed from London, were independent of one another; London did not see that they were coming into a form of union that would ultimately bring independence.The importance of this book today is threefold: 1) we really ought to know our own history; we ought to know the key roles of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia and South Carolina; we ought to understand the ambivalence of New York and Pennsylvania; we ought to understand the religious divisions within the populace, and so forth; 2) we ought to recognize the difficulty of conducting small-bore wars thousands of miles from home where we don’t know the shoals, be they cultural or maritime, much less the ethnic and sectarian divisions that can aid or defeat us, and 3) England had alienated most of the European continent in the previous twenty years; it had no allies or sympathizers; this set the stage for France and Spain and Holland to provide the rebels with indispensable assistance, the lesson being that if your more general foreign relations are roiled, you’ll suffer through indifference, the provision of arms and money, and assistance through diversionary disruptions.There are some little known heroes in this book. Connecticut governor Jonathan Trumbull comes to mind. There are some well-documented boobs. Virginia governor John Murray Dunmore comes to mind. There are generals who didn’t know how to fight, and of course, there are fighters like Benedict Arnold who was an exceptional fighter, but also a traitor. The descriptions and quotes relating to George Washington are impressive without exception. He spent much of the prelude to 1776 tied up in Massachusetts, far from Mt. Vernon, but he seems seldom to have made a miscalculation. The English, by contrast, made a terrible miscalculation by concentrating on Boston in the pre-1776 years. If you stand almost anywhere on the rim that surrounds Boston today, you will see it is a kind of bowl. It is not a good idea to fight from the bottom of a bowl. The English ultimately gave up on this idea and then spread their forces north and south and ended up being defeated in the middle, in Yorktown.At the time--1774 to 1775--no one could be sure of anything, just as no one can be sure today of what will happen in Syria or Tunisia. One might have thought, erroneously, that Canada would be brought into association with the colonies. This proved not to be the case, and in hindsight we can see it could never have been the case. Phillips’ triumph in 1775 is looking back through the fog of war and picking out the key facts and major muscle movements that made it, more than 1776, the critical year of Revolution for the colonies.Since this is a dense, data-rich, closely argued book, I think its audience will be limited. Readers fascinated by the American Revolution will find it fascinating. Others won’t. The question is whether it ultimately will broaden our understanding of the complex commercial, legal, military, cultural, geographic and other factors that led to what we think of as a war of political principle more than anything else; political principle, codified in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, played its role, but its enactment was much, much less clear cut than we tend to think. The fact is, we don’t even get the year right. By 1775 we were shedding blood to become independent, lots of it. 1776 was an important year, too, but it wasn’t the year when the birthing pains were beginning to yield a new nation.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle.)...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2013","Oct 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13588422-1775

Forster reads like two different books. In part I, our heroine, Lucy Honeychurch and her family and friends	A Room with a View (lovely title) by E.M. Forster reads like two different books. In part I, our heroine, Lucy Honeychurch and her family and friends are cautious travelers in Italy observing all the niceties that protect a young woman’s reputation while giving her a taste of the world. Two major interruptions occur--she witnesses a stabbing and she is abruptly kissed by a fellow lodger, George Emerson, who had a hand in getting her away from the scene of the crime. Otherwise Lucy evidences little intelligence, little maturity and no particular reason to be taken seriously. She’s a bit of genteel fluff and her guardians are really hangers-on and, one guesses, subject to furtive impulses of lesbianism. George, likewise, isn’t filled out. He’s a flat character, somewhat impulsive, who gives no account of himself and shuffles around with his aging and not healthy father. There’s Florence to admire, of course, and eventually Rome, but these are not English folk one would want to know.	In Part II there’s more of the same as Lucy gradually becomes betrothed to an empty cynic named Cecil who has money and presumes that a flower such as she belongs in his garden. As luck would have it, though, the Emersons, father and son, rent a house in Windy Corner, where Lucy lives and is being wooed and won by Cecil. They’re a great match, just the right status and money. But...George takes advantage of Lucy on a walk in the woods to give her another kiss. This doesn’t appear to have been a searching kind of kiss, it’s more of a surprise kiss, and Lucy doesn’t realize that it means a) she must break off with Cecil and b) take up with George for quite some time. 	She does achieve this realization, however, and like Henry James’s Isabel Archer, who draws the opposite conclusion about what she must do with her life, she grows up right before our eyes. These scenes are wonderful for the force and concision of how she dismantles Cecil, scolds George, and thinks she has had done with them both. Even Cecil, granting her criticism of him, recognizes his shallowness and does it well. But...the elder Emerson is yet to be heard from, and when he gets a chance, he puts the question of love to Lucy in bold, romantic, imperative terms: she must admit running from George is a mistake, they were meant for one another...and indeed, this is what occurs: George and Lucy make an engaging pair back in Florence on their honeymoon.	You can tell from what I said so far that I thought about chucking this novel several times during its much ado about nothing phase of Part I. No character was interesting. Florence wasn’t even interesting. I wondered how E.M. Forster could have engaged himself in a pale imitation of Jane Austen. But then Part II began to change things, and once again, when Lucy lets go, it’s wonderful.	My criticism would be that the foreshadowing of a self-confident, articulate Lucy is almost nonexistent, and the same is true of the vague, kiss-prone George. When they finally arrive, two thirds of the way through the book, they’re palpable, admirable, honest, direct and believable, but the book would have more impact, it seems to me, if there were something more consistently subversive and uncomfortable about Lucy in Part I and if there were anything at all about George in Part I except a certain sensitivity and clumsy boldness.	Set against A Portrait of a Lady by Henry James or most of Thomas Hardy, A Room with a View trails behind until the final sprint. Then it almost catches up.For more of my comments on contemporary and classic writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 02, 2013","Oct 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3087.A_Room_with_a_View

She is what used to be called a liberal, not a bad word in my book, and she attacks the growing wealth divide in the U.S. with ferocity, humor, cutting wit, solid facts, and chilling anecdotes.The style of this volume is one short, snappy chapter after another. I don't know this, but I guess these chapters began as blog comments and then were built out. She takes on the financial crash, greedy CEOs, the plight of the young and old trying to find work, the way corporations like Walmart (she really skewers Walmart; don't shop there!) exploit their workers, and so forth. Can you imagine Walmart tell its aging ""greeters"" that they can't have stools anymore? Welcome to the world of cost-cutting at all costs. She also takes a good look at feminism, abortion, gay marriage, and the way in which the Republican party and evangelicals have woven their snake-like way together to produce a truly venomous anti-Christian Christianity. The war in Iraq? As bad as Walmart!She doesn't say it exactly the way I like to say it, but she makes this point: There is class warfare going on in America but it's not being waged by the poor against the rich, it's being waged by the rich against the poor...and it's all but over. The poor are hardly worth bothering about. The rich are now out to squeeze the Chinese, Indians and Vietnamese. Our middle class got a flat tire in the seventies and we've been running on the rim ever since. She even points out that the wealth gap between CEOs and their number #3 executives has spread. Pity the #3s. A fellow told me last week about one of his neighbors who had a mid-to-high level job at Blue Shield/Blue Cross in North Carolina and earned $350,000 a year. He said to her, ""What do you do?"" She told him. He said, ""Hell, I could do that."" She said, ""You probably could."" So Ehrenreich suggests we reform the health care system by outsourcing it to the Third World. This would mean those overpaid executives would be out of work, and our fine doctors and nurses would have to practice in Mexico and Thailand, but we'd save a bundle.I don't want to try to out-Ehrenreich Ehrenreich, but I'd like to close this note with a confession. I already knew most of what she wrote. I think that's true of a lot of thinking Americans. What's puzzling is that we understand exactly the four or five major tragedies that led to our current difficulties, and yet it's so hard to make that the dominant theme of the day. At the moment the Republicans in the House of Representatives may help us change that by shutting down the government in their effort to defund Obamacare. I don't want to see the government shut down, but if it brings the temple of greed crashing upon the right wingers' heads, let it fall.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2013","Sep 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2880662-this-land-is-their-land

This is one of the many statements in Things Fall Apart that unfortunately is too true. There's a piercing quality to this novel. More than fifty years after it was written, it retains a power and piquancy that penetrates in all directions.In sum, this is the story of a rising Igbo, Okongwo, who ultimately falls afoul of his own people's traditions and the disruptive force of Christianizing British colonialism. The richness--and brutality--of his people's beliefs proves inadequate to fend off the guns and Bibles sent to Southeastern Nigeria by London. When Okongwo lashes out, he realizes he's been abandoned by the men who were his closest friends and neighbors...and so he commits suicide, a great disgrace, but he has no choice. The story that he has told himself all his life--a story predicated on an abundance of gods, goddesses and spirits--is true; anyone reading this novel would agree on that point through three-quarters of the text. This is narrative ethnography wherein ""the native"" is the narrator (meaning China Achebe himself), but in the last quarter of the book, when the whites arrive, something else becomes true, diminishing and degrading the first truth and supplanting it. This is not only the truth of Christianity but the encroachment, as it were, of a concept superfluous to Igbo life: government. The Igbo of the times knew perfectly well how to rule themselves. They understood their needs, their values, their obligations, and their subjugation to the clan. They did not require instruction on these matters from a distant queen, but they got it, and the glory of this novel is that it ultimately tells the truth of the horrible fact: British colonialism wrecked everything. It's so appropriate, then, that the London-educated Achebe reached across to Ireland and William Butler Yeats for the title of the novel: When Yeats wrote the words, ""things fall apart, the center cannot hold,"" he too was confronting the realities of British power imposed on another people.Things Fall Apart is full of splendid Igbo stories and proverbs, but one of its most curious characteristics is that it relates Igbo life in a novelistic form that was born in 18th century Europe. The realities of Okongwo's life are foreign to us, and yet they can be represented with perfect accuracy in our own genre. What is this telling us? I suspect it's telling us that cultural forms--at least in the hands of a master-- possess the suppleness necessary to investigate one another without damaging themselves. Politics, government, and proselytizing religion don't work that way. They smash into foreign cultural realities, they make things fall apart.In another context, Achebe said that literature was his weapon. What he meant, I think, is that literature helped him disarm and defeat his enemies. I like this book a great deal because it dares to count, to acknowledge worldly struggles. In effect, Okongwo's death led to Things Fall Apart; but Things Fall Apart is still leading to the death of British and other forms of colonialism.

I found it very mixed and mostly disappointing.There are two genuinely terrific stories here: “Escape from Spiderhead” and “Tenth of December”. In “Escape from Spiderhead” a futuristic pharmaceutical prison cooks up potions that are used to induce and then eradicate love (and sex). There’s no elaborate explanation of where we are; none is necessary. Saunders develops perfect names for all of his imaginary drugs and manages to let some of the prisoners fight back, drawing on their own emotions, rather than succumb fully to “science.” In “Tenth of December,” an elderly man, pretty sick and pretty crazy, decides to escape his sickbed and go freeze himself by a pond where he once took his little boys. At the same time, a boy, fantasizing himself on a great expedition, heads out for the pond, trudging through the snow and 10 degree weather. He sees the old man half naked and spots his coat. Being the little hero that he thinks he is, he grabs the coat and decides he’ll only get to the man in time to save him if he crosses the pond; but there’s a feeder stream where the ice is thin and ...in our hero falls. Now the old man becomes the hero, chucking all his fear and misery for the sake of getting the kid out of his fix. Then the kid’s mother becomes involved, helpfully, and the elderly man’s wife joins the action, coming to collect him from the house where he’s been taken to warm up. All this is written right on the bare horseback of the story, galloping along, funny, penetrating, implausibly plausible, and generous.The rest of this collection had me wondering what Saunders was doing and why he had achieved such attention. Sometimes he reminded me of Donald Barthelme but lacked the acute wit. Sometimes he reminded me of Sinclair Lewis, poking fun at more contemporary Babbits. Sometimes he’d jigger along, portraying almost everyone as a moron, and then, as in a story called “Home,” find a surprisingly strong ending. His stories definitely draw on a vision of our world as subject to authoritarian controls that only the imagination can elude, but the authoritarian controls aren’t always convincing and the imagination is--deliberately, of course--one cliché after another. So what you get are portraits of hopeful failures; this is Sanders in his Garrison Keillor mode. A story called “The Semplica Girl Diaries” is flat-out boring; a story called “Exhortation” is a nonsensical memo to the staff, urging that it improve its performance while demonstrating how wonderful (and gassy) the office director is. This story is not quite at the level of a graduate program in creative writing, the kind of program where Saunders himself teaches.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle.)...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Sep 17, 2013","Sep 17, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13641208-tenth-of-december

In the sequel, three elderly women, Alexandra, Jane and Sukie decide to go back to the scene of their witchery, Eastwick, Rhode Island, and perhaps perform some white magic, as opposed to the black arts they engaged in long ago.	The idea is that by following old practices, chanting the right chants, focusing the right energies, and holding the right beliefs, a group of women can generate a cone of power from which they can draw magical effects.	As an anchor for a novel’s plot, this is a pretty flimsy proposition, even when it is turned on its head and a former victim (by extension) begins retaliating against the women through the use (as explained late in the book) of quantum mechanics.	But Updike surely intended this to be a mischievous, discursive, playful novel, and he wanted to write about aging women and their attitudes towards themselves and others...and in this he succeeded. Further, he retained to the end of his writing career an astonishing ability to describe visual phenomena, be they Egyptian tombs, Canadian rock faces, the twitches in an unfriendly face, or the cavernous playground of New York City, portrayed here as the capital of nonsense.	The real core of the book is the uncomfortable relationship among the three women...how they accommodate what they don’t like about one another...and the link between women and the true source of magic, Nature, a kind of background character that bewilders us all in its mystery, its extent, its inexplicability, and, by extension, our own inexplicability.	For Updike fans this novel is one more attempt to conjure the mystery of things, partially through social reality, partially through Nature, and partly through one of his persistent preoccupations, the spiritual world, or, more simply put: religion.	Over the years it’s my impression that Updike kept trying to do new things with prose (and poetry) and lost much of his audience. He wrote beautifully, he observed acutely, but he grew more distant from the palpable struggles so evident in his famous Rabbit books. And even though he never lost interest in sex, sex organs, sex acts, sex effects, he seems to have peaked on that subject in a novel called Couples, written in the sixties. In The Widows of Eastwick, he has some fun making Sukie a writer of romance novels who understands that women do not like to be subjected to too much explicitness when it comes to moments of sexual conquest and consummation. Updike himself loved that stuff, so he was in effect making fun of himself.	He didn’t leave anything to the imagination because he had the rarest gift, still evident here, of being able to put the imagination into words. Originally thinking he would be a graphic artist, he never lost interest in all the things painting and drawing portray: he learned to name those things and sequence them in sentences so that water leaked out of pipes in a certain limpid way and doorknobs beckoned to be turned lightly...or with force...or with no hope at all, because the door was locked, the character was trapped, the character had to sit and think and remember and fill in narrative blanks until he could be rescued, perhaps by accident, perhaps with malicious or beneficent intent.	Updike’s gift for reality was strong from start to finish. One personal example: The first Updike novel I read was the first Rabbit book, Rabbit Run. In it Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom has decided he’s got to flee his life and so he takes off on the highway one night and in the course of his driving he sees a sign that says, “Pottstown, 20 miles.” But wait! I was in Pottstown, Pennsylvania when I read those words. Rabbit was heading my way. He existed, and therefore I existed, and I was only sixteen! 	That’s what it was and still is about Updike: Go to Taos or travel up the Nile and you will find yourself looking at a chunky piece of pottery resembling the woman of Willendorf or a glass of gin in which the ice cube has melted to the size of a dime. And Updike will have made you see these things exactly as you see them because he described them perfectly to you before you saw them.	The Widows of Eastwick isn’t a strong novel, per se, but the writing is strong, and that’s its virtue: sentences that make you blink, reread, and then blink again....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 13, 2013","Sep 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2833745-the-widows-of-eastwick

The concept of ""inherent vice"" seems to apply to the marine insurance business, recognizing that most ships have some built-in liability or deficiency, just comes with the territory.That's the case in this novel, set in L.A. in the 60s, which Pynchon describes with painful accuracy. A lot of too much was going on. Here we have, roughly, a complex case of police on police violence in the interest of corruption with the proceeds emerging from drugs, a mysterious organization, and a little real estate.This is a book that closely follows the L.A. private investigator format established by Raymond Chandler. Here ""Doc"" travels all over L.A.'s peculiar geography dealing with equally peculiar people and somehow manages to live without any visible income. But he's onto things and has to find out what's up, and there are bad guys in his way, and so this can be dangerous…but not fatal to the anti-hero P.I.A lot of the novel is dialogue. Enter the recently departed Elmore Leonard. Some of this dialogue is unbelievably accurate; when you read it, you hear it. Some of it is talky explanatory stuff. Interesting but not electrifying.The brooding mists and sunsets and sandy winds and cliff faces of L.A. give the story more context, at times, than the action. There's a boat involved associated with the name Golden Fang, and there are Golden Fang people, and some live and some die.My sense is that Pyncheon had fun writing this book but limited his aspirations to a 60s version of Chandler, depicting the new lower and than low life that took over from good old crooks. Could anyone have smoked as much dope as Doc and continued to function? I think not, but maybe so.Gravity's Rainbow, Pyncheon's third novel, was so much better than this book not because this is a bad one but because Gravity's Rainbow was astonishingly brilliant, wide-ranging, funny, cutting, and stuffed with crackling prose. I think it's better to leave that comparison where I've just put it: don't really compare these books. If you feel like drifting around L.A. in the 60's, Inherent Vice, is resourceful, funny, cynical, and worthwhile. If, however, you tend to see a lot of the characters in the 60s, maybe yourself included, as dressed-up, doped-out schmucks, this might be a novel to ignore. In that case, yes, if you haven't read Gravity's Rainbow, give it a try.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 08, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5933841-inherent-vice

It's written with exceptional vividness--jumps off the page--and honesty. This is a compilation of memories, stories, and straight reports about what it was like to serve as a ground soldier in Vietnam. It bounces from the past to the effects that linger in O'Brien's later life, and it paints painful, blackly comic and frankly agonizing portraits of his comrades, including their grisly deaths.One of the implicit themes of this book is the contrast between American dreams and American wars. Each of these soldiers, O'Brien included, was a kid when he was swept into combat. Each of them had a spot in life at home all picked out. Then...whoosh, it was gone.O'Brien describes what it's like to collapse in fear, what it's like to be overwhelmed by killing a so-called enemy, and what it's like to be shot a few times. He captures the adrenalin-fueled reality of war that is both hell and an intoxicating kind of heaven where everything that happens is super-real, super-significant, and indelibly inscribed in one's memory.One fantastic passage has to do with a guy smuggling his girlfriend over from the States and the girlfriend taking up with a Green Beret unit and, in effect, falling in love with the call of the jungle.Other passages capture the stunning silence returning soldiers often encounter when they come home. Hemingway got this right in a story called ""Soldier's Home,"" and O'Brien gets it right here.For pyrotechnic prose, this book rivals another great book about Vietnam, Michael Herr's Dispatches. Like Dispatches this book is episodic. There doesn't need to be much intersticial matter; it's highly unlikely that any reader will lose his or her place in the riveting narrative that unfolds more like an unrolling canvas than a book--you just see more and more and more of the action.When he was on the eve of being drafted, O'Brien gave serious thought to crossing the border into Canada. He tells this tale with acute fidelity and candor. What holds him back is being nineteen and losing his place in the American story, I suspect--losing his claim on the flag, the history, the geography, the people he's known all his life who would expect him to serve. The moment ripe for fleeing evanesces--here, then gone.This is a particularly intriguing passage because Canada is a great country that has emphasized peacekeeping in its military doctrine, although Canadians certainly have fought as allies when they were needed. Going to Canada as a matter of conscience could easily be justified as a higher calling at the time. There is nothing in this book that justifies America's involvement in Vietnam and essentially no indication that any of the soldiers depicted here knew why they were sacrificing themselves to unspeakable risks and horrors.The lingering effects of having been in Vietnam, or more recent wars, are ghastly. I have a friend who wakes up every twenty minutes at night, jolted by a nightmare. This has been going on for over forty years. He's coached kids with me, always gives the neighborhood Christmas party, and functions as a very effective lawyer, but nights are different. Nights are when bad things happen and never stop happening. O'Brien captures this in his book--the spooky, ghostly, menacing, moaning songs and dance of darkness.I've written extensively about war myself (Nights in the Pink Motel) and know its literary pedigree from The Iliad to today. The most confounding question concerning war is why? If there's an answer...if there's someone threatening you and your loved ones...that's one thing, but if there is some geostrategic rationale underpinning young men and women sacrificing themselves abroad, that's usually not an answer at all. It's not easy to start a war, but it's very, very difficult to stop one....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Sep 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/133518.The_Things_They_Carried

It’s like an old movie that had several directors working on its componentWhen We Were Orphans by Kazuo Ishiguro is a strange and not very good book. It’s like an old movie that had several directors working on its component parts. To put this in more literary terms, the opening sections are stiff and reminded me of H. Rider Haggard’s writing. The narrator, Christopher Banks, is pompous, self-involved, a perfect little British chap raised in Shanghai who, after his parents are mysteriously abducted, decides that upon “coming down from Cambridge” he will become a detective and combat evil in the world.He becomes very involved in this activity, living off some kind of trust fund and solving cases that are never fully described by means that are not fully described either. But they generate acclaim, and Christopher, when he has time, circulates in some of London’s finer “sets.” Periodically he thinks of his parents’ disappearances--they didn’t both go at once--and his childhood friend, Akira, a Japanese boy who lived next door to him in the International Settlement. These passages soften the stuffy prose a bit.Along the way into adulthood, Christopher becomes acquainted with a Miss Sarah Hemmings, also an orphan and a man-chaser who tends to dump her catches. She makes a stab at him that he rebuffs with typical stiffness. Eventually she settles on a distinguished old diplomat who takes her to Shanghai because--though this is not explained--there is something brewing there that threatens the entire world, and only a man like Sir Cecil can resolve things.Ishiguro lets Christopher tumble along becoming famous in England and then reveals that of course his main goal is to go back to Shanghai and find his parents. The possibility that they are long dead doesn’t seem to occur to him. Of course they must be hostages, held for years and years, and of course Christopher is the one to crack the case.In Shanghai it appears Sir Cecil is mistreating Sarah Hemmings. He’s a drunk and a gambler and calls her a whore. Actually, the scene in which this happens is one of the best in the book--it’s real. Then the Japanese assault on Shanghai intensifies, and a new director takes over this movie. Christopher finds Akira, wounded, in a heavily shelled area, and the two of them head off for exactly the house where Christopher is sure his parents are being detained.This is a cartoon. At one point, a lieutenant gives a captain “instructions.” Doesn’t work that way in the military, but Ishiguro and his editors have other things on their minds, apparently. The book has picked up pace and become, somehow, a mystery story without the intense focus that would lead you to think that, but it has to be a mystery story because suddenly you’re in another director’s work, and he’s brought back to life a character who “explains” why so many different things happened long ago. This character, Uncle Philip, was a secret admirer of Christopher's beautiful mother, perhaps the most beautiful woman in Shanghai. Now he spills his guts, full of self-hatred, about all that emotion, well-hidden earlier in the tale.Things end up--I’m skipping over what happened to the parents in case you want to read this book--with Christopher a distinguished fellow in semi-retirement who is looking after a girl he abruptly adopted earlier in life and who apparently tried to commit suicide but now fantasizes that she’ll marry and give Christopher a place to live out his old age. But the truth is that he’d rather stay on in London, read the papers, reflect on his many famous, unexplained cases, and bump into old acquaintances from time to time on his long walks.I could have been rougher on this book, but I wanted to save a few harsh remarks for the literary mafia so full of self-love that they apparently fell all over themselves in the rush to praise it.Joyce Carol Oates--”...will linger in the mind as an often fascinating, imaginative work of surpassing intelligence and taste.”Esquire--”...extraordinary thematic resonance and depth.”The Independent-- “When We Were Orphans discloses a writer...in a league all of his own.”I don’t think it’s just Anglophilia speaking here or a longing for the days when detectives were fascinating heroes--Sherlock Holmes being exactly such a fascinating hero. I think there’s blithering dishonesty at work. I praise you, you’ll praise me. That sort of thing. Let’s all think well of ourselves. Let’s be excited by whatever jumps all over the place, underpinned by the nobility and genius of characters like this and writers like Ishiguro.I try not to read bad books, but sometimes I stubbornly stick with them to make sure I’m right.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 31, 2013","Aug 31, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28923.When_We_Were_Orphans

It falls on its face when it comes to the farcical, a choice McEwan, a talented writer, did not have to make. He could have done otherwise, and better, but he wanted a grotesque, too clever ending and he wrote one. 	Having said that, what's the book about and what are its good qualities?	The book is about two men, a composer named Clive and a newspaper editor named Vernon, who were once the lovers of a recently deceased beauty named Molly and are edgy about their own lives and resentful that Molly ended up dying in the arms, as it were, of a fellow named George.	The setting is London. The cast is a mixture of the chattering and artistic classes with some money sprinkled around. Vernon is desperately trying to save his dying newspaper, the Judge, by boosting circulation with dubious stories, and Clive is trying to finish a commissioned symphony to mark the coming of the new millennium, or the end of the old, or both.	McEwan writes with a rapier as he presents the politics of the newspaper. He is excellent in portraying the pettiness and pride of too many journalists gathered together in one newsroom for their own good.	Clive's task, composing a symphony, is something one might think couldn't be described in words, but McEwan does it beautifully, it seems to me. Of course Clive is an eccentric who works all night and sleeps all day and battles himself constantly for inspiration,but that doesn't make him a buffoon. He doesn't attain that status until, talking a long walk in the Lake District, he decides that he must scuttle away from the scene of a woman being attacked by a man rather than lose the few notes that have just come to him--the apex of his symphony. His self-justification is persuasive up to a point, but no, you can't do that, as Vernon points out to him. You just can't.	Vernon's moral dilemma presents itself when George, Molly's last male friend, offers him photographs of the British foreign secretary in drag. Should he publish these pictures to boost circulation, or should he pass? The New York Times would not publish these photograph. The Judge, however, decides that it will. Good for circulation. But at the last moment, the foreign secretary's wife scoops the Judge by showing one of the pictures to the media and saying she's known about this feature of her husband for a long time and lived with it and it's never made him less of a wonderful, talented man.	Well, the foreign secretary somehow holds his post (I doubt it), and Vernon sees opinion turn against him. He's sacked.	Meanwhile, Clive has come up against the fact that he can't quite get that crowning set of notes fixed in his mind...and he must, thanks to Vernon ratting him out, go to Manchester to identify the male assailant in a line-up.	In the background, Clive anxiously had asked Vernon to promise that if his time to die should ever come, he'd facilitate his passage somehow. Vernon hesitates but accedes on the condition that Clive will do the same for him.	By the end of the novel, however, the two close friends hate one another, and the knowledge they've acquired about certain sleazy Dutch euthanasia specialists facilitates them doing each other in virtually from the same glass of poisoned champagne. 	When everything claps together like this in a book that suddenly decides to shift from character studies to plot-based shenanigans, it may satisfy some need in Great Britain. Amsterdam won the Booker Prize. But I had to wince. McEwan had worked up the moral rottenness of London glitterati to the point where their demise ought to have been more human, painful, and perhaps poignant.

In both cases, there's a prurient element animating the prose, of course, and there is a feminine reason behind the sensual largesse being offered and gratefully received.The Reader's bite is manifold. Part I sets up a pattern of the boy reading things to the woman as a form of entertainment (just something she likes); later on, during the trial, the boy (now a law student) realizes that she--her name is Hanna--is illiterate. This matters because Hanna's codefendents heap blame on her for having written the report on a terrible fire in a sub-camp attached to Auschwitz. Our narrator/protagonist retrospectively realizes that Hanna couldn't have been the leading figure among the female guards, however, if writing a report is the telltale clue--but Hanna, ashamed of her illiteracy, goes along with what they claim, and the result is that the others get limited sentences and she gets a life sentence.Before that happens, our narrator consults with his father, a philosopher, who suggests that the narrator should not approach the judge with what he knows about Hanna because it would intrude on Hanna's freedom and dignity to define her life as she wants to define it. That advice only partially sticks. The narrator does go see the judge, but in the event, he doesn't reveal what he knows. He just engages in legal chitchat.The balance of the novel involves the narrator beginning to record classic texts for Hanna and sending them to her in prison. Eventually, some years into this phase of things, Hanna actually writes a crippled little note of thanks. So she's learned to write! And maybe she can read, so...? But the narrator keeps sending her cassettes, and eventually, after eighteen years, the prison warden, an enlightened soul, advises the narrator that Hanna will be granted clemency, raising the question of whether he will help reintegrate her into society. He agrees, but first, after so many, many years, he'll have to meet Hanna again, face-to-face, won't he?I won't spoil the ending, but it's a turmoil of German post-Holocaust moral reckoning with which I am familiar, having lived and worked in Germany for three years. The narrator isn't guilty in the least except by extension, being German; he was a young boy during World War II. Hanna's guilt derives from the fact that she joined the SS because she was trying to avoid a promotion at Siemens that would have exposed her illiteracy. So yes, she was a guard at a death camp. Did she bear special culpability for the events of the particular night in question? That's not so clear. Ought the narrator have spoken up to the judge? I think so, but you might not. Did Hanna in a way ruin his later love life? It seems she did. Because she saw herself as nothing, she asked very little of him in return. That's not exactly how most relationships work; it's bad training, if you will.Ultimately the narrator takes refuge in becoming a legal historian. The more or less explicit suggestion here is that he sees a continuity between the past, present and future. Things are different as time passes, but some differences linger in the air, in memory, in one's conscience.Hanna is a consistent character throughout the novel. The narrator, by contrast, displays an interesting rupture between his abrupt loss of Hanna as a teenager and the kind of man he became. This is the tricky part, and although it's problematic, I think Schlink has something just about right: teenage boys can go wild about something--a girl, for instance--and then turn ice cold toward something--again, quite possibly a girl. Our narrator does that. Only much later does he accumulate the moral and psychological insight, and courage, to put the whole story together and grow into understanding the permanence of the past. By then certain things are too late, of course--poignant but true.The issue of illiteracy is a vague stand-in for larger issues in The Reader. There is an association between illiteracy and innocence and, of course, between illiteracy and inadequacy and social shame. The narrator and Hanna both have great faith in great writers; late in life, while still in prison, Hanna actually accumulates a small library of books focused directly on the Holocaust. I've read a lot of these books; as powerful as they are, none by itself unravels the horrible fact of the Holocaust. The Reader now becomes another book on the Holocaust shelf; it offers a little more insight into the twists and turns of bludgeoning, senseless, depraved evil.

The characters are displaced Indians, but there is nothing fundamentally different about their problems than you would find among Americans, Mexicans or Germans.""When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine"" focuses on a child's perception of exile as seen through the eyes of Mr. Pirzada, a family friend who is temporarily working in the U.S. just as the war unfolds creating what now is known as Bangladesh, an inevitable consequence of being thousands of miles away from its larger element, contemporary Pakistan, and not an especially happy development.The idea of exile stories goes far back, of course. At its core, the exile story is one of alienation, loneliness, nostalgia, and telling detail. Lahiri's general backdrop is Bengal. Proust, in a weird way, wrote his two thousand page exile story, A Remembrance of Things Past, with the backdrop being childhood; he didn't even have to leave France to lose it.Failure and quiet desperation and confusion are other well-known features of exile stories. There were such great dreams about how wonderful life would be, but only dreams, not realities. The title story, ""Interpreter of Maladies"" has some of that. Here a confession made by an Americanized Indian befuddles a dreamy, unhappy Indian who stayed at home. ""Sexy"" doesn't quite work out well for its main character, either, and in the next story, ""A Real Durwan,"" the worst fate, being put out on the street, shows up in the case of a Bengladeshi woman, driven from her native land, losing her place in Calcultta.Strangely, these are not grave, disturbing stories. Their style is straightforward, sometimes a little flat, but the characters do have a certain suave nobility even when they are desperately poor.It seems to me that Lahiri writes best when she permits herself to be funny. ""This Blessed House"" mixes Christianity and Hinduism in a charming way. ""The Treatment of Bibi Haldar"" presents the case of an apparent epileptic whose ""cure"" seems to be, ultimately, marriage, but there isn't any marriage, only a child.""The Third and Final Continent"" is the most complete immigration/assimilation tale. Lahiri portrays an Indian librarian working at an MIT library eating cornflakes for several weeks upon his arrival in America. Then he finds lodging with a woman who, astoundingly, is 103 years old. Then his arranged wife joins him in America, and they are bewildered into falling in love with another by virtue of affectionate laughter provoked by the 103 year old's judgments and pronouncements. Things work out for this couple; thirty years later they're still together, have a son at Harvard, but keep eating the precious foods of India, having set cornflakes aside a long time ago.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle). ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 23, 2013","Aug 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5439.Interpreter_of_Maladies

Boyle is an animated, vigorously written story about identity theft related in the third person from both the victims' and perpetrator's point of view.The strongest part of the novel is the opening, wherein Dana, who is deaf, finds herself not only abused by her cynical victimizer--let's call him Peck, his real nickname--but also thrown in jail, subjected to the indignities of a three-day incarceration and subsequently fired from her job as a teacher in a place called San Roque, California. While this is going on, her boyfriend, Bridger, is frozen out of the action by the penal bureaucracy (he can't communicate with her), and Peck, who is using Dana's name in the male sense, is living splendidly in Marin, California, with his Russian sweetheart and her annoying little girl.Partly because she's had such a struggle earning her PhD and with life as a deaf person, Dana is outraged and wants to find this thief and make him pay for what he's done to her. Bridger, who creates computer-based movies, is concerned about her obsession, but there's no holding onto her if he tries to hold her back. In fact, when they first spot Peck, Bridger's outrage is huge, but not as huge as it will become when Peck decides he'll just switch over from being Dana to becoming Bridger--exhausting his credit cards, ruining his credit rating, and escaping pursuit (he thinks) in an illicitly acquired Mercedes S-Class.The stage is set for Peck to head for the East Coast, specifically to the area where he grew up along the Hudson River. There he has another scam planned with a co-conspirator and master thief he met in prison. But Dana won't give up, and Bridger tags along.The narrative alternates between Peck's high life in his new woodsy home and Dana and Bridger's desperate attempts to find out who he is and where he is. Through a series of not implausible clues and quick thinking, they succeed.One of the interesting features of Peck's character is that being chased makes him mad. He wants revenge when anyone messes with his life. He takes it personally and reacts violently. It's not entirely clear when he became this way, but he definitely had a high opinion of himself as an adolescent and he definitely had a brutal experience when he lost his restaurants and marriage and ended up in jail for three years after brutalizing his former wife's boyfriend.In a sense, T.C. Boyle is presenting a split-level story here...split between the hearing and the deaf...split between the vagaries of our digital identities and our flesh and blood identities...and split between the ""anything can happen in a computer-based movie"" and the ""anything can happen when hot-tempered people go after one another.""There is no doubt that Dana and Bridger are the good guys, insulting though that seems to Peck, but there is a quality of the unresolved embedded in this novel. Peck apparently gets away. Dana and Bridger apparently break up...but they also apparently, in Bridger's imagination, come together again.Ultimately, I suppose Boyle is portraying modern life, or American life, as a place where nothing matters all that much. Push back hard enough and you'll get nowhere...or hurt. In some ways he undermines this message with intermittently syrupy bursts of joy and love going on between poor Dana and Bridge. And in other ways he blunts the cruelty he presents by letting accidents take some of the blame and contextualizing things in the low-grade reality of fast food joints, stupid car dealers, dummy cops, and wooden school administrators. He's a fast-paced, quick-witted, sharp-edged realist, someone who may take the America he snarls at too seriously, not someone who reaches deeply enough into the horrors of being no one, of being a few misplaced digits on a card or a screen, of losing big and permanently to the evil spirits of the mass age when we are, in fact, in danger of becoming entities that don't matter.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle). ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 21, 2013","Aug 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24723.Talk_Talk

He's not a stunning stylist, but he does introduce desciptive effects--snow, nightfall, oaks tossing in the wind, pubs with carpets, gentlemen's clubs with special lounges for ladies--at the right time and with the right touch.The daughter's tale is much less considered than the mother's tale. In fact, part of what she is involved in becomes a kind of red herring, and lots of what life holds in store for her is unexplored. I don't know if Boyd has returned to Ruth Gilmartin in novels following Restless, but she is almost perfect as a single mother with too many loose ends in her life, all begging to be tied together.Ruth's mother, originally named Eva Delectorskaya, is the female lead in this book, and her adventures in British intelligence, culminating in her act of revenge decades later, make up for what we miss in Ruth's life.Recently I read a book called The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring in Washington by Jennet Conant. Much of what transpires in Restless is echoed in that book, including reference to the spymaster William Stephenson, who drove British efforts to convince America to get to into the war against Hitler.Restless is the better book, not because it is more comprehensive but because it is more intensive.The tension in all spy stories, it seems to me, is a tension between plot and character. Generally plot wins. In Restless, plot is more than given its due without trampling the centrality of human beings in spying, in fiction, and in life itself.Sal Gilmartin (as she eventually came to be known) becomes a symbol of simpler people, all people, scanning the landscapes of their lives, wondering what fate, or someone else, has in mind for them.This isn't a ""great"" book, but it is a very good one.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 17, 2013","Aug 17, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/72148.Restless

They decide to hide away in the Tuscan hills for a while where he will put pen to paper and they will abstain from sapping sex until he's finished his great work.As a first-person narrative, this is a very analytic, pushy book, much like Silvio, the writer. And like King Lear, who wanted things his way without continuing to be responsible for them, Silvio loses control of Leda. She engages in some kind of affair with a local tradesman. Silvio discovers this on the very night that he confronts the fact that his literary work, now finished, isn't good. Like him, it's stiff, thin, and forced.Moravia plays out the denouement with skill. One must also give Silvio credit for understanding his emotional subordination to greater, lustier passions than literature. The discovery scene is a moonlit dance that fulfills what Silvio has always known about Leda: when she isn't docile and generous in direct contact with him, she's got a rough, crude side. He makes her better, in other words, but only if he keeps his focus on her.The title, Conjugal Love, raises interesting questions. A plain vanilla dictionary definition suggests that it is the kind of love that keeps people together long after their passion has waned. The Catholic catechism (Moravia was writing in Catholic Italy) suggests conjugal love is the height of spiritual and emotional union. These are very different propositions. Add in the way conjugal is used in the prison context: conjugal privileges in certain prision scenarios allow a woman, usually, to come meet her incarcerated man for sex in a trailer on the prison grounds.Silvio's idealistic phoniness is always going to undermine him if he tries to hold onto Leda. If he is undermined and knows it, he only becomes all the more phony. But he's a highly literate, emotional dummy, and she, wiser in the ways of the deeper emotions, is his best route to learning something.One contrast underpins many other contrasts: Silvio's rationality versus Leda's sensuality. The lightly sketched backdrop for this tale is Italy in 1936. Who was in power then? The wildly emotional, theatrical Mussolini, whose leadership was disastrous for Italy. As a politically astute man of letters, Moravia was fully aware of the contradictions in human nature and the need for balance. Rationality leads too often to rationalization. That's Silvio's path. Sensuality leads to brutal domination. One might call that Leda's path. Leda's saving grace, however, is her oft-mentioned, if someone patronizing, kindness toward Silvio. With her superabundance of feeling, she manages to tolerate her own flaws while forgiving Silvio his flaws.Ultimately, it seems to me, conjugal love means a love of necessary, albeit difficult, interdependence. When we say one thing and another are are conjoined, they are bound at the hip, nothing without each other. The exact quotient of idealism and realism, sentimentality and sensuality, rationality and sensuality, can and will vary. What won't vary is the fact that this particular love can only exist in the two-ness that gave it birth. This is a human fact neither artist nor muse can render wholly beautiful. This seems to be Moravia's message.For more of my comments on contemporary letters, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle).  ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 14, 2013","Aug 14, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/67144.Conjugal_Love

It is a picture of a rosy-cheeked girl in a marching band uniform playing a drum. She has a big smile on her face and wears a hat with a leather brim and an eagle on the crown.Nonetheless I read My New American Life in part because I admired Prose's Reading Like A Writer so much. I was pretty sure that her benighted publisher was hyperventilating when he slapped that cover on her book. Prose is just too discriminating and intelligent to be the culprit.This proved to be more or less the case, although My American Life isn't much of a novel. Rather, it is an airy, hopeful, pretty funny, wandering tale about a young Albanian girl trying to make her way toward a Green Card (Permanent Resident Status) by serving as a bored nanny in the New Jersey suburbs of New York.Lula, our heroine's name, is a kind, thoughtful, exceptionally smart person with nothing going for her except the motherwit she brought along from Albania. Albania, for those who don't know, was the most secretive, closed-off country in the world during the Cold War. Partly as a consequence, and partly as a consequence of being a country in the Balkans, Albanians are cynical, have lived worse than however they are living now, resilient, and generally convinced that within the next few seconds they'll figure out how to escape their latest jam.That's Lula. This is a story about her ducking the sex-slave trade, being beached in the Garden State, and falling in semi-love with a small time Albanian hood named Alvo. (He makes his great escape by being deported.)Lots of things happen, with increasing frequency as the book rolls towards its end. That makes for numerous comic scenes that don't credibly add up, especially when the various calamities turn into serendipities and most of the horrendous possibilities are blunted by Lula's dumb luck, grandmother's sayings, and the ongoing circus of America at large within itself, meaning there is an Italian mafia (Tony Soprano in Bay Ridge), a Russian mafia (in Brighton Beach), and an Albanian mafia (wherever it can squeeze in.)Prose excels in long stretches of lively dialogue and a general picture of Americans as sadder, slower, and more culturally impoverished than Albanians. She's good at father/son alienation, broken-down wives, and the materialistic mysteries of what passes for Christmas. Lula has to navigate all this; she doesn't always succeed; but she's spunky and not mean. (I was reminded of a teenage friend of my son addressing her father as, ""You wretched little man,"" to his face; now that's mean; Lula would never do such a thing.)I have no idea why Prose decided to pack this book with Albanians other than their scheming remoteness and bizarre past, but why not? For two decades I was a diplomat. We never dealt with, worried about, or even discussed Albania. It was sealed-up. It might as well have been a moth hole in a woolen map--not there, absent. Well, that was a while ago, and now the Albanians are here with us, banging their drums.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2013","Aug 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9949190-my-new-american-life

The central figure among theSunset Park is a neighborhood in western Brooklyn, New York, where four young people are squatting in an abandoned house. The central figure among them is Miles Heller, who has severed ties with his father and mother from his late teens to his mid-twenties and is on the verge of reconnecting. He’s been drifting, having dropped out of Brown after his junior year, and doing menial jobs around the country. Now he’s been taken in by his boyhood friend, Bing, and waiting for his girlfriend, Pilar, to pass her eighteenth birthday in Florida so they can resume a relationship that Miles has begun to envision culminating in marriage.Miles’s father, Morris, is a publisher, based in Manhattan. His mother, Mary-Lee, left Morris and Miles soon after Miles’s birth. She became a successful, versatile actress, based in California Morris’s second wife, Willa, had a son named Bobby. Miles’s problem is that he thinks he was the accidental cause of Bobby’s death. This has a lot to do with his extended disappearance.The novel traces the trajectory of these characters--and the other squatters--with narrative fluency. As the novel settles into New York, picking up publishing and theater contexts, it reminds you of Joan Didion’s memoir, Blue Nights. This is how New York is; this is how New Yorkers are. And lots of them, maybe most of them, have kids with problems...while said kids don’t think their problems are their parents’ problems at all...they think they’re living their own lives.I enjoyed reading Sunset Park even as it disappointed me. This is almost reportage or something like a synopsis of a potentially longer, more complex novel. A fair amount of character-development has to do with borrowings from American popular culture: the financial meltdown, old movies, old baseball players, favorite greasy-spoon diners, quandaries about sexual identity. This is pretty easy, familiar stuff, but something has to happen to such stuff when it goes from the newspapers into novels, and it doesn’t really happen in Sunset Park.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle).I asked myself why and came up with this: Auster doesn’t go deep enough into his characters’ psychic ground. And he fails to get there, it seems to me, because he writes the book largely in the present tense, which provides fleeting, dramatic immediacy but little depth. Again, that sense that the book is being reported, not written. Novels are not, ideally, reports on contemporary existence. They are existence itself. Not Sunset Park. Sunset Park moves with the mastery one would expect of someone as accomplished as Auster, and yet it is something like a stone skipping across a creek, from character to character, barely getting wet.One very odd element is the introduction of a diary Morris Heller keeps toward the end of the book. Up to that point Morris is depicted as a sympathetic, troubled father whose one mistake in his second marriage virtually destroys it (and his second wife, Willa). But the diary represents his relationship having changed with his son, Miles, such that, despite their reunion, he refers to him consistently as “the boy.” He doesn’t call him Miles, just the boy this...the boy that...the boy if...the boy but... I’m sure Auster’s idea is to reflect Morris’s disappointment from and alienation from Miles. This isn’t a tale where the prodigal son is really welcomed home, but a father elevating himself to the point where he refers to his son not by his name but as “the boy” strikes a very false, patronizing, arch, and distasteful note. We know enough about Morris to know he isn’t perfect, all-knowing, and detached from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, so when Miles becomes “the boy” in his mind (and heart), he’s cheapened and becomes less credible and compelling. It’s too late in the novel for this to happen.Sunset Park ends with Miles back in trouble again. I won’t go into the details, but it’s clear that Auster is condemning not just the heartlessness of the father but also of the enveloping modern world in which the son must live.

Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel is such an excellent piece of historical fiction that a short , simply saying, ""Read it!"", might be the best . Mantel's novel focuses on Thomas Cromwell, ultimately chief advisor to English King Henry VIII, and his rivals within Henry's court. The book is well-searched, evocatively written, and vivid to the point of ""taking you there.""An historical novel this good surpasses biographical history in bringing a fascinating cast of characters at a critical point in English history alive.What the uninitiated generally know about Henry VIII is generally true: He died a fat man who had split the English church away from the Roman church primarily because he wanted a male heir…and he married six women in search of that heir. Said heir never emerged; instead Elizabeth I, Henry's daughter with Anne Boleyn, became the greatest queen in English history.Mantel focuses on Cromwell for good reasons. He was a commoner who rose to prominence as a protege of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Henry VIII pushed Wolsey out of the way because Wolsey wouldn't press the pope in Rome hard enough to permit him to legally (under church law) marry Anne Boleyn (at the expense of Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII's first wife, who did not produce a male heir.) Cromwell survived Wolsey's downfall and kept rising, eventually helping break the pope's grip on Henry's obedience; this brought the Church of England into being and gave Henry the authority he needed to sanction his marriage to Anne Boleyn.Ok, so that's the ""history."" Here are some thoughts on historical novels and how this one works.Historical novels are constrained by what we know happened, or what we think we know. They live and breathe to the extent a novelist knows her material and has, as is the case with Mantel, an iron grip on what the key characters were really like. Cardinal Wolsey, a sly churchman, is the first intriguing character in this novel. He's deferential but self-assured, determined but modest. Cromwell soon emerges as a young man who has done a lot on the continent and knows how to do a lot--of a practical nature--in England. He is consistent throughout the novel, but I must say that his reticence and inwardness left me dissatisfied. The very title of the book, Wolf Hall, refers to a passion Cromwell develops that he never explores. Anne Boleyn is a crafty, tough, experienced woman who enraptures Henry to the point that, as you read along, you wonder if she can possibly be ""good enough in bed"" to keep him interested once, after seven years, she lets him have his way. As it turns out--I give nothing away here--she wasn't that appealing to him once she produced first Elizabeth and then a miscarrige. He wanted a boy, dammit!Henry VIII evidentally was two figures in history. Mantel writes about him when he was cautious, merry, passionate, careless, and rather appealing. Later in his reign, he became self-absorbed, cruel, confused, and distinctly unappealing; but that's after the book's conclusion.Ancillary characters are all terrific: Thomas More, Mary Boleyn, Rafe, and Cromwell's immediate family members, including his first wife and son, to name a few.The driving dynamic of Wolf Hall really is a quarrel about religion and power. Mexico stamped on the priests in its 20th century revolution; the Soviets did the same in their 20th century revolution; this list could go on. But here you have a Catholic England way ahead of many other secularizing countries although highly influenced by the ongoing Reformation movement emanating out of Germany (and led by Martin Luther). The portrait of England presented in Wolf Hall is simply fascinating because it is so unlike the England (or U.K.) we know in recent centuries. As knowledgeable as Mantel is, she surely knows she is foreshadowing much of Shakespeare in this tale; she also knows that the baby Elizabeth eventually will become a world figure much more grand and powerful than any pope.These are the delights of historical fiction. Not a line can be written absent dramatic irony. We know how things will turn out. But these are also the constraints of historical fiction.Mantel does wonders with the mists and vapors and seaminess of England in the 16th century; she's great on old stones, old buildings, lumbering barges, splendid costumes, and the general atmosphere of antiquity. And yet this is in some ways compensatory for a static quality in Wolf Hall. Every page is good, but like Cromwell himself, every page is doing its best not to reveal its already known secrets too easily. History, in effect, tends to vitiate fiction; it imposes a form on it that a pure fiction writer would probably toss off.On the other hand, there are lots of gems here. One of my favorites, because it rings so true, is that Anne Boleyn had expected every day of her queenship to be like the day of her coronation…and was bitterly disappointed that that was not, and could not be, the case.Back to the short  form: If you like historical fiction and you particularly like English history, read this novel. Even if you don't, it's a masterful portrait of a country wrenching itself apart because of the thousand-year power exerted by the Roman papacy.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 08, 2013","Aug 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6101138-wolf-hall

All he wants is to leave his only daughter some money to help her deal with her unsuccessful marriage, so he invests his last 500 pounds in an old steamer owned by its chief engineer, a man named Massy, and serves as its captain on local runs through what can be called Conrad country, the innumerable islands of Indonesia.Massy is a desperate man who won the money to buy his ship in a lottery. He only takes Whalley on as partner because his steamer is fast deteriorating and he would like to get rid of him under terms of the contract that would give him a year to repay the 500 pounds. Whalley has a problem in that he can barely meet the terms of the contract because he is going blind and trying to conceal that fact by relying on a Malay servant who dutifully carries out the captain's orders and could virtually sail the ship himself.A further complicating factor is the second engineer's desire to reveal Whalley's blindness and take over as captain himself. All thee main characters have one more journey in which to resolve their respective challengesThe characterizations in this novella are superb, forceful, distinctive and raw. Ships require intimate cooperation that often bleeds into psychological entanglement. In general Conrad writes about the moods of the sea with dazzling perceptiveness. He has a painter's eye for light, sunset, nightfall, the murky hours of late watches and the refreshing mysteries of timeless mornings, ever recurring, ever renewing.The natural companion to this tale is Melville's Billy Budd. The elemental force of Melville's novella is its strength. The End of the Tether is more morally complex and ingeniously plotted. There is a wholeness here, a fully developed cast of characters whose motivations and weaknesses are clear and painful. Are we really such brutes? Do we have such bad luck? The poignant realism here verges on the bitter realism in Thomas Hardy's novels. Sometime Conrad overwrites, but his missteps are an excess of talent. ...more",Notes are private!,1,3,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2013","Jul 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2083902.The_End_of_the_Tether

It's fuHouse of Meetings by Martin Amis is a convincingly bitter memoir by the survivor of one of Stalin's slave labor camps above the Arctic Circle. It's full of biting insight, distinctive characterizations, and an ongoing sense of ambivalence about life itself and life in Russia in particular.It's hard to imagine Amis would have written this book in the 1970s or 80s. Even then only a few writers--in English at least--were as fully engaged in trashing the Soviet Union as it deserved to be trashed...and not only during the period of Stalinism.I've read a great deal of Russian fiction from the 19th, 20th and 21st century and published many stories in what could be called ""the Russian idiom,"" which is a mixture of irony, despair, passion, obsession, and wronged grandeur. I use this term, ""wronged grandeur,"" to signify the greatness in Russian culture that first the czars and then the communists and now Putin have made it their business to suppress.There is no going beyond the horrors related about Russian/communist prison camps by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Solzhenitsyn, but Amis keeps pace. The fascination of prison camp stories (Ha Jin's War Trash is a good one) is the way in which they recount the transformation of the society of origin into a starker structure of hierarchical violence. Prison tales tell you quite clearly what power in a given country has on its mind.At one point, Amis's narrator points out that only Stalin did not realize that slave labor was a diseconomy. Everyone else was afraid to tell him. But economics wasn't Stalin's point; control was what mattered to him. Likewise the various czars, some better, some worse; and likewise Putin. And control is power.Amis's principal characters are deformed and corrupted in fascinating ways. Somehow the narrator climbs out of prison camp and finds wealth. His brother gets out of camp and can do almost nothing with life. The woman they both love, Zoya, ultimately abandons the narrator's brother but doesn't take up with the narrator. They've seen too many horrors and known too much internal death, death of the heart, death of the soul.Ultimately the brother, Lev, has his post-mortem say in a letter he leaves behind. From a strictly novelistic perspective, this is crucial. It interrupts and complements the wicked precision of the narrator's lament. It unravels some of Lev's obstinate mystery and it opens a window on Zoya. Until Lev's letter appeared, I was beginning to think House of Meetings might not find its emotional point in a personal sense. Afterward the book rose substantially in my estimation.Amis is a cheeky, versatile, but serious writer. The fact that he took on Russia this way is surprising but much to his credit. We know enough history now to know that what he writes is true. To a certain extent Solzhenitsyn did much of the work Amis duplicates here, but by rounding out the love triangle in a strong, moving way, Amis made Russia's ongoing tragedy his own.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2013","Jul 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18826.House_of_Meetings

The main such scenario is tAncient Light by John Banville is a lyrical novel, often beautifully written, that loosely meditates on oedipal scenarios. The main such scenario is the narrator's affair, at fifteen, with a woman who is thirty-five. This is improbable but Banville's narrator--now an actor in his sixties recollecting his formative experiences--has a compelling voice, a gift for description that makes the implausible plausible, and a kind of explanation for why Mrs. Gray falls for him with such abandon: she has a wanton side; she's bored with her husband and the Irish town in which he is an optician; she wants to cut loose and she can have as much of the boy as she wants because he wants her all the time.Our narrator also is involved in two parallel stories: one is the somewhat vague account of the damage done to him and his wife by their daughter's suicide; the other is a more detailed account of his involvement in a film (he's a stage actor, not a film actor) that entails a close, but apparently not amorous, relationship with the film's heroine, who reminds the narrator of his departed daughter.The overarching novelistic structure here, then, has to do with when the fifteen year-old and thirty-five year old will be found out. The daughter's suicide shows up early, as a memory, but is overwhelmed by long passages dealing with having sex with the accomodating Mrs. Gray in various risky and unappetizing places. Around the midpoint of the novel, the film gets under way, and likewise the awkward relationship between the narrator and heroine, unfortunately named Dawn Devenport.Banville's strength isn't tying things together, that's for sure, but he is smooth and deft at writing his way out of corners by shifting story lines, or introducing a mysterious stranger in a bar in Italy, or suddenly placing emphasis on a factotum in the film business who helps him get to the bottom of his faulty memory of how exactly his affair with Mrs. Gray blew up, or was found out, or came to an end.There are legitimate hints in the book, which I won't reveal, but they aren't that well-matched to the narrative's needs. So one concludes the book with a sense of deus ex machina, and a return to that oedipal trance our hero never quite escapes. He's a suckling type, basically, but, excuse the pun, he has good taste: he takes in variations in a woman's skin tones quite well, he's good on light effects, he captures the essence of minor characters with a few quick strokes and actions, he isn't a miscreant, he's just a boy who blames his adoring older lover a little bit for arresting his development and making her, not an exceptional woman, his model femme fatale forever.Banville's writerly gifts, his word-painting, his mood-setting, his shrew psychological insights and pleasant irony are the qualities that make him a successful literary man. This book is somewhat thrown together, but it reads well nonetheless.For more of my comments on contemporary ficton, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2013","Jul 19, 2013",,Audio,view (with text),/book/show/13414604-ancient-light

With a virgin he requests from a trusted madam whom he can't bring himself to consume; instead, he weaves her into his life, gives her the name Delgadina, and finds himself reborn with the kind of comic love Garcíía Márquez excels in portraying. The old guy, a journalist, writes better than ever, adores his Delgadina while preserving her innocence, and is ultimately rewarded with the rejuvenation of jealousy that proves, fortunately, unfounded. For Delgadina it turns out, has fallen as deeply in love with him as he with her, though she's a teenager.This is a book that bespeaks the writerly talent of never missing a beat, even in digressions, amiable subplots, and the lulls that plague any ninety-year-old as he pushes doubtfully through the day hoping to survive until his nightly visit to the bordello of Rosa Cabarcas for his innocent rendezvous with Delgadina.Saul Bellow also had this gift; like García Márquez he took ""feelings"" seriously, welcoming woe as much as joy, and penetrated the quandaries of life with a leaping kind of energy. At its worst in a book by either of these masters, life is good, all we have, full of cunning opponents, seemingly insurmountable obstacles (old age, for sure!) and dismal circumstances that will have to pass for palaces because palaces are so seldom available to the common man.The key, though, is the theme of invigorating love, love confessed, love celebrated, love that storms through bordellos and dreams and the tail of an Angora cat swishing across your naked bony shin.My affection for García Márquez started out slow a long time ago. The first book of his I read was called Leaf Storm, and I found it to be a clumsy imitation of Faulkner. Then, like millions of others, I read A Hundred Years of Solitude and encountered something I thought was impossible: he had actually worked through Faulkner and extended him, creating worlds that were thick as jungles, fleshy, tragic, bewildering and dripping with time...in which we are all trapped.So García Márquez, who has had his ups and downs, entered into my pantheon of great novelists and this little gem is another indication why.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2013","Jul 15, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5947099-memories-of-my-melancholy-whores

The key family in this story, from within the Reserve, is the Cole family, whose daughter would be fairly difficult to diagnose. Vanessa is a vamp or a nymphomaniac or a borderline personality or the fragile victim of sexual abuse at age three who, despite her beauty as a woman and her fine sensibility (and on and on), specializes in wrecking her own and other people's lives.We know this type, unfortunately, and more often encounter it in the movies than in serious novels.One life Vanessa takes an interest in wrecking belongs to the graphic artist Jordan Groves, who lives on the edge of The Reserve when he is not having adventures in the world's wilds, often documenting these activities not only with woodcuts and drawings but also with suggestive accounts of his liaisons with the local femininity, such as it may be around the Arctic Circle or in the Andes. (Toward the end of the book, when he's in agony over his wife's first and only infidelity , he really has to scamper to list all the ways in which he's confused about the fact that he can screw around but she can't.)_Groves is a talented artist, perhaps, and an amateur pilot, but also a gross, wife-abusing boor. He has some Hemingway in him, unfortunately, and even claims to know Hemingway. He also is upstate New York's resident Red, if such a thing is meaningful or even imaginable.Between them Vanessa Cole and Jordan Groves put a hex on her parents, his wife and children, and a handsome widower who serves as an accomplished hunting guide and naive lover to the needy rich.Well, I didn't like the book, so why go on? Perhaps it's just being perplexed, as I said above, by a good writer gone bad--someone who still can describe the physical world very well, someone who still moves expertly between exposition and dialogue/scene, someone who in earlier books has focused on misfits but done it in an interesting way. The core problem really is the melodrama of it all, the woodsy sniffiness of the Reservists, the tough guy disdain exhibited by the aesthetically gifted Jordan, and so on and so forth. The Reserve as a novel exhibits moments when it seems to reaching for the territory Fitzgerald sketched out in Tender is the Night but many more moments when it is posing for a movie option in Hollywood.Essentially an experienced writer is exhibiting control here, but he is controlling unworthy subjects and taking them far too seriously. I'm not exaggerating or giving much away when I say that the series of calamities arrayed in The Reserve go from death by heart attack to death by shotgun to lobotomization to death in the brutal skies of the Spanish civil war (on the good guys' side, of course.) And somehow, in a flash forward sequence, the Hindenburg zeppelin floats past, which we know went up in flames, just as (oops, I'm giving something else away) the Cole family's magnificent retreat goes up in flames.The issue may be this: a writer of Banks' skill, proven elsewhere, can make a creepy crawly kind of tale work…sort of…but it would be better to simply take this strange ensemble right over the top…push it into Poe-land or Lawrence-land or McCarthy-land. Banks avoids the solemn simplifications of the later Hemingway--who began to falter when he really began to try to write about women--yet he fails to realize that he is dealing in caricatures more than characters.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 13, 2013","Jul 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1896247.The_Reserve

Thereafter the father led a dissident campaign, and his recompense was being kidnapped in Geneva....and apparently killed somewhere.This left the boy, Nuri, adrift with his young step-mother, Mona, with whom he was in love. Neither understood the father’s (Kamal’s) role in international politics, and his disappearance mystifies them despite the somewhat lame assistance of Kamal’s long-time Swiss lawyer. Said lawyer knew much more than he revealed at the time of the kidnapping. Ten years later Nuri revisits Geneva and forces out the truth, which I won’t reveal for fear of spoiling the novel for potential readers.There are additional plot twists as well but as this book progresses, it’s clear that its strength is the narrative voice, and development, of Nuri, and its weakness is the belated explanation of who Kamal really was.There are good short scenes in Cairo, Geneva, London, and northern England, where Nuri is sent to boarding school. The depictions of the family retainers in Cairo are also good. Matar does a lot with short sentences and short chapters. Mona comes apart logically, but it is interesting to see this happen. Nuri? We can’t be sure what impact this frequently compelling tale has had on him, even though the book ultimately concludes where it begins in an apartment in Cairo, and his return to Egypt is some kind of statement.My “issue” with this tale is that it hinges somewhat on the assumption that the assassinated king of Libya and his court were the good guys and Gaddafi was a bad buy. Yes, Gaddafi turned out to be a very bad guy, but this is a book centered on the exotic appeal of very wealthy, cosmopolitan Libyans, and I, for one, kept asking myself about how they got so wealthy and how deeply they were cosmopolitan. Over the last three or four hundred years, we have seen that monarchs, unless very tightly constrained by a constitutional democracy, are a flawed, pretentious bunch. Are we to shed tears for the Shah of Iran or the last kings of Jordan and Morocco when their times come? How about the King of Saudi Arabia? Or Thailand? The underlying nostalgia for privileged aristocracy done wrong disturbed me.Again, this is not to take Gaddfi’s side, nor is it to take the side of another revolutionary who spent a lot of time in Switzerland, Lenin, but a novel that ultimately hinges on liking a man for his association with nobility is problematic. Kamal should have been in the foreground, not exposed ex post facto, in all his complexity. That would have made this book a better one, and it would have made the central character, Nuri, all the more interesting. The emphasis placed on his sentimental education misses the point that his life was financed by very wealthy interests that predominated in a very poor land.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 10, 2013","Jul 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10102881-anatomy-of-a-disappearance

The main male characters are a father and two sons, very different in nature, who fall in love with sex, fall in love with love, and fall in love with overreaching their prospects and capabilities.The society being described here has the air of not being judged, just presented with an acute eye and sense of irony. It is a paternalistic society, overtly religious but in practical terms full of sin and folly. Dignity appears to be a man's right, but the women, because they are so constrained and oppressed, are the ones who maintain their dignity best.The fun of the book is seeing men swell up with desire and vainglorious imaginings that lead them to disappointment and shame. The novelistic antecedents would certainly include Balzac and his sweeping but intense studies of humanity, whether humanity be loyal and diligent or spendthrift and reckless.Cairo here is fringed with the true palaces of the truly rich, landscaped with palms and vast lawns and backed by the restless desert. We see some of that. Cairo is also the houseboat life of kept women, too much booze, laughter and ribald affection. And Cairo is the narrowness of the inner city with streets that twist into obscurity every ten or twenty feet, lined by awninged shops and backed by stolid three-story dwellings in which three families, and three generations, live, love and battle.The most valiant character is young Kamal, a confused idealist, age 19, who is abused by an older girl as a way of forcing another, more appealing fellow, to propose marriage to her more quickly. But Kamal's post-adolescent efforts at coming to grips with modern science, European philosophy, and his Islamic heritage can be pretty tedious and confused.The steeliest character is Zanuba, an ""entertainer"" who wants to force some man of means to free her of a life just a step or so beyond a whore's.The central character, inevitably, is the conflicted Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, father of difficult sons, disciplinarian at home and hedonist in the night. The inevitability of Ahmad Abd al-Jawad's centrality, it seems to me, flows from the paternalistic nature of the society in which he lives. You can't do anything without somehow taking your father into account, and he, with all his flaws, is your father.This is not a tight chronicle but it barrels along with a quality of authenticity. The framework, lightly traced in, is dual: Egypt's struggles to get out from under British dominance and Egypt's internal conflict between the life of the flesh and the life of Islamic spirituality.Mahfouz's excellence as a writer derives from not overreaching the way his characters do. He focuses on the essential aspects of figures who, admittedly, are somewhat inessential. He doesn't attempt to write a tale encompassing all of Cairo, much less Egypt. He wants to get at the lived experience of ordinary people. That normally is considered the essence of writing a novel. I think of the book as a chronicle because it tumbles on, makes little effort to finalize a picture of each major character's development, and at the end, just sort of drifts into another inconclusive and surprising storyline.I did, in fact, decide to read Palace of Desire this week because of what's going on in Egypt at the moment. There is no direct connection between the ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood from government and Palace of Desire, but indirectly, yes, there's a cultural connection, which always is much bigger and more portentous than political affairs (though politics dominate front pages and headlines more often than culture).You read books like Palace of Desire to try to come to terms with the complexity of a place like Egypt, to learn to respect that complexity, and in some ways--not in patronizing ways--pity it. My sense is that Egypt's future is very uncertain right now, and by this I don't mean it could ""go either way."" There's no ""either way"" here. There are many, many ways involved. The art of the great fiction writer is to spell that out in human terms. That's what Mahfouz managed to do.For more of my comments on fiction and public affairs, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 08, 2013","Jul 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5495.Palace_of_Desire

As always there's no reason why I haven't read his work except that I've been been busy reading other stuff.This is a novel that reads somewhat like Kafka, somewhat like Paul Auster, and somewhat like Don DeLillo. It's an obscure ""premise"" novel, which is to say there's an idea advanced that is explored and explored and explored. The quote from Wittgenstein at the beginning sets the stage well: ""If, for example, you were to think more deeply about death, then it would be truly strange if, in so doing, you did not encounter new images, new linguistic fields.""Death, then, is this novel's main character. Initially it is a folklorish abstraction that takes time off, allowing people to age but not die (Swift was the first writer I know of to play with this idea, but it might show up in Dante, Vergil, or even Homer; it certainly is a hellish concept.) This causes a lot of trouble, as you might imagine. Then death decides to give a week's notice to all those who haven't died during the suspension of its activities. More trouble. Saramago is meticulous in exploring every variation and permutation of these troubles. He involves the government and has fun with how a government would deal with no one dying and then tens of thousands dying. He also involves the undertakers, the grave diggers, and something he calls the Maphia.I'd say about half way into the book, I started finding it tedious, but I kept going because it is a beautifully controlled piece of writing (aided by an excellent translation from the Portugese), and I was rewarded when, in the last third of the book death (always with a lower case d) begins having trouble with a certain musician she plans to kill. Yes, in a perverse and interesting way, they fall in love and thereby explain, retroactively, the first two-thirds of the book.What enlivens the text isn't only the difficult and problematic love story, not easy for either the musician or death, but also the fact that they talk to one another extensively. Much of this book is narrated somewhat puckishly as straight exposition. But at last, in the final movement, we encounter the fencing, questioning, ambivalence, and boldness of two ""people"" exploring one another's appeal.The category for this kind of writing is ""fabulist."" It's not a one-to-one allegory and it's not a fable; it's a hypothetical mixture of the real and unreal, a proposition that eventually, like a caterpillar, becomes a butterfly. I'm always interested in variations in conventional approaches to punctuation, sentence structure, and dialogue. Saramago, for whatever reason, eschews quotation marks, separates sentences with commas, and achieves an intimate enjambed quality with his otherwise strong, straightforward, witty prose. I've never seen a writer do exactly what he does before, especially with his quirky commas which lead naturally to his tendency to make lists of things and push them into the exposition (not always logically, it seems to me).Nonetheless, this is a short novel, a two-day read, and it concludes with a convincing, provocative surge of mysterious emotion. If you liked Auster's Travels in the Scriptorium or DeLillo's Point Omega, you'll like this novel, too. When it begins to grow tedious, don't rush, read more slowly. The net impact is greater that way.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction at 2 cents apiece, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle.) ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2013","Jul 03, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3018539-death-with-interruptions

That's the case for me with The Power and The Glory by Graham Greene. This is a novel of awesome power and concision, and it is a foray into a world that Greene somehow understood after only two months exposure to it. That's the length of time he spent in post-Revolutionary Mexico before writing The Power and The Glory.	Many years later I lived in Mexico for three years and have visited it extensively. Somehow Greene ""got"" qualities Mexico possesses that are other-worldly even to this day.	The story is as follows: After the Mexican Revolution, the Catholic Church was hounded and reduced into a kind of phantom. The Church's vast land holdings, accumulated over centuries, and its omnipresent socio-political influence repelled the revolutionaries to such an extent that churches were burned, clerics forced to marry or face prison or death and they were not permitted to appear in public in their typical priestly garb.	Greene, a converted English catholic, tells the tale of a priest who is in semi-hiding from this persecution for eight years. He lets the story unfold on its own, in the process creating a fascinating central character who finds himself guilt-ridden, full of shame, and a sense of doom. He's a ""whiskey priest,"" meaning he's an alcoholic. And in a moment of weakness and basic human nature during the chaotic transition to a secular society, he fathered a child.	Neither the mother of the child nor the child herself offers our priest any solace. It's dangerous to harbor him. A price has been put on his head. As a consequence a mestizo bounty-hunter, one of the slimiest characters in all of fiction, pursues him wherever he stumbles in the wilds of coastal Mexico (this is on the eastern coast). And at the same time a police lieutenant in the district where the priest is scrambling for safety makes it his business to capture and execute him, although not without misgivings.	Time and again the priest wishes he'd simply be caught. Ultimately he responds to a call of conscience that really is a trap, and he gets his wish.	The great fiction of Mexico, and this is one of the great fictions Mexico has spawned, tends to focus on its darkness and mystery, a merging of conquest, indigenous survival,and breathtaking landscape that sometimes verges on a horror to even contemplate. Books I'd list along with The Power and The Glory are The Death of Artemio Cruz by Carlos Fuentes, Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo, and Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry. I could go on. Mexico's greatest literary figure, Octavio Paz, wasn't a novelist, but as a poet and a critic, he was world-spanning, and yet Mexican to the core. His Labyrinths of Solitude is a masterpiece of critical writing that brings to life the unbelievable contradictions between Mexico and the United States. I happened to know both Paz and Fuentes. They were emblems of what Americans can't get through their heads: Mexico is an a poor country, sure, but it is also a country of high cosmopolitanism, and it possesses a heritage of extraordinary civilizations that is utterly ""non-western."" 	Back to Greene: After his conversion to Catholicism as a young man, he struggled with it and its precepts. It consoled and condemned him. It elevated and crushed him. HIs priest draws on this, but this isn't Graham Greene in disguise. This is a weak, sometimes humorous, brutally honest, fatalistic, desperate man thrashing through a landscape of villages, settlements and towns where he often is discovered and sometimes, with no consequence, even admits to being who he is.	The intensity of this book, especially the ambivalent dialogue between the police lieutenant and priest toward the end, reminds me of Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. The fleshy vegetable physicality of its setting is Conradian. But this is Greene at the height of his powers, wasting no words, pushing conscience to its breaking point, and exploring the mystery and necessity of God.	One final point: Mexico and Turkey turned on their religious institutions at about the same time. In Mexico the Church still has its wings clipped; in Turkey it regained its footing over the last ten years. What's fascinating about the Mexican example is the notion that a society can get sick of its priests and keep them at bay even though they find their way through the back door and persist. The real case in point in today's world is whether something similar will occur in Egypt (and the tide may also be turning secular in Turkey.) People can still believe but not want to be governed, much less be exploited by, their clergy. The eradication of faith, as Greene implies at the end of his novel, isn't the question; it is ineradicable. The reallocation of power, separating it from glory, is the painful dilemma that can be and has been approached. The backlash against the church in post-Revolutionary Mexico was an awesome example of this.For more of my comments on fiction and the world, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle), so named because the s therein cost about two cents apiece....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2013","Jun 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3690.The_Power_and_the_Glory

I would not have read this novel if it weren't proposed by the guy who had the choice of what we'd take up next, and after fifteen pages I began considering whether I should stop reading the book and stop going to the reading group altogether.To take the latter point first--droping out of the reading group--I should note that I am a particular reader who does his best to find good books that meet his particular interests and needs. I should also add that when I ""worked"" for a living before transitioning to writing full-time, I had to read thousands of pages of stuff every year that I didn't especially want to read (though sometimes it was interesting.) Now I don't do anything I don't want to do, and that includes reading things people tell me I ought to read or would love to read. I might love reading it, or I might not, or I might be pursuing a reading agenda that I have loosely mapped out for myself months in advance. In other words, what I read is mine, and I can't read everything, so I read what I want and as and when I want to read it.This extends to the way I read newspapers. Once upon a time I read five or six newspapers every morning as part of my job; then I would be briefed by one of my assistants who had done the same and we would compare notes on what we thought was important and what wasn't important. This went on for years in various countries around the world. Now I look at the front page and sports page of one newspaper and periodiodically check the web page of the New York Times for updates through the course of the day. On Sundays the massive New York Times and just as massive Washington Post arrive on my driveway. The Post comes in a clear plastic bag, the Times comes in a blue plastic bag I look at their front pages and turn them over to my wife. For days she tries to catch up with them, bringing Thoreau to mind: he said he'd need a week to read a newspaper properly. Well, I don't have a week for that sort of thing anymore. Supplementing whatever I miss by limiting my newspaper intake, I receive ten to fifteen emails a day from various sources, all pointing me toward world affairs. I glance at them, sometimes I read them in full, sometimes I push the trash button in less than a second.What I really want to read are the specific books I choose to read. Books are infinitely more rewarding, challenging, and memorable than the news, or ""articles,"" or news summaries. They brave the difficulty of dealing with a subject in depth; the demonstrate, or try to, a command of a subject, factual or fictional. They are the product of a writer's personal style and worldview, not the style and worldview (and style book) of a news organization.So when a friend with whom I have long discussed books asked if I would like to join a new reading group he and some others were forming, I said, with some trepidation, okay, I'd give it a try. As a writer I was interested in how these guys reacted to writing, what they valued, what they questioned, and what they found that resonated in their own lives. I didn't foresee Homeland by Sam Lypsyte coming down the pike.This is a satirical novel that is firmly embedded in the culture it satirizes, i.e., cosmic New Jersey suburbia (New Jersey is the world, didn't you know that?). The trope--which is a fancy way of saying the hackneyed concept--has to do with a loser who was miserable in high school being encouraged to contribute notes to his high school class alumni newsletter. Our anti-hero, known unpleasantly as Teabag, is witty, perceptive, and hot on the trail of the hypocrites who somehow got up on him back then…and still do. The opening chapters read like a stand-up comic's endless act.So I put the book aside and came back to it when I'd simmered down. This seemed to make Homeland easier to take. Fragments of characters episodically matter and are not stereotypes. Some descriptive writing focused on the dead birds in the gutters and the armpit stink of someone's basement apartment bespeak a certain grisly humor. But who was it who wrote about quiet desperation? Ah, Thoreau again: """"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."" Here we have it; not as a lament, though, as a farce. This isn't a book about adolescence (and post-adolescence) as painfully honest as Catcher in the Rye. It certainly isn't a book as beautifully tragic as Billy Budd. It's a book disturbingly gifted in eliciting the jargon-filled, drug-induced, sexually-confused, ambition-craven qualities of our good old U.S.A., circa 21st century.So, hell, as it is by now clear, I finished Homeland, and as I anticipated, there was a semi-apocalyptic comeuppance at the end and, trope of all tropes, a squeak of sincere candor implying that all the rage, all the wrongs, all the schlock, all the betrayals, all the ferociously wound-up linguistic energy herein presented had to do with something hard to believe in anymore: love.Aha, so that's what this was all about? Well, not quite. To give Homeland perhaps an excess of credit, let me conclude by aligning it one more time with Thoreau: ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth."" Lypsyte, it seems to me, can't pull this book out of its nosedive on the very last page. One can see him edging in that direction with some of Teabag's wittticisms and actions in the final chapters, but if you're going to be a satirist, be one until the end. The world of Homeland is not a world of distorted, dysfunctional love; it's a world of lost souls living atomized lives of noisy, rather repugnant desperation.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 26, 2013","Jun 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/544046.Home_Land

One is Ben Jonson who is inconvenient because When you major in what is called ""English"" at college, certain inconvenient figures present themselves. One is Ben Jonson who is inconvenient because it is so much more rewarding and taxing to spend your time on Shakespeare, although Jonson also was a major dramatist during Shakespeare's day.Another inconvenient figure is William Blake, the poet often grouped with the ""Romantics,"" but clearly not one of them and a study unto himself, sui generis, one of a kind. If you're going to study Blake, you have to take him on whole and in extenso, not side-by-side with anyone.An easier figure of inconvenience in some ways, but deceptively so, is the titanic figure of Samuel Johnson (1709-1784). He's inconvenient because he was protean-a poet, a lexicographer, a critic, a dramatist, an essayist, a biographer, and some things I've not doubt left out--letter-writer, for instance.On top of all that comes the extensive biography of Johnson written by his young friend, James Boswell, which is either the best or the worst way to get to know Johnson.For decades I decided it would be the worst way to get to know him. The Johnson I spent most time on in college was Johnson the critic of Shakespeare. Having just taken a look back what I then read, my recollection proves correct: he was an uncommonly astute, forthright, plain-spoken critic. He points out all the plot flaws in Hamlet the play, for example, without diminishing the enigmatic genius of Hamlet the character for whom the play is known.Johnson wrote to be read and had either the self-confidence or temerity to believe that by criticizing Shakespeare for his flaws, he actually built up his strengths.But last week I decided to take on volume 1 of Boswell on Johnson, and now I've finished it, or perhaps I should say half-finished it because, to my surprise, it ends with a huge quantity of appendices and footnotes, and I have never in my life enjoyed reading appendices, footnotes, or introductions either by some notable editor or the author himself. In one case, Nabokov's Pale Fire, I know I've cut myself out of the fun, but that's pretty much the exception. My rule is that if it's important, it's in the text; if not, not…ignore it.The Johnson Boswell presents--and he presents him well--is exactly the sprawling figure who doesn't fit comfortably in any multi-author syllabus. He wrote for a living for decades, never stopped writing, and when it came to producing a one-author dictionary of the English language (a task for which the French or Italians would assign forty scholars), he would do that, too.He was Addison and Steele, a bit of Pope, a Boswell himself to many other authors, and something of a Dostoevsky in that like Dostoevsky he produced his own newspapers from time to time, writing the copy from first word to last.I don't recommend you pick up your very own copy of Boswell on Johnson unless it's been standing unread on your shelf since undegraduate days. Then perhaps you'll find value in considering the kinds of giants who once walked the earth and are very difficult to conjure in the present day.From childhood on Johnson read, recalled what he read, and formed astute opinions about what he read. He was a principal figure in the Age of Reason, but not an idealist, with one exception. His preferred mode of analysis was from the specific to the general. He thought that gave a truer, if less sweet, account of reality. Where he wandered into idealism, it seems to me, was in his Christianity. Flummoxed by mortality, unable to puzzle out its ultimate purposes, he happily enough left the hard work of determining why we are here to God.Today we have one literary figure who idolizes Samuel Johnson. That is Harold Bloom, who considers Johnson his guide and master. Multi-talented himself, Bloom does exhibit Johnson's astonishing erudition and productivity. Reading Bloom's book on Shakespeare, I recall, was like having an extended conversation with a better literary friend than I've had in person. I also recall how much the leading Shakespeare critics of our day hated what he'd written. Why? Because Bloom focused on character, because Bloom explored Shakespeare's language and worldview…because Bloom wouldn't bow down to the recent pseudo-scientific schools of literary criticism that have, pardon the pun, bloomed and wilted one after another over the last twenty-five years.What I like in particular about Johnson as Boswell presents him are the following:--He often took the opposite side of an argument not because it was his but for the fun of it;--He was a lifelong depressive, given to deep fits of dark despair;--He was a compulsive-obsessive: he never crossed a threshold with the wrong foot, and if he was about to, he retreated and took another shot at it;--He had the wisdom to observe that as you grow older, your friends die off, so you better make a point of getting some new, younger friends…and quick.--He was a loyal, generous, talkative, discursive friend;--He was a giant of his age and regarded himself as a pygmy;--He castigated himself for his unstructured reading habits…but made up for them by reading everything;--He was a big, disheveled, goofy guy with tics galore who cocked his head sideways when he was making a point and upon doing so sometimes had to huff and puff to catch his breath;--When he made a mistake, as he did in his definition of a horse's pastern, he attributed it to ""ignorance,"" and made nothing more of it, not defensive at all;--And he almost never shot back at someone who criticized him; he'd had his say, let them have theirs. (Never complain, never explain as Disraeli put it.)So all this is why I call Samuel Johnson inconvenient. He was a prolific genius who took literature seriously enough to give his life to it. In literary studies we won't really come upon someone like him until Coleridge in his later-life talkative mode. But when we get to Coleridge as undergraduates, as you'll recall, we group him comfortably among the ""Romantics,"" and we tend to ignore the inconvenience of his having continued to to busy himself with the philosophical dimensions of literature for decades after his poet's pen had run dry.For more of my comments on literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle). ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2013","Jun 25, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/688826.The_Life_of_Samuel_Johnson

It's a bound volume containing three long short stories and a concluding novella, ""A Love Child."" And with one exception, it's very, very good.The opening story, ""The Grandmothers,"" is a mischievous but persuasive piece of wickedness in which two close friends end up being the lovers of each other's sons. There's a cosy quality to this pseudo-Oedipal tale that envelops the sons totally. What could be better than a woman unhappy in her marrige whom you've known all your life, is still fairly young, and makes you feel rich and secure because she's yours without having had to go through growing up with her? The mistakes you might make as a lover are forgiven, the little things you ought to know are taught to you gently, and all in all, you're in the butter, home away from home.Of course other young women begin to intrude and the grandmothers (because that's what the original mothers become) have a sense of realism about this. They know, or persuade one another, that the fantasy can't go on forever. And this is interesting, too: the decoupling, the way one of the younger women traps one of the boys, and then, of course, the bitter denouement, which I won't spoil. The fact that ""The Grandmothers"" is set in South Africa, along the sea, helps. It's good scenery. There is (racial issues aren't a focal point) a quality of distant completeness about that world at that time; there's an underlying, unstated argument here that ambition isn't a central human need...if you're born in the right place across the street from the right woman.The next story, ""Victoria and the Steveneys"", is a story about a black Londoner who falls in with a white, culturally liberal family as a child--by accident, really--and then, as time passes, gives birth to a child by one of the younger family members...and then, as time passes, reveals the existence of this child and proceeds to lose her to the better-endowed, more energetic, irresistible white family. The contrast in life styles, attitudes, prospects, and moral grounding between all these folks is acutely presented. At the same time, the ""long story"" form, which I enjoy a great deal, provides most of a novel's impact in more concentrated style. Time passes, scenes unfold on artfully altered premises, the impetus and inevitabilty of the narrative catches you up, and the conclusion has that pungency one expects of Lessing. She's masterful. The comparisons would be Alice Munro of today and Henry James of yesterday's yesterday.Now I'll say something about ""The Reason for It,"" the third story. It doesn't belong in this collection. It's one of Lessing's fantasy or other-world fables, and it's sort of no good, a clunker: renaming disappointment and cultural decay and associating it with the spirit of legends takes us tritely nowhere. Lessing is strong-willed enough to have been the one who insisted this book is where ""The Reason for It"" would go. Frankly, I see no other reason for it to be here.Now, the longest piece, ""A Love Child."" This one is set in World War II. A young Englishman doesn't have any idea what he's being drafted into, misses all the good battles in Europe, sails wretchedly to India, and in a stopover in South Africa (Capetown), has a four day fling with a married woman who really was only trying to be a decent hostess to ""the boys."" He's smitten, she's more willing than she would have expected, her best friend is scandalized, and then the story goes on, as I indicated, to service in India, which is marginally better than captivity on a troop ship, but nothing like those four luminous days of shore leave in Capetown. This is where the genius of the ""long story"" or ""novella"" operates so wonderfully. Things happen to James that aren't really relevant to his passion for Daphne,but they become a kind of container for his passion, and we sense he'll return to it, and the novella permits this in stages: first, he makes his way back to England, then he arranges to marry someone he can't love as much as he loves Daphne (surprise, surprise), then he tells his fiance about Daphne and the child he's deduced emerged from their encounter (bigger surprise), then he goes to South Africa looking for Daphne, then, years later, he takes his wife (Helen) to South Africa looking more for his son than for his long-lost love. In summarizing the plot, I'm not doing justice to it. Again, you need the weight of events, distractions, irrelevancies, and time to explore its fullness.I'd recommend The Grandmothers as strongly as I'd suggest skipping the third tale. What a book this could be if it were a modest three tales. Lessing's insight into human psychology, her mastery of pace and plot, and her knowledge of the world are all of the first order. You live to love, you survive to hold onto that love, but you can't live or love forever: there's always some undertow dragging you out to sea, into war, into old age, or into a life, as Lessing proposes at a key point in ""A Love Child,"" that isn't really yours. Yours is something altogether private and apart with its distinctive quotient of pain.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Jun 19, 2013","Jun 19, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/400608.The_Grandmothers

Jack is the most prolific bank robber in American history, but he's a smiling, gentlemanly kind of bank robber, doesn't use a gun, just asks for the money politely. Cundo has graduated from pole dancing at gay clubs to drugs to sports booking to real estate and along the way become considered culpable for some deaths. Both crooks have cause to rejoice, however: Cundo has lots of money stashed away, a smart lawyer he puts at Jack's disposal for an appeal, and a hot girlfriend (Dawn) waiting for him in California. So it's early release. Jack gets out first and makes for California and discovers that what Dawn wants, after waiting eight years for Cundo to come home, is to deprive him of his millions...and maybe take off with Jack...or maybe with someone else who is just as helpful and comes cheaper.Elmore Leonard is a kind of cult writer with a broad following. I'm not a member of the cult. As far as I can tell, this kind of cult works as follows: a very normal guy with a gift for smart talk, quick dialogue, and imagining a certain kind of unseemly but compelling character affirms the latent fourteen-year-old in millions of men and furthermore validates the power, charm, and subtlety of dopey American culture.The nuances in this particular book are a bit threadbare. Cundo Reyes is a kind of Tony Montana (aka Al Pacino in the movie Scarface). He beats on his woman, he demands respect, he's generous to a fault to his friends, he drinks way too much, he likes sex his way, not some broad's way, etc., etc. This is what I mean by dopey.Jack Foley is something of an inverse Philip Marlowe. He's got a code of honor about not taking money he hasn't earned (now that he's finished robbing banks) and making sure Dawn (whom he beds) doesn't get over on Cundo when Cundo joins the scene in California. Like Marlowe Foley is thoughtful, not in a hurry, luckier than most in attracting women, and smarter than most in detecting scams, threats, and liars.The ""road dog"" idea is that the unlikely bond formed between Cundo and Foley in the slammer is inviolable. This is how road dogs regard one another, as blood brothers, or something like that. The pervasive and variegated criminal element populating this novel is efficiently deployed. Leonard once said, I believe, that the secret to a successful book is leaving out the part people wouldn't read anyway. He's not a minimalist, but he has discipline and a good sense of timing as far as moving things along.Providing Jack Foley with the restrained traits of nobility does give him a certain enigmatic appeal. He doesn't often take the easy way through things. The boorish Cundo is lacking in Tony Montana's psychopathic intensity, however, and Dawn? Well, how can anyone trust a woman more than his road dog from the slammer? You can't. Makes no sense. So keep an eye on her if you read this book. Would I recommend it? I probably wouldn't. At the same time, this is relatively recent Leonard, and I'm willing to entertain the idea that earlier in his career (he's written forty novels) he was providing stories that were more taut and tense--maybe even thrillers, as the dust jacket says.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 13, 2013","Jun 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5640796-road-dogs

There's not a story here that isn't masterful in a controlled, minor-key kind of way, as befits the sensitivity and vulnerability of his characters.These characters tend to be Irish women of heterosexual persuasion or Irish men of homosexual persuasion. Perhaps persuasion isn't the right word. They do what they do because they are who they are; no one persuades anyone otherwise.A characteristic Tóibín setting involves a lonely homosexual man confronted with the death or demise of an elderly female relative...and a degree of longing for times past when Ireland was a brighter, simpler, more attractive place. Dublin here isn't grand to look at; it's hard to take, modernized in a crusty, cheap, run-down way. But the Irish people, despite the prototypical and perhaps autobiographical protagonist's alienation, retain a folkish intimacy, some old ways, some delicacies that compensate for the dreams of youth turning into the disappointments of maturity.One of the finest moments in the earlier stories--the title story, in fact, ""The Empty Family""--comes at its end. A man who has returned to a place that fills him with ambivalence happens to fixate on a view of the distant sea and its ongoing mysterious chaos, endless and purposeless but unyielding. As a metaphor for the story as a whole, that image is perfect.An extremely complex and sharply written story, ""The Pearl Fishers,"" focuses on a gay man encountering a boyhood lover who has now settled into a conventional marriage with a fiery, self-dramatizing wife. The protagonist fences roughly with the sanctimonious wife and demonstrates flinty indifference to her ongoing religious preoccupations. She's a user. She took up with and used the protagonist's boyfriend, who doesn't mind being used, but she's not getting her hooks into the protagonist.At some point Tóibín spent a lot of time in Spain, where I, too, lived for four years. So three stories focus on Barcelona and Minorca. The least effective story, a sexual coming of age tale, keeps the alienated Irish wanderer theme alive. The most effective stories, ""The New Spain"" and ""The Street,"" focus respectively on a young woman returning to Spain after Franco's death and on a Pakistani man's attempts to make his way forward among the watchful Pakistani community in Barcelona. ""The New Spain"" is a tour de force of insight into how hardheaded, willful, practical, and passionate Spaniards can be. The characters are all Spaniards, and you'd think, really, a Spaniard wrote the story. One of the things that holds Spain together is its intimate attachment to its grudges. Tóibín has this down perfectly. ""The Street"" explores a world within the world of Barcelona you wouldn't expect: a place where Pakistani's rule and know how to keep the faith with their faith while keeping out of trouble with the Spaniards, or, as a resident of Barcelona would tell you, the Catalans, who live in Spain and are only technically or marginally or legally Spaniards, not Spaniards in their hearts.The last book I read by Tóibín, a novel called Brooklyn, is more constrained than this collection of stories. Brooklyn has a fascinating turn-of-events for an ending that's fully justified by its opening movements. These stories are consistently sharper, more perplexing, and provocative.

The title of the book, Blue Nights, refers to an atmospheric effect Didion associates with the latitudes of New York City: ""approaching and following the summer solstice, some weeks in all, when the twlights turn long and blue...the actual light is blue, and over the course of an hour or so this blue deepens, becomes more intense even as it darkens and fades...""That's not a bad metaphor, in fact, it's a good one, for the protracted melancholy of this book. You lose a beloved husband, you lose a beloved adopted daughter, still in her youth, you come down with ""frailty,"" or, more specifically, ""shingles."" Blue's the word. Night's the word. And yet, if you're Didion, you manage to write, you manage to lay bare disturbing memories and fears, you manage to pack a lot into a short book, and you achieve a certain poetic effect by that quirky habit of hers, repeating key phrases at transitional moments in the narrative that take you back to the precursors of that moment and make the transition even bigger than it is.A good part of Didion's mental apparatus can be found in this quirk. She insists, in vain, that there ought to be connections between one thing and another...if only we could find them...if only we could force them on reality and make reality cough up its perverse secrets. You lived in a house you should never have left, ergo, you die 15 years later. You lived in California but now live in New York and yet you still call yourself a Californian, which is a little bit of a lie, ergo, you are not in line with the latitudes and longitudes of your own existence, your personal GPS isn't working. Which is it? Who am I? Am I the woman who adopted the child? Did I raise her or watch her raise herself? Where was she really herself and where was I really myself and am I still that self and is she really really dead? No...of course, not...no to everything...none of this can be true...I, Joan Didion, have studied and reflected on all of it, and as a writer, at the very least, it's my judgment that my life, which has turned out this way, really hasn't turned out this way. Just another story. Something someone made up. So why can't I turn the page?Recently I read The Year of Magical Thinking in which John Gregory Dunne really dies and for Quintana there seems to be some hope (she ultimately died from the effects of blood clots on her brain, but it took a long, long time.) I think that book is somewhat more effective than this one. In this one, by Didion's own admission, she is running out of gas. She writes more sentences that are questions than ever before. She pushes at happenstances and coincidences with an almost nagging quality, the undertone being (understandably, of course) ""I don't like this...and I don't like that...and I really don't like that!""Who does? The portrait she presents of Quintana Roo is one of an always thoughtful, preternaturally perceptive girl who is worried by her fear of abandonment...something Didion supposes worries all adopted children because they were, after all, abandoned into a different loving family...and maybe some day they will be abandoned out of it.This may be so, but there's also a quality of defensive neurosis in Didion's presentation of herself. She takes some issue with the notion that Quintana, who had a lot of trouble in life, somehow had a privileged upbringing. Well, her mother and father made good money as writers and had sensational, talented, famous friends in the movie world, and they stayed in a lot of plush hotels...and that's sort of privilege.Beyond that, her parents clearly loved her, desperately. But even so, in a moment of reflection with which I profoundly disagree, Didion asserts that ""...everyone who has ever waited to bring a baby home thinks it: what if I fail to love this baby?""This is just not true. It may be true for some parents, and there certainly are some parents who don't want their children at all; but I'm pretty sure the majority of parents don't have any doubt about loving their babies. They're in love with them from the moment of birth, and this is an altering experience: when you become a parent, you grow into a larger person, you expand, you may have practical and recovery issues, and frustrations, and financial fears, but you also have this beyond-yourself commitment to life that you didn't have before birth or adoption.I wouldn't take issue with Didion's statement if it were confined to her personal situation; I could sympathize, but in a universal context, it's untruth may point to the air of doubt and uncertainty that has long been Didion's strength as a writer and pershaps, in another sense, her qualms as a person.To back off a bit, I also want to say that I think it's a deep mistake to judge someone else's efforts or approach to parenting. It's pretty clear that Didion and Dunne were wonderful parents. She may have some fun mocking hyper-parenting (the fellow who, for instance, took a year off to help his daughter get into the right college), but in terms of sensibility, having a perception into and curiousity about everything, Didion and Dunne were life-giving parents. Nothing to be defensive about. They were super-smart, super-engaged, and their lovely girl had as rich an experience on this earth as one can have in twenty-some years.

Afterward he also suffered from tuberculosis, but the focus of the novel is on booze and Birnham's unstinting efforts to obtain it, eluding the good intentions of his younger brother Wick and his female friend Helen.The setting is New York City. We're in the 30s. One of those claustrophobic apartments with small closets, a small kitchen, bedrooms just for sleeping, and a living room with a record player and some books. For much of the novel, that's where we stay, although there is a fantastic scene entailing Don racing up 2nd Avenue where he hopes to find a pawn shop to hock his typewriter (not on Yom Kippur, however) and another fine scene in the alcoholics ward of a public hospital and finally a great hallucinatory sequence that ends up in a bloody struggle between a nonexistent bat and a nonexistent mouse.For anyone who has ever had too much to drink, or who has had a friend or relative who is an alcoholic, this is a novel that's almost too vivid to take. In fact, I'd venture that a lot of people today would put it down. The literary problem has to do with both sympathy for the protagonist, which is hard to muster, and current understanding of alcoholism.Don Birnham could be an appealing figure. He's educated, well-traveled, and clever, but here's the rub: an alcoholic is not really a person. The mind of an alcoholic may function, but it's not in control. The addiction--like most addictions--runs the show and becomes a kind of body-mind, almost moving without the individual's say-so. I'll go further: the body-mind does in fact move without the mind-mind's say-so. Once in spell of recovery F. Scott Fitzgerald (a hero to Birnham for good literary reasons) asked someone if he had just picked up and swallowed a glass of gin. He was told he had. He didn't know he was going to do it and he didn't know he did it. That's alcoholism. At a certain level of chronic alcohol abuse, an individual like Don will steal, pawn, beg, lie, betray, hide...do anything to make sure the booze remains available.And then he will drink. The quantities Don consumes during this weekend are astonishing, but not incredible. An alcoholic can and will down quarts of whatever in a day. Quarts! He will, as Don does, knock back six drinks in an hour. He will, as Don does, empty every empty bottle one last time for one last drop, although he doesn't employ the trick many alcoholics know well: you hold an empty bottle under running hot water; this produces an extra drop or two.Don can remember love for his mother, his home town, works of literature, music and film. He's gifted in these memories. I doubt, however, that the regnant consciousness being portrayed--other than the venal cunning--is actually Don's. It's Charles Jackson's in full and painful recollection not only of his bad times as an alcoholic but of his good times.Two of my friends in adolescence were alcoholics by their early twenties. I saw one drink a full bottle of vodka in twenty minutes. We sent him off in an ambulance. Another visited me in Baltimore and we headed out for a bookstore. He asked if we could stop in a bar. It was 11 a.m. I said okay. He had a beer. Halfway into his beer he told me that he had been desperate for that beer since 8, when he woke up, and his life was nothing but the next drink. He was 22. Recently, he said, he apparently had flipped his prized Toyota Celica and awakened in a garage where it had been towed. No memory of any of this. Another beer. He was calm enough for the bookstore now. He like most of the books I liked. Then we went back to a bar. I still didn't want anything to drink. The stratagems and rationalizations of the alcoholic are only superficially what the alcoholic is about. The core issue is the horrific impersonality of the overwhelming addiction. Some people evidently are more vulnerable to this than others; sometimes a core difficulty earlier in life is the trigger; sometimes the difficulty would appear to be genetic.In years past, alcoholism and drug addiction have been associated with creative personalities. There has been talk of ""fire in the brain,"" or so much pain in the heart that the artist must douse it with one kind of sedative or another. We can list Fitzgerald,, Faulkner, Poe, Coleridge and countless others as examples of this school of thought. The long-lived, long-productive counter--examples get left out. Henry James wasn't an excessive drinker, nor was Tolstoy. We know nothing about Shakespeare as a person, but I would wager that he drank early in life and gave it up. No one could write King Lear or The Tempest in his cups.As I read The Long Weekend, I thought that the story of an alcoholic was being fabulously well-told from within Don Birnbaum's humiliations but no story about an alcoholic should be about the alcoholic himself; it should be about the people stuck with or trying to help the alcoholic. We get some of this in the form of Don's frazzled brother and stoic lady friend. We do not get, however, to the cruelest moment in personal entanglement with an alcoholic,the moment when you tell him or her it's over: another drink and I'm done with you, another drink and I have no hope for you; another drink and you're dead to me because I'm moving on.The actual crises of the chronic alcoholic of the binge or constant variety are true sufferings, but the deepest cut and moral challenge befalls the outsider in taking the ultimate moral step of saving the lost soul by banishing it...ceasing to enable it...shutting down all sympathy and love because that's what the alcoholic needs and that's what the enabling outsider needs for either of them to survive beyond alcohol's grip.The Lost Weekend had a strong impact and Jackson went on to write a few more books of varying success before his addiction and TB combined to break up his late-life marriage and erratically reborn career. The book remains relevant even if it is medically somewhat off-the-mark, focusing more on the personality than the physiology. That said, we are living in an era of binge drinking at college that is no different from what Jackson describes, and this binge drinking goes on into the twenties and thirties and sometimes beyond. I always wince when I see a particular ad for alcohol that ends with the sweet warning, ""Drink responsibly!"" At best this is just alcohol venders trying to make sure they don't kill the goose that laid the golden egg. At worst it's hypocritical advice from friends who are no one's friends but their own.

The narrative goes on to lament the horrors of four years of trench warfare between the contending parties until European exhaustion and a more active American involvement put a temporary end to it. Then Germany was sent a bill for damages that was so high its economy spun out of control, setting the stage for Hitler to take over and initiate the WWII which begat the Cold War which begat the Korean War which begat the Vietnam War and dozens of other wars and violent struggles too numerous to list.	Barbara Tuchman’s classic, The Guns of August, is sometimes woven into this narrative. I’m not sure that’s fair to her. The Guns of August does study the chain of events that led to WWI, beginning with the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, but her book makes painfully clear that if Imperial Germany had not found its casus belli in the Balkans, it would have found it elsewhere, and soon.	The paradox of Germany at the time is one that haunted the twentieth century and continues to impact the twenty-first century. Imperial Germany was homeland to great universities, great artists, great literary traditions, and great music. It was more than solvent. It possessed, unjustifiably, something called East Prussia, which was separated from Germany by Poland. It had trounced France in 1870. Its industrial power was immense. And yet the Kaiser and his cadre found all this success to be a kind of insult: if Germany could do so much, why could it not absolutely and utterly dominate Europe? Why couldn’t it have puppet governments in France, Belgium, Poland, Italy, etc? Why couldn’t it draw on colonial riches in proportion to Great Britain’s exploitative empire?	The story here seems to be that the political class was much less successful, in its own mind, than the economic, scientific, and cultural classes, and so the political class of Germany made a fateful decision. It would use its arrangements with wounded Austria to begin a great war against Austria’s friends, and it would compound this error by marching through neutral Belgium--bringing global opprobrium on itself--and simply crush France...before it turned back to the next problem, which would be Russia rushing its way from the East.	The Guns of August is a wonderfully detailed, complete account of what ensued over the first month of WWI. It relates Germany’s success in initial combat with an incompetent, ill-prepared Imperial Russia, and it relates Germany rampaging through Belgium, whose neutrality was an historic keystone of peace in Europe, as it threw its armies into France.	France wasn’t ready for this. Yes, it had been hearing things out of Berlin, and Great Britain (also not prepared) had been hearing the same, but there was no immediate justification for Germany’s action. It was said the German military attaché wasn’t being well treated in Paris. There were Gulf of Tonkin-like charges that France had dropped some bombs or fired some shells into Alsace-Lorraine (which Germany appropriated for itself after defeating France in the war of 1870.) Nonsense. Germany wanted war and got it, and as Tuchman’s book makes clear, Germany would have imposed war reparations on its victims just as severe as its victims ultimately imposed on Germany.	What no leader knew on either side was that advances in technology would make a multi-year struggle possible and inevitable. At the outset, all leaders were hoping for a nice four month conflict, and then back to your corners, gentlemen. The thought was then, and remains so today, that economic interdependence was so great that a protracted war would be unthinkable.	The heart of Tuchman’s book has to do with the politicians, generals, and battles wrapped up in the events of August 1914. Germany, which almost took Paris, clearly comes out a loser in this tale. Belgium, which was ravaged, comes out a winner for the resourceful leadership of King Albert. The British? In the fumbling, cowardly, duplicitous person of its commander in chief of British expeditionary forces in France, Sir John French, Britain comes off as almost criminal in its unwillingness to help France deal with the German hordes (colorfully referred to as the Uhlans at the time). The French, held together by the enigmatic but fearless General Joffre and the steely General Gallieni, are portrayed as strategically misguided but courageous, resilient, and rightfully proud	There are dozens of character sketches in this book that are full of the “fog of war.” Communications were imperfect, egos clashed, intelligence was right but ignored and wrong but credited, and so forth. Tuchman does nothing whatever to claim that WWI was a unique bungle, an anomaly. Not at all. She simply reports, sometimes acerbically, the facts. And yet, to return to my opening theme, we have inherited this legend about WWI that it was a very special mishap and miscalculation--a damned war that didn’t settle things and had to be fought all over again.	I have a few thoughts on that. First, it’s clear than when Germany couldn’t have its way under a kaiser, it was just as happy seeking its way under a dictator. Once again Germany had built itself up--admittedly, partially through illegal rearmament--and wasn’t satisfied with the results. I don’t see a hypothetical settlement to WWI that would have made WWII unthinkable. Germany might not have been saddled with Versailles-scale reparations, but the wound in its psychic flesh was there, and the loss of resources would have been large in any case. Once the calculating but very wise Bismarck had put Germany together, this collection of principalities, kingdoms, city states and so forth was destined to cause trouble in the twentieth century, and its appetite for such misadventures would have to be dealt with root and branch. No power could really do this to Germany at the end of WWI, not that they didn’t try. The United States and the Soviet Union had to emerge in their fullness in WWII to achieve that end.	Second, I don’t know of many wars in the last 110 years that haven’t been exercises in brutality, folly, petty competition among generals, miscommunication, political lies, half-baked intelligence and cynical rationalization. Because it was such a nightmare in the trenches, WWI probably stands out more than it should as an example of the wrong war to fight. There aren’t many right wars to fight, and from the outset there’s seldom a right way to fight them.	Third, Germany having had its military aspirations and feathers trimmed, has focused on economic activity for decades now. And once again it’s a colossus in Europe, the key voice in addressing the EU’s ongoing economic woes. For this Germany is frequently criticized, but it has done a good job economically, and I don’t fault it. I lived in Germany for three years and saw firsthand Germany’s smart labor-management approach, environmental sensitivity, and financial prudence.	Fourth, if you have to fight, fight to defend yourself. Don’t fight preemptive wars (like Iraq, or, in the future, Iran). And don’t spew cant about pursuing a policy of the just war. All wars are unjust to someone.	Fifth, recognize that the power to make war resides in the hands of elites who are not engaged in the same kind of productive achievements as the rest of the population. Remind those elites that most of them are older men who, if they ever fought, will never fight again. Encourage them to not rely on the military as their own shield and emblem. Presidents shouldn’t go to military bases to talk about national security issues more than they go to civic gatherings, universities, business associations and other entities that are not, in effect, captive audiences. The U.S. national conferences of mayor or governors probably wouldn’t provide great audiences for a president explaining air strikes against Syria or Iran. So start there. Try your pitch to people who command you, not to uniformed military you command.For more of my comments on contemporary writing and pubic affairs, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 02, 2013","Jun 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August

Marvin has no right in the world to demand that Bea drop everything and find out what's going on with his twenty-something son, Julian, in Paris. But that's what he does. And Bea subverts her summer trip a bit to accommodate his wishes. She gets nowhere. Throughout the novel Bea plays a role analogous to Strether in Henry James's The Ambassadors. She is a diplomat reaching out to and trying to understand not only Julian, but Julian's wife, Lili; Julian's sister, Iris; Marvin's estranged wife, Margaret; and Bea's own ex-husband Leo. Her job is to moderate family passions and alienation and assist Marvin in keeping, ultimately, both of his children from sliding back into the maw of Europe that his and Bea's parents and grandparents' escaped at great cost. Initially Marvin is a caricature of a Jewish bully: My way or the highway. He comes on so strong that I winced, wondering if Ozick was simply unable to control the kind of figure that Bellow and Roth presented ably and often. But Marvin's role diminishes as the roles of the other characters grows. This is an entertaining novel because it moves from expository passages to letters to dramatized scenes as the need presents itself. The focus shifts among the characters. Even Bea becomes an ensemble player, although she's the heroine of the plot. In this way the story gets told efficiently and colorfully and tangents become structural supports for further plot and character development. Ozick's writing abounds in short sentences, exclamations, adjectives after adjectives, and questions, questions, questions. It also is utterly idiosyncratic, full of peculiarly apt but utterly novel formulations a reader has never before encountered but understands instantly. At one point someone who is upset feelings grinding under her heart. What grinds under hearts? Is there some lathe or sander or magneto in there I didn't know about? But Ozick would have it this way, and so it is this way. Here's another clumsy but effective sentence: ""Her spine felt drilled through; her brain still swarmed with fearsome dream-shreds retreating into oblivion."" Watch out for those dream-shreds! Take aspirin fast if you had such a bad night your spine feels drilled through! As the story progresses, it wears away at Marvin's outlandish pretensions and plans. His kids will live their lives, not his, which hasn't been that happy even if he's made a ton of money. And Bea's ex-husband somehow is made to produce a symphonic homage to Bea, something like a peace offering, despite the fact that Bea is utterly tone deaf. In other words, things become more human, more life-centered, more settled within themselves, not within inherited fears and suspicions. The quote Ozick uses from James's The Ambassadors at the outset suggests such goings on can lead either to becoming brutalized or becoming refined. With her quick wit, quirky style, and fast pace, Ozick has fun driving things in the direction of refinement.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 28, 2013","May 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8149149-foreign-bodies

There are two keys: First, Cahill's immense but easy erudition, how much he knows about the soft crumbling of ancient Rome into the darkness of the barbarians and the almost serendipitous way in which classical and church manuscripts became an Irish obsession. Second, Ireland's indescribable, ambiguous, playful, musical, dramatic history--which forces someone as wise as Cahill to move quickly from high point to high point and not pretend to document in detail what no one can ever know. Cahill's approach benefits greatly from the use of poem fragments (the Irish wrote as beautifully in 500 as they do now) and a focus on key actors, notably St. Patrick. I confess I never paid any attention to St. Patrick and regarded him as a semi-mythological species of leprecaun. No, he was a real man, woefully abused as a young fellow, who forged the first connection between the earthy Irish and Christianity. He was tough, he was loving, he was patient, he was tenacious. Through Patrick and successor men and women of the cloth, Columcille and Columbanus, to name just two, Ireland preserved the literary values at the core of the word ""civilization"" and extended them not only through Ireland but into Scotland and across the English Channel through northern Europe. These Irish prelates were admittedly subjects of the Bishop of Rome, or Pope, but lived and worked so far away, with so little communication, that they were the ones, not he, who invented the systems of monasteries, scriptoria, and sacred/secular co-existence that did so much to enable this book to live up to its title. One of the core elements in dispute between classically-based Christianity and the Christianity that emerged out of Ireland's drystone hermitages is familiar and enduring: reason versus nature. For the dominance of reason (and its connection to an abstract realm, the metaphysical) we can thank neo-Platonists of the Mediterranean. For the life-giving breath of nature, we can thank Irish monks and nuns who took the smell of peat, the light of day, and the intermingling of the sexes as somehow connected to humanity's ineluctable essence. In their hands, particularly on the pages of their illustrated manuscripts, Greek letters became both letters and…images, i.e., things that we understood as elements of grammar but also things that we saw as manifestations of nature's irrepresible fecundity. Cahill's book falls within a series he wrote connected as studies of the hinges of history. This is volume one. I'll read the others. He's on the side of the good guys: not the Romans, but the saints.

It didn't have to be that way, of course, but Florence has known all along that sex repels her (she profers playing the vioilin) and Edward, an honors graduate in history, has not understood her squeamishness and avoidence tactics during their courtship.The narrative focus initially is quite tight: dinner in the inn, the bedroom waiting. Then it expands in alternating chapters to develop Florence and Edward's backstories. There is a hint that Florence was abused by her father when she was a girl, but if she doesn't quite know it (having blocked the exprience to a degree), it's not clear to me the reader should know it. I'd guess it probably happened, but neither the events nor the father is fully developed.Of course that would explain a lot, but in the final battle, ""frigidity"" presents itself. That seems to be Edward's conclusion, at least, and Florence appears resigned to live with it, too.That final battle is a good one, full of the accusations, hopes for reconciliation, critical moments when things could go either way, and self-disgust that generally goes into fights between the sexes.At certain points I thought, in fact, that fighting would wake these two up. Edward isn't much more experienced than Florence and could certainly use a good shaking. But he doesn't realize that until, in the final passages, the narrative sweeps him forward through the 60's and he has a sad look back at an opportunity--many opportunities--annulled.The sweeping wrap-up may be this novel's one aesthetic mistake. The battle on the beach almost reads as untethered and real as D.H. Lawrence, but then we go into Edward did this, and Edward did that, and years passed. This more or less lets the air out of the final pages. Edward goes from an overwrought, deeply in love and deeply abused suitor to a guy who, like many guys, bedded women with ease in the following years. As such he's not nearly as interesting as when he was younger, more hopeful, more committed, and more vulnerable.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 24, 2013","May 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/815309.On_Chesil_Beach

Barofsky was a deputy U.S. attorney in New York when he was asked, though a Democrat, to become Special Inspector General for the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). He didn't want to accept; he didn't see himself in Washington; he didn't like Washington…but he was given a God and Country speech and he succumbed. For the next 18 months or so, he entered the bowels of the Treasury Department and the hallways of Congress, trying to ensure that the $800 TARP kitty did its job for U.S. taxpayers. He soon realized that Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and his successor, Tim Geithner, weren't focused on homeowners or taxpayers. Their concern was the likes of JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, CitiGroup, and so on. Economic historians will long debate whether this unstated focus was essential to preventing global financial collapse. But what's clear from Bailout, and lots of similar reporting, is that the little guy--Not Too Small To Fail--took it on the chin as the megabanks grew, their debts were honored, and their executives richly rewarded for soaking up Treasury's largesse in the form of gigantic bonuses. In one sense Bailout is a personal tale. Barofsky recounts being patted on the back and kicked in the shins; he retells stories of his Treasury and White House colleagues lying about him for political advantange; and he is open about his anger and disdain without losing his sense of humor. So this is a readable book, almost a fun book. But there are two additional dimensions of Bailout I would highlight. First, it's a pessmistic book despite Barofsky's wit and innate optimism. It takes us inside a huge financial crash whose origins have not yet been addressed. We are still at the mercy of banks and other ""nonfinancial"" institutions making risky, greedy bets that force us to save them or bring down the whole house of cards. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was supposed to address this problem didn't do so. The bad guys and their lobbyists won. Wall Streeters tell us that we may have been smart enough to see them with no clothes on a few years ago, but they're still better at forecasting the financial future than we are…lots better…despite all evidence to the contrary. So we should regulate them lightly and shrink them not a bit. Second, back in the days of the Cold War, there was a term, moral equivalence, that came up in the context of global debates about who was truly evil, capitalists or communists. I thought about that term last week as I sat through a presentation Barofsky made, recounting his early days as a prosecutor focused on Colombian narcotraffickers and then his latter days as an inspector general trying to combat misguided policies and outright crooks in the US financial sector (which has laundered a lot of drug money, by the way.) I asked him if he saw any equivalence between drug lords and Wall Street lords. He said no, the drug lords were violent beasts (true) and the Wall Street lords, while some were crooks and convicted for their crookedness, often were geniuinely persuaded of their patriotism, or at least not torturers and kidnappers. This was an equable response, a fair response, an indication that Barofsky could see different points of view, even when he was in disagreement. But I wonder about the misery and humiliation and family destruction experienced at the hands of Wall Street lords by millions of Americans. I've been in the room with both the tiny and the titans. The titans are not, as far as I've seen, four hundred to a thousand times more critical to the nation's economic welfare than average workers. They're not that much smarter. They're just lucky, crafty, and full of self-righteousness. A nonfiction book like this, when written from a personal perspective, provides lots of fiction-like insight. Bailout is a standout in this regard because Barofsky, by Washington standards, is one of the most open, unguarded truth-tellers I've come across (I've been in and out of Washington for thirty years). My favorite anecdote is Tim Geithner, who managed not to pay a few years worth of taxes due to a statute of limitations, being asked if he had made any mistakes in implementing the $800 billion TARP fund.  Geithner replied: ""The only real mistake that I can think of was that there were times when we were unnecessarily unsure of ourselves. We should have realized at the time just how right each of our decisions were."" Wow. Pure idiocy. Barofsky and others have documented in extenso Geithner's misjudgments, questionable maneuvers, and failed policies and programs. Guess Geithner was too busy being right to read about how wrong he was. Final note: We're a fabulously rich country. If $800 billion isn't well spent or on target or doesn't meet the needs of the hardest hit, I suppose we can survive. The deeper problem is moral. Can we survive the judgment of our leaders that shoring up out-of-control financial institutions and their obscenely compensated executives is more important than doing right by Main Street? Can we recover trust in a government that happily misleads us as its top officials prepare to scamper through the revolving door from Washington to Wall Street? And what about the permanent politicians in Washington who serve at the pleasure of the plutocrats? These realities are demoralizing; they erode the foundations of a strong democracy. Barofsky concludes that he wrote Bailout in anger. It's a good book. It hits hard. It tells the truth. But I still wonder about the moral equivalence question. How did we end up with not only banks that are too big to fail but also bankers too big to jail?

Dima's need: to reach British intelligence and defect, not from the USSR, but from the Russian mafia he is fatally associated with.Perry is a dissatisfied academic; Gail is a rising barrister. Neither of them is connected to British intelligence, but Perry hazards a guess that an Oxford associate might be able to put everyone together.Enter Hector, who leaps at this opportunity to catch a big fish and engineer payback within the ""Service."" He's been trampled, not enjoyed it, and now, in a semi-rogue fashion, he confirms not only that Dima knows incredible amounts about incredible sums being laundered worldwide but also that there is a pathway to extracting Dima (and his family) from the clutches of the Russian mafia dons (led by someone known as the Prince) who want to kill him.le Carré is a professional espionage writer who in this book, at least, shifts the focus of the ""Service"" from intelligence to crime fighting. The ironies, bits of tradecraft, hardened characters, long-lived rivalries of his earlier novels remain more or less the same, though.At the heart of such writing there's always a competition and it's not necessarily plot-related. It's a competition between proceduralism and character. Intelligence as le Carré portrays it is an elaborate sequence of getting things right; this is what moves the story more than the typical mix of iconoclastic spies, smarmy bad guys, and unwitting accomplices.As a consequence, Hector, Perry, Gail, Dima and others are somewhat forced. There's ""backstory"" to each of them, but it doesn't add up to three-dimensional characterization. Why? Perhaps because some features of character development are contingent upon characters in idle moments, adrift, floating this way and that. And in a spy or crime book you need to keep them pointed in a given direction which, again, le Carré works out according to the idiosyncracies of secrecy.Having said that, I did find the final passages, when finally released from bureaucratic purgatory, almost touching. A part of Dima that has been presented earlier in the book emerges with genuine pathos: he realizes that he is in the process of becoming what you might call a free prisoner.le Carré writes to entertain. He's not a moralist like Graham Greene. But he does do a lot with this theme of the free prisoner (my phrase, not his) because in the end, he seems to be saying, we're all such creatures. No matter how ingenious and persistent a rogue like Hector might be, or idealistic Perry might be, or perceptive as Gail might be, they all (we all) live in a world governed by the abstract collective behavior of vast, intertwined sectors that are called, for instance, bureaucracy, the economy, science, the Internet…impersonal, irritating, not always rational processes that in the 21st century are determinative.At one point in the novel, Hector's nemesis in the ""Service"" asks, ""So what?"" He means so what if there is a black world in which money gets laundered white, just as long as Great Britain and the City of London get their share of it when it's clean.Again, a Graham Greene would take this question, focus hard on the nemesis, make a psychological study of him in crisis, and give us a true lesson in darkness. Likewise Conrad or Dostoevsky. In le Carré's fictional world, the nemesis is asking a great question that's never answered; le Carré reduces motivation to bureaucratic revenge and criminal expediency. This is what separates someone as talented as he from greater literary talents. He entertains us, he may know enough about espionage and crime to engage us, but his descriptions of existential imprisonment in the modern era are more for fun than enlightenment.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 17, 2013","May 17, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7839766-our-kind-of-traitor

This novel could be called “magical realism” in that things occur that we know can’t occur and haven’t occurred and won’t occur, but that’s a tired term, and I’ll try to improve upon it in a minute.Here we have a boy known as Kafka who has a tutelary Crow Boy companion (who appears occasionally, not systematically) fleeing home as “the toughest” fifteen-year old on the planet, perhaps trying to outrun his father’s prophecy that he would kill his father, and sleep with his mother and daughter. Somehow in the dreamscape of a casually narrated story, these things happen anyway--in fact, Kafka’s flight from home seems to lead to them.In a parallel world, a man who can speak with cats, Nakata, is on the government dole having been rendered an idiot savant by a mysterious plane overflying Japan during WWII. He’s not real good at remembering things, can’t read, is pretty helpless, but he, too, dreams his way into Kafka’s world: he’s actually the one who kills Kafka’s father, a Japanese sculptor who isn’t well-developed in the novel but who, at the moment of his death, does a fine imitation of Johnnie Walker--you know, the logo figure on varying blends of scotch.Then there are mystery worlds, a mystery library, the phantom sister/mother who becomes Kafka’s lover, and a companionable truck driver named Hoshino, who ferries Nakata around, enabling him to open and close the entry stone guarding the dream dimension.All this undoubtedly has made for far too many academic papers probing the alternate realities Murakami proposes, name-dropping Kafka, Beethoven, a little bit of T. S. Eliot and a little bit of the philosopher Bergson along the way.The strength of this book lies in its sincere main characters, their confusion, their good intentions, and the lyrical encounters Murakami arranges for them.We are in contemporary Japan, we’re not altogether happy about that, we’d like to find a way out, Colonel Sanders (him too!) does his best to help us, and people do, sadly, actually die along the way.Does this add up to a great novel? I wouldn’t think so. Maybe it’s a pretty good one. I do suspect that the English translation I read (by Philip Gabriel) is more pedestrian than Murakami’s original Japanese, but since I can’t read Japanese, that’s only a guess. I just thought the prose was too often humdrum and somewhat clunky.A few years back I read Murakami’s short story collection, After the Quake, and found it forced in its emphasis on the meaninglessness of existence. This novel doesn’t read that way; the things it forces are forced for comic ironic effect, not tragic ironic effect.To take Kafka on the Shore quite seriously for one final reflection, I’d say this: Artists and their audiences live on the spiritual rumors that we hear in our minds and hearts but can’t quite pin down; they have faith that through the metaphors of art (including literature, of course) it is possible to capture and present a sense of reality beyond realism...and that that reality beyond realism is more important, more fundamental, than mere reality itself. I personally don’t think this has much to do with what is known as transcendence; I think it has more to do with the way the human psyche has evolved: it is full of rich, archaic, symbolic material. That’s what Murakami was shooting for when he wrote this book. He hadn’t given up on anything yet; he was still trying to suggest that we are more than we think we are as conduct our daily lives.For more of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 12, 2013","May 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore

So they need readers, and I plowed ahead for their sake, only mildly curious about how Brookner was going to sustain a tale going nowhere, thought by thought, worry by worry.The core of this story is that Paul Sturgis was an only child who never married but had modest success as a London banker and now, in retirement, doesn't know what to do with himself. He loses his last relative, Helena, who never meant much to him, and he is picked up, to a certain extent, by a younger woman, and he re-encounters an old lover, Sarah, who chucked him because he was too nice. And that's sort of it until the very end of the book when he realizes, in a Jamesian moment (or actually two such moments) that if he doesn't get out of London, he'll be the living dead for longer than he cares to ponder.The first Jamesian moment occurs when he's tending to his haggard old lover's twisted ankle: ""His hand remained on her ankle, in a gesture of appeasement. Instinct told him to breathe in a less compromised air, to get out, to walk as he was accustomed to walking, as if nothing could ever stop him. To stay any longer in this red room was to accept confinement, not merely to sympathize, but worse, to empathize, to mimic this fallen condition.""The second Jamesian moment occurs on the last page, so I won't quote it.The point is that Paul Sturgis finally realizes, in his seventy-fourth year, that he's never really made his own decisions or known what to do with freedom, always settled for reason when disturbed by irrational instinct, and had better get away from Sarah, the lover who chucked him long ago, at least a little bit. Paris might do it…and if not Paris, then somewhere sunnier further south.Henry James is referenced in this novel once or twice, likewise Proust, but the real influence, Philip Larkin, gets the most direct attention. Brookner writes: ""Home, as Philip Larkin memorably observed, is so sad.""Is it? Maybe in this book.Larkin, who had the personality of a prune or something more sour (let's also consider a lemon), occupies a fairly lofty place in 20th century British poetry that consistently surprises me, but I wasn't at all surprised to see him pop up toward the end of this gloomy novel. Gloominess, low expectations, emotional constipation, dreariness, the discomforts of alienation…these were Larkin's trademarks. Same thing with Brookner. Sometimes we're all in that kind of low mood, however, and that's ultimately Brookner's appeal. She matches up well with the depths of winter, rainy days, and the solitude of modern existence.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 03, 2013","May 03, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6063521-strangers

His wife, Helen, conducts a frantic search, involving both the Paris police and the U.S. Embassy, to find out what has happened to him. Part A essentially comes into play every other chapter of the novel.Part B of A Desperate Man recounts Richard Bittenberg’s upbringing in Charleston, S.C., his education at The Citadel, the University of South Carolina, and Harvard, his distinguished career as a professor of intellectual history, and his decision to involve himself in a conspiracy to assassinate the president and vice president of the United States and substitute for them a Speaker of the House of Representatives (constitutionally the third in presidential succession) who is friendly toward the conspirators’ point of view.The conspirators’ point of view is the foundation of this novel. Essentially the conspirators--scores of highly placed Washington movers and shakers across all fields--believe the United States is a corrupted, failing nation on the way down...fast.Their complaints are as follows: pointless, tragic wars; mounting national indebtedness; inordinate Wall Street influence; and a general belief that the United States’s moral and cultural integrity has been trashed and abused.This is not a Tea Party indictment in the sense that cutting back taxes and shrinking government would fix the mess in Washington. It is a broader indictment, classically conservative, which holds that America’s conspicuous consumption, reckless profiteering, and disregard for civic virtue and national traditions have put the country on the precipice of total disaster.As the novel unfolds, Helen Bittenberg has no idea how desperate her husband Richard has become or how deeply he has involved himself in the conspiracy. She doesn’t know anything about the conspiracy; all she knows is that one day in Paris, Richard disappeared.Richard, by contrast, knows everything about what’s going on in his life. He is steaming with rage at the ruination of the country he loves, and he is regarded by his co-conspirators as smart if something of an egghead. But he’s a dutiful member of the group, very impressed with its originators and leaders (men and women from the Federal Reserve, State Department, National Security Agency, Congress, the CIA and so forth.)I don’t want to go too far down the narrative path and spoil A Desperate Man for its future readers, but I do want to highlight a few of the troubling questions it raises.First, this novel focuses on killing the president and vice president, but “in real life,” we have recently seen the extent to which a recalcitrant Congress can thwart the Executive Branch short of assassination.Second, A Dangerous Man repeatedly advances the thesis that the decline of a nation is socio-cultural in origin. In other words, Hollywood, Wall Street, the universities, the churches, the Internet, and many other socio-cultural forces and actors ultimately will determine our fate more than Congress and the Executive Branch.This foregrounds some issues that seldom get attention in the media and national dialogue. What happens to a nation where the citizenry loses touch with core values like prudence, modesty, decency, neighborliness, and maintaining a good reputation? What happens to a nation where media violence and street violence are genuinely epic in character? What happens to a nation where a sense of entitlement lures middle-class couples into thinking they should have a really nice house as their first house--3,000 square feet, five bedrooms, family room, flat screens everywhere? What happens to a nation where the gap between wage earners and executives widens and widens and widens? What happens to a nation that doesn’t fight wars as a people but fights them on the basis of professional volunteers? What happens to a nation where the Congress can’t be bothered to exercise its constitutional right and obligation to declare war, but rather leaves that to the Executive Branch? Finally, what happens to a nation where the citizenry more or less just looks after itself, family by family, and lets the Big Boys run roughshod as they please?These questions underpin the news even if they don’t show up in the headlines very often. That’s where novels come in, dwelling on the dark side of social decay.Decay is a word that shows up repeatedly in A Desperate Man. It implies that once upon a time we were morally better, sounder of judgment, more cautious in action. That’s a debatable proposition, but it’s worth debating. Short of a senior level Washington conspiracy aimed at the president and vice president, most of what A Dangerous Man relies upon by way of national critique is well-documented. There’s cause for alarm and cause for discussion that goes beyond Republicans and Democrats posturing for political advantage on Capitol Hill and up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. A Dangerous Man pushes that alarm and discussion ahead in interesting and useful directions.For more of my comments on contemporary writing and issues, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 30, 2013","Apr 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17290189-a-desperate-man

Most people experience some form of obsessional thinking or compulsive behavior at some point in their lives; most people are inexplicably “good” at certain things and “bad” at others; most people have emotional blind spots and insensitivities; and most people think they see with their eyes, not their brains.Taken to extremes and concentrated in unique ways these qualities generate what Sacks and others call idiot savants, prodigies, autistic individuals and individuals who “suffer” from Tourette’s Syndrome.This is what Sacks writes about: extremes. Multiply your uncle’s quirky way of repeating what you say to him 100 times and you have someone who is manifesting echolalia. Think back on how many times you have returned to check on a door you know you’ve locked...imagine yourself doing this 100 times... and you’ve got compulsivity (the same thing goes with hand-washing, or certain phobias, or other species of irrational psycho-physical behavior).One figure in this book can look at a cityscape for five seconds, go to his apartment, sit down and drawn all the buildings he’s seen in that fast glimpse with astonishing accuracy. What he can’t do is engage in something that shows up in many of Sacks’s case studies: relate his subjective self to your subjective self. He is alone with his perceptions more than with his feelings. His inter-connectedness is not the same as most people’s.Another figure in the book obsessively paints, in excruciating detail, the village in Italy where he grew up 25 years ago. He sees that village in 3-D while working in his garage in California, and he’s got to record it from every angle and perspective, catching all the structural features and the way every stone “used to look.” When he revisits the village, the stones don’t look that way anymore and the village is just about dead. That’s hard on him. But after ten days shock, he returns to his old task: recreating the images of his childhood again and again and again.What are we to make of this? Again, I’d submit there’s some of it in all of us, and it’s fascinating. A surgeon with Tourette’s Syndrome crying out weird noises and tapping his head and clicking his heels and making funny faces...who becomes utterly focused and expert in the operating room? Not possible? Yes, possible...and interesting to encounter.Even more interesting is the implicit question Sacks’s scientific observations raise: are we, in our more “normal” feeling, subjective, integrated mode simply highly functioning animate conglomerations of matter...or is there some additive spirit or soul that pulls us together...while failing to do so for people who are autistic?I was somewhat astonished to read that Picasso said something to the effect that artists are made rather than born. If you look at his drawings from childhood, you’d think he was a born artist, but in comparison to the artistic prodigy known as Nadia, perhaps Picasso had a point.On the other hand, if Nadia and others could produce graphic gems at very, very early ages, wasn’t she born with this gift? And if she had the gift, don’t we all? And if we all have it, how could we summon it...or nurture it...or at least not suppress and ruin it through our conventional upbringing?The final essay in the book, “An Anthropologist on Mars,” focuses on the famous autistic scientist, Temple Grandin. What she possesses is immense technical and objective skill, an affinity for animals, and a great deal of confusion when it comes to “relating” to human beings. She doesn’t react to other people so much as try to figure them out; she does a pretty good job of it, but her emotional life appears quite constrained. For her there will be no lover, no children. There just won’t be. She knows she doesn’t get that kind of relationship, and she’s written it off.Again, if Temple can feel strongly about cows and pigs, and design mechanisms to improve their lives as they are fattened for death, but doesn’t feel quite so strongly about human beings, does she lack something soulful? Something most of us would not care to surrender to be as smart as she is?Sacks doesn’t have an answer for these questions other than to point out that humanity is not a homogenized, perfectly evolved unity...nor should anyone feel ostracized for possessing some gifts to such an extent, almost beyond comprehension, that they lack others.This is a very good book, definitely worth reading. It’s about human nature. It’s about us.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2013","Apr 23, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/64666.An_Anthropologist_on_Mars

I'll have to say this and get it out of the way so I can move on (against the tide, I'm sure, of many critics and readers): the book is overwritten. Banville is so talented and perceptive that his prose overflows its mark time and time again; there are some bad paragraphs and less than effective sentences as a consequence. Illustrating this with quotes, it seems to me, would be pointless. My suggestion is that you definitely read the book, but as you do, stop now and then and come to terms with your tense disquiet by reading a few lines aloud. Not all lines are overdrawn, far from it, but enough are so that you're sure to come to a few in a short period that strike you as just too much--too many adverbs, too many over-stretched similes, too many flat out obscure word choices.	Okay, enough of that.	The story basically is a lyrical memoir recorded by a rececently widowed middle-aged man that focuses less on his deceased wife than on memories of childhood in the beachfront community he used to visit as a child.	So this is a bildungsroman coupled infused with intimations of mortality.	Banville really does a splendid job coordinating his parallel narratives, and the story his narrator recalls of his first and second loves in that community are good ones, worth telling.	The high point, which is the low point, comes about ten pages from the end. There a pair of deeply interdependent twins take an action that is disturbingly eloquent-- a comment on life itself that I won't spoil for you.	The final ten pages contain one too many narrative revelations and they also are somewhat stiffened by Banville doing what he has managed not to do up to that point: he overtly ties things together, he brings the narrator down to life (or cuts him down to size), and thus winds the book up somewhat as Trollope would have: ""Now that I've told you the past, here's the future…"" 	I don't have any reservations about recommending The Sea, I just wanted to wave a few flags of caution.

This is a fable-like novel in which Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born without a family to care for him but possesses one strange unnatural gift: he can smell everything and remember what he smells and distinguish between smells. Effortlessly. With this gift, Grenouille inevitably becomes a perfume-maker…and a murderer because he devises ways in which to steal the scent of young maidens and distill them into a fragrance that turns the world's moral order upside down but he must kill young girls to do this.	Interested? This is a compelling book, learned in the arts of perfume and the odors of Paris. The rank, unwashed life humans led in the 18th century (and before) takes Grenouille from infancy through a bizarre, Zarathustra-like seven years hiding on a mountain top to his final crop of murders and then, because he has small flasks of essential innocence with which to douse himself, being set free, being worshipped, and finally, in a wonderful scene chopped to pieces by riffraff who take him for an angel.	Perfume is a story-teller's book…one thing follows another…characters intersect Grenouille's life and learn to regret it…the tale moves on…attempts to interpret him or outwit him fail…he is a psychological cipher, in a sense, because his spectacular olefactory gift is a kind of Kantian category: within the realm of certain smells, one will do this…or that…not because of metaphysics but because of the aesthetic compulsion ultimate scents mandate.	Perfume is just intriguing: wicked, not in the least tongue-in-cheek and yet, of course, obviously fabulist in its core. 	The final chapters, wherein Kafka and the Grand Inquisitor seem to breathe life into the fatal action, are models of twists, turns, surprises, logical reversals, and illogical passions.	This wasn't a book on my ""to read"" list. I knew Süsskind's name, not much more.

My reasoning was as follows: Sacks's book offers a neurologist's explanation for almost any imaginable religious phenomenon. In effect, where God is concerned, the human brain can do it all: hear voices, see angels, receive instructions, imagine the unimaginable.	Sacks did not set out to prove that God doesn't exist, but it's difficult not to draw that conclusion from his survey of humankind's hallucinatory gifts and brilliance.	James's book, by contrast, is a famous analysis of religious experience from the psychological--and, I would add, humanistic--viewpoint. He, too, was an eminent scientist, but I suspected, correctly, that he would offer a ""beyond-neurological"" account of religion.	The Varieties of Religious Experience began as a set of twenty lectures given in Scotland (James was a professor at Harvard at the time). It's clear that if the audience followed him as he worked his way through the various dimensions of religiousity, it was because in the early 1900s there were no movies, no Internet, no Netflix, no MP3 players, etc., to offer alternative modes of entertainment. And then, of course, you had the tough Scots ready to put up with almost any test of their patience and intellect. Taking all these factors into account, it's possible…but only possible…that James offered his listeners twenty good nights out on the town.	This is a strenuous book, a demanding book, but a rewarding one. I would think it could be used as a fundamental text in a college course on religion. The subject is approached from the point of view of faith, conversion, philosophy, saintliness, mysticism…and yes, even neurology.	Keeping in mind when James wrote this book helps when we ponder his fundamental conclusions:	--Faith in a divine entity emerges out of a relocation of an individual's energy from his/her conscious mind to his/her subconcious mind.	--The acquisition of faith can come from being born into a family of faith or, just as likely, a realization that one's little self (conscious mind) is inadequate to live a good, healthy life.	--It's impossible to ""prove"" that a divinity exists or does not exist, but we can assess a divinity's reality by the utility that divinity offers the faithful.	--Excitability, or a passionate nature, disposes one to the extremes of purity, self-sacrifice, and asceticism found in the saintly…and the mystical.	--""Healthy-mindedness"" was the term James used to describe religions that served as precursors to what we now broadly term ""I'm Okay, You're Okay.""	--Protestantism will never be able to compete with the aesthetic glories of Roman Catholicism or offer solace equal to that provided by weekly confessions.	--Many great religious figures--St. Augustine, Luther, Tolstoy--came to their faith out of self-disgust…and never quite surrendered that self-disgust.	I could go on in this vein since it's a longish book, but there are a few more general points I'd like to make about it. Consistent with his scientific mind, James made constant use of testimonials, statements, confessions, etc., describing aspects of religious experience. In other words, he felt that given the subjectivity of religous experience, private, personal commentaries were indispensible in really understanding what religion was all about.	James also was modest in his philosophical and intellectual pretentions, although he surely was one of the most erudite scholars of his time. He looked at experience inductively, case by case, wherever possible, and he did not force unities where they could not be discovered. 	This, of course, put him somewhat at odds with the fundamental quality of faith in that faith pretends to, or expresses, a sense of cosmic unity.	Two major issues confronting Americans in terms of religion in today's world occur to me:	--First, religions of subjective happiness and well-being and a sense of permanent contact with permanent love must be severely challenged by what we see around the globe, through jet travel or in the media. Setting wars aside, consider the fact that there are hundreds of million people who live on about a dollar a day. A God who doesn't push the well-off to work harder at relieving misery is a God who isn't pushing the well-off very hard. Our subjective experience and consciousness has changed since James's time, after all. We see everything, we hear everything, we need to pay attention to everything.	--Second, James was quite prescient in noting how religions can lead to extremist views, dogmatism, discrimination and persecution. He uses the old-fashioned word ""excitable"" in a way that seems inadequate to describe the furies of jihadism or anti-semitism or Hindu rejection of Islam. Nonetheless, he's very good in highlighting the dangers of certainty. 	Again, James was a scientist and a pragmatist. He was suspicious of universals, but he was incredibly eloquent in offering a comprehensive account of what it feels like--and feeling is so critical to religion--to believe in a connection between an individual soul and the cosmic soul…if such a thing exists.

He made it in my kitchen in the mid-90s in Germany to prevail in a discussion with my then ten-year-old son about the disposition of optical nerves in octopi. This tells you a lot about Oliver Sacks and Nick. I would suppose Sacks was right, but Nick wasn't having it. He'd looked into the question and Nick could see Oliver, as he called him, was all wrong, or at least part of him was wrong. Neither would give in. They stayed at it all through the breakfast my wife served them, Oliver being in the house because my wife had arranged for Oliver to have his morning swim, about which he was fanatical.Now…to Oliver's latest book, Hallucinations. It's not the best book as a book because it is a kind of compendium. As such, it is doesn't present marvelous mysteries that are solved or a grand story that is revealed. What it does it anatomize the species of hallucinations we human beings experience: we hallucinate when we suffer Charles Bonnet Syndrome, when we are in drug withdrawal, when we are about to die, when we have lost a limb, when we have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, when we have consumed hallucinogenic drugs, and when we have conditioned ourselves to be susceptible to visions, voices, and the presence of others, sometimes an ""other"" self, who is passive or relatively autonomous. Oh, I forgot epilepsy. Can't do that.But Hallucinations is an important book because it sysnthesizes all these ways in which we experience that which does not occur because of the way parts of our brain interact. Let me offend some of you: there is no God, there are no ghosts, there is no phantom limb, there are no witches, no patterns in gold and blue on the surface of your mind…or actual voices…or actual fingers on your back…or most of what we categorize as religion, magic, the supernatural, or the inexplicable.Time and again Sacks points to a study that demonstrates these phenomena are brain-based. They are not ""imagination,"" which is voluntary; they are involuntary. They ""happen,"" but they are as remote from reality as the eyes are from sight. Didn't you know that the eyes don't see? The brain does.I had hoped Sacks would find a direct link between the artistic imagination and the ""other world."" Nope. I sit here at this desk every day imagining things without really knowing how as I write fiction, but I am not recording, if I may put this awkwardly, experienced experience.William Blake apparently did experience such experience and write it down, but most folks who do are not artists, they are normal people….lots of normal people. If you add up all the populations Sacks cites as susceptible to hallucinations, you will find yourself included. At some point you will have seen or heard or felt something outside yourself that had no basis in fact, only in your brain. You will have had an out of body experience, or you will have heard a voice, or seen a loved one, long dead, in the garden. Sacks goes into all this: it's not a matter of will or reality, it's a matter of how your brain expresses enigmas and offers you modes of intepretation.I can tell you, with relative surety, that neither Nick nor Sacks believes in the epiphenomenonal sparks of fiery vision cast off by the common brain. There is no logical reason not to believe God is behind all this. Really, He could have been, He may have been. But more likely we are experiencing the peculiarities of brain-based phenomena.If you deprive someone of sleep, of physical contact with the world, of someone to talk to, of sight, or many other common things…that someone is likely to hallucinate. This is why, in my opinion, torture and extreme stress are dubious interrogation techniques. You can drive someone ""crazy"" but what he tells you in that state won't stand up in court...or shouldn't.I don't want to underplay the power of hallucinations. They are not to be lightly taken. I have a friend who served in combat in Vietnam. From 1968 to today, 2013, he has not slept more than twenty or thirty minutes without being jolted awake by what happened to him almost fifty years ago. Think about that.Last week President Obama announced a $100 million initiative to map the brain, or some such thing. Not enough money. Really. Not nearly enough. The virtue of Sacks' book is that it points out the multiple ways that the brain duplicates and disdorts reality. Because of the brain, I might see witches, angels, demons, and octopi eyes some day.This is worth considering…and reading.For more of my comments on contemporary thought and writing, see Tuppence Reviews(Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Apr 07, 2013","Apr 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330771-hallucinations

It began with Didion's daughter, Quintana, succumbing to septic shock and near death (originally a case of the flu took Quintana down this path). Quickly thereafter Didion's husband of forty years, John Gregory Dunne, dropped dead of a heart attack while Quintana was still in a coma. Then, after Dunne's funeral and Quintana's shaky recovery, Quintana suffered life-threatening brain injury due to blood clots from her legs reaching her head.This memoir could easily be titled Denial because at its heart that is what Didion's magical thinking consisted of: she incessantly replayed memories and scenes and ""what ifs"" in such a way that these horrible events didn't happen…or she used her limited powers of concentration to devise ways not to think about them…or she blanked out totally, lost track of things…or she closed herself in her bedroom and cried.The substance of the book is twofold. First, there are the medical events themselves, reported with Didion's well-known terse precision, researched and reduced and presented with complete clarity: what happened, why it happened, when it happened, what the doctors did or did not do, what others around Didion did to help her, what Didion did to try to cope. Second, there is an extended if episodic memoir of a marriage that included adopting Quintana at three days of age and was a great marriage--intimate, collaborative (they were both writers, they sometimes wrote screenplays together), sometimes quite lucky, sometimes not so lucky, but always committed to one another and one another's thoughts and impressions, which they shared incesssantly.The book achieves its effects in certain ways worth noting. As mentioned, Didion is a precise writer who documents what she writes and gets things right. Beyond that, Didion links events and memories at singularly appropriate moments. And then there is the question of style. In Didion's case style heavily leans on a fine rhetorical quirk: she isn't affraid to repeat introductory clauses to three consequtive sentences…""If this were true,…. If this were true,…. If this were true,…"" She doesn't caracicature herself as Hemingway and Lawrence sometimes did. Her writing isn't mannered, but it does bite into something and not let it go until she's really finished with it. I liked that. I liked the way she handled her second-guessing of herself and others, not necessarily coming down on one side or the other. And I Iiked the repetion of certain phrases--all intimations of mortality--at given points in the story-telling. These serve as reminders that death is foreseeable and often foreseen.I've followed Didion's writing since the sixties. I've always liked her spare approach to essays more than her somewhat reductionist (minimalist?) approach to fiction but for me it's all been good. John Gregory Dunne apparently was a very solid, very engaged writer, but I just have never read his work. No reason, just haven't. In the fourth quarter of her terrible, magical year, Didion took up writing again. She started with some journalism that didn't go well. Then she turned to this book. Not everyone has Didion's discipline and skill as a writer, but almost anyone--certainly anyone reading this --could try to find his or her footing in the face of tragedy by outlining the sequence of events, clearing up mysteries, pressing oneself to confront a crucial distinction Didion (and others) make:There is grief and there is mourning. These are two different things. Mourning is an extended process that follows certain protocols (funerals, memorial services, the throwing away of clothes). Grief is its own master, arriving unbidden, ravaging the grieving, and leaving them distraught and defenseless.Didion makes a marvelous, true observation: people who have lost someone precious in the previous year have a vulnerable, open, haggard look about them. They are not back in control, don't know that they ever will be in control again. Indeed, they're not, in effect, altogether present wherever their body shows up. That's the look of mourning. Grief makes you hide. It leaves its traces all over you, but you don't like to let others see it do its nasty work.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2013","Apr 06, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking

Find some way to divorce Tony and marry Jim? Go back to Brooklyn and Tony and his boisterous family? I won't spoil the ending; I've already said enough about the ""plot.""My thoughts about this novel are that it is written with control and insight but is almost an antique in its old-fashioned third-person style of narration. I'm reminded of one Irish writer, William Trevor, and one English writer, Anita Brookner. Both have long specialized in the moral quandaries of loneliness wherein ""nothing happens"" until some emotional commitment or longing is brought into muted relief.That's Tóibín's approach: the affairs of a day, the interplay of Irish girls in a Brooklyn boarding house run by a bossy matron, the comparative differences between Italian and Irish immigrants, not to mention the blacks beginning to show up in the shop where Eilis works, and the modest concerns of an unpretentious though thoughtful and sensitive protagonist make up the real substance of the novel.Toibin's previous novel, The Master, about Henry James was just about the same: Not much happens in James's novels, and James was very careful to ensure that nothing happened in his life...or as little as possible.Why are Toibin's novels interesting, always being ""short-listed"" for that ubiquitous British Booker Prize? In what sense is he a writer to be cherished? I think these are fair questions. Writing a novel that is so pedestrian must have been fairly boring. Eilis does a few things that are risky, but not many. And yet one cheers for her because she's so restrained, so slow to assert herself, so overmatched in the way immigrants almost always are overmatched. The effectiveness of Brooklyn, it seems to me, lies in its lack of ambition, its muted account of ordinary life. Compared to Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, it's a story lacking in vivid characterization and action, and yet it does weave a web comprising small concerns and small people in a large world not easy to manage.So my summary is as follows: This is a novel that isn't intellectually or aesthetically stimulating. Nonetheless, it's a novel that rides the back of the conventional novel form rather effectively. It's not challenging, it's comforting. Tóibín is an almost sweet writer in the sense that he is so caring about the little gestures of little lives.

The story is an account of an American who has fallen in love with Florence and haunts it as he studies its art--notably Raphael's Madonna of the Chair in the Uffizi Gallery--and prepares himself to paint his own madonna, using a woman whose image as a young woman lingers with him even as she ages...and he cannot bring himself to paint her. Years pass, and he talks about his intentions with visiting Americans as he guides them around Florence, but no one has ever seen his work...until our narrator makes an especially close connection with him and he is introduced to the aging woman, a handsome enough lady, and ultimately is able to see that she puts up with Theobald, as the artist is called, even though the only thing he has produced is a quick, lovely sketch of a child she lost long ago. The actual canvas upon which he intends to paint what James refers to as the Madonna of the Future is primed but unpainted; it bears not a single brushstroke.Theobald claims he's been preparing himself diligently; he's been studying; and well...perhaps he is only half a genius, the kind who at least thinks even if he cannot act, but thinks well, thinks brillliantly, and has a response in mind that will match the Raphael that so enchants him.What's the resonance today? The resonance, it seems to me, is that this is another one James's stories focused on Americans in Europe who have arrived only to be confronted by old Europe's staggering glories...which neither Europeans nor Americans can now match. The one continent is too old, the other too young. And these last few years in particular have placed a lot of tension on the trans-Atlantic relationship for similar reasons. We are each other's closest friends and kin, but neither of us knows exactly what to do about it. Unfortunately Britain leaped into Iraq with the U.S., and just as unfortunately, all of NATO embroiled itself in the long war in Afghanistan. Tragic misadventures. Now we hear talk of a free trade agreement between the U.S. and the E.U. Well, how can there not be such a thing already? Because our cultures don't quite match up: because there are French fears we'll flood their movie market (more than we have?); and because there are little countries that could see whole industries wiped out if U.S. goods were cheaply available.So we pivot to Asia? I'm all for Asia, but having lived in Europe for many years, I find James's image of an unpainted canvas to be a painful symbol of what we don't seem to be able to do with the civilization that gave us birth. It's beyond our imagination...and perhaps weighs down Europe's imagination, too. Mixing Henry James in with free trade and Iraq makes for an odd cocktail, I'll admit, but his perplexity and sense of diminished capacity in the trans-Atlantic sense remains apposite. We're crippled in a two-sided political paralysis and Europe is fragmented ten times more than that.James wasn't the kind of literary artist who, confronted with today's dilemmas, would deal with them broadly, but in this odd little story, he's got it about right: after all these years, and wars, and tourism, and talk, talk, talk... the madonna lingers beyond the horizon of the future.For more of my comments on classic and contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2013","Mar 28, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1291768.The_Madonna_of_the_Future

Here’s what I thought: Farewell, My Lovely sustains Chandler’s uncanny gift for physical descriptions, similes, quick, idiosyncratic dialogue, and ability to toss plot(s) up in the wind early in a novel and then weave some elements together while discarding others toward the end.Here’s a sample of Chandler’s distinctive style:“Outside the narrow street fumed, the sidewalks swarmed with fat stomachs. Across the street a bingo parlor was going full blast and beside it a couple of sailors with girls were coming out of a photographer’s shop where they had probably been having their photos taken riding on camels. The voice of the hot dog merchant split the dusk like an axe. A big blue bus blared down the street to the little circle where the street car used to turn on a turntable. I walked that way...”One of my friends says writing like that is enough to keep him reading regardless of Chandler’s characters, themes, or plots. I don’t know if I’d go that far. I like the physical quality of the writing, the unnecessary bit about the sailors, their girlfriends and the camels, the characterization of the hot dog merchant’s voice, and the big blue bus, but I look for more in a novel, and there is more to Farewell, My Lovely.The principal characters, led by Philip Marlowe, the detective, all get the Chandler treatment in two senses: what they look like (features, clothes, style of walking) and how they talk. They are vivid if tightly gathered around a thin slice of underworld life.Then there is Marlowe’s crazy curiosity and emblematic sense of ethics: time and again he turns away or gives back money when he feels he hasn’t performed a job to his employer’s specifications. This is a quirk that distinguishes him from almost everyone else in the novel. Either they have tons of money and money isn’t an issue for them (Marlowe doesn’t have tons of money, far from it) or they will do anything to get it.The paradox of Marlowe is the juxtaposition of his curiosity and his sense of ethics: he takes risks that, no, you wouldn’t take, and neither would I, in order to fulfill his verbal contracts with people who, in the end, prove to be “beneath” him.This makes him predictably maddening and interesting, and probably makes the reader wish he or she also lived such an untethered life, able to act on any thought, travel here or there in an interesting city, drink at odd hours, recover quickly from being sapped, and able to consistently accept criticism and indulge in self-criticism. In Marlowe’s world, you often lose, but that’s in the nature of things. Shakespeare must have said something like that, and somewhere or other, Marlowe has learned enough Shakespeare to quote him from time to time.Does it matter that many of Chandler’s vivid characters are fundamentally caricatures, lacking depth? Does it matter that the contortions of the plot, when they come unsprung, make glancing sense? It’s impossible not to say yes, it matters. But even bit players in Chandler possess an almost Chaucerian humanity, which is to say they are compelling moral portraits, conditioned by bad luck, bad friends, bad enemies, and the ravages of time. Even outside the narrative framework, these figures possess a certain alluring authenticity. Chandler’s artistry lies in constructing that authenticity with his quirky details, the snap in his dialogue, the sordid fragmentary back stories that have wrapped them up in the mysteries Philip Marlowe is determined to crack between drinks.For more of my comments on contemporary and classic fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 27, 2013","Mar 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/105704.The_Big_Sleep_Farewell_My_Lovely

Toby's Room covers some of the same territory...the years leading up to the war when it was all but unimaginable...and the years of the war when it also was all but unimaginable. Toby's Room is a superb novel offering a full account of what it was like to be a young person in England during those times. Barker's focus is on Elinor and Toby, younger sister and older brother, in a milieu of other well-educated, troubled young Brits hoping to find their way ahead in the professions or possibly the arts but somehow landing in the trenches of Ypres. Elinor, the painter, and Toby, the medical student, more or less open the novel committing an act of unanticipated incest and then struggling to ""put things back the way they were before."" There's something about Toby, whose gesture of a certain kind of kiss opened the door to more, that won't be put right, however. He's elusive, suddenly less of Elinor's soulmate and more a figure of an older generation So Elinor pursues other interests--not just love interests, aesthetic interests, sense of self interests--and settles among colleagues at an art school where she prospers, but remember: in the early part of the twentieth century, young women were not expected to go far. Barker has a wonderful sense of pace as she unfolds this tale and brings on the war. She also develops a series of characters who are attractive for all the wrong reasons--too loud, too quiet, too German, too censorious... Lots of arrangements and relationships are explored that don't pan out, nor should they. There's no settling for less than what is truly compelling among these young people. When they don't fit together, they drift apart but remain courteous, even friendly. The point of view shifts: Sometimes Elinor's point of view, sometimes her diary, sometimes the point of view of a young man named Paul Tarrant. These shifts are handled effortlessy. Barker writes splendidly about both the English countryside and London. She's just as good along stretches of slate-strewn stormy coast. When the war hits, the men are fed into it. Those who return often are maimed. A young man named Kit Neville has his nose blown away. Paul Tarrant has a permanently bad, painful leg. Toby doesn't return. Elinor wants to know why not. She thinks Neville knows the story but can't get it out of him. For the longest time, neither can Paul. I won't reveal the ending. I'd rather return to the middle to late sections where Elinor and others are working at a hospital for veterans with facial wounds. Neville is one of them. The horrors of facial disfiguration are graphically presented. It's hard to read about these things--rebuilding a nose, reconstructing a jaw, mending a shattered cranium. Men went to war; monsters returned...but again, not Toby. Despite the disturbing material that lies at the core of Toby's Room, it's a novel almost anyone interested in realistic fiction, or fiction dealing with WWI, would enjoy. The writing and characters are consistently satisfying, the complex moral dilemmas the novel explores are taken head on. This is a very good novel.

I let that pass.Now we come to Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, and in 2013, it looks like he writes in cliches, too, but of course there are differences.Shakespeare's memorable formulations capture the untethered human spirit, and thus they have become lines of thought upon which we all brood to this day.Chandler, another Englishman, came upon the argot of the American west, and he did capture and seize upon cliches with an uncanny ear and sense of timing. And once he had the rythm, he kept manufacturing, if not duplicating, what we now thing of as noir cliches, both as wisecracks and as characters.So the juxtaposition is this: Shakespeare worked in an open world of thought, Chandler worked in a closed world of thought.And now, since this comment is about Chandler, not Shakespeare, we'll dispense with Shakespeare.What Chandler does in The Big Sleep is condense America's worst suspicions about itself and turn America, or at least L.A., into a cynical nightmare of greed, power, corruption, and disillusionment.He does this marvelously. There's some regrettable overwriting here, but Chandler gets certain things dead on right:1) The voice of Philip Marlowe, private eye;2) The look of almost any room, its furniture, drapes, gimcracks, and carpets;3) The look of almost any face;4) Relevant smells, appealing or appalling;5) A staccato style of reporting reality that ""works,"" i.e., is quick, to the point;6) Whether it's going to rain, and if it rains, what the rain will be like…whether it's sunny and what the sun feels like…whether you need a drink and whether the drink works or not;7) What morally corrupt people with enough money will do to make more money, or protect what they have.Detective stories or mysteries or crime novels, or whatever you want to call them, are supposed to be about plot. That's a stretch in The Big Sleep. The biggest mystery is a man who never graces its pages alive. Rather, The Big Sleep is a tour de force of taking you somewhere and keeping you there.And blessed be Marlowe for his continuous sense of insignificance. This is not the anti-hero in the sense that he is deeply flawed; this is the guy who doesn't believe in heroes or heroines and shows us why.There are aspects of The Big Sleep that don't work. Marlowe can be the object of a gun's single eye three times in a day and somehow never bleed. Hard to take. On the other hand, as Elmore Leonard has written, people read his stuff because he leaves out the stuff people don't read. Therefore it makes sense for Marlowe to be accosted by weapons with a high degree of frequency: it's the part people want to read. Minor note: L.A., for those who know it, is physically what Chandler presents. There are the mansions, the terraced gardens, the unaccountably rich, and the less rich tucked into apartment complexes and up in the canyons where the streets are steep and the retaining walls high.What we know about L.A. and the very meaning of ""noir"" comes from an Englishman who didn't hit his stride as a writer until he was in his forties. He wrote in smart talk that became the form, if not the substance, of a long-running cultural cliche. This is not his fault; it's to his credit.Not everyone can be Shakespeare.For more of my comments on fiction, please see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2013","Mar 21, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2052.The_Big_Sleep

There's something careless, reckless, strong and inquisitive about its protagonist, Susan Wheelis, that contrasts well with the terraced beauties of Bali. She's unencumbered, fairly hard working, and ready to take on lovers of either sex with no great sentimentality. But even in her strength, she is outrunning her weakness, or her need of integrative healing. As a consequence, the ending of the novella comes as a strong shock, a real smack, that clarifies exactly how hard she's been heading for a crash.The second novella, ""Care,"" gives us a heroine, Moira (a name referring to the three fates in Greek mythology) worthy of a better hero than Rafe Santerra, whose post-stroke consciousness is a pastiche of cerebral damage and shamanism. But Moira has not had the most successful life up to the point where she reencounters her former writing teacher, and there is not much she can demand of someone so incapacitated (albeit poetically incapacitated.) This is a pretty good novella, nonetheless. Moira can't deal with the cards she and Rafe are dealt, and that rings true and hurts when all is said and done.The third novella, ""When The Stars Threw Down Their Spears and Watered Heaven with Their Tears"" (a title taken from William Blake), features a writer, Paul Brunce, who has been married three times and only in his third marriage does he tell his wife about his horrific childhood and mad, institutionalized sister. This isn't credible. How someone so badly treated as a boy can suddenly pour forth ghastly memories with such studied fluency is beyond me, though it is consistent with the pompous and frequent references made to Paul's literary idols as a youth and cohorts as a man. Rather than ravaged, a guy who has a permanent hard time taking life day by day, Paul is something of a font of wisdom, regret, controlled rage, misery, and careful phrasing. Bad things happen all through this novella. Incest, theft, juvenile detention, runaway parents, and bullets flying here and there all play a role. So do motorcycles, some black leather, a bar where you could get in trouble, and a father who turns out not to have committed suicide after all. It's just too ornately wrought for my taste. Somehow I don't think you can go through two marriages, even bad ones, without coughing up a few of these details--and if you managed that, it's unlikely that you'd be ready to spill everything so eloquently to wife number three.

Coetzee is labeled ""fiction,"" not ""a novel,"" or ""a collection of autobiographical investigations disguised as a story cycle,"" or some other generic propositon. Just ""fiction."" Ok, it goes this way: there is a biographer, an academic, who goes through the deceased John Coetzee's notebooks and focuses a lot of effort on five extended interviews with four women and one man who were important in Coetzee's life. Two of the women were sexually involved with him; one was a cousin; one did everything she could not to accept his advances. The man is presented as a literary friend, an academic.Spun out at novel-length, this manuscript effectively uses the apparent nonentity of John Coetzee as he saw (sees) himself in the form of a blank canvas upon which the five interviewees can talk about themselves. We learn more about them than him. About him we learn he's resevered or shy, well but generally educated, something of a utopian, something of a romantic, a dutiful son who dislikes being a dutiful son when his father's health begins to break down…and so on.About the interviewees we learn that they managed to live without receiving a great deal from the likes of John Coetzee. We hear about their affairs, their childhoods, their complications living in South Africa, and the limits of being human. One denounces Coetzee; one finds him a family misfit; one had some good times with him…The book goes on this way.The notion that this is Coetzee fictionalizing Coetzee while also probing for that elusive being--the author ""behind"" the books--isn't overplayed as Philip Roth would overplay it. There's no grand theory as to the interpenetration of the real and the fictional, or their interchangeability. As a consequence, the articulate documentary quality of Summertime, a title whose meaning eludes me, feels thin. This is an idea book by a writer who can take just about any idea and do something highly professional with it. It's not a lot more than that. It lacks heat, plot, cunning, and a willingness to do more by way of introspection than put the author across as as something of an introverted clutz.I haven't read it in a while, but I recall John Updike's memoir in essayistic fragments, Self-Consciousness, as a great deal more engaging and enlightening. He does his best to tell ""the truth"" about himself, a very hard thing to do. Coetzee, on the other hand, skillfully diddles with the post-modern notion that the author, Coetzee, isn't the point, his political views aren't the point, his lack of engagement with women isn't the point…the point is in his books, and this book, a fiction, isn't really a book, it's a thematic exploration…but of what?The other day a friend asked me about a book we were discussing, ""But don't you think it's well-written?"" I said, ""Yes, of course, the sentences are solid, the pace is good, the imagery is appropriate…but there's something to fiction that goes beyond that."" I meant that fiction must have an internal dynamic and objective that is more than skill in managing words.Late in this book, a former colleague tells the interviewer that where Coetzee fell short was in not taking chances, in deferring to the precepts of genre, in not wrecking conventional expections in the interests of passion. The larger reference here was to Russian writers of the 19th century--Gogol, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, I would think. Since Coetzee is playing the character being interviewed about him, it appears he has understood his own limitations well.What's truly curious is that Summertime was ""a finalist for the 2009 Man Booker Prize,"" which we hear about all the time as Great Britain's highest literary award. Why? Because even though a book about Coetzee by Coetzee isn't alive, it still deserves to be on such lists…because Coetzee is Coetzee?I'm not trying to damn the book, just put it in perspective. It's sort of a readable, articulate book on a par with middle-grade wine, which is okay on a weekend when you're looking for a way to pass the time.For a collection of my comments on contemporary fiction, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 16, 2013","Mar 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6337163-summertime

Things that can be shown are shown; things that have to be told are told. The point of view wanders, but it wanders in the right direction, each time picking up a piece of the overall tale where it needs to be picked up.Everything hinges on Frank Money making it back across the country, from west to east, before his younger sister, Cee, succumbs to the effects of strange experiments performed on her by a doctor recklessly trying to develop better gynecological (and abortion) instruments. The joke, of course, is that Frank Money never has any money, so his trip isn't easy. It becomes a brutal excursion through an America that abused African-Americans often and without end. There's anger driving these incidents and scenes, but it doesn't need to comment on itself: who wouldn't be angry that this is our history? This, indeed, is where Morrison does her best work as a novelist/historian: putting the facts into narrative flesh and letting them speak for themselves. You can't eat here, you can't walk here, you can't live here, you can't be safe, you'd better learn to be sorry 'cause that's how it's going to be for you from beginning to end.And yet in between, in the Georgia settlement called Lotus, a scattering of shacks and unpaved roads back off the highway, some real people lived when Frank and Cee were children and continue to care for them when they are reunited as adults. This full-circle approach is basically the novel's form--Frank and Cee coming back to where they began, at least having each other and a handful of equally abused neighbors willing to give them a hand, nurse them, acknowledge their humanity.Morrison writes so quietly and fluently about people who deserve better than they get that it is difficult to imagine a reader who wouldn't enjoy and appreciate Home.

Having finished it, I asked myself about its British precursors, particularly one I had not read, though I’d seen Stanley Kubrick’s movie: A Clockwork Orange.	So I picked up a paperback of the latest edition and was interested to read Anthony Burgess’s introduction, written in 1986 (the novel came out in 1962). Normally I skip introductions. I don’t want to be told what to think before I’ve had a chance to think myself, but for some reason, I dipped into this one and am glad I did. Burgess’s complaint was manifold: 1) the novel wasn’t that important but people wouldn’t stop talking to him about it because of the movie; 2) the movie, and the American edition of the book, was all wrong because it left out Burgess’s final chapter; 3) the final chapter was critical to the book because it offered our hero, Alex (between ages 15 and 18), a chance to change, i.e., demonstrate some growth and maturity. Burgess’s argument was that fiction is fiction precisely because it offers--nay, insists upon--change in characters. Otherwise, a longish prose tale is not a novel, it is a fable or some other didactic device.	We come here to a judgment that is debatable but is undeniably the linkage between what is known as narrative arc and character development. Burgess was quite furious that Kubrick, liking the idea that Alex remain a weird sociopath, left him in front of the viewer as the same bad boy who first graced the screen. Likewise, Burgess chastised his American publisher. Both Kubrick and the publisher seemed to think, wrongly in Burgess’ estimation, that the shock of enduring evil was worth sacrificing the possibility--again, nay, the necessity--of moral growth and at least incipient goodness.	Now...to the book. We have to remember it was written a long time ago but still seems perversely fresh and that it was written by a polyglot polymath who was particularly strong on Finnegans Wake. This means that it is narrated in a quasi-imitative Russian-English wherein you puzzle out what the argot signifies (rot, for example, signifies mouth.) It’s not that difficult to pierce this verbal fog or understand why Burgess wrote as he wrote in this case: he wanted to foreground a wildly alienated youth, someone so reckless and violent that it would be difficult to understand him verbally as well as morally. Alex and his mates go about London bashing heads, stealing money, playing awful pranks, and generally amusing themselves at the expense of others. As they do so, they chatter in this weird language. The freshness I alluded to earlier comes from the comic, or satirical, implausible plausibility of such heathen in our midst. 	Of course there has to be a major twist and it’s this: Alex finally is jailed and then given early release on the condition that he be reprogrammed according to the latest psychological strategies and theories. Said reprogramming ultimately works, although it takes a step back before the last chapter, and that step back is where Kubrick and the American publisher wanted to leave things. Not Burgess: he wanted Alex to have a vision of life beyond age 18 that entailed some things that were utterly inconsistent with a reversion to his sociopathic state--and that, of course, is what we find in the final chapter: Alex rethinking life itself.	This isn’t a book that’s easy to get into, but once you’re there, it’s much more intelligible than Finnegans Wake and careens along with a Falstaffian playfulness that’s annoyingly appealing.	Burgess himself appears in the book--and is badly handled--as the author of something that eventually emerges as A Clockwork Orange. This undoubtedly led to another one of his complaints in the introduction: hundreds of aspiring academics contacting him about the book’s “meaning.” Did he intend this, that or the other echo, double entendre, allusion, or whatever? Well, the answer is obvious: he did and he didn’t. As I noted above, he was a polyglot polymath. He could effortlessly pick literary references out of his mind all day and drop them into sentences wherever he wanted to, which is what he did--for his own amusement, and ours. But did he want to get at more than a satirical image of London going down not the Tube but the tubes, while offering it a chance to resurface? No, he plainly states not, and he doesn’t seem to be posing and preening in that 1986 introduction. It’s written clearly, solidly, with great candor and evident conviction.	The subsequent American publisher, who put out this version with the last chapter included, adds a note that there may simply have been some aesthetic misunderstanding between Burgess and the original American publisher. That doesn’t cut it. Burgess was notoriously overactive and over-engaged, but as he points out, his missing chapter appeared in every other edition of the book across many, many languages.	To a certain extent, I think A Clockwork Orange is an artifact of the 60s that Kubrick mishandled appropriately for purposes of his film. As literature, no, Kubrick was wrong and Burgess right. How could he not be right? He was the author, after all, and even to this day, the triumphs of film notwithstanding, authors at least get to say what’s on their mind between the covers of their own books.For more of my writing on contemporary literature, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle), so named because the s therein cost two cents apiece....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2013","Mar 13, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/227463.A_Clockwork_Orange

I don't think it will be the last, though it's hard to imagine a novel, or a writer, so lathered in its satire that often you can't tell what's going on…or decide whether anyone who lives as comfortable a life in England as Martin Amis has any right to write such devastating prose about the English who aren't his kind of English anymore.The gist of the book is this: In a violent corner of London there's a neighborhood called Diston Town. Bad things happen there by the minute. One perpetrator of bad things is Lionel Asbo (self-named for Great Britain's Anti-social Behavior Order, a law that is a form ostracism). He has a nephew who, in the weakness a fifteen year old might display, takes to plunking (or chose your own verb) his grandmother, who is also Lionel's mother. But the nephew, Desmond Pepperdine, a modern day Pip, is really as good and hopeful a young man as Dicken's original in Great Expectations.So we cheer from Desmond as he hopes Lionel won't discover that he spent some time plunking Grace, the gran, and as he finds his true love, a lass named Dawn, and eventually they marry and give birth to Cilla, a mixture of black (Desmond's basic color) and white (Dawn's color). The complication comes when Lionel, who has spent much of his life in jail--and continues to do so off and on--wins 140 million pounds in the lottery. With this Lionel is empowered, confused, belittled, thrilled and as anti-social as ever. He becomes a national buffoon whose P.R. firm gradually transforms him into something a little less awful than he is.How awful is he? Well, this is a satire, and satires are supposed to be amusing, and some of the ghastly things Lionel is responsible for do have their moments of infantile glee. Further, he naturally becomes a personage (money will do that for you) and he actually experiences some growing pains, aided and abetted by the women in his life and bitter, backfiring experience full of indignities a man as rich as he ought not to suffer.In one sense, this novel is an exploration of all the rot and ruin the U.K. has become through immigration and benighted social policy and too many bad drugs floating around. That's where the subtitle comes in: State of England.In another sense, this novel is a Great Expectations upside down, Magwitch's triumph, and a screed more compressed and just as funny as Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Every few paragraphs Amis will write a beautiful sentence just to remind you he's awfully good at describing sunsets and mornings and fogs. Most of the time, he writes in the dead-on argot of Diston Town, employing every conceivable misbegotten term for misbegotten people and events.Lionel Asbo the novel, to its credit, doesn't make too much of drugs. Lionel Asbo the character likes alcohol and violence more. He also acquires a late-in-life taste for actual sex over porn, which he finds just as effective and cheaper, less complicated.If you want England as it once was--in our imaginations, at least--there's Downton Abbey. If you want a send-up of England as it often is in 2013, there's Lionel Asbo-State of England. Neither is the ""real"" England, although Martin Amis's work may take us a great deal closer to what life is like in the endless stretches of metropolitan London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and the like.This is a pungent book, not for everyone, but whether you find it appalling or dazzling, it would be difficult to argue that Amis didn't land his punch where he aimed it.For more of my writing about contemporary fiction, history and public affairs, see Tuppeny Reviews, on Kindle....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2013","Mar 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13155843-lionel-asbo

Part One, about two hundred pages, is an overlong account of Dell’s unlucky father and unwise mother deciding to solve their problems by robbing a bank. The setting--Great Falls, Montana--evokes exactly the writer Ford suggests in his acknowledgements statement: Wallace Stegner. In other words, Part One of Canada reads like a strained attempt to rewrite The Big Rock Candy Mountain. I’m sorry about that because some readers surely will put the book aside before getting to Part Two.	Ford’s narrative excuse for fastening a bank robbery onto Bev Parsons and Neeva Kamper--Dell Parson’s parents--is that bungled bank robberies and similar lame-brained initiatives do happen, and so there’s not infrequently an over-desperate, not-very-bright collection of people behind them. The problem is that Ford doesn’t get inside this mismatched couple and find their fire. And Part One goes on and on and it doesn’t need to. 	In his acknowledgements, Ford also tips his hat to another great midwestern writer, William Maxwell. Maxwell was the literary artist Ford should have emulated in Part One because Maxwell wrote short novels, and that’s what Ford should have done: open Canada with about sixty pages that eject young Dell by himself into Saskatchewan. There Ford presents us with a run-down, wind-bitten, miserable town and a dubious guardian for Dell who can only mean trouble. Part Two is great stuff because Dell somehow doesn’t knuckle under and collapse--morally and psychologically--despite brutal neglect and loneliness, culminating in Dell witnessing a double murder carried out by a character, Arthur Remlinger, who is as forcefully, disturbingly real as Dell’s parents, in Part One, are thin, papery, and unconvincing.	Twice in this novel Ford alludes to Ruskin’s edict that composition is the arrangement of unequal things, so I think he must have been conscious of the problem he creates for himself in Canada by dealing with Parts One and Two more or less equally. As a consequence, he tacks on a look-back Part Three in which Dell, fifty years later, is reunited with his nonidentical twin sister and engages, as the book often does, in a species of extended moral analysis: Why do bad things happen to good people? How are good people supposed to deal with them? 	Oddly, Ford introduces an answer in his text by referencing another writer, Thomas Hardy, who had an answer for these questions. But Ford doesn’t really come to grips with what Hardy had to say. Hardy’s belief, in one word, was in something he called “hap,” which is just the inescapable random harshness of the cosmos. “Hap” and “happen” are the noun and verb forms of the same thing: something occurs, and often, in human affairs, what occurs is a bitter thing.	I remark on Hardy in this way because I vividly recall my senior year high school teacher, Mr. Morgan, who was as tough and austere as cherry wood. When he taught us Hardy, his favorite of all writers, he almost shouted that word “hap” at us in a kind of fury. Here was a man in his sixties, nearing retirement, and he wasn’t leaving the scene quietly. He’d have us know the truth, Hardy’s truth: you’ll have things happen to you you’ll never be able to explain or accept. This is the nature of things. Prepare yourselves.	Ford tiptoes out of Canada more quietly. He has Dell emphasize, after having met one last time with his mortally ill twin, that in the face of inexplicable injustice, we can only try. I think the core of this book is better than that. It captures the coarseness of Saskatchewan powerfully; it should stick with that. Here you have William Kennedy Ironweed-quality blunt crudeness, rotten people, warped people, and some good people.	So I find this book interesting, uneven, sometimes powerful, and sometimes windy. Ford’s a good writer. Maybe he needs a better editor. His instincts to pursue the William Maxwell in himself are better than his instincts to pursue his affinities for Wallace Stegner.

This is what gives us fiction--some ground everyone agrees is The Lower River, by Paul Theroux, is a wonderful clash between imagination and reality. This is what gives us fiction--some ground everyone agrees is “real” and some force only an artist can impose upon that reality, i.e., the imagination. The imagination is what makes a work fiction if it’s literature, or some other art form, if it’s not.The conceit here is that a man well into middle-age sees his marriage and business fall apart and decides to reunite with his past as a Peace Corps volunteer. Forty years previously, Ellis Hock had spent four years on “the Lower River,” which we can take to be a river in southern Malawi. The village where he worked was Malabo, and that’s where he wants to go for a week or two, getting away from the disasters he’s just experienced in Massachusetts.He’s full of generous emotions and good intentions. He remembers building a school and teaching smart kids. He recalls a sense of order and purpose. Malabo was so good to him that he extended his two year tour to four years--the best four years of his life.Then he gets to Malabo again...But first let’s pause here to think a bit. First, if we’ve known Peace Corps volunteers, we know they are this way: what they did under harsh conditions, wherever they went, was a huge achievement, something they treasure. In my twenty-five years as a diplomat, I spent time in some bad places, but I was cosseted. Peace Corps volunteers aren’t cosseted, yet they find depths of feeling very few others approach. I’ve seen incredible transformations in high school exchange students, and I’ve seen similar transformations in men and women who have been at war, but none greater than those transformations afforded by a Peace Corps experience.What I really know about that kind of experience comes from a lifetime of backpacking. There you sweat, you ache, you wonder, you marvel, you itch, you parch, you blister, you hear and see and feel things that houses and buildings, suburbs and cities, don’t provide. It’s hard, but it’s limited; in five or ten days, you’re home.I guess it was two years ago that the Peace Corps celebrated its fiftieth anniversary on the Mall in Washington. Out of solidarity, I went over to their “area” and talked with a lot of Peace Corps veterans. They were a happy, grizzled lot. If we’ve done anything great overseas in the last fifty years, it’s been the Peace Corps, and we should do more of it--a lot more.Now, back to Malabo...it’s been putrified. Theroux has it just right. You go to places that were almost noble in their spare dignity some decades ago and find that “the West’s” money-based humanitarianism has corrupted and degraded life, not enriched it.Our protagonist, Ellis Hock, falls into the same trap. He knows he is going to stay a short while, so he doesn’t bring bags of cement with him, he brings sacks of inflated Malawian currency. Unfortunately, that’s what’s wanted because the Malawians even in a place like Malabo know what makes the world go round -- money.The heart of this novel is a tale of Hock scrambling to get out of the hole he has fallen into and only falling deeper. There are oppressive scenes of grandiose friendliness that is nothing but hostility. There is a frightening experience among a village of cast-off children. There is the specter of AIDS, and the legend, which was acted upon, that if a male AIDS victim could have sex with a virgin, it would cure him. There are snakes. There are some remnants of loyalty and friendship with which Hock is able to connect, but these people pay a heavy price for befriending Hock.What is it like to be in a terrible place for days, weeks, and months? A place steaming hot, buggy, desolate, boring, undernourished and subject to diseases unimaginable in Miami, Madrid or Moscow?Theroux does this kind of situation narrative and psychological justice. He writes his own Heart of Darkness and can be proud of it. We are talking fiction here, not ethnography, but the line is pretty blurry. Without having been to Malawi, I can’t help but think much of what he recounts is straight talk about how it is--no theoretical interpretations, just the facts. A mask dance. A manner of address. A fear of the night and people who stare too long at the stars. It just strikes me as something written by someone who has been there, much as Peter Mathiesson’s writing reflects similar authentic contact.What you do when you enter another culture, if you’re wise, is surrender to it. You find points of contact from within that new culture, not from outside of it. The discomfort can be incredible, but culture is so much more powerful than the rational West would like to think. Money, in many ways, only makes things worse.This is a point that makes Theroux’s book especially important. There are those who argue fiercely that “we, the West” make terrible mistakes and do terrible damage trying to put things right in underdeveloped nations. The Lower River addresses this point dramatically. The counter-argument that, for example, HIV/AIDs can be dealt with only by medicine, not by virgins, isn’t made. I won’t settle this debate here, but we have to keep having it.Ultimately, a novel being a novel, Theroux’s protagonist has to succumb or escape. This is another point I won’t address. It would spoil the book for future readers. But it’s a terribly important point. If I were writing this book, Hock wouldn’t make it. Read The Lower River and see what Theroux decided. It’s his book, not mine.For more of my writing about contemporary fiction, history, and public affairs, have a look at my book, Tuppence Reviews, just released on Kindle....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2013","Feb 28, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13023201-the-lower-river

In the first story, ""After the Season,"" an accomplished musician with adequate but not a great deal of money falls in love with an heiress with tons of money…and that's a problem for him. He doesn't like rich people, or thinks he doesn't, but there's really nothing wrong with the woman except that by moving in with her, he'll lose touch with all the nice things he has in his modest New York life. These are itemized: the guy he plays chess with, the kids he jokes with on the sidewalk, the fact that he can hear all the fighting going on in his apartment building which justifies him playing music as loud as he wishes any time of night or day. Anyway, bye-bye to all that…love is in the air and he'll swallow his distate for a fortune to accomodate it. Sweet, maybe. Saccharine? Maybe that, too.The next story, ""The Night in Baden-Baden,"" is a tale in which a fellow likes women other than his girlfriend from time to time…and his girlfriend is the jealous, snoopy type. You can imagine how that turns out, but this guy still gets an unexpected roll in the hay --with another woman, of course--before the final break-up.Then we come to my favorite stinker: ""The House in the Forest."" Here a male writer who is overshadowed by his more successful spouse, also a writer, moves the family five hours out of New York so her fame won't distract her so much. Kind of him. He even goes as far as knocking out the telephone line to their house so no one will tell her she's won ""the American Book Award."" All this ends up in a car accident and a split. Some marriage.Throughout these tales, the question of control often presents itself. Our writer friend clearly is a controller. The jealous girlfriend? A controller. In the next story, ""Stranger in the Night,"" a con artist bewilders an otherwise intelligent chap…in other words, he controls him, quite implausibly.Same thing in spades in ""The Last Summer."" Here we have a man dying of cancer who wants his family around him at his country house for one last summer before the pain becomes so great that he will drink a potion that will kill him as kindly as falling asleep. Of course, he doesn't want anyone to know this is his plan. And of course, his wife finds out. End of his control over the situation. The wife and the family abandon him. Really? He's quite ill, can barely peck out a letter apologizing, but somehow he manages to do so, and in addition, he locks up the poison and throws away the key.I had hopes for ""The Last Summer"" until this peculiarly happy unhappy ending presented itself. The same control-freak reappears in the next story, ""Johann Sebastian Bach on Ruegen"". Here he's a father with a son desperate to get to know him. The son batters him pretty hard about this, but no luck; when dad cries over a Bach CD's beauty, a true show of emotion, he offers no explanation why.Now the last story, ""The Journey to the South."" This is another end-of-life story that does have an interesting twist when a granddaughter snookers her highly controlled grandmother into meeting, after decades, the man who was the true love of her life. This is hard on the old lady, but good for her. After facing her own role in undermining a passionate youthful romance, she confronts many of the highly controlled consequences that followed: chiefly, becoming a dutiful, exploited, betrayed wife and grandmother. The way she snaps at her kids and grandkids about this is shocking but actually happens from time to time. Be wary of old folks ready to tell the truth. Their tongues can cut.Fiction is ""made up,"" of course, but it can't read as though it's ""made up."" It has to emerge from psychic ground to which it remains true. Schlink almost has the life experience and writing skills to slip past this requirement, but not quite. His fame in Europe and the U.S. rests on a novel called The Reader, which I haven't read. It's possible that a novel's requirements for sustained commitment forced him to turn out good fiction in The Reader. In the case of the short story, however, he may simply be writing with too much facility and too little heart.To read more of my comments on contemporary fiction, please take a look Tuppence Reviews, recently released as a Kindle e-book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 24, 2013","Feb 24, 2013",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/15812545-summer-lies

There doesn't have to be a strong plot; in fact, a strong plot gets in the way; adolescence is a series of events full of feeling that don't add up. Dream all you will, life isn't going to turn out that way. And if it does, your train wreck is coming later in life…probably around thirty.The gift offered by this particular book isn't the beauty of Petterson's Out Stealing Horses--it's the gift of a portrait of a good but tough kid, Audun Sletten, learning unpleasant and tough lessons as he dreams of becoming a writer, quits school, goes to work, has the bad things done to you you always have done to you when you're a kid working among adults, and finally finds a few tears in himself when he buries a father he'd long since decided he couldn't bear.Here's a book in which it is possible to both sympathize and empathize. Adult readers have been through it and wish teenagers didn't have to go through it, but they do.Auden takes his knocks in an admirable way. He has one good friend, Arvid, who reminds us how important friends are to children and adolescents, and he has a single mother who, to his surprise, isn't over the hill yet…in fact, she finds another man.One narrative curiosity about this book struck me, i.e., the specificity of Petterson's descriptions of Audun walking or driving down this road, over that hill, past this church, along this row of houses, all of which have Norwegian names, none of which really matter to the reader as much as they do to adolescents. To make sense of this terrain, we'd have to have a map, which might make sense. But at the same time, what really matters is being reminded that when ""we were young,"" we actually took note of where we were going; the book foregrounds this fact. After adolescence, we sort of stop naming the places we're going and the ways in which we get there. We blank out because we know the way; we think about other things; we're less present, more abstracted. During adolescence, however, every shortcut, every house that prompts a memory, every lake where we skinny-dipped, all that stuff is vivid, essential. There is no land over the horizon. There is here, right here. This is where we grew up. This is us.	And then it's gradually not us. More geography piles up in our lives, more relationships, different urges.	The interesting and presumably autobiographical irony of one of Audun's key decisions--leaving high school without graduating--is that he is a good student, perhaps so good and self-directed that school is superfluous…or perhaps (it's really not clear) he just wants to abandon something the way his father, a drunk, abandoned him…and his brother, who died in a car accident, abandoned him. I guess that's it: I'll get back at them by demonstrating that I can walk away and abandon conventional expectations, too.	This is an interesting, engaging short novel because Audun wants what happens to him to be real. He's got integrity. It's always pleasant to spend time with someone like that.

He's appealing in the sense that he's modest. In a peculiar way, the whole novel is modest and somehow understated although it hinges on patience-testing spoofs of the art world's vagaries and is interrupted, toward the end, by something of a police procedural (in which Martin plays a key role.)How do you make your first major statement photographing and exhibiting MIchelin maps? You need a novel like this to say you do. How do you get further along in your career photographing ordinary objects--made things--that we all have in our house: screws, desks, lamps, pill bottles? Again, it takes a novel like this to put that one over. Finally, Martin really makes it really big painting mock heroic canvases that portray 21st century business titans as demi-gods, dividing up the world: Bill Gates, you take this part; Steve Jobs, you take that part.Jed Martin finds all this surprising. It wasn't quite what he intended, to be so famous, so rich, to have such a fabulous Russian mistress. He seems most real on Christmas eve when he traditionally dines with his aging father, who isn't interested in him. Or when he listens to the cranky hot water heater in his flat, wondering if it's trying to tell him something.Houellebecq, whom we are told on the dust jacket is ""the most celebrated and controversial French novelist of our time,"" makes several appearances in this novel himself. He's portrayed as a drunken recluse, somewhat misanthropic, the least likely guy to write an essay for Martin's exhibition catalogue that vaults Martin into the Pantheon of French painters.I told my wife what I was reading this weekend, and she said it sounded awful, why bother? I said I'd written something disparaging about Houllebecq once and felt I owed it to him to finish reading this novel…and to myself. I like to finish books and see if, in the end, there's some hidden value.The value here is quite hidden. I'd put it this way: there is a Franco-German philosophical tradition that over the course of the 20th and now into the 21st century has emphasized the mystical dimension of the mundane. This deescalates ""belief"" from metaphysical belief (as in believing in a God) to accepting the reverberations of consciousness reflected off the existing physical world as a higher mystery in itself.Basically, Martin stumbles through this terrain of thought in his photography and painting. He renders the inessential essential. He carries the flag first raised by DuChamp and later Warhol. He is used by Houellebecq for purposes of satire, but again, he's not an offensive fellow…wouldn't hurt a fly…it's not his fault that his publicist and gallerist are so effective…nor that the art world is desperate to find the final painter who can render the meaninglessness of meaning in stirring terms.I know that for American readers I'm exploring terrain that is unnatural to us. We still have some kind of faith in the reality of things. Continental intellectuals don't.There are passages in the novel wherein Houellebecq spends time describing a Samsung camera's instruction manual and the architectural feel of Shannon airport in Ireland. By the end of the book, Martin, in his viritual dotage, is photographing the innards of computer equipment dissolving in baths of corrosive acid (which he applies.) All the same, manuals and high-tech glop. Just as the new residents in an old village behave more or less exactly like the old residents, but with less surliness because they want to sell things to Chinese and Russian tourists (the old village residents wouldn't have known a Chinese tourist from the King of Saudi Arabia…or cared).Houellebecq has the good taste to have himself brutally murdered in this novel, and he also, as I've indicated, has an ability to focus on the quieter moments of existence, the ones we all drift through, up to and including those utterly silent seconds enveloping death itself.If you don't know the philosophical background against which he is writing--the utter relativism and disbelief that makes an avant-garde French novelist tick (and there have been similar ones before him: think Robbes-Grillet)--Houellebecq is apt to make you pity the French.If you do know that background, where everything is demystified and cyberized, lasting and evanescent, only as real as it is fake, this is something of a witty book.The problem, as a novel, really comes in the later sections where a meditation on the arts becomes a kind of police procedural. We're reasonably pleased to see Houellebecq brutalized, but the truth is that the brutalizer was an accident richocetting off another narrative accident.I think back on my friend of yore, the Spanish novelist Juan Benet, who urged me not to read his novels because they were so terribly, terribly boring. But of course I read one, and he was right.For more of my s of contemporary fiction, please check out Tuppence Reviews (Kindle).

In another sense it is an open book, and Blain Harden's Escape from Camp 14 opens that book a little wider.	This is the story of the only person to escape from one of North Korea's worst Gulag labor camps. ShIn In Geung was born in Camp 14 and grew up under conditions that even the word ""dehumanizing"" expresses inadequately.	Camp 14, and other Gulag installations in North Korea, does not permit children to humanize in the first place. They are taught to betray one another, live in absolute fear of horrendous punishments when they transgress, and forced to work themselves to death through a combination of brutal labor and perpetual malnutrition. Stalin's Gulag was no worse. 	In clear, efficient prose, Harden describes how Shin In Geung made it out of North Korea to China, then to South Korea, and then to the U.S. He begins with a boy watching his mother being hanged and his brother being shot. That boy was Shin In Geung. He didn't like, much less love, either his mother or his brother…or his father. He wasn't supposed to. He was supposed to regard everyone as a competitor for a few extra grains of rice or a spoonful of porridge. If his mother made herself lunch in their unfurnished dwelling and returned to eat it at midday, she found that Shin In Geung had already eaten it. He couldn't help himself, didn't see why not. 	For years the boy had only the most delicate and tense relations with his peers, his teachers, his family, and of course, the camp guards and administrators.	I've been interested in North Korea for several years now. That's why I say it's an open book. We know the regime is a dynastic proposition propped up by the military, strengthened by a puny but deadly nuclear capability, and willing to do anything to live well at the general population's expense. If there are 25 million North Koreans, less than a million live reasonably well; perhaps a few thousand live lavishly. The rest are hungry, growth-stunted, paranoid, and desperate.	At the very bottom of the ladder, you have the inhabitants of the labor camps who are born there and die there.	As Harden's book unfolds, we see Shin In Geun enter other countries with an increasing sense of amazement, doubt, guilt, and confusion. He is a young man who used another man's electrocuted body to slip relatively unharmed through the wires of a deadly fence. He knows that by having escaped he probably doomed his father, who had no knowledge of Shin In Geung's escape plans. He experiences something like psychic bends as he surfaces, learns English, learns how to relate to people in a kind way, edges mistrustfully toward trust, a belief in God, and a mission in life to inform the world about what we already know: North Korea is an unspeakably cynical hell. We can see it from overhead on Google much better than FDR could see where Hitler was concentrating the Jews and others and annihilating them. We have volumes of testimony from other escapees. We have haunting documentaries shot with hidden cameras. We have North Korea's predicably unpredictable behavior. What does it want? It wants to perpetuate itself; 'it' in this case being those few thousands who live like Gods among the damned.	William Golding's Lord of the Flies and Shirley Jackson's The Lottery tell Shin In Gueng's story in moral terms.

This means novels, in particular, have changed a good bit in their function over the centuries. Once upon a time novels confirmed the social order--think of Jane Austen. Now we have writers like Nadine Gordimer who was born into the white discomfort of black South Africa, and she manages to write plausible, discomfiting stories that make us dissatisfied, appalled, sympathetic, and even, occasionally, energetic.	In the case of The Pickup Gordimer assigns herself a task that at first I found a kind of fairy tale, not every credible.	Reaching beyond South Africa, she places a man from the Arab world in South Africa, has a white South African rich girl take a shine to him, and then, in the first part of the novel, traces his descent into deportation--for he has come to South Africa, as he has gone elsewhere, illegally. And the authorities have caught up to him, and this time he can’t fight it, he has to leave.	Okay, but it’s challenging to believe in Julie’s love for Abdu. She is recognizable, a young p.r. professional who hangs out in cafes. He is intentionally vague, doesn’t want to be seen. What country does he come from? We’re not told. Where else has he been? Not told. Is there more here than Julie’s social rebellion and his fugitive’s allure?	The novel’s first 75 pages tumble along from past tense to present tense, first person to third, and are short on quotation marks, distinguishing who’s talking or thinking.	Sort of thin.	Where does this guy come from?	Well, Julie decides she’s going back there with him. What do you think of that? 	It’s hard to know, but it happens. He’s deported and she goes right along with him.	My guess is that they go to Yemen. I could be wrong, and I’m not sure exactly how important it is that I’m right, but I find, as I read, that I like thinking, “They’re in Yemen. They’re in his home village outside the capital, on the fringes of the desert, in a ghastly place.”	Turns out his name isn’t Abdu, it’s Ibrahim, he has a family that has seen him deported back home before but never in the company of a white female non-Muslim.	This is where the novel becomes interesting. It doesn’t take a turn toward Ibrahim having been some kind of failed sleeper in an al-Qaeda cell. It focuses on him expending all of his energy trying to get a visa to some other country that might give him a chance in life. And it focuses, more importantly, on the crushing process of Julie learning how to be a woman in the cramped difficult confines of Ibrahim’s family’s house--and life.	I find myself highly skeptical. Experiences like this really don’t work very well. They turn out as Ibrahim constantly fears: she’ll decide to call Daddy and get a ticket back to South Africa. But Gordimer keeps pounding at the situation into which Julie becomes more and more embedded, finding a meaning in certain relations, times of day, beliefs, methods of preparing food that she never found in the emerald belt of South African suburbs where she was raised.	The territory we’re in is Paul Bowles’s territory, but that’s just one take on it. It’s also Gordimer’s. She’s got the right feeling for the desert, the trash, the dust, the limited options, the minor flashes of tackiness, the turbulent emotions within Ibrahim’s family, and Julie’s gradual realization that she has built a life for herself there.	I’m not going to take this description of the book to its narrative end. That would spoil it for you. I want to go back to where I started: the fiction writer today is bearing a burden that a lot of journalists, politicians, health workers, business people and scientists are bearing: how to bring the First and Third Worlds, the Christian and Islamic worlds in particular, closer together.	This isn’t Jane Austen, who is wonderful in her way. This is a writer of relentless intelligence and aesthetic vision.	One can “buy” a percentage of the ending in terms of believability and yet value this book; you don’t have to take it 100%; it could be less; would still be worth the time to read it....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Feb 11, 2013","Feb 11, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96334.The_Pickup

Aboul-Enein is a synthesis of key passages in an eight volume work entitled, Social Glimpses of Iraqi Modern History by Dr. Ali al-Wardi. Although this is not a long book (173 pages) I wouldn’t recommend anyone other than specialists (academic or military) read it, and even then that they do so only if they keep one key point in mind:Nothing went as planned (nothing really was planned, truth be known) after the United States-led Coalition toppled Saddam Hussein because U.S. non-planners did not understand the society and history they were entering.Iraq in Turmoil isn’t only about Iraq because Iraq is inseparable from the larger region of which it is a part, and that region, for thousands of years, has seen governments and monarchies come and go while persisting in its distinctive shape-shifting forms of tribal alliances and betrayals.If you break down any government in “the Middle East,” you will find an underpinning of tribal and clan networks that will persist. Saddam Hussein ruled in one sense; in another sense, he didn’t rule. He passed through Iraq as the British once passed through and the United States has passed through. What remains is a mixture of Bedouin and urban social organization and fractured interpretations of Islam, spiced by ethnic variations and their sub-groups. Kings and presidents and dictators have discovered this, and it is well-told by Dr. Ali al-Wardi and somewhat choppily retold by Youseff H. Aboul-Enein.We often hear it said that Iraq is an artificial country because three main groups comprise it: Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. This is true but only partially true. Through the course of history, all three of these groups have conspired with and against one another. At a given point of social/military stress, whatever structure of governance or “power” exists is quite likely to crumble into its fundamental components and those components will move this way or that depending on key leaders then active and key foreign forces then trying to influence things.To read Iraq in Turmoil’s account of the Brits’ miseries dealing with Iraq in the 1920s is more or less to read an account of quite similar American miseries in the years 2003-2010.There was a story-line after the U.S.-led invasion that read this way: we toppled Saddam and now the insurgency is led by former regimists trying to climb back into power, complicated by the fact that they were mostly Sunni and the majority of Iraqis are Shiite. Actually, that wasn’t the case. There were old Saddamists afoot, no question, but the intricacies of the insurgency had more to do with tribes and clans and sects interacting with one another against “the intruder.” The Middle East is a region dominated by families and Islam. That’s the message of this book. The families change from century to century, Islam changes, too, but these core building blocks are not susceptible to Western adaptation.The U.S. military likes to talk about this sort of thing in terms of confronting “the human terrain.” Okay, let them put it that way, but it doesn’t help. It hasn’t helped in Afghanistan (which is just like Iraq, but lacks oil) and it wouldn’t help in Syria (which is historically almost indistinguishable from Iraq, meaning, where is the border? what is the difference between these societies?)At the moment, Washington is aflutter because President Obama declined the advice of his national security team to arm the insurgents in Syria. Apparently he understands what he has been saying: there is no certainty whatever as to what will happen in Syria. Deals might be made that will shock us. We might be snookered before we finish shaking hands with our new partners. We might be pleased and see a tiny glimpse of something we can work with in encouraging peace. The fighting might stop, just like that, almost inexplicably, when the dictator gets on a plane to Switzerland or Swaziland.None of this means the Middle East has no future and that we will never be able to deal with it peacefully, but the idea of talking about recent events there as some kind of “Arab Spring” is questionable. Some might say the Arab Spring happened fifteen hundred years ago.In simplest terms, one has to understand that any strategy toward the region will break down into very particular, specific, tactical maneuvering at the drop of a dime. It is vital to be minutely informed if you are actively involved in the Middle East. Iraq in Turmoil makes that point abundantly clear, but it’s even more vital to be cautious. Any arrangement made there--in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq or nearby--is provisional. That’s why I particularly love the word “glimpses” associated with al-Wardi’s initial book (upon which Iraq in Turmoil is based). Eight-volumes and all you get are glimpses. Good way to put it.

The wife he’s always leaving, of course, is the basic girl grown older, angrier, and still as confused as ever about why men are necessary, or so damned persistent.Watts’ setting, character and themes make me think of a white female writer who grew up in Georgia: Flannery O’Connor. What Watts lacks that O’Connor possessed, it seems to me, is a tight, explosive sense of story wrapped up in the fundamentally tragicomic wickedness of people--their vanity and greed above all.Some of these stories are so socially fuzzy (who is related to whom? who is sleeping with whom?) that it’s a challenge for the reader to keep the narrative straight. Others are richer in the middle than in the end, when the fundamental girl just has to give up and yield to uncertainty.The collection has several strengths: a consistent, well-controlled prose style full of vivid details; a great instinct for titles (“If You Hit Randolph County, You’ve Gone Too Far;” “Family Museum of the Ancient Postcards”); and a commitment to bringing the South’s backwoods African-American trailer-folk to the fore.

One writer who always makes my lists, however, is Alice Munro. If that sparks any interest, and I'm asked what I like about her, I say that she writes short stories with the qualities of novels, possesses an almost perfect, meditative narrative style, and surfaces the weird from the mundane without ever losing her dignity or judgmentQuite a mouthful. Alice Munro has long been, in other words, an accomplished writer of somewhat unique gifts.The way she achieves those novelistic qualities in short stories isn't too hard to figure out. First, she starts on one subject or character, then she moves to another subject or character, then years often pass (lots of them) and the seemingly unrelated first and second beginnings of her stories are woven into their endings.A word for this is discursive. A little of this, a little of that, some magic and coincidence and long-lingering passion and life, which seldom makes even fleeting sense, blossoms in a beautiful concluding sentence or two.When I say ""almost perfect, meditative narrative style,"" I'm referring both to her discursiveness and her relatively straightforward language, adorned here and there by a startling image (something out of keeping with her characters' pretensions but absolutely lined up with their dark memories and fears.) Munro doesn't follow the threadbare prescription: show, don't tell. She tells a lot. This is the sin of exposition, which didn't used to be a sin. Is she speaking in her own voice or a made-up voice drawn from a principal character? Usually it's the latter. Usually that's what gives the story heft and credibility. But at the same time, her narrators purl along smoothly, sluicing this way and that around the rocks in the streambed.Finally, ""the weird from the mundane,"" what's that mean? It means life caught up with itself in an unexpected way. It means Munro doesn't spell this out so much as build it into her story without explanation. It means the reader gets it without having to be told: life is full of panic attacks, surrenders, inconvenient encounters, and the like.In her new story collection, Dear Life, all of what I describe above is present, and there's a little more: a few autobiographical sketches at the end that read like ""Goodbye."" I've heard she's said this is it, no more, she's eighty, enough. I don't know whether that's true or not, but going to the source of some of her qualities and sharing them with us does suggest she may mean it: here's where I came from, this is what I and my family were like, you can guess why I've always been caught imaging country life when I'm in the city, city life when I'm in the country, Toronto when I'm in Vancouver, Vancouver when I'm in Toronto.I think I've read all of Alice Munro's stories, and I'm not one to suggest that a writer necessarily loses it when she grows older or that Dear Life isn't a good book, but I wouldn't say it's the best she's written. One or two stories could have been left out. ""In Sight of the Lake,"" about an older woman either losing her mind or having an anxious dream, is just another tale about the elderly getting everything wrong. ""Dolly,"" about the reemergence of an old flame who temporarily incinerates an aging couple's ""On Golden Pond"" experience is a little bit shaky. I'm not sure whether we're really seeing the couple undertake a suicide pact at the beginning (before the old flame shows up) or why the old flame's appearance is so devastating to the female partner.Stories like ""To Reach Japan"" and ""Leaving Maverly"" have a certain bite to them that I like. The autobiographical pieces, let's say ""Voices,"" wherein Munro realizes her mother swept her away from a dance because a gaudy prostitute had shown up, also reach home. Perhaps for the first time, Munro writes the word fuck. I could be wrong about that, but it catches your attention and makes you realize that they did that back in the 1930s, too…or wanted to.In one of her books, Munro writes about how she has always written: full of dissatisfaction, always disconcerted by where the next sentence is leading her, wondering if she'll ever get an actual story out of the scenes and characters and sudden incidents she imagines. Probably the fitful quality of her approach to composition lends itself to the delightful wandering nature of her work; probably it also helps her render her prose so simple, so direct, with lots of short paragraphs, and--tsk,tsk--incomplete sentences (no verbs!)We can be sure that Munro, for all that she has published, has written a great deal that has never seen the light of day. What we have to hope is that no ill-advised scholar ever gets her hands on these remnants. The nature of true talent is that it's idiosyncratic down to the last beat, the last syllable, the last unexplained narrative leap. It takes Alice Munro to be Alice Munro, in other words. My criticisms notwithstanding, Dear Life is still Alice Munro.For more of my s, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle).

His subtitle: ""FaitIn ""Talking to the Enemy,"" social scientist Scott Atran makes an elaborate case for seeking to find common ground with terrorists. His subtitle: ""Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)making of Terrorists"" tells us, in effect, that humanity is dependent upon faith to generate larger communities (brotherhoods) that will develop enough respect and restraint within themselves not to hurl suicide bombers into crowds populated by other communities (also brotherhoods united by faith, which may or may not be religious.)This premise is both tantalizing and utopian.Atran spends a great deal of time-- many chapters--examining the terrorist communities of the last twenty years. Clearly he has gone to some dangerous places and spoken with some dangerous men (they're almost all men.)One demon he seeks to demolish has already fallen--al Qaeda. I should think George Bush had more or less worn all the fuzz off that organization by 2003 or 2004. Within intelligence and foreign policy circles, it was known to have been crippled badly by the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. A few years later, almost no one considered al Qaeda per se as a matter of direct, substantial concern. Yes, it was good to see Osama bin Laden meet his end, but he was at the time of his death more or less what he had been for many years: a little heard voice and a leader with moral influence, to a certain extent, but no operative impact.The terrorists of the middle and latter part of the first decade of this century are then examined by Atran with a great deal of care and insight, and we find what I think is pretty well known: in London, in Madrid, in Pakistan, and elsewhere (he overlooks Yemen and wrote his book before Mali became an issue), the world's terrorists were relatively well-educated, self-selecting, alienated groups of men who came up with an idea that was fed by bin Laden's achievements and the continuing verbal jihad being waged on the Internet by his emulators. Atran goes so far as to cite Hannah Arendt's famous term, ""the banality of evil,"" as he probes some of these ganglets (my term). The train bombing in Madrid was one of the worst cases, hundreds dead, a thousand wounded, but it was a tragedy of improbable success and…murderously pointless.The conservative party lost the presidency to the socialist party in Spain because the conservatives quickly blamed ETA (the Basque terrorist organization) and was wrong, but the fact is that terrorism (Atran points this out) has never achieved more than murder. It didn't bring down Spain, London, the United States, Indonesia or any other country. In other words, terrorism, as we have seen it practiced, has not yet moved to the next stage--from random acts of violence to organized insurgencies to regime changes wherein, in the Islamic case, Sharia becomes the law of the land and the religious leadership takes over from the secular leadership.Such a revolutionary progression did take place in Iran, though not because of the terrorism under discussion. It also took place in Afghanistan, though, again, not because of the terrorism under discussion.President Obama bravely said, at one point, that the terrorists had not crippled New York, much less the United States, and never would or could. President Bush never would have said that. He was reelected on his war platform (war on terror, war on Saddam) and couldn't tell such a truth.After Atran surveys the actors involved in two decades of intermittent, high-profile, unproductive carnage, he then assesses two big issues: the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the role of religion in modern life.On the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, Atran probes (he did this in person, face-to-face) the willingness of leaders to accommodate one another's needs, not just for land but for justice. These two factors are blended into that which holy, both for Jews and Muslims (as well as Christians). What Atran senses is that if the respective leaders would exchange some kind of apology, other concrete pieces of a settlement could fall into place. He's referring, implicitly, to the honor/shame rigidity of religious and/or ideological societies. (In fact, ideology has its flexibility, and so does religion.)Like many academics, Atran portrays senior U.S. government officials as insensitive to these nuances of human experience (history, culture and religion). Okay, let him have his fun, but I doubt that everyone he met with was as illiterate about human nature as he suggests.The problem for the U.S. government is two-fold (at least). First, we have overinvested in offensive military capability. This has grossly distorted our foreign policy, Washington decision-making in general, and our entire economy. Let me mention one startling fact: the U.S. has over 700 foreign military installations. Beyond that, we have weapons no nation could possibly match in the next twenty-five years. Second, as Atran points out, we are a nation ostensibly of law (our Constitution) although culturally we are quite religious. Officials in Washington are better equipped to make policy through the Pentagon than they are through religious leaders.Atran concludes his long book with an abstract consideration of the role of God in human life. He writes as a social scientist who believes, in effect, that belief is intrinsic to the community-making mind of mankind. He doesn't argue that God does exist or doesn't exist; he simply argues that God has a habit of showing up in zones of conflict and could be deployed to resolve rather than worsen those conflicts. (At different points in his book, Atran links monothiesm to universalism and universalism to the concept of human rights. All this is good, but the question arises as to whether this book should have been two or three books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 29, 2013","Jan 29, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/9573362-talking-to-the-enemy

SmithI'm scheduled to moderate a panel on short stories in March that will include discussion of Sherburne by R.T. Smith, so despite the fact that I've read this book, I'm going to reserve direct comment and share some more general thoughts about writing and writers that occurred to me as I read it.Poets and Fiction Writers: Very few great fiction writers are great poets and vice versa. I can think of three--Thomas Hardy, Robert Penn Warren, and D.H. Lawrence. Others might add James Dickey to that list or Herman Melville. William Faulkner wanted to be a poet and famously said that if he could have written The Sound and the Fury in ten pages, he would have done so. From the poet's perspective, it seems to me that the habit of producing poetic forms, which are so condensed, often makes them run wild when they try fiction. They just come up with one great formulation after another, all of which seem equally compelling, and don't prune them back. This damages the fiction. From the novelist's perspective, writing poetry seems to be writing something lyrical or even dramatic in just a few words, but that's not poetry at all. Poetry is a big thing seen small from the beginning, and it's not easy, it's hard, because poetry rests so heavily on possessing exactly the right vision to begin with, before the words even appear on the page. The one poetic mode of fiction, which is to say the one mode of fiction that is perfectible, is the short story. Novels, someone else said, are long pieces of imaginative prose that have something wrong with them. Hemingway didn't write much poetry, but his early short stories were darkly representative of his central vision and flawlessly executed. He subsequently wrote a few good novels, but when he should have been peaking, he was growing mawkish. Somehow--in my opinion--he got everything right in The Old Man and the Sea, a prose parable that tells life's tale as well as anything.The South: I am a great admirer of most of the South's greatest writers: William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, and Robert Penn Warren, to name four. Singling O'Connor out a moment, she was a short story writer more than a novelist; she just had a brilliance and intensity and drive that worked best in short stories. Of the writers I've mentioned, Faulkner is the one who comes closest to erring in his treatment of the South's great theme, but ""closest"" is foregiveable in his case because he worked through his romantic fascination with Southern perspectives on the Civil War and came out knowing how horrendously slavery mutilated the slaves, the South, and the nation. What do you write when your greatest theme--memory--is sodden with guilt? You write books like Faulkner's great books. You don't gild memory and focus fancifully on the valor of defeat. That's cheap, threadbare, erroneous history in the case of the South. As Faulkner might have written: because of slavery…because of slavery…because of slavery.Grant said in his memoirs that he always felt the South would win the war because when it lost all the battles, it would lose its grip on slavery, too, and what a grand victory that would be. There are very few ways in which we can say humanity has improved in recent millenia. The universal condemnation of slavery is one of them (although it's still practiced around the world, with a focus on women and children). This does put the Southern writer in a special position, but there may be, in this day and age, too much emphasis placed on Southern writers. When did you last see an anthology called ""New Writing from the North""? A ""Northern"" writer like John Edgar Wideman has demonstrated many times that the black-white scar of the Civil War is as raw in the North as in the South. I grew up in the North and have lived in the South for many years. We have an African-American president, but we still aren't whole as a people, and by now, the South has no monopoly on the problem. Writers from everywhere have a legitimate reason to address it.The Western: I haven't read many Westerns, but those I occasionally come across run the danger of formulaic plotlines that defeat the characterization ""literary."" Nowadays we see the Western's threadbare plotline transported to police procedurals in L.A., Miami, Philadelphia and New York. Writer beware: noble as the law may be, it's a lame and imperfect morality. Collectively, the Constitution, our basic law, is the best we Americans can do and it's what we Americans are. But literary writers eschew good guy/bad guy/judgment stuff for serious engagement with the ambiguous. Cormac McCarthy shows the way to do it.Editing: Some tiny percentage of writers may like editors. It's truly possible. But that doesn't mean writers don't need editors. If there is one thing they need them for, it's getting the story told in fewer words than the word-mad writer prefers. Kathleen Parker, the journalist, recently wrote that pruning your prose is like killing your children. So writers either have to become cold-blooded murderers or hire editors to act as executioners.

In a sense, it’s two books. First, an account of how Matti Peled, the brilliant warrior and militant Zionist, became a scholar of Arab literature and proponent of returning the lands captured by Israel in the 1967 war to the Palestinian people. Second, an account of how his son, Miko, followed Mattei into Israel’s special forces, became increasingly disillusioned with Zionist militarism and finally formed such strong bonds with his Palestinian counterparts that he now believes, and argues persuasively, that Israel/Palestine must be a single state--in fact, it already is one state, an apartheid state, within which the Jews dominate and discriminate against the Palestinians.That’s an unusual story for American readers to encounter but not unrelated to serious crises of conscience in both the Jewish and Palestinian populations of what originally was called Palestine. There are many people there who have lost loved ones to the ongoing conflict who don’t think continuing animosity make sense. I’d guess that the majority of both populations still thinks in terms of what is known as a “two-state solution,” but that is an idea that has not, for decades, gone anywhere. Instead, the Israelis have continuously built more settlements that diminish the Palestinians’ prospects of ever achieving a viable state. On top of that, these settlements have generated a need for massive protective barriers and special roadways on which Palestinians may not drive.Miko Peled’s account of the State of Israel, which he once served proudly, presents it as a nation ruled by succeeding generations of generals--brilliant leaders and politicians--who have overreached. The key novelty for me in this book is the assertion that in 1967 the Israeli cabinet did not direct the Israeli Defense Forces to occupy what is known as “the West Bank,” which formerly belonged to Palestinians under the 1947 partition. Rather, Israel’s key generals took that decision and made it a fait accompli. I also didn’t know that Matti Peled found the mysterious entity known as “the Gaza Strip” so repellant and unjust that he raised his concerns to Israel’s highest levels...without receiving an answer...from his friends and comrades in arms. Peled stood at the levels of Dayan and Rabin and was senior to famous Israeli leaders with a military background like Ariel Sharon and the current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. His son’s portrait of him is that of an introverted, somewhat authoritarian, brilliant, taciturn man who would not abandon his moral principles for any political gain. He wasn’t interested in going along with a project that betrayed its own value system. He preferred to get to know the Arab world and through knowing it become a vigorous advocate of Arab/Palestinian-Israeli understanding.This is fascinating. Matti Peled was a master of military logistics, acquisitions, and weapons development. Then in mid-career, he perfected his Arabic and became a man of letters and political culture, if you will.So there’s story one in this book.In story two, Miko falls out of love with the Israeli Defense Forces due to their wasteful arrogance and casual brutality. He follows a path that takes him deep into the martial arts. He founds successful businesses around his expertise in San Diego. And then his niece is killed in a Palestinian suicide attack in Jerusalem, and he begins putting himself on the line to try to figure out how to stop the carnage. First, he ventures into Jewish-Arab dialogues in Southern California. That’s demanding. Passions run high. Friends ask why he is talking with “those people.” Next, he works with fellow Rotarians to send wheelchairs to Israeli and Palestinian hospitals. Finally, he forms friendships with Palestinians in their chopped-up cities, towns, and villages.For the longest time, he thinks of himself as a two-state Zionist. Finally, he concludes that the Palestinians he knows are a natural affinity group for the Jews in cultural and even democratic terms. That’s when he turns away from the corrupting force of Zionism and commits himself to the dream of a single democratic state that puts Palestine back together whole, Jews and Muslims and others living side-by-side in peace.Miko isn’t a leading opinion-maker in Israeli thinking about the future of Palestine. He’s essentially a representative of a small minority that cannot bear the oppression the State of Israel imposes on the Palestinians. (Example: Netanyahu has explained that the Israeli settlements are a function of “natural growth,” as though the Palestinians don’t experience “natural growth,” too. Example: Golda Meir once indicated that for the longest time she had no idea that the Palestinians, i.e., the long-term residents of Palestine, were a people. This is more or less what Mitt Romney said--ignorance has a long shelf-life, apparently.) But in following his father’s path, Miko has found his way into a dynamic that may surprise us all over the next twenty years. How long before social media bring Israeli and Palestinian youth so close together that they can’t despise one another anymore? How long before the military credentials of so many Israeli leaders become less important than their diplomatic and economic credentials?Within 2013 we in the U.S. may find ourselves called to deal with an Israeli preemptive attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel is definitely our “friend;” we haven’t been real “friends” with Iran for a long time, if ever. But what are our interests and values, and how will the Obama administration express them? These are difficult questions. A diplomatic solution, which requires dialogue, compromise, and verification, would be far better both in the case of Iran and the Palestinians--better for the Israelis and better for Americans. The outcome, however, depends on whether people like Matti and Miko Peled, proponents of realistic peaceful engagement, prevail, or leaders who trust force more than words prevail.So this is an interesting and timely book, a personal book written against the backdrop of historic issues. As Miko freely admits, it is possible to disagree with him, but I don’t think it’s possible to deny that he’s been a man who has acted out of conscience, just like his father....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jan 22, 2013","Jan 22, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14649174-the-general-s-son

Short""My Escapee,"" a short story collection by Corinna Vallianatos is, like most short story collections, difficult to characterize in general terms. Short stories are unique, even when the same writer creates them. But most writers of short stories do have recurrent preoccupations and Vallianatos is no different.Several stories in this collection hinge on nostalgia, or simply memory. There's an underlying assumption that what is happening now (as in the title story) isn't as important as what happened a long time ago.All the stories in the collection reflect the perceptions of women, be they old, middle-aged, or young, even very young. One of the stories, ""Examination,"" concerns a school girl's experience of being excluded from a funeral; her parents apparently don't think she's old enough to face such a thing. Instead, she goes to school and is pulled out of class to be subjected to an odd assessment of whether she's smart enough to be transferred to a school for the gifted. It turns out that she's smart enough to flee the assessment and certainly smart enough to be able to go to a funeral and learn more there than at any school, a normal one or one for the gifted.Being excluded, being lonely, having a sense of disconnectedness…these are Vallianatos's additonal themes, and they often show up in male/female relationships wherein the female lets herself in for intimacy, even marriage, with a male who isn't her ideal, not even close.In two stories, ""Posthumous Fragments of Veronica Penn"" and ""Privations,"" Vallianatos pursues the mosaic approach to story-telling perhaps best exemplified by William Gass's masterpiece, ""In the Heart of the Heart of the Country."" These two stories are full of good writing, vivid images, and that sense of disconnectedness I mentioned above; it is built into the stories formally and underscored by the somewhat muffled and distant sense of self experienced by the protagonists.There are a few stories in this collection that for me, at least, aren't successful. ""Celebrants,"" revolving around college students, their rituals and relationships, is as uninteresting as college students, their rituals and relationships often are--they're our society's special class of babies, permitted to regress, overindulge, play-act, and waste more time mooning around than studying. Another story, the final one, ""A Civilizing Effect,"" focuses on a woman in her mid-fifties who just doesn't know who she is anymore. That can be a piquant topic. But there's no piquancy here, and the denoument is somewhat more slapstick than touching.I'd recommend reading this collection if you like reading short stories. There are some wonderful moments, there are some wonderful images, and there's generally a good sense of proportion, exploring but not overtaxing the short story form.""My Escapee"" won the ""Grace Paley Prize in Short Fiction."" Most university presses and many independent presses run such prize competitions. They receive 500-1000 submissions, winnow them down, and somehow come up with a winner. I imagine there's a revenue element here: these competitions typically carry $25 entry fees. But Grace Paley was really a special short story writer, and a prize bearing her name does make me smile. I read her work and spent an afternoon with her once. She talked and thought exactly in line with her idiosyncratic writing. All her stories had a large voice and compelling chararacterizations. Stylistically, she was tart, quick, and funny. So if you haven't read Grace Paley, or perhaps haven't even heard of her, take a look at her short stories while you're considering ""My Escapee.""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15893230-my-escapee

When what we used to know as Yugoslavia broke up in the early 1990s, violent struggles broke out engaging Croatians, Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croatians, and the major remaining power in the region, Serbia.	These struggles were as bad as what we now see in Syria and Afghanistan. They pitted neighbors against one another along ethnic and religious lines that had been peaceful for decades, even centuries.	The GHW Bush administration saw these Balkans’ clashes as the first chance for “Europe” to step up during the post-Cold War era and take on a problem in its backyard.	But as Henry Kissinger famously said, if someone could give you “Europe’s” phone number, there would be someone to call. To this day there is no such number.	As a consequence Bill Clinton’s first administration cautiously tip-toed into the breach. Horrors called “ethnic cleansing” occurred, largely perpetrated by Bosnian Serbs against Bosnian Muslims.	In mid-1994 Richard Holbrooke left Germany (where I was one of his senior advisors) for Washington to assume responsibility for European affairs at the State Department. His number one concern was that murky, tortured, foggy, beautiful, violent, mountainous region called “the Balkans.”	The strength of his book, leading to the famous Dayton Accords that put an end to fighting (more or less) in the Balkans, lies in its detailed account of how difficult and dangerous diplomacy can be in the midst of war.	Holbrooke, who died in 2010, was a superb writer (and the best extemporaneous speaker I’ve ever heard). He successfully conveys the nightmarish ups and downs of his shuttle missions through the Balkans leading to the Dayton negotiations. These missions involved deaths, freezing nights in unheated hotels, visits to presidents whose inner office walls were pockmarked with bullet holes, theatrics, temper tantrums, bureaucratic struggles, and a persistent reluctance on the part of the U.N. and to some degree “Europe” to use force--drop bombs--as a way of getting combatants’ attention.	As someone who served as an American diplomat for twenty-five years, I often wonder if Americans know how difficult it is for “Washington” to deal with problems abroad. When foreigners are at each others’ throats--as in Syria or Libya--they don’t want to listen to reason...they want to gain the last inch of land possible before they stop fighting.	Holbrooke was a theatrical man himself. He put on multiple acts all the time, raising and lowering his voice, laughing at himself, bullying others, issuing threats, mocking threats, and drawing on seemingly endless energy to not give in. 	He was a humanitarian; and he believed in the U.N.; yet he didn’t hesitate to call for military backup when needed. Did he always get it?	No, this book shows another difficult facet of diplomacy: the State Department doesn’t order the Pentagon around.	In fact, even a man of Holbrooke’s caliber couldn’t always get a seat in the highest councils when key decisions about the Balkans (for which he was responsible) were being made.	There are endless fascinating portraits of Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian leaders in this book. None is better than the picture Holbrooke paints of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia’s strongman. Milosevic was almost a Balkan Holbrooke when it came to schmoozing, haggling, and playing out discussions for five, ten, or more hours, looking for just a little something that hitherto had eluded him. He prided himself on his English, his knowledge of the U.S., and his ability to sing old pop songs from the Fifties. And in this book, because of the time period covered, he is not portrayed as what he ultimately was revealed to be: a war criminal. In fact, Milosevic’s trial at The Hague went on five years; he defended himself; he medicated himself; and when he was worn out, he took himself off the playing field with a fatal heart attack.	Holbrooke’s effectiveness in bringing about the Dayton Accords revolved around his own talents, his understanding that he had to surround himself with a small group of talented aides, and exceptional support from Warren Christopher, in particular. Bill Clinton made the ultimate decisions, but Holbrooke had Christopher at his side for long decisive encounters that overwhelmed historic animosities and put Bosnia on a new path. I’ve dealt with many secretaries of state. Until I read this book, I never knew how far Christopher would go--just as far as Holbrooke and with more on the line.	At the top of all great public issues, one tends to find just a few men and women. Bureaucracies don’t negotiate peace; bureaucracies tend to perpetuate negotiations forever like the lawyers in Dickens’ Bleak House. 	There are lots of stories about Richard Holbrooke that aren’t flattering. In many respects, he brought this upon himself by being a very rough guy to deal with. I won’t dwell on that, however. 	The final point I want to make, which is a double-edged sword, was Holbrooke’s constant reference (in this book and elsewhere) to “history.” He was always finding something historical in everything he did and everything he wanted someone else to do. I thought about that this afternoon as I was finishing his book. Part of his emphasis on history had to do with vanity and ego, no question. People at the top are full of vanity and ego, and it’s not always pleasant to be around. But Holbrooke did have a broad strategic vision of how individual pieces constituted the foundation of U.S. foreign policy, which during the last century was (and remains) our relationship with Europe. He was right about the slaughter in the Balkans. That slaughter was an offense to our collective conscience; it represented a virulent nationalism that can spread; it was a challenge to our diplomatic, military, political, and economic skills as peacemakers. If we couldn’t bring peace to the Balkans, ill winds would keep blowing. Was that the history we wanted to pass on? Definitely not.

The idea is that the interview will help Kathryn, the journalist, write about Hope, the artist. Hope is a well-known painter in her own right (she’s a Lee Krasner stand-in), and still active. But she’s not the equivalent of her husbands and lovers, who are pastiches of Jackson Pollock, Roy Liechtenstein, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Barnett Newman and the like.So the aesthetic arc Hope’s life follows runs from the earliest abstract impressionists to later Pop and Op Art types. At present she’s painting canvases in shades of gray, trying to find ways to make the various shades push and pull at one another.The strength of the book lies in Updike’s ability to verbalize abstract impressionism’s aspirations. He doesn’t believe in abstract impressionism, but he does a great job considering a field of paint that has no object, no story, nothing to represent except the beautiful moment of being within which the abstract impressionists worked.Updike is just about as good dealing with successor movements. He wanted to be a graphic artist before he became a writer, and he knows his stuff.There’s something empty about the way in which Hope relates her experiences with men and the art world. The men, especially the Pollock figure, don’t come alive for me. The better you know Pollock as a man, I suspect, the less interesting you find him. He was an enfant terrible in a sense, a Westerner, an alcoholic, a rule-breaker, and someone who, inevitably, met an early and violent death. It’s hard to imagine most of his acquaintances didn’t find him a bore, which is what he wanted to be (setting painting aside).Of course, Pollock’s art is powerful and unique, but in a novel, most of the main male characters can’t be paper thin, not palpable, just beings Hope, however well she knew them, describes.That’s a big flaw. Hope is personally quite interesting, almost exhaustively so. Updike pours into her his astonishing ability to perceive, name and connect things--be they doorknobs, reflections, alterations in the clouds, or the wings of nostrils. This can be funny, but at the same time, it’s an oddly concrete mode of rendering reality--very representational, not at all abstract, though somewhat expressionistic. I sometimes felt as though I were being subjected to Homeric catalogues. There’s a fair amount of descriptive brilliance that doesn’t make up for a real story.The real story is bookended between the morning when the Kathryn arrives in Vermont and the afternoon when she leaves. One day. In between, there’s tons of talk and tons of internal reflection on Hope’s part. The issue is whether the two women can find and believe in one another, I suspect. The answer is that they can’t. Updike forces Kathryn to keep asking Hope personal questions about sex with her men, and Hope doesn’t like it, and most readers won’t like it, either. So no matter how hard Hope works at reframing the exchange, she keeps failing. She can’t mother Kathryn, she can’t take her back and make her see exactly what here life was like, she can’t even get Kathryn to understand what being 70+ is like, and yet still working.Updike being Updike, you expect a lot of stylistic pirouettes and are grateful for them, you expect a lot of sex, and have your doubts about it, but you also cheer him on when he seeks the metaphysical in quotidian reality. He was a “believer,” a kind of optimist, and a single child whose primary narcissism was never injured. No matter how many times he experienced or witnessed personal setbacks (his own and others) he kept thinking God lurked around the corner, willing and able to make things better.I think this book should have been cut by 25%, but I wasn’t the editor in charge of telling John Updike that, and I doubt he would have listened. He was like Hope: he wanted to talk. So he talked. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Jan 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/181858.Seek_My_Face

N. forces.I found this novel to be interesting chiefly because of its point of view. The horrors of war recounted here are unfortunately commonplace and the situation in which the Chinese prisoners of war find themselves is commonplace, too. That doesn’t mean they aren’t shocking. They are. It just means war tends to be war, and being captured and brutalized tends to be pretty much the same everywhere.The one difference between this story and something by Dostoevsky or Solzhenitsyn is the constant and effective pressure exerted on Yu Yuan and others by the resourceful Communist Party leadership that stages various revolts and demonstrations during the captivity period. These Chinese soldiers, party members or not, don’t fall out with one another as often or as violently as is typical in other literatures. There’s fear, obedience, control, and ingenuity, but all of it revolves around fundamental Marxist-Leninist-Maoist doctrine. Yu Yuan has a simple style of relating how this works and manifests a kind of human solidarity with his fellow captives without, until the end of the novel, revealing the cynicism and betrayal the Party leaders have in mind.That’s what makes this book oddly compelling. The naiveté of Yu Yuan’s tale has to be overshadowed by what his readers must all know by the time he writes the last lines of his memoir: Mao Zedong was an arrogant, heartless, brutal giant whose pitiless leadership brought about as much wreckage as achievement. Those of us reading War Trash today know this. That’s undoubtedly part of what Ha Jin wants to capitalize on--our fuller sense of history. But at the same time Ha Jin succeeds in humanizing Mao’s pawns in the Korean War and making them seem, by and large, dignified, stoic, and generally caring individuals. This isn’t commonplace, not in the least, and Ha Jin deserves great credit for expressing the Chinese soldier’s viewpoint before letting China’s ultimately cynical Party perspective crush so many of the book’s minor heroes and protagonists.The Korean War, known widely in the U.S. as “the forgotten war,” was an early example of superpower conflict. Korea, in comparison to Japan, for instance, wasn’t of great strategic importance, but it did have symbolic political significance, and the contrast today between North and South Korea bears that out, justifying some of the sacrifices made. The North is a nightmare state. The South is a kind of boom state. A woman has just been elected president of South Korea. Yes, her father was once South Korea’s most notable dictators, but her triumph, set against the quasi-aristocratic succession of dictatorial rulers in North Korea, is a great one.In this context, Ha Jin slips in with his fictional account of the beginning of the North/South division.

It’s well-written	Korea: The impossible country by Daniel Tudor answers just about every challenge an introduction to a foreign nation one can image. It’s well-written, comprehensive (history, culture, foreign relations, politics, economy, education, family life and social mores).	In addition, Tudor’s book has the special advantage of being a recently released (2012) comment on a country that desperately needs foreign interpreters. Sandwiched between the great Asian powers (China and Japan) and divided by the 20th century’s two great ideologies (capitalism and communism), South Korea remains a marvel of national distinctiveness amidst modernity’s global homogeneity.	At the conclusion of the Korean war, which hasn’t really ended (there’s an armistice, not a peace), South Korea was physically devastated and demoralized. The occupation by Japan from the 30s to 1945 had been harsh and demeaning; the struggle to define Korea’s future before its civil war was inconclusive; the Korean War itself was a rampage of forces representing most of the world’s great powers up and down the length of the peninsula.	But Tudor is right that South Korea’s self-invention in the subsequent decades is unmatched anywhere. Now South Korea’s fifty million are relatively wealthy, their products are sought-after worldwide, and they even have a substantial influence throughout Asia thanks to their film and music industries.	His explanation of this turn-around is complex. On the one hand, he notes the extraordinary drive Confucianism and a sense of inferiority/victimhood have lent the South Korean workforce, which works harder and longer than just about any other workforce in the world. He also explores the virtual fanaticism South Koreans bring to the matter of education. South Korean kids study all the time, before school, during school, after school, on weekends and vacations. This generates top scores on global charts, especially in math and science. No wonder companies like Hyundai and Samsung produce such excellent products. On the other hand, he explores the dark side of South Korea’s drive to the top: high suicide rates, low birth rates, low levels of loyalty to firms that are not very loyal to their workers, extraordinary consumption of alcohol, which is socialized to the point of unconsciousness (an entirely acceptable ending to a typical wild night).	At this point, South Korea has just democratically elected its first female leader, daughter of its greatest dictator, so there are changes afoot in a country proud of the “pure blood” of its 5,000 year old history, but it’s a nation that is aging fast and registers near the bottom of most measures of happiness.	In its rush to the top, South Korea concentrated about half of its population into ugly apartment buildings in Seoul. The impact on “community” seems to have been strong. People don’t know their neighbors or have time for them. And yet in a broader sense, this is one of the least individualistic nations on the planet, as can be seen in its mega-churches and marriage practices, often mediated by match-makers focused more on the socio-economic prospects a couple might expect than on their affection for one another or personal compatibility. South Koreans like the feel of themselves as a crowd and a community even if there is a high level of personal anonymity within the larger group...and this is despite the manic emphasis on outstanding grades and complementary credentials.	Tudor writes well about about Korean food, for instance, and notes the Korean habit of presenting many dishes at a meal that are shared--your spoon, my spoon, his spoon--by everyone at the table. This is the kind of communal “boundary” that seldom is crossed in the West but nonexistent in South Korea.	At the same time, Tudor explores the magnetic attraction South Korea has had, economically, for immigrants from Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Each year South Korea becomes, by definition, more multicultural and somewhat more accepting and tolerant. By contrast, the walled kingdom of North Korea draws almost no one to work there, much less live there. Over time, this may moot the unification question, if South Korea’s gigantic economic achievements, vis-a-vis North Korea, haven’t already done so. The likelihood is that the two populations will grow further apart, not closer together, as the one “goes global” and the other remains stuck in its cave.	There are lengthy analyses in this book of South Korea’s musical scene, the kind of topic that’s hard to write about unless you really live it, and the kind of topic that’s essential if you want to explore “youth culture.” U.S. soldiers brought a lot of rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, and rock to South Korea. South Korea likes heart-breaking ballads, glitz with tears. Somehow South Korean musicians have managed to produce both kinds of music and generated large audiences at home and abroad.	Occasionally Tudor repeats facts and observations, which is as much the editor’s fault as his own, and there are times when he seems over-reliant on certain sources and/or “informants.” But this is a broad, quick study, not a scholarly study in depth.

Susan Burling marries Oliver Wade in the latter part of the 19th century. She is an artistic/literary-minded Easterner. Oliver’s calling is to pursue opportunities as a mining engineer in the West. Their story is reconstructed by their grandson, Lyman Ward, working from Susan’s letters and other documents in 1970. So the novel takes place in two timeframes. Lyman tells his own story, marked by a recent leg amputation and retirement from teaching as a professor of history, as he recounts his grandparents’ story.	The term “angle of repose” refers to the angle at which soil finally settles after, for example, being dumped from a mine as tailings. But it also refers, in this case, to the angle at which the entire Ward clan will finally settle. Specifically, will Lyman forgive his wife for abandoning him right after his leg amputation, or is the settling of his fate, like his grandparents’ fate, now permanently determined?	The relationship between Susan and Oliver, marked by long separations mandated by his wandering calling, resembles the core relationship between man and wife Stegner also explores in The Big Rock Candy Mountain. In that novel, too, the husband is constantly pursuing dreams that don’t pan out and the wife is half-abandoned, though deeply loved. A difference here is that Susan Burling is a talented woman, an accomplished illustrator, and a professional writer who specializes in “tales of the west” for notable Eastern publications.	She’s strong, charming, somewhat romantic, and loyal up to a point. Stegner skillfully brings that loyalty to a breaking point in Idaho, where she may--or may not--succumb to the suit of a friend and partner of Oliver’s, Frank Sargent. 	Lyman Ward, who’s telling this story, prefers to leave the sexual aspect of this affair in some doubt. What’s clear, however, is that the affair is somehow related to both the drowning of one of Susan and Oliver’s children and the suicide of Frank Sargent. These events confirm the breach between Oliver and Susan that lasts for the rest of their lives, although they still live together in parallel sadness.	Stegner may be a little bit less gifted than Willa Cather in describing the physical beauty of the American West, but not by much. Angle of Repose is a tour de force of setting, including rivers, cliffs, mesas, sage flats, clouds, storms, winds, canyons, and the way the weather works its way into the human face.	This is the second time I’ve read Angle of Repose, and I think I liked it better this time because I wasn’t quite so overwhelmed by the misery and drama of mining camp life and I was more receptive, for some reason, to the interpolated chronicles of Lyman Ward’s efforts to reconstruct his grandparents’ tale. He is writing more or less at the peak of the cultural/sexual revolution in America, a stark contrast to the Victorian times of Susan and Oliver, and confronted by divorce and substantial physical pain and limitation. His housekeeper’s daughter, Shelley, undertakes the role of his secretary/assistant, but she’s also a provocateur, a woman of 20 who thinks the niceties of what he writes, and what he apparently thinks, are quaintly and uselessly old-fashioned. So she pushes Lyman, who’s a bit hung up over her habit of not wearing a bra under her T-shirt, into focusing on a crucial point: will he declare his own life “over” at 58 just as, in his opinion, Susan’s life was “over” at about 37?	The first time I read the novel, I found Shelley annoying and unimportant. This time it seemed to me that she gets under Lyman’s skin in a useful way. I admired her taking an interest in him. She wants to know what life is all about, too, and just as Susan and Oliver are Lyman’s path to understanding, Lyman in a way is her path to understanding.	One issue that lies at the core of Angle of Repose is the definition of the term “affair.” In today’s usage, it generally signifies sexual activity. So we sometimes put it this way: “They had a sexual affair.” When we do that, we’re perhaps unintentionally contrasting a “sexual affair” with something else, what used to be called “an affair of the heart.” Lyman clearly thinks the latter, original usage is more meaningful, and so does Oliver. Lyman also clearly feels that Shelley’s sexual liberation is superficial promiscuity, little more. This is a point that matters to him, and he does a wonderful job in the key encounters between Susan and Frank spelling out all the attachments and considerations a married woman with children must take into account as a single-minded predatory male makes his simplistic if passionate moves on her. Shelley’s attitude--what the hell, sex is sex, big deal--inadvertently confirms Lyman’s point. There’s little reason to focus so exclusively (as we tend to do) on sex per se, when the more troubling questions attach to non-physical sentiments: Is this longing of mine real? Can I bear my husband’s stoic reserve another week, another year, another decade? What would I tell my children--here’s your new father? 	And yet in a subtle, persuasive passage, Lyman concedes something: As long as Susan is able to defend herself with words, she’s all right. But when Frank touches her, in this case grasps her bare foot, the equation changes. Touch, Stegner argues, breaks the glass of reason and lets other forces through. So maybe the sexual consummation preceding remorse, guilt, and ultimately tragedy really did occur, for Frank’s hand might have conveyed something he could not articulate so powerfully any other way.	Do you feel some degree of regret when you finish a novel? Do you feel that the world you’re involved in imaginatively is more real than your daily existence? Do you wish that you had the novelist’s gift of compressing your life experience in such a way that only the important parts occurred, and you had the perspective to appreciate their importance and connectedness as they occurred? If so, Angle of Repose is a book that you should read if you haven’t read it...and re-read if you’ve only read it once. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2012","Dec 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/292408.Angle_of_Repose

First, it doesn’t take long to get to the end. Second, it doesn’t take long to get to the middle, which is when the novel comes together and becomes fun.	This is a book about doubles, the chief double being one man another man encounters who looks, to the second man, exactly like him. Again, around the middle of the book, we begin to get the idea: Man two will kill man one and use man one’s corpse as a means of swindling an insurance company.	The problem is, as we begin hurtling forward in the second part of the book, that man one really doesn’t look much like man two. So the police come upon the corpse of man one dressed in man two’s clothes, see that he isn’t man two, and put out an alert to arrest man two.	Now this is probably too much action for a Nabokovian fiction, but Despair was one of Nabokov’s first novels, and he apparently still felt he had to kick his predecessors in the shin, mocking Dostoevsky (Crime and Punishment, The Double) in particular with lots of spinning, frenzied plot.	But Nabokov never excelled with plot. His great gift always was, and it shows up here, a comic gift for sensual description and characterization. This required the inventive use of alluring words like “pale,” “puce,” “plum,” and “puff.” Said words were then attached to characters’ faces, lips, waistcoats, and manners of speech, as in, “The pale fellow hooked his thumbs in the slit pockets of his puce waistcoat and puffed out his lips despairingly, wishing he’d eaten that plum when he’d had a chance on the afternoon train.”	I made that sentence up, of course, and have deliberately overwritten it to make a point. In Nabokov we have the arch-artist who takes the position that words are everything in literature and literature is nothing but words. As William Gass wrote, there is nothing about a character’s face in a story except his exclamatory eyebrows and bristly nostrils if that is all the author has given us to consider. The character has no mouth, no ears, no hair, no double chin...nothing but the details proffered by the author. This, he suggests, and Nabokov concurs, is the point and purpose of literature: to find and fix on an essence and milk it for aesthetic pleasure, not mistake it for “the real thing.”	What Nabokov does allow with respect to “reality,” and this shows up in the ramblings of our self-deluded unreliable narrator in Despair, is the permanence and inescapability of memory. One is always a double, in a sense, because one is only what one remembers of a former self...the self of yesterday or ten years ago. Literature, fortunately, allows us to excavate that self, or imitate it, or echo it with words, descriptions, interactions...stories. These are not “true” things, but they’re all we’ve got: we are what we are able to claim, persuasively, to remember. That’s us doubling ourselves, generating in the process, laughter as well as despair. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 18, 2012","Dec 18, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/418209.Despair

My host said I therefore had to read it and gave me his personal copy. Soon a basic question presented itself that remains valid: What is there to compare with Conversations in the Cathedral for sensuous corruption, betrayal, a society in decay, a politics of criminality? Something by Balzac or Conrad? Robert Penn Warren’s All the King’s Men? 	Strange, because Cochabamba is a delightful town full of light, flowers, good beer, and magnificent filet mignon, but the young Vargas Llosa had a somber tale to tell, and he told it with riveting power. His account of Peru in the 1950s enveloped me. Here was one of the great Latin American writers of the latter half of the 20th century, young but already in full stride. 	Vargas Llosa has written many novels since then, including The Bad Girl (2006), the subject of this . All of them are marked by his fluid narrative style, his quick eye, his feel for the tragically comic in life, and that perplexing vividness manifested by characters who hide everything and nothing at the same time--always declaiming, always obscuring...making great speeches while hiding great secrets.	The Bad Girl tells the tale of a middle-class Peruvian boy whose life’s aspiration is to live and die in Paris and a lower class Peruvian girl--a con artist of the first order--whose life’s aspiration is to live far beyond the means of that unambitious boy, torment him for loving her, and wreck herself with greed, resentment, and daring.	Of course this sounds like a dreary, horrific book, and in substance, it is. Yet somehow Vargas Llosa pulls off the feat of portraying “the bad girl” tormenting every man she seduces and subjecting herself, at the same time, to increasing levels of physical and psychological abuse without losing touch with the story’s, and the bad girl’s, fundamental élan.	She is a poor kid in Lima who wants better...all the time better. She is an impostor. She is a liar. She is foolish enough to fall into the hands of a sadistic voyeur in Tokyo whose practices half ruin both her vagina and her rectum. She is foolish enough never to let Ricardo Samocurcio hold onto her and keep her well. But she, and he, somehow stagger forward, decade after decade, falling out and then getting back together against his better judgment (he can’t help himself) and hers (she can’t help herself either.)	So what we have here is the history of a passion and a perversion, a reinterpretation of a love story that not even Shakespeare would dare. Only the “Lesbia” of Catullus approaches, it seems to me, the levels of degradation and torment the bad girl forces on Ricardo. Odi et amo, Catullus wrote: I hate and I love. Something of the same goes on here. The bad girl is Ricardo’s Lesbia. He sees this clearly...he swears her off...but when finally she is about to die...what do you think, does he take her back?...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 14, 2012","Dec 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/615208.The_Bad_Girl

The protagonist, Trond, speaks in two time zones: in one chapter he offers an account of the austere life he is building for himself in the Norwegian countryside as an old man; in the next chapter he is recalling a summer he spent with his father elsewhere in the Norwegian countryside.The connective tissue between these two time zones, fifty years apart, is the consistency and precision of Trond’s tone and style. A great deal of who he is, perhaps a great deal of whom Norwegians are, is manifested not in speech so much as in active perception of the physical environment: this wind, that snow, those geese, these shadows, such a hard fall, such a soft hand...In an earlier  of a Petterson book (I Curse the River of Time), I commented on the Hemingwayesque quality of his writing. To that I’d add some Cormac MacCarthy in this case (covering the son/father relationship) and some Walker Percy (covering the restrained days of old age.)The dominant storyline is Trond learning that as a resistance courier in WWII, his father fell in love with a neighbor’s wife and that as a man recovering from WWII, he intends to leave his own wife and steal that neighbor’s wife for himself.Along with Trond’s own sensual development, these insights into a father’s moral nature make the boy into a man, but they don’t make him hate his father because he values his company, his care, and his passion so much.The passages where nothing much happens are some of the best in this book; they call up the quality of endless being that youth and summertime have combined for so many of us, even those of us not lucky enough to pass our adolescence under the blue blue skies of Norway.There are some intriguing, rather unexplored subplots tucked into this short novel that are relatively undeveloped. In fact, the passage of fifty years from adolescence to old age is more or less untouched. Trond had at least one marriage, two daughters (one of whom briefly appears), and some kind of firm he sold to finance his final retreat into the countryside. But none of that is worth accounting for. What matters is that he has come to a place where he can be alone...simply alone.I always find this trope challenging. As a writer I spend a lot of time alone, both writing and ruminating, and I value the fact that I don’t go to an office, don’t have colleagues, don’t have meetings, don’t have to do much of anything I don’t want to do. But to live in rural isolation, taking note of the weather, fixing up the cabin, visiting the store once or twice a week...having no phone...just my books and memories?To me it seems that would be a huge imaginative and philosophical task. There are times every day when I need some relief from the demands of mental monasticism. Active consciousness (aka thinking and perceiving, not just drifting along) is a burden, it’s heavy. Perhaps the closest I come to experiencing Trond’s kind of practical engagement in the thingness of the natural world is backpacking, where the senses and taking care of yourself are the fullness of the experience. But the appeal of backpacking, of course, has something very much in common with Trond’s recollected and ongoing existence north of Oslo: it’s elemental, it’s basic, it probes the corporeal aspect of being human, one is conscious in rhythms that are broadly natural rather than social.Petterson closes with an observation that echoes a comment Trond’s father makes earlier in the book: “we do decide for ourselves when it will hurt.”I find this an interesting coda and in keeping with the unsentimental quality of his writing. There are characters here--all of them, in fact--who are in some way hurt, badly hurt, but the novel is selective in worrying about them, and in old age Trond is prepared to cast aside those who to him don’t much matter anymore. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 10, 2012","Dec 10, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/398323.Out_Stealing_Horses

He then uses his time to do something I won’t describe because it would spoil things for future readers...but it’s good and powerful.The question then becomes what to do with one’s life after losing one’s anchor in the solitude of the French countryside. This is a question that Railles answers by returning to an America he neither knows anymore nor much likes, but he does find a spot for himself on the coast of Maine. There he has a final encounter with Bernhard and a French intelligence officer who helped capture the terrorists...and all three explore the title of the book--forgetfulness: does one brood about the past, relive its bitterness and pursue its fleeting sweetness, or does one allow time to erase itself and keep on exploring the mystery of things?Railles’s answer seems to be to plunge ahead. Earlier I said he wasn’t a man of action, but that’s only in the conventional sense. In the aesthetic sense--in which a brush stroke is an action, the conception of a form is an action--he is in touch with a breadth of possibilities that far exceeds wars on terrors, the happenstances of violence, and the dismal plotting and counter-plotting of CIA agents and terrorists, competent and not so competent.Forgetting is an excellent, well-written, engaging book full of interesting French and American characters--and a few Brits. It reads somewhat like a very low-key Alan Furst novel. At times the reductionism of relying on current events to contextualize the story thins its effects. I think we’ve all read too much newspaper journalism about Kennedy’s Camelot, the bodies falling off the Trade Towers, and Bush’s blunder in Iraq, to need be reintroduced to them yet again as the thin connecting tissue of a more powerful novelistic plot.We want to know about Thomas and Florette and we want to know how Thomas confronts the moral dilemmas posed by the terrorists captured and interrogated (harshly) before his eyes. We don’t want to know that the bad guys were planning on doing something nasty in Holland, especially since the novel never gets to Holland.I particularly enjoyed the detail and accuracy of Just’s depiction of French provincial life and its personalities and a subplot involving Railles’s relationship with a centenarian Brit who didn’t really desert in WWI, he just walked off the battlefield in shell shock and never returned.Just’s overriding point, I think, is that one can remember and remember and change nothing or one forget some things, some bad things, and change nothing just as well. We always fiddle as if we can alter the course of life instead of following it to see where it goes.

Something has gone wrong and the author is there not to put things right but to delineate the wrongness. In After Dark Murakami traces the actions of a cast of characters who interact in a distant way, shielded from understanding by the absence of light in Tokyo from midnight to six in the morning. This, at least, is a larger canvas than the one Auster affords himself, but the net result is the same: the world we live in is peopled by shallow individuals who can barely hear one another speak and and wouldn’t understand if they could.The charm of Murakami’s book is its casual use of cultural argot: late-teens talking, the manager of a “love hotel” philosophizing, the general sense that televisions watch us, we don’t watch televisions. But then there is some violence, irrational, hurtful, and without warrant. This, of course, is not charming; it’s sinister and disturbing.I might not have read this book if I hadn’t had a call from Tokyo recently. A friend asked me what I thought of the possibility that Murakami might be awarded the Nobel prize for literature. To the head this off, the friend asked, did it make sense to write an opinion piece pointing out that Murakami is a more-or-less westernized creation of New York agents and the New Yorker, not a profound figure within the Japanese literary world?I said I didn’t know. I’d read one book of Murakami’s short stories--which reads just like After Dark--and I thought they were exercises in minimalist frenzy and nihilism with humanizing snippets woven into the text. What’s “cool” about Murakami’s characters is how little they need to keep surviving, how little they have by way of expectation, and how remote they are from their monumental surroundings: the vastness of Tokyo or other cities in modern Japan.I certainly didn’t think, from that book, or now from this one, that Murakami should be awarded the Nobel prize, but then I’ve never had a high opinion of the Nobel prize. As far as I know, no one in the academy that awards the prize reads Japanese--one strike against it--but then, since the prize went to a Chinese writer this year--and no one in the academy reads Chinese, either--it’s hard to take the Nobel prize seriously. Somehow James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges didn’t win the Nobel prize, and I could mention a host of other writers of stature in excess of the Nobel laureates. It’s a prize, there’s a lot of money involved, and Doris Lessing, bless her, regarded it as a nuisance.To return to After Dark itself, this is an episodic narrative in which chance encounters between denizens of the darkness cause them to reveal themselves briefly to one another and occasionally cross wires. Some are kind and curious, others distant and indifferent. A point being made here seems to be that narrative can have moments of interconnected plot, but please, not too much. Murakami did win a prize that bears Franz Kafka’s name. The problem I have with this is that Kafka’s parables are dense, coherent, and oppressive without succumbing to riffs of randomness. “We,” which is a narrative summons in Murakami that’s hard to respond to, share an ironic perspective on deep moral and emotional issues in Kafka. There’s humor, but it’s not cheap and flat; there’s pain, but it’s connected to a substratum of psychic tension that is unrelenting, not simply an accident of modernity. So I don’t see Murakami in Kafka’s league although I understand why he may be associated with him.I think I’d recommend reading After Dark or some other book by Murakami for those who enjoy finding in literature the kind of flat, evasive experience they find in life. This is fashionable writing, I suppose, like wearing nothing but black. It reveals little, but then there may be little to reveal....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 04, 2012","Dec 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17803.After_Dark

He’s a narrow-minded, unimaginative fellow who outclimbed his talent and has alienated his wife, son and daughter with his relentless self-preoccupation and sense of personal importance.Grushin moderates this negative effect with prose that dances along, sometimes overwritten, in the manner of her great Russian predecessors. Gogol and Nabokov come to mind. Beyond that, Grushin embeds her narrative in a series of dream sequences that let Sukhanov wander in the first person (sometimes remembering the poignant disappointments of his earlier life, his father’s suicide, his mother’s impoverishment), and provide a more full picture of the soul he left behind when he signed on as a Party arbiter, more committed to truth than beauty.In the fifties and early sixties, Sukhanov succumbed to fear of the State, fear of life as a poor painter, and fear that he couldn’t get along without ultimately garnering a fine apartment, a staff, a car and driver, and a dacha outside Moscow.So this is a story about his life falling apart almost from the first page. Bit by bit he loses his family, his job, his stature, and his illusions. He’s crushed the way so many characters in Russian literature are crushed; it’s what we have come to expect, isn’t it? The hero of our times is no hero at all; he’s a schmuck; he needs to wake up.His son, daughter, and wife, Nina, are critical to Sukhanov’s awakening, but none plays a greater role than his long-abandoned best friend, Lev Belkin, who didn’t have Grushin’s talents as a painter but had more persistence--a nobody of a painter, but one who remained true to his earliest visions and aspirations.Grushin deftly moves from the reality of Sukhanov’s demise to the possibilities of a revival still smoldering somewhere in his much neglected Russian soul. Here we are in a realm of dreamy magic realism, perhaps not entirely persuasive, but inspired by the colors and phantasmagoria of Chagall, who lurks in the background of the entire novel.The question I personally would ask is whether a man who has been locked up within the “system” for decades can emerge as a free spirit in his fifties. Grushin wants us to believe in this possibility.

He’s a photographer at first for a Washington, D.C. newspaper. Then he becomes a free-lancer. He works with a Leica. He’s a good technician. And he is a man without any great ambition.This confounds his father, a long-time senator who knew presidents from FDR through Johnson. Kim Malone wanted Alex to follow him in public life. No chance. Alex doesn’t even want to go to Vietnam when he’s offered the opportunity to do a tour there as a photographer for his newspaper.When the time comes to marry, he stumbles upon an au pair girl from Switzerland, Lucia, who effectively leaps into his arms. They buy a house in Georgetown; they have a child, Mathilde; and in time, Lucia is drawn into an affair with an Hungarian writer who takes her back to Europe with him.Alex isn’t exactly crushed. He goes on with life and forms a sometimes relationship with a beautiful Hollywood actress a few years his junior.He also spends time with his dying father, reminiscing. In his way, he tries to answer the questions both parents wanted answered about him: What was it about him? Why didn’t he care about things people tended to care about in Washington? Why did he shy away from opportunities? He could have had Vice President Johnson at his wedding. Nope, he preferred to elope. No Lyndon Johnson. No Hubert Humphrey. Certainly no Jack and Jackie.The smooth skill with which Just writes this novel, coupled with his knowledge of Washington, D.C. and other world capitals, almost compensates for the complacency and aversion to conflict that lie at the center of Alex’s being. Just does a great job with exiles and cocktail parties and D.C. neighborhoods (I live here, and I can assure you his descriptions are on the money), but he doesn’t do such a great job working up living, breathing characters, people who boil the way people boil, worry, fret, fight, doubt...Toward the end of the novel, Alex buries his father with no great fanfare (as one would expect) and Lucia is reunited with a father who disappeared when she was three (living in Prague with her mother at the time, she had no memories of the man.) In fits and starts, we learn that Lucia’s father was sucked into World War II and then some form of the Soviet gulag for the better part of twenty years. He was a resistance fighter, a renegade, a risk-taker, a brute, a survivor, and generally speaking a man who lived a life full of conflict, which he managed to overcome.The combination here of Lucia and Alex’s fathers (the senator was a tough pol) brings Alex to realize that his life, like his photographs, lacks one essential ingredient: conflict.He’s not exactly remorseful about this and not without resources, even though he’s losing his sight. He still has the initiative to head up to Maine to think things through...still has the self-confidence to head off sailing into waters that might be more treacherous than they appear.So what we have here is a very enjoyable, deftly written book that is superficially astute and accurate but lacking in heart, in psychological depth, in pain.Where does this place Exiles in the Garden in terms of Washington novels? The funny thing is that Just knows and accepts Washington to such an extent that he lets the good order and proceduralism of the place dominate his text. There’s a life cycle in this city that sort of goes this way: you start out trying to make something of yourself in government and public affairs, you make something of yourself, then you drift out of the rat race of government/public affairs activities into the comforts of worldly acquaintances, reasonably good restaurants, and a hospice overlooking the 16th hole of some well-appointed country club. And then you die and people who remember you tell stories about you for a while. And then they stop telling stories because they die, too.In this case, Just skips the “trying to make something of yourself” phase and lets his protagonist skip along like a well-thrown stone on the smooth surface of a lake. This is a shortcut that doesn’t quite work as well in literature as it does in the northwest quadrant of Washington.D.C. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2012","Nov 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6251346-exiles-in-the-garden

Many years ago I had been deeply engaged in reading William Faulkner and believed no one could take his work another step further. Gabriel Garcia Márquez’ One Hundred Years of Solitude changed my opinion on that. Faulkner stands as a giant and so does Márquez, having learned some Faulknerian lessons and taught us a few of his own.	I then began to read Cormac McCarthy’s work and somewhat slowly fell under his spell, but ultimately I surrendered to his mastery, never more present than in his parable-novel, The Road. This is a work seemingly set somewhat west of Faulkner territory with all the life, all the history, all the relations, all the everything blown out of it.	A father and son journey through an utter wasteland. How the wasteland came to be isn’t explained. What will happen to it isn’t suggested. There seem to be other survivors of whatever happened--one would assume some kind of nuclear firestorm raged across every square inch of the earth and sea--and the father likes to play along with the son’s idea that there are good people among them as well as bad people.	Almost every paragraph of this book is poetry. It excels in taking the humblest of objects and experiences and magnifying their importance to the point that a vista or a locked door or a layer of ashes rippling in the wind assumes metaphysical significance.	As usual McCarthy works wonders with landscapes, patterns of land upon land, heaps of sky upon sky, desolation in the turbid waters of the ruined sea. He also creates a symbiotic relationship between father and son that is so true, loyal, loving, and stalwart that it’s heartbreaking on more than one very difficult day.	The Road is a mystery much as Waiting for Godot is a mystery. Each reader will fill in the gaps in his or her own way, but the challenge is two-fold. First, the reader must sense the apocalypse somewhere in the air; if nothing in you tells you the world could one day come to an end, this isn’t a book for you. Second, the reader has to love lush and yet precise writing more than plot. 	Faulkner isn’t for everyone. A lot of readers can’t follow him, think he’s overwrought and so forth. Gabriel Garcia Márquez’ magical realism has been so widely imitated that to some readers, the real thing might come across as a cliche. McCarthy is so intense, so distilled, so controlled within such a narrow bandwidth of human love, suffering and calamity that some readers surely will just not enjoy his work, even find it boring.	But I’m a reader who thinks McCarthy is a great writer and The Road is a great book. This book is a nightmare, it’s a tale of deprivation, it’s a tale of survival, and it’s an omen, one we should heed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 25, 2012","Nov 25, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6288.The_Road

Why is this novella so important?I can’t help focusing on the moment in which the book was published. 1774: the majesty of kings was fading, likewise the power of the church. Western Europe was on the eve of a romantic moment when passions and outsized emotions, often reflected in or seen in wild natural settings, began to substitute the grandeur of individual subjectivity for the grandeur of institutional objectivity.Love and jealousy unbounded run through every page of Werther. In a sense, he’s a self-indulgent, foolish young man who kills himself when he can’t have Lotte, who already was engaged to Albert when he met her. In another sense, however, he acquires an enviable depth of conviction and loyalty to his emotions.At the critical moment in the action--before his suicide, that is--Werther embraces and kisses Lotte as he has longed to do. This is a confession on both sides. Obviously he was in love with her. He, she and Albert all knew it. Obviously he wasn’t returning to her home village again and again out of mere friendship. And obviously, Lotte bears some responsibility for enjoying the way in which he adored her. She pushes him away, but at least this much has come out between them: had things been different, she certainly would have welcomed his suit.Europe at that time was on the eve of convulsions we may not have seen conclude. It’s hard to lay all the blame on romanticism, but time and again, the vertigo of living through periods of failing states and raging egos brought on revolution, war, and mindless sacrifice.It’s in this sense that Goethe was ahead of his times. His young Werther, not all that impressive a young man, became a symbol of modernity. He was unbridled subjectivity. When his mood was such that the fields and valleys were beautiful, so it was. When his mood darkened, the fields and valleys darkened, too.The novel expertly draws to a conclusion, terminating the epistolary nature of the narrative and resting in the hands of an unknown, unnamed “editor.” He does a fine job of stitching the action, more bits of letters, and different perspectives together.What we have to imagine--and here comes the challenge to the historical imagination--is a readership that had never encountered a figure so rich with passion, self-contradiction, and self-destructiveness, at least not in the novel form.It’s said, and I agree, that Goethe’s vigor comes more from his study of Shakespeare than Racine or Corneille. So we won’t suppose that Othello hadn’t registered on the European consciousness, but again, this was a book, a private experience, in a new age of reading, not the theatrical framework of Shakespeare’s London or Racine’s Paris, for that matter. As such, the subjective, the private, the intimate, comes to the fore. There’s no crowd around you when you read a book; you’re in the book alone; you’re in there with the tormented Werther. He oppresses you; you worry for him; you can see he’s being led on; you can see he doesn’t care...you can see that this kind of living won’t end well, not at all well.The death scene and its aftermath are wonderful. They have just the right pace and remind me of the wrap-up at the end of Hamlet, in particular.As a final note, I want to come back to the translation. One of the precepts Corngold followed was not to use any word that wasn’t in use in 1774. This hasn’t impaired the translation, although I am not sure what the connection is between German in 1774 and English in 1774. At one point, I was surprised to see the word “whoosh.” I haven’t checked the OED; undoubtedly Corngold has. But I highlight it to make a different point. This is the first time I’ve read Werther in English. The German is, in fact, full of analogs to the word “whoosh.” By this I meant at Goethe had a gift for writing a stormy, throaty, physical kind of German that whooshes through the eyes and ears. As Werther’s mood darkens, so does Goethe’s German: it becomes more muscular, ominous, and stormy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 20, 2012","Nov 20, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10773231-the-sufferings-of-young-werther

The story line is as follows: For scant reason having to do with him as a particular Jew, Shaltiel is kidnapped in New York city by terrorists and held hostage in the hopes that his captors can effect an exchange--Shaltiel’s freedom for the freedom of three imprisoned Palestinian freedom fighters. The site of his incarceration is some kind of basement.Shaltiel’s history is that as a boy he was saved from German extermination camps during World War II by being hidden in a basement (by a German officer), so the irony is apparent: here he is in a basement again, once a hostage, always a hostage.He is abused and mistreated more in New York than he was in Eastern Europe during World War II. His modern day captors are a brutal Arab extremist and an Italian revolutionary who fundamentally is an anarchist but has allied himself with the Palestinian cause.Much of the story occurs through Shaltiel’s memory of what happened to his family members during World War II and the Holocaust and what he recalls of his own life afterward, leading to his profession: he’s a story-teller, sometimes writer, and general memorialist of things Jewish, 20th century back to King David...and beyond that.The tale emerges in bits and pieces: sometimes first person, sometimes third person, sometimes present tense, sometimes past tense, sometimes news clippings and bulletins, sometimes omniscient narration designed to set the stage for U.S./Israeli cooperation in rescuing Shaltiel. (They won’t negotiate as a matter of policy.)The best sections of this novel have to do with Shaltiel’s frustrating love for his wife, Blanca; the flirtation one family member has with communism during World War II, and a lovely story about a man who plays a violin that has no strings.A light haze of Jewish mysticism hangs over this novel. There are moments, vignettes, and anecdotes that acquire a dream-like quality, not only reflecting Shaltiel’s stress and pain but also his ongoing confusion about God, whom he never renounces, just as he never gives in to the demand that he sign some kind of statement denouncing Zionism and confirming the justice of the kidnappers’ demands.Even as someone who has always believed that the Jews have a right to a Jewish state in Palestine, I’ve never believed the Palestinians didn’t have a similar right. In a sentence or two, Wiesel portrays them as casting away that right when they, in effect, did not agree to a two-state solution in the mid-1940s. Then the Palestinians are portrayed, through these kidnappers and their ranting, as determined to reclaim all of Palestine by means of violence. History shows that yes, the Palestinians and their Arab brothers and sisters have employed violence numerous times against Israel. They’re doing it now out of Gaza. But there are two sides to every story, and this is a one-sided story. For a novel preoccupied with justice, that’s a problem. Rather than spell out the Palestinian perspective (which can be done in great detail), I’ll stick to purely novelistic issues for the moment and set the ongoing Israeli/Palestinian conflict aside.This could have been a more effective book if it focused more exclusively on Shaltiel’s relationships with the German who helped him survive, with his family, with Blanca, and with the relative who misguidedly adopted communism as his new religion, only to have Stalin drive him from Moscow to Jerusalem, where he reunited with his true faith.Reviewers and readers aren’t welcome to rewrite authors’ books for them, but my sense is that Wiesel could have accomplished more by using less of the material he packs into a 213 page novel. He offers an abundance of story-telling wisdom, which flows naturally through Shaltiel the story-teller’s mind, that could easily have been exploited to better effect. Ultimately, this is a cosmic and religious meditation; at least that’s where I think its strength lies and the thematic framework within which Wiesel has written with great power for so long....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2012","Nov 18, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13155834-hostage

O’Nan’s strength is that he makes it real through minute, accurate observations of the couple’s interactions (from both perspectives) in the context of a two-day visit to an appalling tourist destination (not Niagara Falls’ fault).As I followed what occurs between Art and Marion during their sojourn into reckless gambling, including bedroom, whirlpool, and bar scenes, I couldn’t help thinking of some of John Updike’s Rabbit books and Richard Ford’s Independence Day. Updike was able to make American commercial shlock and meaningless sex sparkle with his dancing style. Ford generally is a more sour and flat critic of contemporary culture in the USA; there’s more overt pain in his work than in Updike’s. O’Nan clearly knows our lifestyle is both thin and dangerous to our souls and wallets, but neither he nor his characters take much issue with the general erosion of civilization that leads, somewhat inevitably, to lots of troubled marriages. Things don’t look good; but they are what they are; and who can do anything about it?The backstory is that Art had an affair twenty some years ago, and Marion never forgave him. She did, however, have her own affair with a woman, and continues to keep that secret. This tit-for-tat seems to lie at the core of Art’s neediness and Marion’s somewhat generous ambivalence toward him. She’s expert at turning away from him when he wants sex, but she feels guilty about it. So she gives him what he wants, which he tends to think is his gift to her, and then wishes she hadn’t because she knows what she really wants is to separate, live free, get her own place and disentangle herself from him, their past, and their financial crisis.The brevity, quick pace, good dialogue, insightful details that abound in The Odds compensate to a certain extent for the fact that the really important events in these two lives are only remembered in snatches. We don’t know why Art had his affair. We aren’t really with Marion when she goes through the full stages of a relationship with another woman. We aren’t in the kitchen when Art and Marion are hit in the face by the reality that they really will, having lost their jobs, lose their home. This is the big stuff, not the entertaining but essentially unimportant issue of whether they win or lose playing roulette according to Art’s carefully devised method.In newspaper jargon, O’Nan has buried his lead. This would be a more compelling book if it took us step by step through the insults and injuries that have brought Art and Marion to emotional and financial ruin. Once we had that in hand, we’d care more about the edgy gamble they undertake to somehow keep them off the streets and in touch with one another as life goes on....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 16, 2012","Nov 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11797352-the-odds

The setting primarily is pre-Alan Furst’s MISSION TO PARIS has all the qualities-- but perhaps a little more optimism --that usually mark his novels. The setting primarily is pre-WWII Paris, and the focus is on Germany’s attempt to co-opt Fredric Stahl (a lower-level Hollywood movie star born in Vienna) into supporting the Third Reich’s political warfare against France before the outbreak of fighting. Stahl is in Paris to shoot a movie, and the message is that if he doesn’t help Germany demoralize the French and nudge them toward capitulation, he might get shot himself.So the novel offers a shadowy, inevitably romantic view of Paris, Germany’s expert intimidation tactics, and the movie business, wherein a star’s participation in symbolic acts and festivities can be used to promote either a film or a newly born thousand year reich.This well-written novel paces itself in such a way that each element of its appeal--the wretched Nazis, the world of filmmaking, and the eloquence of Paris being Paris pushing lovers together--receives its due.I don’t think Furst’s depiction of Nazi tactics in France (and elsewhere) is overdrawn, even though it’s brutal and relentless. By contrast, Stahl’s ambivalence in confronting his nemesis is interesting in its understated quality. This is a man who took refuge in the U.S. and really doesn’t want to get drawn into the latest phase of European “politics.” As a result he lacks the edge one might encounter in a Joseph Conrad or Graham Greene novel on the same, or a similar, theme. Yes, he hates what’s going on, but for the longest time, he simply wants to side-step it. No existential angst here; rather, Stahl is a man of moderate self-opinion and no special gift for anything other than professional acting and relatively sincere seductions.Paris? What can one say? Bring in the mists, the shadows, the little side streets, the cafés, the tatty hotels and the grand hotels, the Seine, just walking and looking at the opposite sex passing by...It’s a good city, perhaps the best city, for a novel to unfold, and Furst is excellent in summoning its spirit to the fore.Of course, a Furst novel generally tends to find Hungary and at least the flanks of the Balkans, and that’s in this book, too. Part of the movie has to be shot in an old Hungarian castle; not a good place for Stahl to be since by that point in the plot, he’s become a player in espionage and a marked man.Thankfully, Furst decides not to depict the American diplomat in Paris who draws Stahl into anti-German activities as the typical back-slapping, no-nothing, insensitive clod who shows up in book after book, movie after movie. This second secretary shows restraint, caution, and good judgment as things get more and more complicated for Stahl.Many of the novel’s scenes are driven by dialogue that’s just right and little reactions, physical and emotional, that are just right. There’s subtlety here. The good characters, at least, have a sense of both conscience and consequences. They’re careful, knowing that in a very short time, the Germans will abandon political warfare for military warfare.No doubt certain things worked out well for some people almost trapped in Europe by WWII. Not every novel from this time and place has to end up in personal disaster, even though the continent itself met exactly that fate as a whole. This is my way of fleshing out just a little bit of what I meant earlier when I indicated there is some optimism in this book. For a lucky few, with the right connections and access to sufficient funds, escape was possible. I’m not 100% taken with the good fortune of the lucky few, however, so that diminished the overall impact of MISSION TO PARIS for me. As compensation, one intriguing, self-possessed double-agent does get pushed out into the cold, and so she, Olga Orlova, is the character I value most. In fact, we never discover what happens to her, and I like that.

Coetzee’s Diary of a Bad Year.	This novel is written in three bands, if you will, so that each page comprises 1) a segment of expository prose by an aging novelist in an anarchistic mood, 2) a segment reflecting his thoughts and actions, largely centered on the pretty young woman in his apartment block he persuades to type his manuscript, and 3) a segment that carries her thoughts about his interest in her and some of her boyfriend’s thoughts and actions in response to the writer’s interest in his girlfriend. The elderly writer is named Señor C, the young woman is Anya, and Anya’s boyfriend is Alan, some kind of financial advisor/operator.	Got that?	Band one is being written for a German publisher, and it will be part of an anthology called Strong Opinions, with contributions from Señor C and other writers of his caliber. All that’s required is musing on whatever topics these writers have opinions about. So you can read left to right from pages 1 through x and continuously encounter Señor’s thoughts about the nature of the state (he’s against it), the nature of numbers (he’s got his doubts), the use of the phrase “going forward” (he doesn’t like it), and the question of whether one is doubly bad for having tortured or murdered two victims rather than one. For writing in which a fictional character’s expository reactions to the world around him are central to the novel, I’d take Saul Bellow’s Herzog over this. Coetzee’s playfulness simply isn’t that amusing, even though several passages are insightful.	Bands two and three tend to overlap. Here the story is one of an elderly man coveting a younger woman who, in this case, is utterly honest with whomever she deals. Señor C hears things from her he probably doesn’t enjoy, same with boyfriend Alan. But Alan is a wicked type, and he really doesn’t like the old writer’s lusting for his girlfriend, so he cooks up a scheme to pick his pocket. (I won’t spoil things by detailing how; it’s somewhat implausible anyway.)	The odd thing about this odd book is that sometimes I found myself reading straight down a single page, keeping its discontinuities straight without too much effort, and sometimes I skimmed along within a single band and then went back and started the second and third bands where I’d left off.	Once again, got that?	What are the real issues here? Well, there isn’t much of a story, so what’s left is a post-modern exercise in confirming (as eventually happens) the utter authority of writers Señor C admires most, notably Tolstoy but also Dostoevsky and other great-hearted Russians who needed no tricks to probe the heart of their characters’ existential situations.	Of the three characters, Anya clearly is the most compelling because she’s so full of herself and honest about it. She knows what men like about her, and she flaunts it. She knows what she doesn’t like in men-dishonesty--and she makes that equally clear. She nonetheless exhibits some compassion for Señor C, and that’s a note that lingers after you finish the book.	Finally, Coetzee foregrounds a question we all ask ourselves from time to time: do writers of poetry or fiction have opinions about world and public affairs that actually matter? If they’re not economists or scientists or experts in some other substantive field, what’s the difference between what an old novelist thinks and a well-known actress thinks, i.e., someone who doesn’t even write lines, but simply memorizes and delivers them?	This goes a bit beyond personality cults and charisma and all that. Coetzee’s Señor C is widely and well-read (as is Coetzee, as was Saul Bellow, as was Gore Vidal, as is Margaret Atwood) but his expertise is literary/aesthetic. Does that mean his thoughts, or opinions, have more, or less, authority? Does knowing Tolstoy mean you “know” the world better 100+ years after Tolstoy’s death? In fact, did Tolstoy himself merit worldwide renown for his religious views in his own later life?	If these kinds of questions interest you, you will find Diary of a Bad Year inventive and intriguing. If they don’t, it’s pretty thin. I’m sort of neutral: not a bad book, not a good book, only a different book, which may be justification enough to pick it up...or may not. None of the three main characters would read it, I’d wager, so that may be the most telling comment of all....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 08, 2012","Nov 08, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1377172.Diary_of_a_Bad_Year

On balance, I’d say that probably isn’t a goThe Witch of Portobello by Paulo Coelho is a novel that seems to answer every difficult question it asks. On balance, I’d say that probably isn’t a good thing, but there’s no doubt that Coelho writes with a fast, fluent touch, and even when his characters expostulate rather than converse, the story barrels along, challenging everyone who might be skeptical of its somewhat implausible premises. Our heroine, a gypsy or Roma girl adopted by a Lebanese couple, is self-named Athena (last name Khalil). She is recognizably a young woman on a quest, seeking her identity through a search for her birth mother, a form of dancing that brings her into the Light, encounters with a Teacher, ruptures with her husband and society, and a variety of rituals that cut across the grain of the “normal.” For example, she alters her form of dancing so that it is out of step with the music.So, this is a thesis book: the world comprises two paths. Path one is the conventional, economically driven, institutionally sustained path of Catholicism, business, ambition, jealousy, and, presumably, the Father. Path two is the ignored, shadowy Tradition of the Great Mother, wherein the perceptions and objects of the normal shift into the paranormal, become intangible, free flowing, interwoven, collective, nonjudgmental.Coelho’s technique for telling this story is good. He has a number of characters in Athena’s life recount their recollections of her. There is her mother, her Teacher, an aspirant boyfriend, an Historian, and so forth. Again, Coelho is economical, quick-footed, and so wedded to the thesis of the Mother emerging in modern society that he has the patter down...well...pat.New Age stuff? Definitely. Out of the question? I’m not sure. As I read this novel, I asked myself whether I had ever met a witch, and in fact, I believe, by Coelho’s standards, I have. One was an astrologer who played a role in Washington similar to the one Nancy Reagan’s astrologer played. She was consulted on scheduling matters, important decisions, etc., by people close to V.I.P’s or V.I.P’s themselves. She also was flown around the world by wealthy believers.I’ve said on different occasions that I think I’ve met more weird people in Washington than anywhere else I’ve lived (and I’ve lived in many places), but I’m not sure I’d classify this astrologer as weird. She was down-to-earth in many ways, admitted to indecision and vagueness on occasion, and definitely had a calming effect on a variety of high-strung people, either directly or through emissaries and message-carriers. Now that I think of it, I probably should write about her some day although I wouldn’t want to master her interpretations of the heavens because I didn’t understand what she was doing then and certainly wouldn’t understand it better now. The only thing I know for sure is that when I told her when I thought I was born, she told me I must have been born earlier that day. So I consulted the birth registry of the hospital in Pennsylvania where I came in to the world, and lo and behold, she was right within five minutes.The second witch I knew was very, very different. She was an extremely successful businesswoman, quite wealthy, a brilliant manager (perhaps the best I’ve ever known), and given to using her intelligence and wealth to empowering women (and some men.) She, too, was down-to-earth and yet had some kind of faith about her that made things turn out spectacularly well, even when her projects failed. I never thought of her as a witch until today; I always thought of her as some kind fairy godmother; but this was a person who could project her will through time and space and would call you one day from a raft on the Amazon, the next week from Geneva, the third week from the U.S.-Mexico border. Everywhere she went, she made friends. Everything she did was interesting. She pursued the noblest goals, worked hard at them, and made you feel the unlikely was likely, the impossible possible.Neither of these women went about their work in typical sharp-elbows, utterly insensitive ways, i.e., Washington ways. They knew how to breathe. They had time for the moment. They picked things up, little hints, clues, sensitivities. They were masters of positioning so that heavy jobs became light. They definitely read others in ways that made people blossom, have confidence in themselves, and take risks. And the qualitative difference between them and their successful counterparts and peers was substantial.Coelho pushes this kind of rumination so hard in his novel, it’s difficult to respond to it on other terms. Have you ever met a witch? Do you believe in the second path, even a little bit? What’s so bad about witches, anyway? These are the kinds of thoughts you have as he programmatically explores his thesis-based characters and narrative.Summing things up, I wouldn’t go looking for another one of Coelho’s novels, though apparently he has many, many millions of readers, but I’d wouldn’t say I’d refuse to read one if it were the only paperback left in the English language section of a news stand on a Greek island. But I do think I’d enjoy meeting him.

The genius of the book is Ondaatje’s ability to isolate his splendid prose on intriguing characters and settings in such a way that sentence by sentence you feel the presence of a passionate soul. He writes with poetic skill, wisdom, humor, and a startling eye for compelling details.	As a friend said to me not long ago, “Why can’t some books simply be valued because they are so well-written that you don’t really care about the plot?” This is that kind of book.	The plot, such as it is, revolves around a California family patched together by a single man who raises three unrelated children on his farm. Those three children, two girls who grow up as sisters and a boy who is something of an outlier, are the core characters in the novel.	Cooper is what Jung would call a “sensate.” He builds, he touches things, he becomes a master poker player because he’s so good at cheating when he deals.	Anna is more of an introvert who becomes a literary scholar whose research, somewhat weirdly, takes over the final portions of the novel.	Claire is a combination figure, conventional during the week, a wild wanderer on the weekends.	They care about one another to the point of interchangeability as children, but Ondaatje presses on them hard as they grow up...and away from one another.	At a few points in the narrative, physical violence is the propulsive force--ugly and somewhat unreal. Grudges are formed fast and held forever. Angry spirits lurking in the casinos of Lake Tahoe, for example, have long memories and never die. At other points, the story shifts to Anna’s literary and historical researches in France. This setting and its characters are as convincing as those in California, but they’re different, very different.	A figure who is foundational and briefly pivotal, the father, is essentially not developed beyond a few protective instincts and a capacity for destructive rage, however, and that raises the question of whether somewhere in Anna’s extended research into the French writer Lucien Segura we can pinpoint an analogue to the undeveloped father...or some point for point analogy between Segura’s tale and that of the three children.	I’m not sure that we can. This is a novel that comes in chunks, perhaps as befits its name. One thing is divided from another. The point is that nothing holds together. Everything, as Yeats wrote, flies apart.	A conventional commercially oriented novel this diffuse would be pushed aside or sent back for rewriting to straighten it out, as in: “Let’s get the sequences, motivations, connections, and so forth squared away. Don’t demand so much of readers! They’re busy and often tired when they settle down with a book. How are they supposed to know if Lucien Segura was a real man, or an invention? What’s this extended riff on diphtheria and World War I doing in here? I thought we were doing a stripped down, beat ‘em up, druggy kind of book...or a book where someone says, ‘Hey, let’s put things back together with Dad...point out the Segura in him...or connect this strange figure Raphael in France to Cooper learning to cheat at cards in Nevada.’”	But this isn’t a conventional, commercially oriented novel. It’s a novel you read slowly and forgivingly because passionately imagined reality is more intense and better than every day reality. Of course there are distortions and non sequiturs, but who cares? Perhaps you really can’t have the sweetness and lyricism Ondaatje brings to the page and not face flaws. The flaws may be, in fact, what frees his imagination and lets his pen flow.	One more point I’m curious about. Ondaatje adds a two page “Acknowledgements” after the novel is over. He thanks dozens of people, some for obvious reasons, others for not so obvious reasons. He also cites a number of fairly obscure, technical books that helped him address some of the problems he wanted to explore in this novel. As wide-ranging and daring as he is, he still seems, as a craftsman, deeply wedded to getting facts about birds, unusual quotes, and the raw breath of the Nevada desert just right. I have no problem with that; generosity is a virtue; but ultimately this is a rich work of a singular imagination, and it’s odd how tied he still feels to the corroboration and stimulation found in source material and friends.No one really can take much credit for what Ondaatje writes except himself....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2012","Nov 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/80063.Divisadero

It lacks the striking characterizations of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it’s a carefully constructed, historically plausible, cerebral account of how an unsolved murder ultimately brings down a rising Swedish politician, although there isn’t enough evidence to achieve a conviction. But I don’t want to give away the plot, so I’ll hold back on that.The novel’s characters are generally interesting and appealing in a somewhat matter-of-fact way. A dozen or so key figures in the narrative are fully committed to the police life, each to his or her taste, and all are brought together by the regnant, master policeman, Lars Martin Johansson, a mixture of loyalty, cleverness, endearing impulses, and cold self-discipline. Unfortunately, the novel gets off to a slow start with an expository, report-like account of an embassy take-over in Stockholm in the 1970s. Reading it, you wonder if you’ll ever hear someone speak or witness a scene from a participant’s perspective. But then it switches focus to the murder I’ve mentioned, and the pace quickens, aided by a quirky but skillful practice of breaking scenes into multiple pieces. Two odd literary problems stand out: First, the person who is murdered is broadly described by everyone as a nasty sort of man, but we never really get to encounter him other than as a corpse. Second, the person ultimately suspected of the murder isn’t given much room for self-revelation or self-reflection. The reasoning behind this may have something to do with a dictum Leif GW Persson attributes to his master cop: motives don’t matter in solving murders, forget them and go for evidence. The essence here is to pursue inductive versus deductive reasoning.Well, that thins things out quite a bit when the evidence is scarce, and I’m not sure I agree with the dictum in the first place. By way of compensation, however, Persson does a good job of portraying Johansson pushing his team--largely comprising willful women--to dig deeper for evidence that is far beneath the surface of events.One of the pleasures of Swedish writing and moviemaking is their somewhat leftish leanings seasoned with certain formal and old-fashioned habits and values. But one of the disappointments I have with police procedurals--even fully developed tales like Another Time, Another Life --is that they fully accept, or surrender to, the bureaucratization of modern life. The dramatic discomfort Kafka imposed on us has passed by like a very bad storm. What remains is a less threatening if complex puzzle, a dreck of wire-taps, passing affinities, brinksmanship in the office, and sardonic smiles over wine at night. Yes, there are deaths, some violence, and almost three-dimensional wizardry in cracking the case, but no psychic shocks or raw challenges to a reader’s sense of reality. The good guy sort of wins. The bad guys sort of lose. The game goes on. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 30, 2012","Oct 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3052892-another-time-another-life

I have no reason to doubt that, but I wish I had stumbled on The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel’s Game before I picked up The Prisoner of Heaven.This is a good, somewhat picaresque novel set convincingly in Barcelona (a city I know fairly well) that conveys the lightness of life that transpires in Barcelona’s many dark shadows. The Catalans are a tough, stylish people, good at the arts and good at industry, and great at architecture. All this comes into play in The Prisoner of Heaven, which is in its heart of hearts, a mystery. Some of that mystery emanates from the results of the vicious Spanish Civil War; and some of it emanates from Barcelona’s fancifulness and impossible expectations.The book moves back and forth from the late 1930s through the 1940s and 1950s, concluding on the eve of the 1960s. Its best scenes transpire in a wretched prison, where those whom Franco defeated are placed to rot and die. They do it with smelly, humorous, ineradicable dignity, and they move through a verbal atmosphere--one of smoke, fog, mist, illusions, and shadows--that’s a pleasure to savor.Toward the end of the novel, a younger and older man carry their friendship toward uncertain fates. The younger man is placed in a situation that calls for revenge. The older man is liberated into an apparently happy bourgeois marriage.Ruiz Zafon writes funny dialogue, moves his story quickly, embeds subplots nicely, and encompasses everything in the somewhat impossible to believe Cemetery of Forgotten Books.

One of the key characters, a Frenchman named Born, is elusive, violent, something of an ubermench, and ultimately a bit fuzzy. But without him…no story. He has to get into our protagonist's, Adam Walker's, life and prompt Walker to mount an elaborate attempt to take revenge on Born, but not before he has had (or has he?) a powerful incestuous relationship with his sister.I say ""powerful"" because the development of this relationship and its multi-year execution has a certain fatal plausibility about it. Whether it actually happened or not is another story…or a story Invisble eventually tells.Ancillary characters are similarly hard to pin down--a French lover, a young French girl who falls in love with Walker, the girl's mother, and the novelist to whom Walker bequeaths his incomplete manuscript.The novel comes in pieces, some keyed to seasons, others built on general recollections, others diary entries by the young French girl when she is a middle-aged woman.This jerkiness is moderated by Auster's smooth, economical prose and his exceptional talent for dialogue that is clipped and yet telling.The key premises of the book--Born's monstrousness, the incestuous affair--are necessary to creating the ""Auster effect,"" which is a noirish sort of writing wherein the certain and uncertain overlap.I'd recommend reading Invisible because it is engaging, vivid, and so smoothly rendered. Lots is ""told"" not ""shown,"" but this doesn't seem to matter. From time to time Auster's phrasing is hackneyed; close your eyes before turning some of its pages and imagine how the sentence you've been reading will end: more than likely, you'll get it exactly right.

It tells the tale of how we inadvertently invited North Korea to invade South Korea, how our forces were virtually crushed and driven off the peninsula, how MacArthur brilliantly struck back and then overreached and ended up losing tens of thousands of his soldiers to slaughter by the Chinese.Not often is a writer able to tell a war tale from both a soldier’s perspective and a president’s. It’s just too demanding, takes too much skill. But Halberstam succeeds.His portrait of the ultimately self-deluded egotist MacArthur is if not Shakespearian, then sub-Shakespearian, which more or less is what MacArthur had in mind: he wanted to be seen as an historical, legendary figure who conformed to and in some ways transcended his predecessors: Napoleon, Hannibal, etc. But ultimately the flawed MacArthur, surrounded by boobs and sycophants and petty staff tyrants, became so divorced from reality that he sent whole divisions to their death. He was too arrogantly racist to realize that the Chinese could and would enter the Korean war and could and would fight more skillfully than his American troops.The pictures of Truman, George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and Matthew Ridgeway, who took over after MacArthur’s failure, are equally well presented. None of them really knew what they were getting into when the decision was taken to defend South Korea at all costs. As so often has been the case in other instances (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan), American policymakers knew their objectives, but not whether they were realistic and attainable. The problem was and remains America’s superior industrial and technological capability. We can do anything in those dimensions. What we can’t do is rub out entire societies determined to hold onto their land, fighting at night, fighting along the flanks, fighting with little regard for loss of life.Halberstam is generous in acknowledging the critics at the time, expert at pointing out how the Republicans goaded and prodded Truman into being “tough,” and fantastic at placing a given soldier or officer’s personal story at the right place in his comprehensive narrative.You can’t know war unless you have seen it through a soldier’s eyes, but you also can’t know war unless you have come to terms with the lofty and excruciating heights of power where presidents and dictators make colossal decisions that once made, can’t be unmade.I was born during the Korean war. As a child, I recall it still being referred to as a police action, a term Truman used to obfuscate what America was doing. Then Korea became “the forgotten war,” embittering those who fought in it.Halberstam revives and vivifies the Korean war as it must have been.A few years ago, my son, who is a war buff, and I were talking with a Korean war vet. My son was recounting some of the battles, some of the crucial turning points, some of the ways in which the war was decided at a macro-level. The vet wanted to talk about the fact that for weeks and months he had no idea what he was doing, that he was a radio man who almost never had good connections, or any connections at all, and that he couldn’t coordinate with units as close as a few hundreds of yards away. They were both right, in their way. Halberstam tells the story both upstairs and downstairs. He gets into the fog of war and the fog of policymaking, he dramatizes the pernicious effects of pernicious personalities, he makes you stop and think: Do we want to do this again? No war should be forgotten; every one of them should remain embedded in our memory.

Of course there’s a psychoanalyst involved, but he quickly gives way to Lysander’s interest in another patient (met in the waiting room) who is better at providing orgasms than the psychoanalyst.The novel then succumbs to one of a series of unexpected breaks or leaps in the action. These include Lysander suddenly being accused of raping the other patient (not true); Lysander effecting a nifty escape from captivity in Vienna (not plausible); Lysander being drawn into an effort to identify a traitor in Britain’s WWI war machine (ah...we now see that Lysander the man of feelings and private issues isn’t quite the object of the novel...not very plausibly); Lysander being shot several times point blank and surviving; Lysander discovering that somehow his mother has been drawn into the traitor’s plot; Lysander solving the mystery; Lysander being saved in the nick of time by his uncle’s marksmanship; and Lysander settling on a marriage to the woman he once was engaged to and now finds, all things considered, a safer domestic bet than some of his other flings.So...it’s fun to read; it exhibits something of what we have come to call “dry wit;” it sacrifices depth of character exploration to quick moving events and unusual figures who slip quickly before our eyes...and sure, I’d recommend it.

Their leaders told them they were winning...over and over again...for years...so defeat was totally disorienting.--Both the rural populace and the fire- and nuclear- bombed urban populace are duly addressed. The rural populace lived in essential ignorance and found itself vaulted upward in terms of national importance as Japan faced post-war food shortages. Yes, millions of rural folk participated in the war effort, but during the war, and afterward, relatively few came back...and were in any condition to give an accurate account of what had happened.--The social glue that held Japan together, i.e., the emperor and his court, really was a relatively new phenomenon, less than a hundred years old in its current form.--The Japanese adapted ingeniously to the requirements of the Occupation: providing prostitutes, housing, and subtle measures of linguistic misdirection and misinformation when it suited them.--Could any proud country not secretly believe it had been ""betrayed"" and that in some sense a handful of imperial advisors, military leaders, and industrialists were the ones ""responsible"" for Japan's war effort and its defeat? Of course not.--The Japanese took one particular lesson from the U.S.'s use of the atom bomb: they were laggard in science and engineering. As we have seen in the sixty years thereafter, the Japanese have remedied much of their deficiency, but of course they do not have nuclear weapons, only nuclear power plants.--Japan was then, and remains, home to large populations of Koreans, Chinese, and other Asian peoples. Said folk were not then, nor are they now, fully protected by the rights accorded Japanese citizens.On the political side:--Post-war planning both within Japan and among the American-led occupation (read: MacArthur et al) revolved around ""saving"" the emperor from being blamed and being forced to step down...and/or being tried as a ""Class A"" war criminal. The thinking was that the entire society would crumble into anarchy without some continuing form of imperial guidance, albeit symbolic. The account of Hirohito in this book certainly makes clear that he was quite culpable, had long been involved in war-planning, and was a rather remote, somewhat self-deluded individual--nothing like a Western ""leader"" in the Churchill, FDR, etc.--The war crimes trials that sentenced a relative handful of ranking Japanese to execution or imprisonment were slapdash. Sometimes all eleven judges were on the bench,hearing testimony; sometimes only seven were on hand. Many of the judgments rendered could be turned slightly to incriminate other national leaders (both within Japan and in other capitals). Translation and interpretation often were deficient. This was an exercise in justice that some of the non-U.S. jurists found appalling, starting with the fact that the U.S. had already decided the emperor must not be held accountable.--There are a few chapters on the making of Japan's post-war constitution and its remarkable provision that Japan will not engage in war or maintain a defense establishment. As you probably know, Japan does have an entity called the Japanese Defense Force. This is something that essentially emerged with U.S. encouragement as the Cold War got colder and the U.S. welcomed some strength on the island of the ""100 million"" (Japan's approximate population).--The Japanese constitution is more liberal and protective of rights than the U.S. constitution.--The conservatives were the shrewdest and longest-lived of Japan's political actors in the post-war era. (Only recently has a party other than the Liberal Democratic Party held sway in Japan's parliament.)--For years after accepting Japan's unconditional surrender, General MacArthur almost never traveled in Japan, met Japanese citizens, or took advice from experts close to him--many of whom had no Japan expertise to draw on. (They were ""functional"" experts; not Japan experts. If they were Asian experts, they tended to have focused more on China than Japan,) He lived in splendid isolation from his own proconsular dominion.--It is quite amazing how pro-American Japan quickly became. Was this caused by U.S.-fostered democratization? It would be difficult to deny that, partly because prior to defeat in WWII Japan was such a stratified, rigid, closed society (even within the ranks of the ""pure"" Japanese.) The U.S. and others pushed open a lot of doors through insistence on democracy, citizens' rights, etc.In sum, this is the kind of long historical book that is interesting in particular because it gives so much weight to the social realities, not just the political realities. It is a sweeping study. But you have to be interested in Japan to enjoy reading it. Otherwise it would be too rich in detail and fine distinctions to hold your interest. In other words, it's not for everyone....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2012","Sep 23, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/273197.Embracing_Defeat

I mean that in the sense that this is a book of nostalgia, reflection, and mood that would be somewhat better off without any plot at all. An elegant writer, Barnes traces the life of a first person narrator, Tony, from adolescence to old age, when he unravels the factors that led to one of his young friend's suicide forty years hence. I don't like to retell stories in great detail when I comment on them, but I will say that the crucial characters in this little book are undeveloped to the point that no one but Tony really matters, and what matters about him is that in old age he seems to have awakened from a very ordinary, unambitious life when he is confronted with a mysterious inheritance, a part of which he is unable to obtain. Tony was never particularly obtuse, although he presents himself that way, so why he should have passed so much of his life in a comfortable trance is a bit of mystery Barnes himself doesn't quite solve, even with his plot revelation at the conclusion. Suicide figures twice in this book. In neither case is it explored in its full horror. In fact, the major suicide is pawned off as a kind of philosophical madness--if I didn't ask to live, why shouldn't I go ahead and die?--until we discover what might have led to the character called Adrian performing a Roman wrist-slitting on himself in the bath. The female lead, as it were, is a manipulative and fairly cold woman whose life apparently was totally undermined by her slightly mad and highly disloyal mother. The mother is not explored at all. Really. This novella reminds me somewhat of Philip Roth's recent novellas (all sold expensively at novel prices). It is long on philosophical quipping and inconvenient irony and short on the hard work of making a story traumatically real--if trauma must lie at the center of the tale. Barnes received the 2011 Man Booker Prize, the U.K.'s most prestigious award, for The Sense of an Ending. I think this must have been some kind of life achievement award.

Many of us, including me, may not have read the novel, or any other by Evelyn Waugh. So I picked up A Handful of Dust and found a strangely uneven, strangely appealing, strangely constructed novel where the harsh ethos of brittle upper class Brits featured in Brideshead Revisited reappears in the form of Tony and Brenda Last and their family and friends.The Lasts are landed gentry, possessors of a manorial residence, that is more fascinating to Tony, the heir, than Brenda, who'd like a little more city life, action, and romance. So she takes a flat (really, just a room) and picks up with a doltish fellow, always on the lookout for an invitation to eat and drink at someone else's expense, named John Beaver. Tony doesn't discover Brenda's affair for a long time. In fact, things don't begin to come into focus for him until his and Brenda's son, a little boy also named John, dies in a fox hunting accident. Their reaction is not quite ""stiff upper lip,"" but it's a queerly unemotional recognition of the fact that he was a good chap who didn't deserve an early death, though no one is to blame. Just an accident.Waugh is a strong writer, keeps up a good pace, enables the reader to visualize settings easily and connect (or disconnect) with his unsympathetic characters easily, too. These characters, who don't do much in life except hobnob, are almost fascinating in their obtuseness, carelessness, and self-involvement.Typical upper class Brits? I suppose so. There aren't many of them left, but enough hung around during Waugh's lifetime to draw his ire. These are people, to put it plainly, who count...and you don't. They let you know that by not talking to you if they can avoid it and by forgiving each other's sins more quickly than they forget your sins...or if not your sins, then your missteps...or if not missteps, your gauche behavior, including having the bad taste to be born to parents without land, title, or money. Anyway, Waugh has at them, bottles are emptied, beds are filled up, glasses break, boredom always hovers about like a cloud of bats,threatening these nitwits with a dull day here and there.And then, once Tony really grasps that Brenda wants out of their marriage, and he is to convenience her on this point, he develops a bit of a spine, says no way, and heads off on a trip abroad designed to lead him to a legendary city somewhere in Amazonia in the company of a totally undeveloped character named Dr. Messinger. Suddenly, a British novel of bad manners becomes a British travelogue a la Rider Haggard. Weird? Weird. So weird, in fact, that the novel we receive today has two endings. One is a slapped-on short story that contains this desperate trip into the jungle; the other is, if you like, a toned-down account of Brenda losing John Beaver and taking up with one of Tony's reliable old friends.I can't say I don't know what to make of this. I do know what to make of it. Waugh was writing about his wife betraying him, ran out of gas, went on a trip himself, imagined adventures that he was lucky he didn't have, and then came back to his ""novel"" and tossed up his hands, and manuscript, and let things fall as they may...into place or out of place.Does it matter that he isn't a Graham Greene who kept control of his material to the nth degree? In fact, it does. Another British novelist of Waugh's generation, Henry Green, wrote to Waugh chidingly. That's a hard and unrewarding undertaking, to write chidingly, one writer to another. But Henry Green had to let Evelyn Waugh know you can't let things get out of hand the way he had in A Handful of Dust.And yet in a wacky way the whole mess is so well-paced, incredibly credible, and stupid that it's fun. Read it; it won't take long; and Waugh in the raw, just him and his pen, makes no effort to pretty up his goofball objects of censure as the TV folks did who gave us Brideshead Revisited in pictures....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 11, 2012","Sep 11, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/531262.A_Handful_of_Dust

She’s not going to do it for reasons he cannot comprehend or fault. He doesn’t think much of himself, and he has no clue what makes a woman love one man and not another.

Another young lady, Mary, is desperate to do away with her sexual repressions, and a passing cad obliges her on the roof of the old manse.

He reads tales from the clan’s past, and I was surpised to find him reading a story Huxley published separately called “Sir Hercules.” The plot goes this way. Sir Hercules is a dwarf, an unhappy one. He becomes happy when he decides to populate the entire estate with dwarfs and to marry one. Unfortunately, the marriage spawns a full-sized bore who is so cruel to his mother and father that they agree upon suicide. Read on its own, Sir Hercules is a memorable and disturbing story. I can say that with authority since I read it fifty years ago. In Crome Yellow the power of the tale is diminished by the context: it seems to be another way in which Huxley is satirizing the dull Brits of his day.On balance this is a highly competent but somewhat static novel that moves from set piece to set piece. It ends on a flat predictable note, evoking little sympathy for poor Denis. I won’t give the ending away, but I will say that it was only that cruel tale of Sir Hercules that kept me going....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 30, 2015","May 05, 2015","Sep 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53672.Crome_Yellow

I could not have fully appreciated the devilishly accurate and often perverse relationships depicted in the book--especially the protagonist's enduring obsession with a cunning, self-absorbed, low-life woman--but I do recall the way in which Of Human Bondage relentlessly availed itself of the power of the novel form.The story begins when the orphan Philip Carey, born with a club foot, is taken in by his maternal uncle, a clergyman. It then pursues Philip through the next 30 years of his life, including boarding school, a sojourn in Paris, being down and out in London and being a medical student in London. The reader goes through so many detailed experiences with Philip that inevitably he begins to feel ""real"" and more than ""real."" He's shy, can be sharp-tongued, easily cowed, and yet tenacious. When he falls for Mildred, a waitress in a tea shop, he and the reader both know it's an expression of his needs more than his desires. As an orphan he feels abandoned in life, and Mildred constantly refreshes that experience for him, leaving him in the lurch emotionally, physically, and financially until she finally destroys herself just before destroying Philip. This is ""bondage"" as Spinoza put it--not being in command of one's emotions and therefore not being in command of oneself.Philip's great and mysterious triumph is more or less letting his passion for Mildred painfully burn itself out--a passive accomplishment. His lesser accomplishments are featured in three or four of the novel's best passages. The first bunch are a series of third person meditations on the meaning of life. Maugham was neither a lyrical nor an abstract writer, but in these passages he pushes himself and Philip to fashion a philosophy of living here and now and assembling within oneself a pattern of beautiful things...almost turning oneself into one of the novel's symbols, a Persian carpet. The writing in these passages is by far the best in the novel until the final movement when Maugham describes a self-sufficient girl, mysterious in her reserve, whose curiously mature maternal qualities answer Philip's needs in a positive instead of destructive way. Sally is a splendid literary creation, deftly described, utterly convincing as a girl sufficiently observant and agile to deal with the complex and much battered Philip. Some of her understated banter is as good as dialogue gets, words conveying not just meaning but character while requiring no authorial amplification.There are Dickensian moments in Of Human Bondage and episodes of grim depravity and desperation that, once again, make me wonder what my schoolmasters had in mind when they assigned it. Probably they thought of it as a bildungsroman that would give a teenage reader a kind of spiritual companionship, proof that hard times could lead to good times. But the business of Mildred subjugating Philip and his subservience to her is dark material. Maugham is said to have lamented the fact that he tended to love people not worth loving and be incapable of loving those who were. That's probably the right thematic synthesis of what Of Human Bondage is all about....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 03, 2012","Jan 19, 2016","Sep 03, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31548.Of_Human_Bondage

I also don't know why familiarity breeds contempt, which was the undertone of her comment.It's difficult to talk about writing unless you really read and can really talk and perhaps can really write. The words whiz past but they are difficult to encapsulate and make yours. Generally the writing you read is better than your everyday way of talking; more time has gone into it, more revision, more cunning and more passion. And besides, do people even like reading things by Cormac McCarthy, especially a book as gratuitously violent as No Country for Old Men? Who wants to talk about it?I saw the movie first and more or less wrote it off because of the robotic way Javier Bardem, playing Anton Chigurh, went about killing people. Whack, you're dead. Whack, you, too. Whack, everyone's dead and even if the man killing everyone is shot and smashed-up, he just keeps on trucking. And then there was Tommy Lee Jones playing the affable, befuddled, mystified, horrified, worn-out sheriff chasing Anton Chigurh, more or less hoping that he didn't catch him.But we come now to the book, and the hammer-on-the-nailhead sentences. That's some whacking, the way McCarthy puts mountains where they're supposed to be and relationships where they're supposed to be and demoralization and drowning in the sea of dope smuggling where it is supposed to be. It's almost criminal to write so well, having learned so many deadly lessons from Faulkner perhaps more than anyone else. And it's almost criminal to be able to portray the pitiable puniness of the young and the old on the wings of chance, always about to fall off. Heads you live, tails you die.Chigurh in the book remains over-the-top evil, a philosopher of death, a man whose ethos is aligning himself with fate. He's a hell of a lot more intriguing, however, than Bardem in the movie. Then the sheriff, wonderfully called by his first and middle names, Ed Tom. His interior monologues remind me of the Bundrens in As I Lay Dying. The speech in these passages is insightful, terse, and arresting. Also colorful. Ed Tom serves as the novel's conscience and commentator and elegist. He's all about admitting that he's no match for the weirdos populating his county in Texas, certainly not for the cast of misfits that figure in this story.The question the novel poses is, Has the world become worse? That's hard to answer. Generally, I think it hasn't. It's still ghastly, but worse? One way to measure our degradation is to consider this: When I wanted to be sure I had recalled the Bundrens' name correctly, I looked As I Lay Dying up on Google. It was listed third, not first. Some rock band or other got the first two rungs on the ladder. This is definitely cultural decay, but now I'm sounding like Ed Tom, and I ought to get out of the way and suggest you go from here to reading No Country for Old Men and if you haven't, As I Lay Dying--the proper As I Lay Dying.Or you can hang out in pool halls like anyone else....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Sep 2012,"Sep 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12497.No_Country_for_Old_Men

While the book starts slowly--Part I is the weakest part--it gathers strength as it unfurls the struggles of Harry ""Bo"" Mason, Elsa Mason, and their boys, Chet and Bruce. They are a family that lived, fictionally at least, from the early 1900s through the Depression and Prohibition in the upper midwest, the far west, and parts of Canada. There was no safety net for them as they farmed until they gave up farming for Bo's bootlegging, and there was no general consciousness or legal protection available to keep a woman and her children safe from the abuses of their husband and father. Some of these abuses were simply the dark sides of of Bo's emotional make-up. The force that gave him great energy was emotionally destructive as well as a source of resilience. But that combination was hard on Elsa, more or less deadly for Chet, and damaging for Bruce, who surprisingly manages to survive as the brightest and most determined of the story's main characters.Elsa's stoicism and her romantic decision to stick with Bo when she knew she shouldn't gives the book a kind of moral north star. If you want to know what's right in life, look to her. If you want to know what's probably wrong, look to Bo, and to a lesser extent to the abused and defensive boys.As a writer, Stegner is ambitious and dextrous. There are passages in this book that rival Willa Cather's beautiful accounts of the midwest. There are passages with the drive of Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. And there are passages that presage William Kennedy's marvelous Albany tales of small-time hoodlums walking the plank between a bottle of whiskey and a bag full of cash.This is a sad book. As many times as Bo gets knocked down, taking the family with him, he's certain to get back up...only to be knocked down again. The America of that period was rough on unschooled working men and women, farmers, common laborers, dreamers, and people who could not depend on, or get along with, their families.Of course, it's still rough for many in this country, but not as rough as then, and yet paradoxically perhaps also not as exciting, physical, even sensual. There's essentially no God in Stegner's fictional world, but there are two factors that he handles and relies upon with true mastery. The first is the beauty of the natural world, the world of mountains, of hunting, of sun, wind, snow, hard rocks and sweet-smelling pines. The second is memory and memory's ability to provide some little incentive to keep on going, some fine moment that fills the worst moments with hope. These two elements move the Masons forward and sustain Bruce, transforming him from a fairly desperate, frightened little boy into a wary but self-reliant man. The rest don't make it; simple as that: they just don't make it.

It begins with a contemporary court proceeding in which the protagonist, Gladys, is tried for murder. Quickly, the story moves back in her life and traces the progression of her self-involvement and self-indulgence. As a psychological study, this is a good book in one sense, not so good in another. It's good in that it maintains a clear focus on a woman's personal obsessions; it's not so good in that the unsympathetic woman in question is predictable and shallow. At a point in her life, age 50 or so, she begins going to bordellos, apparently offering herself for love at a price. That's a pretty radical thing for a wealthy socialite to do; it's not thoroughly explored, however. At other points, Gladys appears deeply attracted to certain lovers, but the lovers are not well fleshed-out.I won't go into the final conflict, but it's overwhelming for Gladys, and her nemesis is a brutal individual (who has his reasons) with some genuine darkness in his soul.As usual, Nemirovsky excels in creating settings and atmospheres with quick broad strokes.

And there is a great deal of knowledge shared about horses, cows, dogs, birds, whorehouses, ranches, and the limitations within which one can make a living in such arid lands.The central plot--a boy falls in love with a young prostitute kept in a bordello against her will--is cloaked, as is much of the book, in a kind of romanticism that bars skepticism on the reader's part.

For example, he notes that on entering the war both sides had the idea of a decisive Napoleonic battle in mind, a kind of Austerlitz, which would settle things quickly.But that didn't happen. Keegan offers one major reason why not: Neither side was equipped to fight the war when it began and once it was under way, Southern geography was hard to pinpoint in terms of what Sun-tzu calls ""fatal ground."" Ultimately, the South had to be surrounded and then crushed from the Potomac through the James and the Mississippi to the Atlantic.So hundreds and thousands of battles were fought--an average of seven a day for four years--and horrendous casualties were registered because life and death, not political decapitation, was the only metric of use in determining who was winning and who was losing.In a final meditation on the meaning of the Civil War, Keegan observes that beforehand we were a country, afterward we were a state. Lincoln, of course, did that, greatly aided by Grant and Sherman. He was the leader who insisted secession could not be allowed, and he was the leader who somehow persisted in creating the military, financial and political structures necessary to prevail and endure such a vicious internecine conflict.The South did assemble great armies led by great generals, and it did have a political structure that mirrored the North and the Constitution, but it lacked the economic substance to prosecute the war until the North gave in--which Lincoln, for one, would never do.The wars we see today--in Afghanistan and Syria, for instance--have components of civil war but aren't comparable in the sense that large war machines are fighting on one side and guerrillas and irregulars are fighting on the other. It is therefore extremely difficult to foresee a decisive outcome. We cannot expect a Napoleonic result nor can we foresee exactly what political arrangements will emerge. In the case of the Civil War, Lincoln insisted that the Constitution as it was written (and amended to validate emancipation) would be the law of the land. So the North had an answer and was able to impose it in detail. In Syria or Afghanistan, there are precedents and documents and a constitution of sorts, but as the violence subsides, no one can be sure how the future will be regulated...there's no answer, any more than there is in Egypt, Libya, or Tunisia...yet.Having seen war and its casualties up close, I read this book astonished by the courage of the Civil War's soldiers. Keegan addresses this question. He suggests two factors that made both blue and gray stand and fight, sometimes ten feet from one another: first, the rightness of cause (for the North, refusing to let the country be dismembered and slavery to continue; for the South, the imperative sovereignty of states' rights and the fear of millions of emancipated slaves); and second, the bond of comradeship, not walking away from your brothers in arms when the lead is hot and the odds of survival are not good.He makes an extremely interesting final point: having fought such a bloody conflict between ourselves, we may not have wished to follow European socialist injunctions to take to the barricades to bring in a new socio-economic order; we just may have had a belly full of killing one another; and so we pursued social justice and economic fairness through non-violent means, i.e., politics, elections, unionism, collective bargaining, and the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s. So this is a book about war by a military historian, but war is not just a battlefield event. It's broader and more complex. Ultimately, one is tempted to suggest that war is settled through one of two means: annihilation or accommodation. Annihilation means things none of us (or few of us) want to see again: a Holocaust as much as an Austerlitz, a Nagasaki as much as a Waterloo. So the question about ending wars ultimately hinges on advantages that force accommodations on the vanquished. In other words, as Clausewitz insisted, war and politics are two faces of the same coin....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 17, 2012","Jul 17, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6315836-the-american-civil-war

He is a masterful stylist, cunning creator of William Gass is one of the most accomplished and provocative American writers of the last half century. He is a masterful stylist, cunning creator of unique characters, and major theorist of what makes fiction fiction--in other words, in addition to writing beautiful sentences and stories, he's a philosopher/critic of the first order.The four ""novellas"" that make up Cartesian Sonata are ""Cartesian Sonata"" itself, ""Bed and Breakfast,"" ""Emma Enters a Sentence of Elizabeth Bishop's,"" and ""Master of Secret Revenges."" I confess I'm losing track of what makes the difference between a long story and a novella. In Gass's case, I think there really isn't much difference, especially since one of his strengths is not ""plot."" These fictions flow along, striking sentences bejeweled with stunning images and metaphors, contingent upon immediate satisfactions and revelations. Forget about suspense. What Gass does is study in minute detail the features of reality, sometimes physical, sometimes metaphysical, that require literary artistry if they are to become visible to the reader's mind and imagination.He specializes in oddballs, cranks, besieged souls, and loners adrift somewhere in the Midwest. I take most of his work to center on Iowa, but that's more guess than fact. And according to Gass's theory of fiction, it doesn't really matter. He homes in on that which is confined within his verbal subject; everything else is immaterial. He also writes, I think, in a phenomenological mode that tracks its own aesthetic purposes, not history, not larger context, not what just happened in the story or what will happen next but what is happening right now. I know this sounds pretty abstract, but if you read to the end of this book, plowing through the sordid bordering on rancid ""Master of Secret Revenges,"" you'll find an almost religious outcome in Gass's brooding on the random magic of people, places, and emotions getting mixed up in the mind. That's phenomenology as I understand it: an affirmation that although we all are locked within our own subjectivities, something luminous and possibly numinous spins around us like motes of dust in sunlight...issuing no special ""meaning"" other than intense particularity, microscopic truths, and imaginative possibilities...not certainties.So Gass is a very, very literary writer. How could he be otherwise if he proposes a story about a mistreated young woman finding relief by entering into one of Elizabeth Bishop's sentences? Now, I want to add a few biographical details to flesh this comment out: I had never heard of William Gass until I was a sophomore in college and my creative writing instructor, Geoffrey Wolff, announced to me and my fellow students that Gass was one of the most important literary theorists since Aristotle. None of my fellow students had heard of Gass either. We went to the bookstore, however, and bought a book of exceptional essays Gass had written called Fiction and the Forms of Life. That book partially convinced me Wolff was right about Gass. The deal was closed when I then read a collection of Gass's stories called In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, one of the most compelling, beautiful short stories I've read to this day (many years later.)After graduating, I moved to Virginia and heard that Gass was participating in a literary festival in Lexington at Washington and Lee. He, Donald Barthelme, and Walker Percy were the headliners. So I hopped in the car and snuck into the auditorium just as Walker Percy was beginning to give a talk. Behind him sat Barthelme, a somewhat devilish looking fellow, and an elderly woman with a large smooth face and long gray hair. Percy talked a bit about science and literature, as I recall. I didn't know his work at the time but later came to admire it a great deal. Then Barthelme got up and was as witty and irreverent as his wicked short stories. Next came the elderly woman who turned out to be a man...William Gass, in fact. What did he say? I don't recall. I just sat there looking at him, listening to his man's voice, thinking about his writing -- which I knew pretty well-- and wondering if everyone else, or anyone else, mistook him for a woman.There was a reception afterward and I approached all three writers. There's never anything worth saying on such occasions, so I didn't say anything worth repeating, and they didn't either. But each of the three has remained on my bookshelves, and each of the three continued to fashion a more or less iconic status for himself in American letters. If you're prepared to read slowly, not be sure where a tale is heading, and yet be bowled over by a poetic/philosophical literary talent, go try Gass.

I don’t normally come out and say something like that right from the start, but this book is elaborately researched, perceptive, intriguing, and very well written. The Charles Dickens who appears here is something of a haunted, insecure but at the same time dogged and brilliant figure. Yes, he was damaged as a child by his father’s multiple insolvencies, but yes, he also was a resourceful law clerk, journalist, essayist, playwright, and of course, novelist. In fact, he became the major English-language novelist of his day.Without psychologizing, Douglas-Fairhurst portrays someone who was a great mimic, a comedic personality and an exceptionally evasive figure. Douglas-Fairhurst has the good sense to understand why Dickens (and others) ultimately chose to write fiction: because you can live better in fiction than you can in life, because the characters you meet are funnier, sadder, more provocative…and because “the world” is replete with articulated moods and details, things that slip past notice unless you are preying upon them with your curiosity and vocabulary and sense of literary “possibility.”I had no idea how hard Dickens worked as a fledgling journalist and satirist before The Pickwick Papers made him a national figure in England. He covered parliament, elections, the courts, the prisons, and the social life of his times. Douglas-Fairhurst knows those times well, and he has an extraordinary ability to cite just the right passage from Dickens’s writings to illustrate a point…but not only that…he also excels in drawing on the writings of others–Thackery, for instance, or diarist/memoirists that only a specialist in 19th century British social history would know.At the same time, I wasn’t familiar with how many plays Dickens wrote, or how often he took on roles himself, or how unhappy he clearly was in his marriage…something Douglas-Fairhurst attributes to Dickens having chosen the wrong sister to marry…and then watched the younger one die a sudden, early death.The Pickwick Papers was the first Dickens novel I read. I was eleven. I suppose I understood 60% of what was going on. Then came Great Expectations, David Copperfield, and Bleak House–a novel I read in college and still regard as one of the most astonishing books written since Shakespeare. Dickens had a plastic personality–meaning that he adapted to circumstances if he had to (he didn’t like it, but he did it)–and that marvelous plastic style, capable of rendering low-lifes, aristocrats, children, barristers, cabbies, thieves and entire cities and landscapes in quick, powerful fashion.Ultimately, Douglas-Fairhurst doesn’t really pin Dickens down. One can tell he was “a case” and there probably was some kind of psychological disorder at the heart of his drive and imagination, but the point made here is that Dickens kept on inventing himself as he invented his stories.Again, a good book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2012","Jun 24, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11506880-becoming-dickens

It's a deathbed memoir told from the perspective of a literary-minded priest/poet/critic who has worshipped the word more than the Word. The writing is moody, quick, almost expository. Events flash past that only someone with a knowledge of Chilean history would understand. Bolano criticizes both sides--the literary/religious types who hypocritically ignore political excesses and the political types who, under the very feet of a literary salon in a basement, conduct torture of regime enemies.

This is the issue that pertains to Russia's mission, driven by Orthodox Christian values, protecting the Slavs of the Balkans and thereabouts from Islamic Turkey's encroachment and Western European machinations.Second, one is exposed to Dostoevsky's almost irrational passion about the Russian ""People,"" in contradistinction to the Europeanized class (he was a member) who mistook Russia's fate as lying in the west.In combining these two issues (The Eastern Question and The People) by virtue of Orthodoxy, Dostoevsky exhibits a genteel but Leninesque intensity that rejects anything other than either a universal or perhaps simply Asian fate for the Russians.He argues, argues, argues, and you wouldn't want to try to wear him down. We are the true children of Christ, he says, whereas Rome is a secularized version of Christianity that when it lost true power through the Vatican picked it up in France and then ran smack into Lutheran Germany.And Asia, including Constantinople, is Russia's destiny. Likewise, one presumes, though he doesn't make the case, the Levant, including Palestine (now Israel.)That Dostoevsky would blog at a length comparable to War and Peace on matters of political and military consequence is almost astonishing. Here you have the master psychological novelist giving up his greatest strength--characterization--in order to try to make an abstraction called the People central to his writing. It doesn't really work. He is syrupy in his devotion to these peasants. He overlooks what we can safely assume is a full quotient of human fraility and venality. He insists that Christ dwells within the reaper's heart and the sweat on her back and the warts on her chin. And he rather genially won't give up, employing vast rhetorical skills and that unmistakable energy of his, the energy that created Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and so many other much more compelling--riveting--novels and stories.The level of historical and contemporary information he attains is nothing short of awesome. This is before the Internet, remember. This is before fresh newspapers at your doorstep. People did have newspapers, of course, but they arrived late, and you had to recompose chronologies and reimagine realities out of sequence. So one assumes he read all he could and did what people used to do: talked with others whenever he wasn't writing.Toward the end of his diaries, just before his death, Dostoevsky muses about whether Russia shouldn't just forget about Europe for a while and concentrate on Asia. He's prescient, in a way. He understands the minerals, oils and gases out there in Siberia and down in the Caspian basin. He foresees the geo-political fact that is beginning to dawn on the rest of us (here in the U.S.). Europe is really only a little piece of what we call Eurasia, giving Europe far too much credit. It's Asia that is humanity's fulcrum, not Europe, and not North America. Hence, when we ponder Putin, we are well advised to ponder Russia's passion for authority at the top. This man is a czar reincarnated. Mere ideology (Marxist-Leninism) isn't enough to hold 11 time zones together. For that the Russians expect a kind of demi-god to do the job, or the demi-god expects that of himself.There are passages in this volume devoted to literature and society--particularly one incident in which a pregnant woman throws her step-child out a window and the child survives a forty foot fall--but these passages are diversions from the main argument: Russia is an Orthodox country, full of Christian believers, destined to bring the world a new ""word."" It is almost impossible to believe that a writer so gifted in portraying impassioned evil could be such an advocate for self-sacrificing faith, but to a lesser extent, Tolstoy and Solzhenitsyn were cut from the same cloth.

This is explained well. Quantum reality deals in probabilities, not certainties, and phenomena that could be waves or could be quanta or particles, depending on when they are measured.There is a huge quotient of the subjective in quantum thinking, which is to say that the observer alters that which is observed, and that which is observed has a somewhat uncanny similarity to the lightning fast disjunctures that characterize the human mind.

This literary experiment includes everything from letters, literary battles, and short stories to fragments of poems, recollections and long polemics focused on Russia’s system of justice (which had undergone a substantial reform in the previous decade.)It’s a whopper of a book, over 700 pages. Do you have to be a Dostoevsky fanatic to want to read it? Probably. But it’s also true that anything Dostoevsky wrote had (and still has) a relentless force and crackling energy worth exploring.In a very long introductory study, Gary Saul Morson of Northwestern University makes a valiant attempt to suggest that many of Dostoevsky’s failings and surprising shifts of genre and subject in his Writer’s Diary amount to a new kind of literature. I didn’t find myself persuaded this was the case, although it is oddly Russian for a writer to push words in any direction he wishes (Solzhenitsyn ended up working in a kind of fictional/historical pastiche format and didn’t like the term novel applied to what he was doing).I won’t go through this book item by item, but I did find a few things worth remarking.Dostoevsky’s faith in the Russian People and the Russian Orthodox Church was boundless.Dostoevsky was deeply preoccupied with the so-called “Eastern Question” which actually refers to Europe’s eastern border on Russia and not to Russia’s eastern border with the Orient.He was a man of strange compassion, always ready to take up the pen to assault injustices perpetrated by Russia’s new courts.He liked to think of Russia as a kind of new country, still fresh and waking up to its mission on earth.He rejected the notion that pan-Slavism was a key to understanding Russia’s quarrel with Europe; he liked to place more emphasis on a spiritual fraternity that united people under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Church, or Eastern Orthodox Church, as the case may be (though not the Greek Orthodox Church).The line of descent he liked to trace in religious affairs went from Byzantium into what would become Russia, which inherited Orthodoxy in its proper form and had, in some vague way, a claim on Istanbul, or Constantinople. He was an unthinking, reflexive anti-Semite of the worst kind.He adored children.His capacity to write great courtroom scenes in his novels is mirrored in his Writer’s Diary. His oratorical power was silent, spoken in ink, but thunders when you read it.He could be whimsical, self-deprecating, witty, casual and many other endearing things one wouldn’t think of in association with the author of Crime and Punishment.Somehow (presumably through intensive reading of newspapers and direct correspondence) he was able to keep up with the events of the day, including wars hundreds of miles away from where he wrote, in great detail. One wouldn’t think one could do that without the benefit of today’s instantaneous forms of communications, but I can’t see any difference between what he knew about public affairs and what our current pundits know...or don’t know. H.e was on top of thingsThere is a second volume to The Writer’s Diary that covers the years 1877-1881. I’ll probably read it because I am, in fact, a Dostoevsky fanatic and generally fascinated by Russian writers and Russia as a country. The critically important lesson one learns in the first volume of The Writer’s Diary is how alienated, confused, attracted and repelled Dostoevsky was with regard to Europe, not to mention America. We follow Putin’s Russia...or Yeltsin’s Russia...or Gorbachev’s Russia and shake our heads. That’s probably because we don’t fathom Russia’s sense of difference, vulnerability, and mission vis-a-vis the West. Dostoevsky knew all about it, and it shows up on every page of this large strange book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2012","Mar 19, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6409458-a-writer-s-diary

Went to the racetrack and picked two winners.What is going on here? Peat suggests that there are two orders in the universe: the explicit, which is what we see, and the implicit, which underpins and connects what we see to realities distant from our immediate perception.Peat’s simplest explanation of this situation draws on Carl Jung, who contended, in effect, that we all are icebergs of consciousness floating on a sea of unconsciousness that connects and gave rise to us in the first place.A more complicated explanation draws on quantum theory, wherein two subatomic particles can become “entangled” and remain connected to one another despite thousands of miles, or more, of distance between them. This is one of those provocative books that explores our indifference to why things are as they are...they just are.It ends with an interesting image: aliens land on earth, see humankind’s sameness all over the globe and cannot imagine how we can tolerate, and even provoke, the fantastic inequality of conditions that prevail in the developed and developing world....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2012","Mar 04, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92550.Synchronicity

Thereafter, both Mexico and the U.S. found the new border between our two countries hard to define as a literal line in the sand and even more difficult to define as an emblem of state power: my law is the only law on this side...your law is the only law on that side.Having worked and lived on the border for a number of years, I know what a rough, ambiguous and violent place it can be. There are things I have seen in the canyons north of Tijuana, right at the U.S. border, that have no place in what 99.9% of Americans would think to be American. Subsequent wallbuilding has quieted some of the action, but there is an ethical ugliness to the way we have approached migration and smuggling that is harsh and constant. One doesn’t have to know what to do to change things, although I have a few notions, to recognize that there is something wrong all along the border, and not just the western border.Better books to reveal the harsh realities of the border’s past and present are novels like Cormac MacCarthy’s Blood Meridian and Roberto Bolaños’ 2666. Both excel in depicting mindless violence, generally driven by greed but going beyond that. So reading Blood Meridian and 2666 is one prescription I’d offer for a national elevation of consciousness about the border. We in the U.S. need to face the fact that our insatiable appetite for drugs, cocaine, etc., is what fuels the astonishing violence and corruption that travels from our border all the way to Bolivia. The only way to change this is through the earliest kinds of childhood intervention and family support programs. Bad neighborhoods, broken families, and bad schools breed drug use. Good neighborhoods, ostensibly united families, and good schools breed drug use, too. Every family in American with young children needs help facing the torments and temptations of illicit drugs. Until we slow down consumption, we won’t slow down the killing on our own streets and further south.Illegal immigration is another important issue that breeds great misery both north and south of the border. Right now we’re in an ebb tide because jobs are scarce in the U.S. construction industry and enforcement is up, but that will change. Right now, then, would be a good time to face the fact that it would be better for Mexicans (and others) to enter the U.S. under organized worker programs--we’ve had them before--than to play cat and mouse with desperate souls in the deathly deserts of the southwest. Walls can’t be built high enough when the jobs are here to feed families. As Janet Napolitano said once, “Show me a fifty foot wall and I’ll show you a fifty-one foot ladder.” By the same token, I have seen massive walls on the border smashed through by even more massive bulldozers. Brazen? You bet. The border is a life and death proposition for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people.But again, my practical thoughts aside, I point to the value of fiction versus history in exploring certain complex events and regions. The St. John book is informative, but not moving.

LiThere's no reason that in a given year several short stories will appear that are instant classics, and that appears to have been the case in 2011. Like most anthologies of this nature, there is an unevenness of quality compensated to a certain degree by a great variety of approach.There are twenty stories here. Seven appeared in The New Yorker. That's thirty-five percent, far and away the most impressive representation from any periodical. Granta, Tin House and McSweeney's each made the collection twice. So now we have well over half the stories here selected from four magazines.Let's start with The New Yorker stories and say right off that they aren't classic New Yorker stories of the poignant, lyrical kind Updike and Cheever once wrote, although Claire Keegan's ""Foster,"" about a foster child in Ireland and Nathan Englander's ""Free Fruit for Young Widows,"" about sentimental attachments in Israel come close. Both are fine stories. Joyce Carol Oates's story, ""I.D."", is a fictionalized version of her much better essay about losing her husband. Here, unfortunately, the action is filtered through a familiar type of adolescent in Oates' work: the abandoned and abused kind. George Saunder's New Yorker story, ""Escape from Spiderhead,"" is a fairly boring riff on chemical experimentation on human beings. Sam Lipsyte's New Yorker piece, ""The Dungeon Master,"" is one of those tales that interweaves adolescent culture of the technological kind with the pathos and alienation that J.D. Salinger once took on more directly. It's difficult to know why either The New Yorker or this anthology's editor, Geraldine Brooks, selected the Oates, Saunders, and Lipsyte stories. Allegra Goodman's story, ""La Vida Nuova,"" is a kind of New Yorker teardrop--through it you see a confused young woman sorting out the threats of maturity through aesthetic choices and preferences.For me the best stories in this collection are Ehud Havazelet's ""Gurov in Manhattan"" and the aforementioned Englander piece.The worst stories are Caitlin Horrocks ""The Sleep"" and Steven Millhauser's ""Phantoms."" Why? Because each is a kind of idea piece, not a compelling story, with an odd hook (one village decides to hibernate throughout the winter because things are so dull there and another village is full of phantoms no one else can see...or explain). These are static, predictable efforts that well-controlled prose can't rescue. Then there is the syrupy Bret Anthony Johnston story, ""Soldier of Fortune,"" that really doesn't belong here at all. It's a workshop effort competently executed in one sense but undermined by the culminating fantasy in which the girl next door spreads her legs for the boy next door and draws him into her pain.One of the best features of this volume is the end matter, by which I mean ""Other Distinguished Stories"" of the year and a long list of magazines and their addresses...whose writers are not represented here in anything like the New Yorker/Tin House/Granta/McSweeney's abundance.The short story form still works, and people seem to be publishing and reading it in ever greater numbers. Perhaps what's needed here is an alternative to this ""Best Stories"" series that isn't so editorially clubby.Would I recommend buying and reading this volume? I suppose I wouldn't.

And there are funny essays, like Christy Vannoy's spoof on essays called ""A Personal Essay by a Personal Essay,"" but then there are a lot of essays here that deserve Vannoy's satirical treatment.The criteria for this volume seem to have included categories such as: 1) Something weird happened to me; 2) I am weird; 3) I know someone who is weird and 4) I can't figure out whether the world is weird or not but I keep staring at it hard and it's not saying anything to me.Accidents, dismemberment, illnesses, sexual anomalies, and uncomfortable cultural adjustments are frequent topics here...like, really frequent.When the nurse treating your injury in the ER doesn't say much, what is she supposed to say? What are the green tiles in the hospital corridor supposed to say? What's that penis popping out of that guy's pants got on its mind--moi?The world comes across as a varied but somehow unrewarding place. Shopping center parking lots--now there's a topic for meditation. What are all those cars about? Why's K-Mart so dumb looking? Why don't we have any ziggurats around here? What about a cathedral? Just those rows and rows of lamp posts?And if I'm weird on the telephone, boy, am I weird in person even though I used to be a whole lot fatter when all I would do is talk to people on the phone, never let them see me.I know, some of my wisecracks are over the politically incorrect line, but if you read this book, you'll find what I'm saying shows up with metronomic predictability. The essayists can't figure things out. They drive all the way to a prison to talk to a man who murdered a childhood friend, and the guy doesn't have anything worth listening to, despite what you put yourself through approaching him. Or they discover that going through an earthquake is really a surprising experience, but you sort of get used to the corpses lying around after a few days.This provokes me to offer a few thoughts on what makes an essay good and who writes good essays. Pico Iyer, cited above, writes good essays because he's culturally insightful, not dumbfounded, and writes fine prose. Atul Gawande, who is not included, writes great essays because he too writes fine prose and they are full of fascinating medical information--and potential cures or treatments. William Gass writing about literature writes gorgeous essays; they're intellectually challenging and exquisitely phrased. Joyce Carol Oates wrote an essay in 2011 (I think; but it may have been 2010) wherein she recounted coming apart when facing the end of her beloved husband's life. Oates can be a messy stylist but not this time. Then there's a stiletto-brilliance of Joan Didion and I could go on. Good to great essays are thoughtful, vivid, full of information and would tend to make bad TV. A lot of the essays here would be great at making bad TV.

There's a bit of that here, but there is also an element of inexplicable fortitude and good fortune. John and Robert Darnton, the one a successful journalist, the other a distinguished academic, somehow managed to survive losing their journalist father early in WWII and then coping with their alcoholic mother until one wild and terrible night, the mother went through four episodes of DT's with only 14 year-old John to see her through...and after that never had a drink again. Subsequently, John followed Robert to Andover, an elite prep school, and the two of them, with ups and downs, stayed close enough to collaborate in tracking down the essential facts of their parents' lives. Example: their parents never actually married; example: their father died of ""friendly fire"" and didn't die right away, painlessly; example: both their parents slept around, married badly more than once, drank too much, and negligently contributed to an increasingly impoverished childhood for the boys...rescued at last by scholarships to Andover (which John managed to blow in a bad-boy phase of his turbulent adolescence.)The formula here is substantial journalistic detective work revealing the facts of Barney Darnton's death in the waters off Papua New Guinea. Upon finding the exact place where his father died, and meeting men who saw Barney die and had his blood on their clothes, John finds a kind of peace.In fact, it probably could be said that he (and Robert) did more to honor their father than their father ever did to honor them. Barney Darnton didn't have to cover the Pacific war theater, he was just that kind of journalist--he wanted to, never mind the little boys.Having gone on to a distinguished career as a foreign correspondent, John Darnton seems to have understood Barney's drive, but as a close observer of foreign correspondents for many years, I can tell you they are all a strange lot. Being a foreign correspondent sometimes means dangerous action; more often it means boredom, crappy hotel rooms, and interminable travel, lightened chiefly by the camraderie foreign correspondents develop among themselves and with the ""locals,"" whomever the locals may be.Part of Almost a Family addresses John and Robert's mother attempting to challenge journalistic customs as a journalist herself. She did this through the 30s, 40s and 50s. It was a tough task; she often failed to succeed, which is how I prefer to put it as opposed to simply ""failed."" No doubt male hegemony in the newsroom contributed a bit to her reliance upon alcohol.The great family memoir of our times, Angela's Ashes, possesses a species of compressed poetry that is lacking in Almost a Family. This book, written by a journalist, is pretty literal and fiercely researched. The question that arises with respect to all family sagas, however, is ""compared to what?"" The McCourts had a terrible time of it (drink playing its role), the Darntons had a terrible time of it...and so did the Kennedys...and so did your aunt and uncle. It does seem to me that a family memoir must have some kind of unity lurking within the family's demise. This tale is a bit spread out. We don't learn that much about the mature Robert Darnton, and for all the time spent on Barney Darnton,he comes across as a fine fellow among a group of not-so-fine fellows. The facts of his death are revealed more clearly that the spirit of his life, and it's just not clear how such parents, footloose and feckless, gave the world such extremely accomplished sons.Is life, as my opening lines and this book suggest, an ongoing accident? Darnton doesn't quite make the mystic chords of memory and the past prove otherwise. Again, he's a journalist, and the story is the story. If you're interested in this particular story, read it If it strikes you as a story that won't move you, there's no compelling vision here that will make it worth your time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2011","Dec 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8767524-almost-a-family

That's a good description of The Future of HistI must admit that I am something of a sucker for short books by master thinkers of encyclopedic scope. That's a good description of The Future of History by John Lukacs. It's a dense meditation on the art and practice of history, aligning it more closely with literature than science, that contains one especially stimulating chapter (for me, at least): ""History and the Novel.""But I'll get to that chapter in a moment. First some quick observations and issues: Lukacs wants to define history as we know it as something that sprang up in the 17th or 18th centuries along with a human self-awareness that he refers to as interiority. This is an observation that parallels, to some degree, Harold Bloom's contention that Shakespeare essentially invented the modern personality and put it on full display in his plays.I find both these contentions odd. Lukacs knows, of course, about Thucydides and Bloom knows about Catullus, but each scholar is seeking to define a new phase in human experience and so each sets aside pretty good examples of historians and self-reflective, ironic literary personae that appeared on the human landscape thousands of years before their heroes of the ""modern."" In general, Lukacs is writing a lament for what he calls the European or Bourgeois Age, which he argues required disciplined, well-trained historical researchers and writers whose principal job has been to ferret out untruths and secondary job has been to assert truths about that which has slipped away from us on the river of time.History, he says, is always revisionist because it deals in a continuously evolving past that shapes and reshapes itself along with our perceptions of it. But he notes that history is not taught as much as it used to be in high schools and colleges and that the first print run of a history book by a university press often is 500 copies. Will we eventually lose interest in reading? Or the ability to read and reflect? Are we doomed to a future that will be defined by images, not words? What will this do to the critical faculties of the human mind?These are pretty common concerns, but Lukacs does note that trade publishers sell more history books than novels, that history books written by what he calls ""amateurs"" are often better than history books written by PhDs, and that technology, rather than making us more materialistic, in some ways is freeing us to wander about in a more spiritual sort of way.Example: I am sitting in my study in Arlington, Virginia. In a few minutes I will ""publish"" this . And people I don't know in places I've never visited will have the chance to read, or ignore, what I've written. Why? Technology. But the subject is history, thought and books, and neither you nor I will pay much attention to the technological procedures bringing us together. What will interest us is Lukacs's provocations.Now, the chapter on history and the novel: It's full of wonderful quotes, beginning with ""Every novel is a historical novel, in one way or another.""Lukacs point is that novelists often record social history better than historians do through accurate observation and that they often tease out of an ""age"" characters who, while fictional, define that age as well or better than actual historical figures--Madame Bovary, for instance. But the novel is limited by, or defined by, class divisions in a given society. That's what makes it a strong symbol of bourgeois consciousness. And as classes melt (slowly, to be sure), the novel has lost its way, becoming too interior (Ulysses, for example) or too ""exterior"" (Norman Mailer's last novel attempting to write ""faction"" about Hitler's youth.)You will have your own views on whether Lukacs makes a good case or not, but he so at ease ranging over all of modern history and literature that you're likely to take him seriously. His suggestion that the turn toward subjectivity (Ulysses, again) strengthens poetry while it weakens fiction seems somehow right to me, much as I admire Ulysses and don't share his questioning attitude toward it.This book is only 177 pages. It's well-written but dense with erudite observations and citations. Lukas, having written more than twenty books, apologizes at the end for many historical scholars having ignored his work and not included it in their bibliographies or surveys of topical historical literature. This is typical of him. He's not really apologizing. He's admitting that he's vain and shouldn't be overlooked. And he's right....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 22, 2011","Dec 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11183207-the-future-of-history

It is a detailed, almost novelistic account of industrialized terror that began in 1918 and extended right through Stalin's death in 1953. Solzhenitsyn lets the incidents, episodes, tactics, and horrors speak for themselves with the power of a locomotive. He is dry, brutally honest, and a faithful witness to sadism beyond comprehension. the fact that he can go on and on underscores his veracity. He couldn't have made these things up. This was paranoid Russia executing itself over a period of decades, drawing Russians into the machinery of imprisonment, stamping out the most trivial forms of rebellion against the system, and yielding agonies that are something like black humor--at least in Solzhenhitsyn's hands.I won't get into a comparison of the Holocaust with Stalinism. I'll just note that millions upon millions of Russians (and other nationalities living within the USSR's sphere of control) died under Stalinism while trapped in the continental-scale Gulag...or en route to it.As a writer, Solzhenitsyn, who suffered horribly within the Gulag, is relentless, sardonic, sarcastic, and merciless towards the USSR's jailers. Comparable writing shows up in some of William Manchester's books, some of Norman Mailer's books, and only a few others: it never lets up, there's always another miserable feature of the torment to document. How, you ask yourself, could Solzhenitsyn have had the personal strength, indeed power, to survive to tell the tale, and many other tales? If you are interested in this kind of writing, or Russia, or the USSR, or the general issue of inhumanity underpinned by genocidal cunning, then The Gulag Archipelago is an indispensable book.Now, to today's discussion: Vladimir Putin just having had himself reelected, was the demise of the USSR for naught? Most of the panelists struck notes of hope, focusing on Putin's surprisingly narrow margin of victory. There seemed to be a rough consensus that social media, a globalized younger generation, and Russia's economic strength (build on oil and gas reserves) may slowly...slowly...bring about a post-Putin era wherein an autocrat does not rule Russia.But there were two dissents. Ambassador Hartman related a wonderful story about preparing to go to the USSR in the mid-1980s and first consulting with the sage of Soviet affairs, George Kennan. Implicitly disavowing the wisdom of his own writing, Kennan told Hartman to forget what had been written about Russia in the last 50 years. Instead, he advised Hartman to go back to the memoirs of Russians in the early part of the 1800s. There he would find the core of Russia's self-doubt and need for domination from within. So Hartman did not join the others on the panel (Koppel was pretty skeptical, too) in thinking fair thoughts about Russia's future. He said there wasn't a general liberalism afoot in Russia; people who were making money just wanted to be left alone; people who weren't making money just wanted to make money; everyone wanted certainty in power.A young Russian then stood up and said he agreed 100% with what Kennan had told Hartman and what Hartman said now.The magnitude of Solzhehnitsyn's Gulag Archipelago adds weight to these dissenting views. The issue isn't entirely ""soul,"" but something persists through centuries of snow that seeks complete control over a disparate populace, and that populace knows itself and its history better than we in the West know it.So should we continue to work hard to make nuclear superpower Russia less dangerous, even though the Cold War is over and the USSR dissolved twenty years ago? The answer, all agreed, is yes....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Dec 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956

The novel begins with a kind of joke. Willie Chandran was so named for W. Somerset Maughm who once met Willie's confused father, a silent holy man in India. This brought Willie no luck, however. Maughm wrote about the father, but he never expressed interest in helping Willie, not even when Willie showed up in London.The London Willie came to (sometime in the 50's, one imagines) was a kind of imperial beach, littered with the human artifacts that the British Empire had brought upon itself: Indians, people from the Caribbean, Africans, Canadians, and so forth. Everyone was half something, half something else.As it happens, Willie has some luck writing for the BBC while pursuing studies at an unnamed college. He then squeezes a book of short stories out of himself, most of the stories fables set in imaginary kingdoms. One thinks, aha, like Maughm Willie will become a writer, and perhaps a successful one. But no, here Naipaul breaks off his own personal saga (he came to London from Trinidad and established himself as a writer from the get-go) and takes Willie on a kind of cultural/sexual saga wherein he experiments with whores, loose Brits looking for a fling with a man of color, and then a Portuguese-African, Ana, who in some ways saves him. They move to a Portuguese colony in Africa where her father left her an estate, and for eighteen years Willie accomodates himself to luxury in the bush, with occasional night rides into the dance halls of black Africans where his needs are explosively satisfied by very young women.His life seems pointless. The lives around him also seem pointless. High points are the night rides and the weekend lunches at other estates, where the architectural grandeur (or pretension) is not matched by intrinsic human interest. (Sidenote: Having spent much of my life exposed to well-to-do ex-pats, I'm of the opinion that they're among the saddest of all human beings, ravenous to hear about the States but insistent that they know the States better, far better, than anyone who actually lives there.)Then Willie meets a woman named Gracia, who is his instant soulmate although she's trapped in a marriage to a drunk estate manager. Well, there's a loping quality in a Naipaul in which ""one day"" these things happen; they just do. Two eyes meet two eyes and all four eyes explode with understanding.But meanwhile the Portuguese-based regime is crumbling; black Africa is reclaiming its rightful place, and Gracia and Willia (and Ana) are pulled apart, unsure that any of them has really had a life, or perhaps even half a life, the book's title.Oops, I gave the ending away, but this hardly matters. Naipaul excels in perfectly controlled, clearly focused, exotic studies of people and the cultural landscapes in which they dwell. That's what you read him for. This isn't Of Human Bondage, big and throbbing and heart-wrenching. No, Willie and other protagonists in Naipaul's books are written in minor keys. Their claims are acute but modest; they are trapped betwixt and between, and that's what one reads Naipaul to experience...that ambiguity and ambivalence...that sense that among ex-pats there are at least a few thoughtful, pained figures worth your time....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Nov 26, 2011","Nov 26, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5853.Half_a_Life

Implicitly there is a comparison between between his fight for justice and that of King and Kennedy, but the comparison really is only implicit. Hemingway makes a more extended appearance, and he seems accurately and incisively presented, although why he does what he does, and what he's doing in the novel, doesn't make much sense. He was a bully and a snot, and his references to himself as Dr. Hemigstein smell a bit of anti-Semitism, or at the least, a distaste for psychoanlysis and anything that isn't true and fine and beautiful.To make a longer story shorter, Quinn meets an unbelievably sensual, sexual, impulsive Cuban named Renata--from a good family, no less--and marries her within a few days of their first encounter. She then is separated from him, abused by the police, and eventually, some lovers later, returns to Quinn's embrace and, ultimately, his life as a reporter in Albany.On the day in question--which is the heart of the novel--there's unrest in Albany, Quinn's Alzheimer-plagued father has a good time, a concert is played by a dying pianist, Renata's niece is burned along with her rabble-rousing African-American lover, and a large sum of drug money appears...which no one seems to want. (Hey, I'll take it.)So this isn't the poetically compressed and moving Kennedy of Ironweed. Let's get that out of the way. What is it? Well, it's fun because it's so expertly written and staged, and it's a little confusing because too much happens to too many characters the reader (or this reader) doesn't really understand or identify with.I remember once having a discussion with a German Faulkner expert who thought that The Reivers was perhaps one of Faulkner's greatest works. Well, that's not the case, and this book is sort of an end-of-career, let's have fun novel by Kennedy.If you already like Kennedy, you'll want to read it. That's why I read it. If you find yourself impatiently wondering why you're continuing to read it, you probably will be getting some gratification from Kennedy's quick dialogue and his romantic moments of revelation (they come about every three pages and don't always involve sex, many of them are built on a foundation of nostalgia and remembered snatches of song from the thirties and forties.)In his extensive acknowledgements, Kennedy thanks dozens of Cubans and Americans and cites quite a few rather heavy and obscure books about Cuba and its history. This suggests he took the work quite seriously, but he wrote it comically and overstuffed it with subplots that prevented him from really examining what he had in mind....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 21, 2011","Nov 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11107247-chang-s-beads-and-two-tone-shoes

Greene wrote the screenplay, but to prepare himself to do so, he wrote the novella first…and after the movie came out, he published the novella.This is an interesting mode of composition, whether Greene pursued it as he normally did by writing exactly 500 words each morning or not.I usually recapitulate the plot of a book when I comment on it, but this book, through the movie, is so well known that I’ll cut to the chase: the action and plot twists get in the way of Greene’s superb prose, which normally is both evocative and beautifully cadenced.Here there are bursts of dialogue, undeveloped characters, characters wearing toupees who don’t need them, and a passionate outbreak of love in the main character that surprises the reader as much as it apparently surprised the woman towards whom it was directed.Both the movie and the book suffer from one defect, and it’s pretty serious: the villainous Harry Lime (Orson Welles) stages his own death early in the action and then returns after it’s been established by hearsay that he makes his money distributing and watering down penicillin on the black market. He’s cool and untroubled about this; that’s his flair, I suppose. But objectively speaking, his activity is hideous…and yet we never really have an opportunity to probe his motivations and personal corruption.Of course, Greene writes well and cleverly enough to tell a tale worth reading, but again, it’s not as good as the movie, and for me that is almost never the case....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 09, 2011","Oct 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48800.The_Third_Man

They seem to be narrative focal points that Solzehenitsyn deemed critical to his historial/fictional style of writing, which he didn't willingly subjugate to the term ""novel.""In this case, Solzhenitsyn had written some knots about Lenin, found himself an exile in Zurich, and decided he would expand the knots to form, more or less, a novel about Lenin's time in Zurich just before entering the famous closed train that returned him to the Russia and the revolution he ultimately dominated.The book--let's call it that--is a psychological study of Lenin as a frustrated emigre revolutionary who had missed the action in the abortive Revolution of 1905 and finds himself holed up in Zurich, willfully keeping pace with his revolutionary monomania by writing, reading, and corresponding with other revolutionary socialists, ultimately to be known as communists.Here's a taste of it: ""His whole career, twenty-three years of uninterupted militant campaigning against political stupidity, vulgarity, opportunism, his whole grim life uner a constant hail of hatred, had brought him--what? Only isolation.""Sometimes the narrative moves along as an interior monologue, sometimes scenes are remembered, full of dialogue and scheming, sometimes Lenin allows himself a drop or two of nostalgia about losing touch with the woman he loved, Inessa Armand.But what's really important about the book is the portrait of Lenin's relentless determination to expose soft revolutionaries (those who would not start with violence and emphasize violence in revolution above all other initial measures) and bring down the czar.How does one survive decades of failed conferences, idiotic alliances, betrayals, theoretical debates, detailed research into the history of revolution, and so forth? Well, one has to be relatively iron-willed and not a little monomaniacal.There's little evidence I know of that contradicts Solzhenitsyn's portrait of Lenin. He was a bully and a schemer who reminds me of the negotiating style of one Washington potentate I knew: you get your way in a negotiation by being the first to break it off...as soon as possible...and making the other party come back to you in astonishment, asking why you did that.The almost unimaginable horror Lenin, followed by Stalin, unleashed on the Russian people, isn't really present in the book because it ends before he takes power, but there's no mistaking his belief in violence, his constant counsel and measuring stick. Are you willing to shoot, club, start fires, bomb, and create mayhem? If not, goodbye. If so, let's conspire together.In a way it was an odd approach, given Lenin's basic nature as an intellectual, not a hunter, a fighter himself, or anything of the sort, but he had come to this conclusion intellectually, and it is a constant theme throughout Solzhenitsyn's book.Of course Solzhenitsyn, who suffered under communism, must have hated Lenin, and yet with artistic fortitude and imagination, grounded in substantial research, he portrays the bald little man with the slits for eyes with compelling fidelity and in disturbing detail. This is something of a Shakespearian or Dostoevskian performance: the man you loathe is as interesting a literary subject to you as the man you love.What ""we literary types"" and many ""journalistic types,"" too, often lack is an appreciation for politics as endless, grubby, conversation-by-conversation, argument-by-argument, failure-by-failure work. Solzhenitsyn excels here in decompressing the refined image of Lenin at the barricades and letting us see his endlessly disciplined, boring, often fruitless efforts to get to those barricades. He does it by staying so close to this repugnant man, mastering his twisted relations with his fellow revolutionaries and rivals, and recreating an epoch that, until it occurred, seemed like it might never occur--that instead of the barbaric thing that became Soviet communism might have taken shape as some kind of parliamentary leftism, social democratic style.I discovered the pleasures of writing about miserable rulers when I took on Herod the Great in my novel, The Man Clothed in Linen. True, some of them are beyond characterization in their banality (Hitler, curiously enough, was just such a personal nothing when lacking an audience; he was as much a mirror as a man) but the Herods, the Lenins, the Maos, and a host of other power-mongering demons give the writer something to rejoice in: contradictions, pathos, spleen, pride, and self-defeat. Power is coarsening, the lust for it is coarsening, but men and women who seek it often are riveting.

It is a learned, complex, and yet accessible study of how ""modernity"" (sometimes referred to as ""the west"") was given birth by three successive maritime nations--Holland, the U.K, and the U.S.-- each adept in promoting prosperity through trade, innovations in finance (joint stock companies, stock markets, houses of exchange and corresponding banks) and sea-based geo-political supremacy.In Mead's account Holland and the U.K. were colonialists/imperialists and the United States is a more abstract hegemon of open global systems that keep Eurasian powers in check while keeping Africa and Latin America under a regime of semi-benign neglect. He contends that the U.K., whose history he has thoroughly and impressively mastered, set the stage for U.S. predominance in part through mastering the art of 1/ religious tolerance, 2/ preserving and protecting irrational but socially useful traditionalism and 3/ advancing the cause of scientific rationalism. These factors underpin what Mead, following Karl Popper, terms an ""open society,"" that is, a society wherein natural, human, and divine law can work out their differences with a focus on marketplace advances as opposed to battlefield settlements.There are times when this book bogs down or becomes cloudy. One less than bright spot is the late entrance of the theology of Reinhold Niebuhr, founded on an acceptance of the doctrine of original sin, which Mead offers as a means of tempering American arrogance. I find it hard to take the theological dimension of American culture as seriously as Mead proposes, but rather than be arrogantly dismissive myself, let's say I'm skeptical, skepticism being a concept Mead introduces but does not fully develop in terms of Anglo-Saxon, or, as he prefers, anglican culture.Closed societies, in Mead's paraphrase of Popper and Henri Bergson, tend to be overemphatic in one of the three principal dimensions of modern social life: the religious, the traditional, or the scientific/logical. Interestingly, he finds European nations (perhaps because they are so sick of irrational warfare) to be more in line with the scientific/logical dimension of things than the United States. Widely known statistics do show that the U.S. is more ""God-fearing"" and ""God-believing"" than Europe, but the paradox remains that the vitality of American religious experience co-exists with an almost totally secular, technologically based social style--we are materialistic, positivistic, and massively contradictory.Ultimately, it would seem that openness can be phrased and developed in many different ways: skepticism is one way, tolerance is another, suspicion of absolute authority a third. Mead, following Niebuhr and others, essentially argues that the unknowability of the divine--God's mystery--is a healthy, humbling, tempering factor, to which Americans ought to pay more attention.Working at the Council on Foreign Relations, where foreign policy tends to be framed within narrow, governmental terms (national interest, state sovereignty, international law and organizations, etc.), Mead stands out as someone who is prepared to think broadly about global affairs and give culture its due in assessing historical events. He doesn't write the history of wars and call it history; he looks much further afield.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 24, 2011","Feb 24, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5148818-god-and-gold

First of all, Canada is a nation in its own right that should no more be evaluated in a U.S. context than any other country. And then:	Canada is a country of two primary languages, English and French, and two primary cultures, English and French, that has successfully drawn so many immigrants from around the world that soon “others” will outnumber the Canadians who are descendents of the original English and French settlers.	Canada, like the United States, occupies a geographical space that was populated before the arrival of European explorers, traders, and settlers. Conflict between indigenous peoples and these Europeans did occur, just as in the U.S., during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but Canada’s treatment of indigenous peoples has been, on the whole, more respectful and less violent.	Once Great Britain assumed political control of Canada from France, in 1760, it managed to remain in control, sans revolution as in the U.S., until Canada peacefully attained constitutional self-rule under the British North America Act of 1867. And even then, the mother country retained responsibility for Canada’s foreign affairs and international security.	Great Britain’s primacy in Canadian affairs did not alter the fundamental fact that Quebec largely remained French in language and culture, however. Today English and French are “official” languages, the defeat of several separatist efforts in Quebec during the latter half of the 20th century notwithstanding.	Like the United States, Canada is a continental, or transcontinental, country, but it is punctuated in the center by the massive Canadian Shield, a barren region of Precambrian rock. Further, most of its population clusters in a narrow band along the border with the U.S., Canada’s north being inhospitable for European settlement.That population is about one tenth of the U.S. population, closely linked to the fate of the U.S. economy, its largest market, and sustained by Canada’s extraordinary resources: more coastline than the United States, more fossil fuel reserves, extraordinary deposits of iron, nickel, other valuable minerals, vast tracts of softwood timber, and a huge breadbasket full of wheat and other grains. More than 60% of the world’s lakes are located in Canada, including four of the five Great Lakes. Only Russia, with its 11 time zones, is physically larger than Canada.	Canada’s problem, then, hasn’t been a lack of natural resources. It has been the challenge of a strong English/French heritage compounded by a strong tradition of federal prerogatives that the country’s major provinces (and regions) have exercised in varying ways and at varying times. The poor Maritimes to the east, bordering the world of the Atlantic, have little in common with the richer parts of Canada in the west, occupying a perch on the edge of the Pacific. Once poor, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in the center, have gained influence thanks to advances in agricultural productivity and fossil fuel extraction. The two major historic provinces of Canada, Ontario and Quebec, remain centers of finance, manufacturing, media and politics, with Toronto gradually outstripping Montreal as the dominant Canadian metropolis.	Through Canada’s history, its great political leaders—prime ministers like Macdonald, Laurier, King, St. Laurent, and Trudeau—have walked tightropes as they balanced English and French, east, west, and central political influences. Initially, they sought to establish Canada’s sovereign field of action independent of but coordinated with Great Britain and the Empire. Then they assumed new responsibilities within the Commonwealth. Ultimately, World War II and the Cold War connected Canada intimately with the United States, and yet all the time Canadians knew they were not Americans or Brits or Frenchmen. Their problem set was that of a rising middle power with a strong economy limited by a relatively small population—far smaller than the population of the U.K., France, and comparable European countries like Germany.	One of the most perplexing chapters in Riendeau’s history of Canada has to do with the failure of the Trudeau administration to achieve energy independence, shielding the Canadian economy from world oil-price increases. As noted, Canada has vast petroleum reserves, natural gas, hydroelectric and wind power. If any nation should be able to provide its own energy, it’s Canada, but “protecting” the Canadian marketplace from U.S. influence apparently is almost impossible. When Americans will pay more for Canadian energy, it’s difficult for Canadians not to sell it to them at a handsome profit.	Over the course of its history, Canada, like the U.S., has seen its rural/agricultural population decline to about 2% as its urban population has burgeoned. As this transformation occurred, traditional Canadian folkways—state fairs, church-based social life, handicraft pursuits and the like—withered, to be replaced by the media world aptly foretold by a Canadian, Marshall McLuhan, whose concepts, “The medium is the message,” and “the global village,” reflected changes wrought by radio, television, and film that have now been exponentially accelerated by internet connectivity. 	As a parliamentary democracy, always wrestling with massive regional and cultural divisions, Canada has outdone the United States in social policy (Canada’s health system provides Canadians the same drugs Americans use at a fraction of the cost) and international peacekeeping commitments (Canada has been part of just about every U.N. peacekeeping mission since the U.N. was founded.) But again, there is no reason to give or take away points based on how Canada conducts its business in comparison with U.S. standards.	Canada, as Riendeau’s history demonstrates, has pursued its own unique path and dealt with its own unique challenges. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 18, 2009","Feb 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2623003-a-brief-history-of-canada

Further, Spain came late to the rule of law in the sense of placing the law in the hands of an independent judiciary, which in turn would protect the patent and copy rights of innovative scientific thinkers. The mentality of the Spanish, and their former colonies, is sometimes described as ""rentier,"" meaning that the economic game is one of exploitation of resources more than the development of economic systems--principally market systems that are open, fairly regulated, and efficient.That the rentier mentality is a dead end can be illustrated fairly easily. Switzerland, with no natural resources to speak of, is a wealthy nation. Nigeria, with fabulous oil reserves, is not. The same applies to Mexico, Venezuela, Iraq and Iran.  Western Europe, Japan, and the United States, Canada, Australia and a handful of lesser nations and regions possess Bernstein's critical four factors in abundance and sufficient natural resources to make them astonishingly wealthy in historical terms. Curiously, wealth at the European/US level is generated at a fairly constant rate of 2% growth per year, including peaks and valleys. That's not an overwhelming figure. Higher growth rates do manifest themselves at certain points in a given nation's evolution, but the tendency is to settle around the 2% rate.Judging by Bernstein's criteria, where have the U.S. and other advanced economies gone wrong in the last two or three years? It would seem that we've stumbled in two areas:First, our regulatory regimes vis-a-vis financial systems has been negligent to the point of making ""rule of law"" fairly meaningless. The results we face today make it clear that it should not be ""legal"" to lend money to home buyers or credit card users who manifestly cannot pay the loans back and then, having bundled the loans, resell them to third parties, who end up holding the [empty:] bag.Second, we have permitted our regulatory negligence to generate not just bad loans but bad capital markets, undermining confidence in these vital economic systems.As Bernstein points out again and again, it is impossible to succeed economically without all four institutional factors functioning well. Remove one leg from the chair and it wobbles badly. Remove two legs and it collapses entirely.Bernstein's concluding chapters are fascinating examinations of a fundamental question: does prosperity guarantee, or generate, happiness? His answer is somewhat mixed. On the whole, the developed nations and the world at large are better housed, medicated, and fed than they were 500 years ago. But a true sense of well-being requires more than material inputs. It's important to survive; it's also important to have the opportunity to express oneself in a condition of relative freedom, and freedom, in turn, is essential for scientific rationalism to flourish and technological advances to occur.In comparing US and European prosperity, Bernstein finds that the US cycles about 30% of its Gross Domestic Product through government agencies. In Europe the figure approaches 50%. Some Europeans do seem more content as a result of this, but there is a trade-off in economic growth, where Europe lags the US slightly. So Americans have more opportunity to grow and keep their economy for themselves while Europeans probably have a greater sense of security that their fundamental health, housing, and employment needs will be met by governments that take a large share of the economic pie.One of the benefits of a crisis is that we are forced to reexamine our premises and behavior and try to understand complex realities that we have hitherto not come to terms with. Bernstein does everyone a great service by placing today's problems in a sweeping historical and theoretical context. This is the book of a polymath and, unbelievably enough, an M.D. polymath at that.   ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Feb 14, 2009","Feb 14, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/94560.The_Birth_of_Plenty_

Trapped in a loveless marriage (as they say), Scobie succumbs to a surprising and moving attraction to a shipwrecked 19-year-old, yet cannot break his sacramental ties to his wife (of course, he sleeps with the 19-year-old, but he won't just tell his wife, and thereby the Church, that in his heart the marriage is over...long since over.) This being 2009, and the novel being written in the 1940s, one must make allowances for Scobie's pain. Graham Greene himself endured a lot of pain over similar quandaries. And yet it's hard to see Scobie ending up a suicide as a result--believable, but hard.The lightest burden in the book (full of West African tedium, petty intrigue, and personalities distorted by the experience of living an expatriate, overseas life) is definitely the early romance between Scobie and the shipwrecked Helen (who lost her husband of one month when a German sub sank their ship). They flirt lightly in the first pass through and then simply realize, on reencountering one another, that ""this is it; you're the one."" It's not often that a writer has the mastery to propose a sincere coupling of this kind without having done more spadework, laid deeper foundations, and so forth. Henry and Helen are fast but not frivolous, a match that cracks the shell of solitude in which Henry has been encasing himself out there on the West African coast these last fifteen years. The surrounding cast of misfits, dreamers, schemers, time-servers, compromised servants, and gossipers reinforce Greene's basic message that quotidian reality is a thin experience sustained, in the main,by unthinking, shallow people. This gives piquancy to Henry's chance at escape, and brings him down, as well.The novel has a few choppy passages, where the narrative seems to flow along faster than the explanatory details, and one of its best characters, the Syrian Yusef, lacks the kind of background one would like to explore, but Greene is a strong, interesting tale-teller, very economical, and superb in capturing human thoughtlessness and incidental cruelty without writing all of life off as not worth the candle. Somehow the studied way in which Scobie emulates Christ, sacrificing himself in the service of belief, justifies the passing tragedy of being merely human. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 05, 2009","Feb 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3692.The_Heart_of_the_Matter

His representatives, many born overseas, capture well the diversity and eclecticism of the American experience.John Winthrop, Tom Paine, Pierre Eugene Du Simitiere (he put E Pluribus Unum on the national seal), and Israel Zangwill (author of The Melting Pot, a play Teddy Roosevelt loved) were born in Europe and brought European conceptions of ""what could be better"" to the New World.Ralph Waldo Emerson remains, in many ways, the quintessential American thinker, but Baldwin makes clear Emerson's debt to European romanticism, literary and philosophical.Figures like Jane Addams, Carter G. Woodson (who is ultimately responsible for Black History Month) and George Marshall seem hewn more directly from American timber, and yet even they were shaped and inspired by European precedents: Addams saw social action at its best in England before bringing it to Chicago; no historian (Woodson included) conducts his research without having learned lessons from the 19th century German historians, and Marshall's greatest triumph came from helping to rebuild Europe after WWII when he saw that America's future would be bleak without a prosperous transatlantic partner in democracy.The American Revelation benefits from Baldwin's strategy of composing a biographical mosaic. Many seminal Americans are left out, but that's inevitable. The best chapters focus on Addams and Woodson. Perhaps the greatest figure studied is Marshall.

This is a book that's too densely packed with interesting data, arranged in short, thematic chapters, to be read from front to back, much as London is a city that's too large and infinite to be visited thoroughly even during a long, hyperactive visit. Instead, I think most readers will end up doing what I did--skipping around to find items of interest: the history of the stage in London, the experiences of the Londoners during the Blitz, the effects of Henry VIII's decision to break with the Roman Catholic Church, the persistence of Chaucerian character-types.My experiences in London over 4 decades correspond in some measure to Ackroyd's insistence on the Dickensian quality of the place...the fogs, low ceilings, narrow alleyways...but his book does drop the ball in conveying the influence of parks and gardens on the London experience and fails to convey the full impact of London's cosmopolitanism--its infinity of peoples, costumes, and cuisines, in the post-Imperial, post-Colonial, post-modern era. I also wish there were a more extended meditation in it somewhere on literary London (writers are quoted all the time, but their London lives aren't stitched together in what you might call a cultural appraisal of the life of letters in London).That said, Ackroyd has no qualms about emphasizing London's dingy quality, its patched-together architecture, and its continuous (for millennia) construction and deconstruction. This is his overriding theme: here's a city with a strong, peculiar personalty with which no one can do anything; it must be accepted as it is for what it is; tear it down and it will twist and torture your plans to build it anew; bomb it and it will survive underground; make it a ""fashionable"" destination, and it will satirize its own fashionableness. As a ""book,"" this text strikes me as something of a marketing enterprise: here's the biggest, most comprehensive, last word on London, so you have to have it.

It is notable its varied depictions of the sterility of the modern world, its sympathy for undeveloped characters, and its consistent search for new ways to narrate disaster in the form of gang rape, exploitation, petty theft, and pseudo-romantic suicide (the lover drives off the same cliff exactly one year after the beloved took her plunge.)The fact that Le Clezio is a ""writer"" is clear in his sinuous, repetitive, hypnotic, disturbing prose, but as his career developed, he must have (I'll try a few more of his books) begun to understand that his nihilistic reductionism severely circumscribed his literary talent.

Le Carre is a strong storyteller nonetheless, achieving vivid atmospheric effects (Moscow, London, an island off the coast of Maine, Leningrad) and driving scenes forward with deft, spirited dialogue.The peculiar satisfaction of the book lies in the main character, Barley, shaking off the chains he's been wrapped in by the British and American intelligence agencies, so that he can set his Russian lover free--from her own doomed Russian lover and the claws of the dying Soviet state.Less satisfying is the appeal Barley exerts over Katya, his Russian co-conspirator.

This qualifies as an alcoholic, and in my experience, heavy-duty alcoholics are not as charming as they think they are.Inevitably, a spy thriller published in 1989 will seem dated, but this one, based on revelations about the rottenness of the Soviet state, must have seemed quite clairvoyant. At the time of its release, the USSR was, in fact, crumbling under the weight of its inefficiencies.The spycraft and tediously restrained spymasters are realistic--human beings constrained by their bureaucratic procedures, yearning to be impetuous (like Barley) but not daring to be, yearning to chuck their marriages and run off with an exotic lover, but not daring to do so.Viewed as a study in international relations, The Russia House is a parable about the futility of the arms race between two superpowers whose competition gave a taste of global greatness they couldn't spit out to save their souls.

There's a kind of yearning in him not to be the author of the send-up satire Carnovsky, but rather the author of filial loyalty or romantic love or marital constancy, if not fidelity. And Roth doesn't really have fun with this; he lets Zuckerman be the observer of everyone else's bizarre reaction to his wealth, his fame, and his repudiation of his family/Jewishness/sexual modesty.

There is the vulnerable maid from the country, a senile woman in her nineties, her feckless and increasingly disturbed middle-aged grandson, his school chum (a doctor who cannot save him from himself) and a corresponding cast from the barrios who, through an affair with the young maid, conduct a botched robbery meant to loot the old woman of her silver.The most striking member of this cast is Emilia, the nonagenarian, whose senility is foul, clairvoyant, and lancing. I'm not widely read in the phenomenon and don't know that senility is often presented as it actually occurs, but I have enough experience to recognize the preternatural nastiness of Emilia, often directed at the young maid, Estela, and frequently targeted on the grandson, Andres, who lusts after Emilia but fails to seduce her before she falls to a low-life (Mario) who operates under the influence of his distasteful step-brother, Rene.At a certain point in this short novel, the romantic possibilities putrefy, and one knows that things are not going to turn out well. The death of Emilia is hardly a cause for mourning, of course--it's the younger generations whose disintegration affects one the most.Reading the book in Spanish, something I haven't done much in recent years, I may actually have escaped some of its darkness. There's a muffling that occurs when one isn't 100% certain of the cultural/linguistic ground a work of literature occupies. In this case, I've never been to Chile, although I recognize the somewhat melodramatic class tensions from years I've spent in Spain and other Latin American countries.At the same time, there's a universal nihilism afoot, plaguing the rentier class as much as the desperate underclass. This, essentially, is Dostoevskian, but it isn't quite as wild and passionate as the psycho-social scenery of Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov. What does signal true psychological desperation is Donoso's wonderful ability to portray characters contradicting themselves--agreeing to do something, then changing their minds; swearing off contact, then running into warm embraces; hurling ugly insults at one another and then sharing a glass of whiskey, wine, or beer. This is really good. Another great feature is the young maid's worldliness. As cynics contemplate exploiting her in Santiago, thinking that she'll be overwhelmed by the novelty of the experience, she refers right away to experiences she had as a thirteen year old out in the campo.

Now and again I return to his fiction, poetry, and essays either to reread something or take on a new work. He's a unique, over-the-top, incantatory, powerful writer whose contribution to human psychology remains unverified by almost anyone else. When I say this I'm not referring to his exploitation of oedipal themes, per Freud (Sons and Lovers), but of course his notions about blood consciousness, a metaphysical conviction that he reduces to this primitive image: something in the blood that binds people together, tears them apart, gives them ecstasy in being subjugated (or the reverse), and fills their spiritual nostrils with scents of both liberation and damnation.Leaving that explicit formulation (blood consciousness) and its typical instantiation (a struggle between men and women)aside, I'm left with the peculiar intimate force of Lawrence's writing, which in small doses does achieve a kind of supplemental echo, boosting the force of the narrative and creating, for me at least, a heightened sense that ordinary life is a high stakes game.How does he do it? In rereading The Fox the other day, I commented to myself how often Lawrence repeated certain words, particularly in passages where the lead female protagonist, is striving for understanding through self-castigation. The words in these passages were, over and over again, ""failure,"" ""responsibility,"" and ""reaching,"" either repeated exactly or slightly altered, so that ""failure"" might become ""failing,"" or ""reaching"" might become ""reach.This is very tiny stuff, but more than ""style."" It struck me that Lawrence was using prose to replicate ""how we think"" not through stream-of-consciousness, per se, but in an equally interesting, and perhaps more powerful way. March hates the way she feels she has let her friend Jill down and comes so easily under the sway of the fox-killing Henry. She doesn't simply reach a conclusion about this, however. In Lawrence's hands, she broods about it, endures it, and repeats it to herself the way one does over time (days, weeks, or months of a crisis that won't let you alone). And Lawrence achieves this mood through his gnawing, stuck repetitions, drawing you in.The paradox and the irony of The Fox as a powerful novella is that Henry gets March for himself, but in the process, he kills her, as he killed the fox, and as he also kills Jill.This is all murky and suspect, and yet, because March resigns herself to a living death at Henry's side, it has the quality of something more real than real.

The Men's Club is a short, mordant novel about seven men who gather in the Berkeley hills to discuss life, hardly a topic I can imagine tackling with any six of my male friends (for me it's a one-on-one subject; even if there were only three of us, one would be left out.) In the end, they talk more about the women in their lives than anything else, revealing the pains and resentments and confusions men harbor toward half of humanity while clarifying little and drinking too much. Sound boring? Well, it's only 132 pages, and Michaels wrote with great economy and deadpan vivacity, capturing a character's saga in very few words. As the years went by, I dipped into Michael's short stories with interest but not much enthusiasm until he began publishing what are known as the Nachman stories. Nachman is an academic, a mathematician, who lives in L.A., has very little social life, and yet somehow is drawn into complex ethical and moral situations that defy resolution by his rational, analytic skills. In a sense he's a classic straight man, a sort of second banana, a recipient of referred pain and slapstick knocks on the head from history, culture, and his best friend's wife. The fundamental joke is that everything makes sense when Nachman sits alone working on math problems--and nothing makes sense when anyone intrudes on him.Michaels was often praised for his short fiction, particularly his devastatingly concise style, but the Collected Stories of Leonard Michaels really reads like a prelude to the Nachman stories, seven in total, that appear at the end. They are the summa, his major accomplishment, perhaps because in Nachman he developed a character who is not transient, who absorbs punishment without being extinguished by the pain, comic or otherwise. I wouldn't recommend skipping his earlier stories to get to Nachman, but I'd suggest dipping into them selectively and then leaping ahead to the end. It would be a pity to grow tired of Michaels' droll, comic send-ups before settling in with Nachman and reading Michaels at his best....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Dec 2008,"Dec 01, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4207424-the-collected-stories

So in a way Camus&Sartre is a kind of primer in existentialism, absurdity, Marxism, and much more.Camus is the more romantic figure, a pied noir from Algeria who was a handsome cultural icon, important in the French Resistance and a writer of exceptional clarity. He wore his heart on his sleeve, and he died relatively young after winning the Nobel Prize when he was even younger. Sartre is a froggy kind of character, not just because he's French, but because he's wall-eyed, short, and jumps all over the place. Initially devoted to philosophy, it took him a long time to become politically committed, but once he did become committed, he used his astonishing intellect to dominate intellectual debate in France from the 1940s through the 1960s.Aronson comes close to novelistic depth as he interweaves the facts of these two writers' lives and the trends of their thoughts. Some of the distinctions are very subtle and conditioned on a basic grasp of Marxism, the difference between Marxism and Soviet Communism, colonialism, the French-Algerian war, and the tensions between justice and freedom...compounded by whether one accepts History as a determinative reality (Hegel) or choses to insist on the individual's freedom from History in matters of conscience.Along the way, Aronson draws frequently on Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre's long-time soul mate, lover, and debating partner. She had a one-night fling with Camus, but that adds little to the story. More important are her written reflections, which are quite acute.The pity one feels while reading this book is primarily for oneself, living in contemporary America (circa 2016). The ground truths of political thought are largely unexplored here these days, certainly not in the presidential primaries. Reductionism suits the media, so that's how our politicians go about campaigning. Which is not to say any of them, except perhaps Bernie Sanders, could expound in any theoretical detail on why he embraces his personal political philosophy--socialism, in Sanders' case.At the height of the Vietnam debate, things were somewhat different, at least on university campuses. At that time Camus, Sartre, Marcuse, and many others had an impact on us (I was in college then.) We understood that something must be going on beyond the bloodshed and mudslinging.But in a way the Cold War simplified things for us. The issue was chiefly capitalism versus communism. Which was the more pernicious? Before long gender issues, race issues, feminism, environmentalism, and other ""isms"" complicated matters, each required very specialized analyses. It became more difficult to talk across problem sets. But a few of us kept at it, and succeeding generations did what they could, and even though anti-intellectualism reigns in America (and always has), we still have, mostly on campuses, some folks capable of and interested in sophisticated commentary on why we do the things we do and how much freedom and justice result from us doing what we do.Aronson's book ends with a detailed reflection on Camus' problems with his native Algeria and the war France fought to hold onto it as a colony. At a certain point Camus was so reviled for his stance that he simply had to shut up. His problem was that while he recognized violence as inescapable in human affairs, he would twist himself into a pretzel to avoid sanctioning it. Sartre, in contrast, believed violence was justified and necessary in situations like Algeria. In No Exit, his best known play, he has one character remark that the real problem with existence is ""other people."" This is a barbed joke but essentially true. In the case of Algeria, the French settlers were the ""other people,"" and so were the indigenous Arabs. Could they get along? Camus said yes. Sartre said no. Sartre proved right. One shocking fact is that France eventually sent 400,000 troops to Algeria. That is a massive, massive force. It won, but it lost. France could have a scorpion in its palm as long as it wanted it there. It didn't want it there very long.Knowing yourself, you will read this book or you won't. I found the human and intellectual struggle between these two giants fascinating and relevant. But there are a lot of knots to be untied in this narrative, and I can easily foresee that many readers would decide not to bother untying them....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Mar 2016,"Nov 23, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15687.Camus_and_Sartre

The fundamental crunch point, of course, is the role of religion in the rule of man--the inability of religiously inspired rulers to yield or compromise, the inability of secular rulers to understand the benefits of religious rule, and the lack of intellectual effort that underpins the communication gap between the two sides.Abd el-Kader was a prodigy of scholarship, so his biography betrays no lack of intellectual effort, either as a leader of his people, or in dialogue with his French adversaries. His problem, however, was the spotty contact he was able to make with French soldiers and politicians able to comprehend, translate, and deal with his socio-religious requirements. Whereas his perspective was theological and tribal, the French perspective was imperial and commercial. France wanted to ingest and exploit Algeria. Abd el-Kader didn't think France had a right to seize and destroy a land given to his people by God. That's a fairly fundamental difference, and it accounts for the fifteen year hit-and-run, slaughter or be slaughtered struggle between Abd el-Kader's Bedouin constituency and a series of French generals and armies.As we read Kiser's book, we are in a familiar zone--the zone of jihad--but not a zone of aggressive terror so much as defensive assault, and not a zone of Muslims condemning Europeans but rather of Europeans condemning, aka civilizing, Muslims.The broader backdrop to this tale, expertly etched in throughout the narrative, includes European pretensions to controlling pieces of the decaying Ottoman empire, a process that began in the mid 19th century and continues to this day, but the sharpest focus is on the chivalrous Abd el-Kader, and for me, the intriguing question of a personality emerging out of religious practice, a somewhat impersonal ""self"" defined not as Westerners define self (an amalgamation of developmental and hereditary factors) but rather as an interpretation of religious strictures hammered into shape by overarching events and daily devotional requirements. For all the time Kiser devotes to Abd el-Kadar, he does not generate a portrait that ""familiarizes"" this figure, i.e., makes him ""one of us."" To me, that's a plus--an honest degree of respect for the hard-edged differences not only between those times and these, but also between personalities shaped by the collective ethos of religion and personalities shaped by the individual ethos of secularism....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3390820-commander-of-the-faithful

It's a splendid book because it is so learned, well-written, and insightful, presenting fiction (that's Prose's literary focus) in its component guises of words, sentences, paragraphs, narrative strategies, and telling details.Francine Prose emphasizes close reading to best appreciate literary effects. She's not a member of a critical school; that never made sense to her. What made sense, from early on, was pondering James Joyce's diction, the rhythms of Tim O'Brien's incantatory sentences, the cunning of Isaac Babel's paragraphs, and the mastery of Chekhov's revealing details. In all cases, and many more (she cites Tolstoy, Cheever, Richard Yates, Henry Green, Kafka, Juan Rulfo, etc.) Prose illustrates her points with excerpts that go on as long as necessary. There are instances of such excerpts lasting a page or even two pages.Yet this isn't a textbook; it's more a summary of discussions, observations, and debates that have gone on in writing workshops and literary seminars she's conducted at colleges and universities across the US for decades.Prose excels in offering potential ""rules"" for writing vivid, compelling fiction, and then debunking those rules. Her penultimate chapter, focused on Chekhov, is a study in what might be called ""the exceptionalism of genius."" I found Prose's defense of the sufficiency of fiction unto itself--not needing excessive theoretical interpretation--effortlessly compelling. Without belaboring the point, she frequently adverts to the ways in which fiction points in directions beyond reason and fact toward paradoxically convincing uncertainties. Fiction is best when it's definite and concrete, yet it is never a math problem with a rules-based answer to the calculations it provokes.The final chapter focuses on how hard it has been for writers like Flaubert, Babel, and others to fulfill their sense of inspiration. Prose makes good use of their letters and diary entries to substantiate the utter uncertainty of a given story or novel, word by word, sentence by sentence.This book will make better readers of writers, and better writers of fiction. It's written with humility and humor. A lot of fun.As a bonus, there is a list at the very end of the book suggesting titles that must be read immediately...as if your life depended on it.

Each essay, on topics as diverse as washing hands to minimize infections in hospitals and doctors participating in executions, is a marvel of case study and comparative assessment, shifting back and forth between the particular and the general. The simplicity and directness of Gawande's prose mirrors his mode of thought: always looking for the basic truth, the underlying commonality between disparate conditions, the fundamental practice, or virtue, that can cause medical science (or, the practice of medicine) to generate ""better"" results.In many ways, the thesis of ""Better"" is that great improvements are often the result not through breakthrough discoveries or ""new paradigms"" but rather of minimizing error through tracking results, comparing them, and altering techniques.The hand washing essay focuses on the nuisance factor, reduced in some hospitals by the use of easy to use gels. The essay on cystic fibrosis focuses on the improvements possible through diligently pushing patients' minds and bodies to accept ever-more-demanding but relatively simple treatments.Gawande's insights into medical history (indeed, his mastery of ancient anecdotes) is enlivened by his observations of practices he sees on a day-to-day basis. He's great at finding just the right specialist to interview, or at getting a nurse or doctor to admit that he/she moonlights in prisons, monitoring lethal injections.A fundamental principle Gawande honors is ""openness"" in admitting the limitations inherent in the practice of medicine. It's important for doctors, and patients, to understand this principle in order to be realistic, focused, and determined to do better.Gawande's previous collection of essays, Complications, is less thematic and places more emphasis on fascinating medical detective work and biological conundrums.

Prior to the novel becoming grandfather-to-granddaughter, it had seemed to me that it was pointing towards a chaotic reference between broader, more disturbing public realities occurring during the ""War on Terror"" or ""Bush Years,"" not toward a thematic union between the likes of said traumas and the personal travails of the book er's life. That's a counterpoint--the invented dream state and the shadowy reality we all know because we've lived it-I would have liked to see Auster stick with.

It's a very fine collection, written with strength, insight,and humor..Thematically, of course, this is a very old trope: it's culture shock, it's 'India is older and wiser than we are,' it's the freedom to descend into one's one primitive nature, unobserved by friends and relatives. But Theroux applies this trope expertly. Each novella moves at the pace of a longer work,slowly, sometimes to the point of repetition (India is clamorous, the dust is choking and fiery, the smells overwhelm, the native cunning undermines all foreign judgment) but achieving a full sense of the principal characters, if not always their Indian antagonists (or friends, in one case.)One amusing motif is the occasional reference to how different India seems to the visitor than it is portrayed in the many-layered, comforting, family portraits offered by Indian writers in vogue in ""the West"" today. Hard to know who is right, but having lived abroad in many countries, I would attribute this discrepancy to the hard shell of culture seldom penetrated by the non-native...and to the self-love of the world's diverse peoples celebrating themselves in their art. The only place I've ever visited where the people consider their cuisine defective, for example, is Catalunya in Spain. ""We eat badly,"" one Barcelona journalist told me once. And a politician said that the paella for which Catalunya is well-known around the world is really a dreadful mishmash that shouldn't be served in decent restaurants. Otherwise, people will tell you that their questionable food, miserable weather, and peculiar family customs (dinner together every Sunday for decades, to be released only by death) are just wonderful...the best. And so we receive the account Indian writers give of themselves: a Merchant-Ivory version of a reality that clearly fascinates Theroux, but with reservations.I first read Theroux when I lived in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1980. Sometimes being right about a situation (he was appalled by Guayaquil for good reason) is enough to turn a reader (me) against you. He described perfectly the rotted hell of the place, to which I added a few miserable details: the frigate birds wheeling menacingly over the Guaymas river, the iguanas scuttling in the patches of scruffy garden along the Malecon (Guayaquil's dismal promenade). After that, I didn't want to read Theroux much. Brought up bad memories.Now I'm glad he has a mellower view of India than of Ecuador (probably deserved, but I have never been to India, so I don't know) and that I picked up this new volume of novellas.

It's written with skill and honesty, a great part of its success. Whereas the title highlights the ""the redemptive power of music,"" the text itself makes clear that no one is fully redeemed and the degree to which anyone achieves progress--emotionally, in life skills and survival--depends on human kindness, patience, tenacity, and a refusal to accept the painful contradiction in our society that it is all right for some people to ""make it"" and others not.Nathaniel, the street musician, naturally is the key figure in the text but only slightly more so than the narrator, Steve Lopez, who at fifty-something is wondering how much he has left in his tank for writing newspaper columns that ding incompetent government agencies and general American complacency with the status quo. Lopez knows he is no angel, and he knows the same about Nathaniel, which is what makes this book real. In part because the story occurs in L.A., it reminds me a bit of the movie ""Heat"" in which Al Pacino, a cop, becomes over-involved with his police work (chasing Robert DeNiro) at the expense of his marriage. Lopez has that kind of problem, needing understanding from a wife and young child who don't have that much to give him. The time he spends on Nathaniel clearly takes away from the time he spends at home, and yet he can't let go of Nathaniel, whose descent into mental illness is deep but not beyond connection.Several musicians and mental health care professionals help Lopez help Nathaniel move in off the street and recover some of his life-sustaining musical gifts. Lopez is generous, and accurate, in ensuring that the reader knows that no single individual, or even institution, is enough to get through to a man like Nathaniel after thirty years on the sidewalks, in subway tunnels, and in parks. More realism, in other words.What one wonders, on finishing a book like this, is how such volumes can be published without provoking a nationwide reassessment of our social safety-net.

He juxtaposes generational and cultural clashes, limned with a strong portrait of midwestern, anti-communist morality, in such a way as to portray--it seems to me--individuals melting under the weight of fear of the Korean War in the wake of World War II, rather than individuals well-grounded in what he terms ""indignation."" There is too much confusion and uncertainty for the people in this novella to be truly indignant, their values and views being compromised by less worthy forces. Rather, they seem hectored, afraid, thwarted, and belittled--and anxious that the future will bring them more of such abuse.The peculiar frame of a story being told by a Korean war casualty, dead at 19, doesn't work for me. It's neither fantastic enough, nor post-modern enough. It feels imposed by Roth editorially.Having written that, I still think Roth is one of the best sentence-for-sentence writers active today. There is a magisterial confrontation between Marcus, the protagonist, and his manipulative dean of students, that's a tour de force of strong prose and dialogue. And there's a protracted mother-son bargaining session, which the reader knows Marcus will betray as soon as he is able, that carries the same weight.Roth's skill in detailing the oddities of everyday life (in this case the life and times of a kosher butcher) remains impressive. I'm reminded of his tremendous work in American Pastoral, writing about glove-making. (And of Updike writing about typesetting). ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Oct 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3015764-indignation

Several reasons are adduced: authentic revulsion at the corrupt, disorderly, criminal way of life in Afghanistan after the communist collapse; rage at the ascension of non-Pashtun rulers; manipulation by foreign intelligence agencies (principally the Pakistani ISI.)The Pashtun variable is perhaps the one American readers must focus on most closely. Pashtuns are the largest and dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan and have ruled it for most of Afghanistan's existence (dating to the 18th century.After the communist's fall from power, Tadjiks and other northerners (non-Pashtuns) briefly assumed control of Kabul. This certainly galled Pashtuns in general and the Taliban in particular. In terms of Pakistan, non-Pashtun rule of Afghanistan also was a problem. Why? Because most Pashtuns live in Pakistan, not Afghanistan, Pakistan prefers rule of Afghanistan by Pashtuns.The current crisis takes shape are these facts: Karzai is a Pashtun who is surrounded by many ""northern"" ministers. In some Pashtun eyes, he is a sell-out. Hence, there is a diverse, neo-Taliban movement conducting operations to weaken his government and drive foreign forces out of the country, presumably leading to a reassertion of more ""genuine"" Pashtun rule.The ""foreign factor"" is a permanent element in Afghan national existence because Afghanistan is an extremely poor state that has served as a buffer, or shuttlecock, between great powers since the early 19th century. To rule the country, a king or president typically has counted on foreign patronage. Today's patronage is US/NATO. Earlier patronage was Soviet, and, of course, British.The political formula in play in Afghanistan right now (centralized power weakened by a symbolic Pashtun leader) seems destined to fail. A more federal approach is called for. Having fought for decades to survive, the northern Afghans (of Tadjik, Uzebek, and other ethnic affiliations) are in no mood to be ruled again by a strong central Pashtun-led government. But a weak central Pashutn-led government won't work in this country either. Hence, the attractiveness of the federal approach (although the Pashtun in Afghanistan, like the Sunni in Iraq, tend to think that is their right and calling to be in charge of a strong central government.)This collection of essays, like all such collections, is somewhat repetitive and uneven. It veers between grand academic discourse and rat-a-tat historical reporting. There is no central thesis, nor is there a strong recommendation or prediction for the future. In some ways the book admirably defers to the complexity of a complex country with a complex history--much more complex than reported in the US media or addressed by US/NATO leaders....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2008","Oct 25, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1628034.The_Taliban_and_the_Crisis_of_Afghanistan

We need to confront this kind of reporting, and reality. The author's hard and dangerous labor excavating this material is undermined, however, by two factors: first, she often recounts horrific injuries and deaths without pausing to appraise the meaning of those sacrifices for the individual in question, the family, etc. In one case two soldiers were incinerated in a Bradley fighting vehicle; their remains, we are told, had to be scraped out of it. But then the story moves on, pursuing the dominant theme, which in itself is an unsettling factor, i.e., General Petraeus somehow understood that we needed to go through this to achieve our end; General Petraeus is an epic individual cast in the mold of our greatest general-leaders... So the book is a bit of a hagiography in which a celebrity figure is praised and lesser folk--although their demise is graphically reported--are sacrificed.I think there are times, and this is one of them, when the United States needs to consider how gruesome its national security policy looks on the naked page....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 25, 2008","Oct 23, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3288038-tell-me-how-this-ends

It makes a strong case for recognizing two things: 1) there isn't enough oil in the Persian Gulf to meet projected U.S. energy needs during the first half of the 21st century; 2) the United States has developed and projected massive military might into the Persian Gulf/Middle East as a result of its thirst for oil. Both points suggest that the time has come to rethink our national energy policy and its linkage to national security strategy.

So this book is fascinating reading, even if it was first published around 1990. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about it, however, is the degree to which British military adventures, and disasters, in Afghanistan parallel NATO/US military actions at the moment. Fragmented, but united in xenophobia, the multiple peoples of Afghanistan don't comply with the wishes of foreign forces. Political solutions to conflict seem to be the only path to temporary peace, but this requires tact, patience, and the recognition that Afghans are likely to rebalance their power structures to their own liking soon after intruders depart.One more point: The Great Game accepts, to a certain degree, the romanticism and exoticism inherent in the British (and Russian) imperial outlook. This means that it celebrates British and Russian plotting and exploring, in defense of their respective commercial interests, with scant attention paid to indigenous perspectives.
