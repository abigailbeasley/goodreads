I'm a little nervous, being an avid fan of The Raw Shark Texts. The thing that disappointed me a little was, when I picked it up, it's short.... with wide margins.... and large type.... BOO. Hall worked on this for how long?.... (...Insert Witcher grumble here...) BUT.....I loved The Raw Shark Texts. It's one of the top ten novels of all time in my estimation. So I am not going to do more than utter a second mild Witcher grumble and open the book.Pg. 80. Oh boy.... it may well be as I feared. When it takes a writer 14 years to bring a book to the market, that's almost always a very bad sign....The premise is good. I like the idea so far... But the idea would take up 5 to 10 pages... Maybe... The rest of the text is what?... Science paraphrase? Dreary is what it is. So far this book is 5% interesting and fun, and 95% dreary. And what's with these typographical leaf footnotes?

Really?!.... This book is just a freaking mess as far as I can tell. What's it even about? I'm just slogging through it at this point, hoping the entropy will at least lead to a minimal level of narrative coherence. This book is aggressive in its manic fury to make no sense. Perhaps I'm missing the point. 14 years? Yikes man....There are no characters really. The people occupying the story just seem to exist merely to transmit some lithomancy ridden eschatological framework regarding the bible?... or something?... The story itself is not a narrative in the standard sense, in that connected sequences follow one another to build significance and meaning. Sequences follow one another, but they they don't seem to be connected. It all just comes off as a bewildering pile of disorganized nonsense.

As good as this type of story can get. But FUCK ME is this a relentlessly bleak fucking book!!!...... Grim does not begin to cover it. I do have a few problems. How the fuck did a handful of half-wits have the resources, the intelligence (both in terms of access to information and cognitive capacity), and the manpower to not only perform the most horrific act in the history of humanity, but to also simultaneously conduct surgical military ops across the entire solar system. So far, the Corey matrix has been nearly infallible in generating plausible authenticity. This is the first time in the series I've felt its lack. If this series teaches us one thing it's that Humanity will eventually destroy itself and whatever else it can take with it, and more tragically, it will ultimately be accomplished by half-wits. Dullards too dense to see past hate and resentment.It's a great book. The Corey organism deserves more recognition than I think it's received. But goddammit it's a bit wearisome to plunge forward through a rolling series of increasingly atrocious calamities.Update after finishing:They subtly addressed how the half-wits accomplished miraculous feats. It seems the next book will be more forthcoming regarding the nascence of the grand conflagration. But in the end, another jaw dropping wonder of a book. Just amazing on every freaking level. When larger narratives inevitably split up the band to give them some solo adventures, these are often the bits in the story people find the least captivating. No to here. Even the most superfluous of the adventures, that of Mongo and Peaches, which had little to no impact on the larger narrative of even this book, was a page turning joy to read.

This is the 5th or 6th book I've read that was just demonstrably, objectively, not a good book. Firstly, I've read this story at least 100 times. It's hopelessly derivative of all the standard fantasy fictional tropes; second, the characters are nearly completely flat, third, the dialogue is ridiculous, and lastly, the plots are juvenile. This book is not terrible, but it's not good either. It's just not. And if you think it is a good book, I do not think your wrong necessarily, you are just in a different relationship with books than I am. I could get into the actual content of the story (the drug oriented magical system is very off putting given our Opioid problems) but there's little point in that. The book fails in larger fundamentals long before it gets to the content. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I feel like I'm out of step with the Science Fiction/Fantasy community. This book was glorified in the  ecosystem with high praise. I don't understand that. Compare this book to something like N. K. Jemisin's ""The Fifth Season"" or Corey's ""Leviathan Wakes"" or Dan Simmons' ""Carrion Comfort"", you will readily see the point I'm making. I guess it's really on me. I'm picking up these books, Leigh Bardugo's ""The Ninth Gate"", Kingfisher's ""The Hollow Places"", Michaelides' ""The Silent Patient"", M. L. Rios's ""When We Were Villians"", and thinking they are books for mature readers. They are not. Mature readers will have seen a good deal of what these books have to offer again and again, and will not be moved by the varying artifices as constructed. For these long years I have made the habit of picking books up off the shelves at random based on nothing but the whim of the moment, and for many years was richly rewarded for doing so.

This is all fine and good if the story is strong enough to override the clichés. So far, this one is not. The back of the book has a statement: ""Charles Dickens meets Joss Whedon in Miro's otherworldly Netflix-binge-like novel."" Credited to the Washington Post, not to the journalist who penned it. I agree with that notion in part. The Whedon bit is obvious. As is the Dickens, but not in the way the er or the author would have us think. Whedon is undoubtedly a fine writer, however he is given to his own peculiar set of narrative patterns. Who knows if he would ever have grown beyond them, given his career has imploded, exploded, polyploded into little Whedon bits. I guess the guy was a massive gonad. It's a shame that people who are so good at things can be such ramrods. This story is at best derivative of Whedon's patterns, and at worst a blatant pattern snatch. You could be fooled into thinking Miro was a Nome de Plume of Whedon, but the dialogue is not nearly good enough. Nor are the characters. There is no charm here unfortunately. And Whedon could layer on the charm like spackle. As far as the Dickens bit goes, it is largely the same. Dickensian patterns have been aped to achieve a narrative end, but the strength and maturity of Dickens is not here. This is how Whedon and Dickens would write if they both had suffered lead poisoning as children. I was, as I very often am, attracted to this novel by the title, the graphic design, and the heft of it. Not the finest well honed criteria for choosing novels, but it has worked wildly well for me in general. I could list a great many books chosen under these circumstances that now hold permanent residency in my soul. The premise of super powered children and the academy/institute that seeks them out is relentlessly cliched and boring at this point. The Umbrella Academy and The Checquy Files represent all that ever needs to be said on this subject.

I’m forced to downgrade the rating from 4 to 3 because I DID NOT like the gimmick reading order. As an idea I think it’s interesting: That you can read a book in an alternate pagination and get a different story. But that really didn’t happen here. All Landragin did was alternate between chapters in the three sections. If that’s the order you want the story told in, then tell it that way. The only reason an author would want to pull a stunt like this is if there is genuine reward to the reader for reading the text both ways. There is not. So respect given for the idea, derision heaped for blowing the execution. The story itself is good-ish. I thought it was very disjointed and more difficult to follow than necessary at times, but that could be laid at my feet as a reader. At the end, I did feel a few dangling plot elements pretty keenly. Who was the Baroness? Who killed her? (I mean, we know it was Joubert, but what were the circumstances, who is Joubert now, and where is Madeleine? Why hasn’t she been able to stop Joubert?) Why was the Baroness having the manuscript rebound? Where did she get it? All the elements of the present that were only hinted at in the preface really should have been explored. Maybe these questions were addressed at some point and I failed to catch them, but I would have liked to see this book greatly expanded, where the manuscript plot represents the first part, and the circumstances of the present are dealt with in the second. This could have been a sincerely compelling history/world/culture encompassing epic story. But we get this tiny piece of it in a gimmicky structure that brings nothing of interest to the table. This is a swing and a miss for me. Too bad....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 25, 2021","Nov 26, 2021","Nov 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56268818-crossings

The book should rightly be tiReading through Stone's odd little book, you develop the conviction quite rapidly that Stone does not care for Socrates. The book should rightly be titled ""The Execution of Socrates: Why Athens Killed the Miserable Lying Bastard."" Just looking at the titles of Stone's chapters reveals his contempt: ""A Wild Goose Chase: The Socratic Search for Absolute Definitions,"" ""The Prejudices of Socrates,"" and my favorite ""Why Did They wait Until He was Seventy?"" The book comes off initially as an impartial attempt to compose an apology for the Athenian point of view with regard to the persona of Socrates and his trial. In his preface, Stone evokes the desire to explore the motivations and positioning of Socrates' accusers. He tries to maintain this bearing for a while, but very quickly gives all that up and attacks both Socrates and Plato point blank. For example:""Protagoras was only the most prominent victim of Socrates' genius for confusing his interlocuters and the issues. He (and Plato) often do this by gross oversimplification and the search for absolute abstractions where there are only complex realities.""My experience with Socrates has been VERY different from that of Stone, and am I grateful for that. I don't think Stone understood a single word he read with regard to Socrates or the Athenian context he so diligently struggles to place Socrates within. His analyses of the dialogues are fatuous and his interpretation of Aristophanes laughable. Stone is the worst kind of writer in my opinion. He used his credibility as a journalist to write authoritatively about a subject that I strongly feel he had a catastrophically tenuous grasp on. I do believe he read the works, and I do believe he performed his scholarly due diligence with cross referencing the source texts in translation, and in mastering enough Greek to translate particularly dicey passages himself when he found it necessary. The problem I have is I've done the same, and I came away with an absolutely different understanding of practically everything Stone discusses in this book. His view of the Sophists, his assertions regarding what Socrates did or did not believe, his reading of Aristophanes, his interpretations of Plato, nearly all of it I call into question. I cannot accurately describe the impact that Socrates and Plato have had on my life as a scholar and as a human being. In the Euthyphro and the Gorgias there are passages which have been critical in shaping how I see myself as a person, as a thinker, as a member of society. Socrates taught me more about why it is important to live a just life than any other single source. And therein lay my ultimate problem with Stone. If this text is the only encounter an individual has with Socrates, then they will come away with a hopelessly impoverished understanding of how important his ideas are. By all means, read this book. I think it does have some interesting things to say about contemporaneous Athens, some of which I also dispute but am not really in a position to criticize all that knowledgeably, but do not let this text stand as your only exposure to Socrates and Plato. Don't let Stone kill the poor guy a second time....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51330.The_Trial_of_Socrates

Although, this could be said to be the authorial equivalent of getting class credit for merely showing up to school. Another aspect of the book that Auerbach deserves credit for is the undoubted success of his self-publishing the manuscript. Every day an enormity of texts are thrown into the maelstrom of the dubious “Print-on-Demand” industry, never to be seen again. So in more than one way, Auerbach deserves praise for this book’s existence and subsequent success. The downside of the situation is that it is not a very good book. If anything, it stands as a testament to the vetting process inherent in the mainstream fiction publication process. This text would not (and clearly did not) make it to press as written if it were submitted to a mainstream publishing house. It is badly in need of editing and revision, both in terms of content and structure. I think this is a fine first draft. As a finished work it left me cold. I found the sequence of events very incoherent, even in the face of the narrator’s self-professed lack of exacting recall; I thought the characters were quite flat and lacked any sort of life beyond a very basic outline; the motivations of “The Man” were totally incomprehensible to me. I felt no compelling reason to believe this person would embark upon a campaign of terror towards a child out of some sense of misguided love; I didn't understand why Josh was abruptly replaced as the man’s obsessive focus, I didn’t understand what happened at the end with the burial. A great deal of this book needed help. I would certainly encourage Auerbach to continue writing, but to find a mentor to assist in bringing his vision to a more successful completion....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Apr 2017,"Apr 02, 2017","Apr 01, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17369352-penpal

I still continue to read King's work and I probably won't stop, but I sure wish he'd take his time and write for quality instead of volume. He is a great writer, but he pollutes his body of work with the dreck he produces in 2 out of every 3 books.

I remove one star for the reason that the story came across as somewhat forced. The Maze Runner was quite singular in its conception and execution. This book did not feel as coherent. Although that does not mean it wasn't enjoyable. As I move through the series I can't help but wonder why it's called The Maze Runner series, as maze running only pertains to the initial book. It should have been called The Killzone Chronicles or something.

I don't know. Maybe I am. I found this novel to be incredibly enjoyable. I don't often read books in one sitting anymore.

I felt it had enough originality to easily stand on it's own merit.

With the publication of a single volume, Kohske is now easily one of my favorite comic artists. If you happen to see the book on the shelves, pick it up and examine the art on the front and back covers. The two images represent a single scene, depicting the two primary characters, viewed from a north perspective (the front) and a south perspective (the back). Nicolas looks at the reader on the front cover, Worick on the back. They're a sincerely compelling set of images viewed solely from a visual standpoint, but the sub-text of the arrangement is also of interest. Nico and Worick are often looking at the same thing, but, for differing reasons, from two widely divergent points of view. Regardless of these differences, they manage to remain on the same page, so to speak. This type of intelligent, visually arresting sophistication saturates the entirety of the text. Kohske is a master of the form in so many ways. The distinctive manner in which she can effectively illustrate both the masculine and the feminine is amazing. Just look at the cover again to see how unique and forceful she is at visualizing the male principle as it is contextualized in the ""Gansta"" universe. Without even reading a word you can clearly see the masculine nature of Nicolas' character: confident, modern, stylish, dangerous. Study any image of Alex to see the same level of intensity with the female essence: vulnerable, determined, resilient, capable. I'm always amazed, as an amateur comic artist, of the ability to consistently depict a set of unique visual characteristics throughout the course of a graphic narrative sequence. Kohske is wonderful at this. Kohske's page layouts are also unforgettable. Pick any page at random and you'd be able to use it as a visual aide in a comics course on innovation in panel design. I don't know how Kohske has emerged as a full blown master with the appearance of her first work, but I'm certainly glad she did. I cannot wait for the second volume to emerge in the US....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 19, 2014","Apr 19, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17706570-gangsta-1

I love tFirst Impression:The whole notion that people write in the margins of books in order to communicate with other readers really makes me happy. I love to write and draw in the margins of books, and (not so secretly) I hope others will come along someday and read them. Books are meant to be read, obsessed over, re-read, and obsessed over again. This seems so rare today. Abrams and Dorst (who?!) have created something very special here in giving us a glimpse into the reading lives of others. Lives which are too often insular and obscure. It seems to me these inner lives were meant to be shared, talked about, revisited, and even documented. Books live and breathe; Abrams and Dorst (who!?) show us how communal a book's life can (and should) be.Second Impressions:So, I'm still generally enjoying the experience of traveling through this text with S., Jen, and Eric, but I have to say I'm getting a little weary of the paucity of revelation. At page 149 I still have no idea at all what is going on. And the artifacts are making less and less sense, and are often not even mentioned in the text, whereas documents that are mentioned are not included. And I still (despite intense efforts) have NO IDEA AT ALL how to utilize the ""Eötvös Wheel"" or have any clue as to what text to apply its arcane decoding capabilities. I hate to admit it, but I'm getting that nagging sensation at the back of my brain to move on to other books I have waiting to be perused: I've got Eugenides' 'The Marriage Plot', Kean's 'The Violinist's Thumb', Stephenson's 'Reamde', and my once every three years or so re-reading of 'The Silmarillion' and 'The Lord of the Rings' is calling mightily to me. I've committed to finishing the book, but it always bums me out when I lose the passion for a story midway through.I just need a few answers. Hopefully they begin coming soon. Final Thoughts:What a amazing book. I lost it for a little while, but that was not the book's fault. This book is strong on so many levels: theoretically, culturally, literarily. I don't think I've ever read a book that functioned so totally, so effectively, on a symbolic level. A few observations:1. The symbolism of human exploitation and oppression as represented by the highly flammable Black Wine.This conception deserves some analysis. The idea that every brutality, oppressive act, or injustice directed at the powerless, and willfully committed by the powerful, results in a black intoxicant that the powerful gorge themselves on at parties is so bitingly clever. The fact that it blackens the tongue is awesome. You have to read Dorst's passages which concern the substance to really appreciate what he's done. 2. Ships of Theseus/ Ships of TheoiThe ship of theseus paradox exemplifies the human need for the illusion of continuity. Is a structure that is replaced/rebuilt piece by piece the same structure? Obviously no, but the human need to apply continuity says yes. What Dorst (and to a deeper extent, Abrams) has done here is to give us an extension of that concept that I'm calling 'Ship of Theoi'. A ship of theoi (""theoi""is GK for ""gods"") is brought into being when there's no original structure, but continuity is applied as if there always has been. We do this all the time. With respect to religion, we create gods out of nothing to explain the existence of the universe and our place in it. This fundamental process bleeds into other areas of our lives, especially as we become less religious as a society. The process is especially rampant in the realm of popular culture, wherein we create structures out of nothing, give forms to formlessness, which then go on to garner a nearly divine level devotion from the public. Take your pick of examples. They're everywhere. These concepts, 'ship of theseus' and 'ship of theoi', work themselves out in a variety of compelling ways in the text. As you read through, you can begin to see them applying and reapplying. Certain conclusions begin to form as you draw toward the end:Even if we work directly against the tendency for continuity and try to replace the original structure, the silhouette of the original remains influential.If history is a ship of theseus, which is constantly being torn down, rebuilt, rewritten, but is still considered stable and coherent, then why be concerned when it is destroyed?When a structure does not actually exist, it is comforting for us to believe it might or even does.If there is nothing durable in a structure, there is no reason for us to value anything. What happens when the old structure cannot be replaced or repaired, as with S. and his total amnesia (and by proxy with Straka himself)? Straka's solution was, as opposed to creating a ship of theoi, to wink out of existence. S. opts for the ship of theoi. He becomes a member of S. The book strives to tell us about authenticity. We are all ships of theseus, or worse, ships of theoi. We all are desperate to see structure where there is none. I'll be thinking about these ideas for quite some time, but in the end I don't think the theoretical aspects of the novel are the most important. The concluding scene wherein S. gives a certain individual a dose of Truth serum takes that honor. I won't go into detail, I'll just encourage you to read through the text until you get to that point, and I'll close with a quote that reveals how great a writer Dorst is:""There is no greater sin than acquiescence to the limits that power imposes on the individual.""Textually, the ""power"" referred to in the book is the financial/military/industrial complex.Sub-textually, that power can just as well be the ""limits"" we place over ourselves. What illusions have power over our lives that we ultimately choose? Consumerism? Nationalism? Materialism? ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Dec 2013,"Feb 23, 2014","Dec 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17860739-s
