The characters aren’t just characters but humans; the setting isn’t just a setting but a home.

NOT so with Never Let Me Go, which is funny, since at first, I thought the book started out slow, and it only grew on me as I read on. But now I think that just goes to show how brilliantly its secrets and science fiction elements are subtly weaved in. There is so much examined here—ethically, emotionally—so much that is raised and ripped, and really it’s useless for me to try to set it down because I will never describe it as profoundly as Never Let Me Go does. I will say, though, that the imprint of all of these ideas makes a book that is haunting and devastating, that had me not only crying but genuinely writhing on my couch at the fact that by the end, despite the name of the title, everything the characters have they must let go of.

They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them—words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they’re brought out. But it’s more than that, isn’t it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you’ve said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That’s the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 08, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11574.The_Body

Chernow was able to paint a picture not only of the almost-improbable life of Alexander Hamilton but of the whole of 18th-century America. he covers much more than just Hamilton’s participation in certain affairs; he further explains what these things meant in early-American society and how they shaped the future of the country. but to me, the biggest genius of this book lies in the fact that Chernow gave such a story-telling flair to the life of Hamilton. he turned events that might otherwise be thought boring and made them as entertaining as the events of a novel. his portraits of the Founding Fathers are so in depth, and they are humanized in a way i have rarely seen before. Chernow takes these far-away, “God-like” men and turns them into real, true people with flaws and worries and passions. Chernow also definitely changed my opinion on some of the Founding Fathers (ahem… Thomas Jefferson…)however, with all this in mind, i would also warn that this book is definitely hefty; it took me two and a half months to finish it. everyone’s reading pace differs, but i think you should be prepared to expend a lot of time into the experience of this book—not because it’s dull and difficult to get through but because there is just such a depth of information and insight. however, if you are a fan of Alexander Hamilton and American history (like i am), i’m sure all of this information will be very interesting to you. all in all, i think this is a very powerful and moving book—just as inspirational as the Hamilton play—which taught me SO much about the founding of the United States and the people who played a role in it. any Hamilton fan, or really anyone interested in that time period, would thoroughly enjoy this book. and yes, i tried not to make Hamilton play references throughout this . it was hard. and to finish with this quote from the introduction of the book:“Today, we are indisputably the heirs to Hamilton’s America, and to repudiate his legacy is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton
