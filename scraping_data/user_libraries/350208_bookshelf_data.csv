I'm not a Socialist but was nevertheless intrigued by the subtitle: The Case for Radical PoliticsI picked up this book at the Brooklyn Book Festival. I'm not a Socialist but was nevertheless intrigued by the subtitle: The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequality.Surprisingly, most of the book was history - and Sunkara delivered a very well-researched and engaging account of 19th and 20th century radical politics in Europe and beyond.I found myself excited to read about (what I'd considered to be dry, esoteric) conflicts between craft and factory workers, between paycheck-oriented trade unionists and theory-based party thinkers, between Stalinists and Trotskyites, between in-the-room accommodators and out-of-the-room militants.But what makes the book a clear-headed history also makes it a depressing Manifesto. He seems to devote more time to the in-fighting, the electoral defeats, and the authoritarian metastasis (see haunting chapter on Mao) than to what the future looks like for the radical Left.I kept storing up these big questions about, say, the viability of factory-floor Marxism in America's increasingly online and/or service-based economy. But I had to wait until pg. 224 - in Point 8 of his quick-hitter 15-Point road map - to get any sense of how Socialism can overcome this kind of fragmentation.I had similar questions about the strength of national labor laws in a world of fast-flight capital.
