We're lucky to have him and it'll be a sad day for fiction when he's gone.All the Wolfe hallmarks are here, and we have a really sympathetic hero in Nestor. Of course, since this is social satire, Nestor has his vanities and weaknesses, but I cared more about him than I have about, well, just about every character current modern literary fiction writers have created all lumped together.The idea that since Wolfe is in his 80s, he can't do youth culture or ethnic culture or anything else he sets his mind and notebook to is absolute nonsense. He nails stuff time and again, stuff I am familiar with and would know if he hadn't looked into it. The man meticulously does his homework and gets it right in both substance and tone.It's a sprawling, wonderful social satire and novel of manners. If ONLY anybody else were around to take Wolfe's place. Alas, no. The 21st century will be a dark place without him once he's done.But if this is it for Tom Wolfe, what a fantastic way to go out!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 14, 2013","Aug 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13480192-back-to-blood

Of course, this wasn't Miller's purpose with the book, but I got at least a taste of that. As far as Hubbard is concerned, probably the less said the better. There are some good laughs in the book at Hubbard's utter meglomania, but it is hard not to finish it feeling sad for him and his family. Hubbard's great con job was upon himself....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 06, 2012","Apr 10, 2012","Apr 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/962611.Bare_Faced_Messiah

Asimov's deepseated prejudices against anyone who had a slightly different sort of intelligence than he did, anyone who isn't, in fact, Isaac Asimov, becomes extremely grating. His assumptions about whole groups of people, especially Americans not from the East Coast, are often ludicrous. But these are quibbles. There is lots and lots of interesting information within, lots of mid 20th century science fiction history. Furthermore, Asimov's endless totting up of check amounts for short story sales becomes a kind of soothing mantra after a few hundred pages, especially since we all know the amounts were going to grow and disaster did not lie ahead. In fact, the genesis of stories and the circumstances surrounding their creation is often more interesting than a mediocre biographer's interpretation of his subject's work, and Asimov piles on such details. It's a good autobiography; he just needed a real editor....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 30, 2012","Apr 05, 2012","Mar 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/85519.In_Memory_Yet_Green

This is the Clark who came up with the idea of geosynchronous communications satellites (which he lived to see, of course). Much of interest. Clark spent a great deal of his life living in Sri Lanka. Clark was practically a professional scuba diver, and was coowner, and very active partner, of an underwater recovery business for quite a while. Final couple of chapters are deadly dull. They consist of literally one description after another of trips to give speeches and receive awards. Clark's naive, unexamined, ultimately insipid one worldism, which was usually the subject of his speeches and non science fiction appearances, is presented at length and as writ from on high by McAleer, who otherwise show excellent taste in quote selection. His disagreement with Heinlein over the Strategic Defense Initiative (Heinlein was correct) is presented as something completely out of the blue, but actually becomes an illustration of Clark's disengagement from reality and his surrender of what had been his stubbornly independent mind to the reigning internationalist zeitgeist of those days. But these are distractions from an otherwise good job by McAleer.

Much material on RAH's second wife Leslyn that was heartbreaking but also fascinating. She really was extremely important to his development as a writer, a true partner for many years before the divorce. A few weaknesses in Patterson's narrative. Patterson seems about as California nutty as the Heinleins at times with the mind power movement and such. Could have stood a bit of critical objectivity there to grasp what was going on at the time in the coalescing culture of Hollywood era Los Angeles that people could buy such things. Also, could have used summaries of the stories and novels, even though Patterson was obviously avoiding literary crititicism. Some odd emphases, as well. A great deal of time setting up lefty California politics of the 1930s and not much time explaining what a sale to the Saturday Evening Post really meant. The Annapolis material was just great, really painted a picture of the young Heinlein's life, hopes and dreams.

These are portraits of Chinese citizens told via interviews Liao has conducted and transcribed (and perhaps embellished a bit). Liao has a theme, which is that people in a crazy totalitarian system must become a little crazy themselves if they are to survive, but it is gently worked in, and mostly he revels in the odd, sweet, troubled, weird lives he presents. Liao keeps a very nice middle distance between himself and the subjects, and this sincere but not naive tone reminds me a lot of Kundera's in ""The Joke,""or The Unbearable Lightness of Being, or perhaps Hasek in Good Solider Schweik. I don't know and don't care if any of these people are real, although I suspect they mostly are fair portraits. Liao brings them to life and shows us a China few of us in the west have any idea exists. The inhumanity of the Chinese political system both in past and today he deals with by not being concerned about making the point at all. The interviews let drop details of almost unimaginable pogroms, suffering, humiliations, and horror (try cannibalism of young girls by their own families during the 1960 famine) brought about by the government, but nobody dwells on such matters, since it it their own particular and singular lives they are concerned with talking about. And what strange, sometimes insane, sometimes wonderful, lives they are. Most of all, Liao strikes the perfect tragicomic tone and has produced a book that borders on being a masterpiece. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 29, 2012","Feb 09, 2012","Jan 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2880708-the-corpse-walker

Whether Liu is talking about democracy or the latest trends in Chinese fiction, the thought is clear, insightful, and sympathetic. This is the kind of book you ought to have laying around the house to dip into occasionally, like the Bible or Walden. Liu’s Charter 08 is one of the best statement of democratic principles of government I have ever read. It’s almost flawless, and Liu could be channeling Thomas Jefferson both in content and stylistic ability. Liu's poems to his wife are equally engaging on a human level, and contain some stark and terrible images to illustrate his feelings of separation from her while he was imprisoned. I read this in translation, of course, but I can only imagine how beautiful and clear the Chinese must be to have produced such an excellent English version. Liu is currently serving an eleven year sentence in a Chinese prison as a political prisoner. He was three times previously imprisoned or detained for lengthy periods.

Blair is very good at constructing enough of an open and honest persona that you're willing to suspend your disbelief and allow that he's at least attempting to give you the straight story, at least by his own lights. You know you're being spun, but it's kind of enjoyable to watch how a master does it, even if you are the mark. He's also quite good at giving the reader glimpses of what he wants you to believe he REALLY thinks about particular personalities. Gordon Brown does not fare well. Bush he clearly likes as a person, Clinton he clearly adores. Cheney he at least attempts to understand (but gets it wrong). It's all very deft -- like listening to a long, but really pretty good, political speech by somebody who knows how to deliver one. And what I think Blair absolutely accomplishes as a writer in a nicely artless way is to paint a portrait of the one of those people who are always ""the smartest guy in the room"" -- and the frustrations and triumphs of being that guy most of the time whether you want to be or not. If only Gordon Brown had seen the political necessity and essential rightness of New Labour positions. If only Obama had turned out to be a Clinton-like DLC Democrat instead of some mini-FDR wannabe...Sigh.It probably also doesn't hurt that I essentially agree with Blair's political instincts, even if I think some of his particular choices are daft (global warming, E.U. membership at all costs and offering idiotic and unnecessary British concessions) and sometimes his essential misunderstanding of the foundations of his position are hilarious.

In this story, several characters are magically transported to their own near future to witness the enormous (think landscape-sized) dragon Griaule, allegedly dead, and under whose hulking sides and upon whose back entire villages are built, momentarily come back to life.The story’s viewpoint character is George Taborin, a collector of dragon ephemera (who appears as a minor character and textual “source” in earlier tales in the series). Taborin and a prostitute acquaintance named Sylvia are transported to a low-lying plain where a jungle is regrowing over what they soon recognize as the Carbonales Valley, the site of the city Teocinte and the realm thought to be under Griaule’s previous influence. Apparently it is some time in the future, but within the bounds of this story, the plain becomes an existential landscape in which several human dramas are playing out. Taborin discovers others similarly transported. Griaule is keeping them all separated for several months, allowing each to proceed through a basic human moment of one sort or another in the process. Taborin rescues a little girl, Peony, from one of these groups. Peony has been horribly abused both physically and sexually, and Taborin, the battered girl and the prostitute Sylvia form a little semi-family where Peony is allowed to heal in a small manner. Eventually, they, and all on the plain, are herded back to an amphitheater to watch the ancient dragon Griaule’s final magical transformation unfold. Taborin finds, as he has suspected all along, that he himself has not escaped being part of Griaule's exercise in manipulation merely because he is aware of the dragon's propensities.Shepard’s dragon stories revolve around fate and free will. Characters again and again think they’re acting in either a noble, a self-sacrificing or self-serving, or a merely free manner, when in fact they’re actually serving the dragon’s purposes all along. The stories raise the disquieting notion that there’s an alternative to a universe of supernatural fate or blind atheistic determinism. It may be that fate exists, but is actually EVIL and has a positive will to use us, abuse us, toy with us, and destroy us. The Griaule stories are kind of an anti-Tolkien take on the world: an immense, emotional will that has no care for human desires and needs (other than a positive intent to use them to its purpose) shapes our reality and the very landscape in which we move. We can’t escape it because we’re part of it, a thought in its immense mind, whether we like this fact or not. In this world, Griaule’s mere whims are a far greater force than the most complex human plan for happiness or salvation, and humans always make themselves, whether consciously or inadvertently, into means toward the dragon’s ends.The beauty and subversion of the dragon stories is that Shepard always goes for the emotional experiences in which we WANT to surrender to fate, most notably love, and has Griaule twist these most basic human foundations for his dragonly purposes. Here, Taborin’s greatest desire is to have a family to care for, and Griaule gives him a parody of what he wants in the form of the blasted threesome of Taborin, the prostitute, and the battered little girl whom they both come to love. Shepard suggests that all families are just that: a gathering of weather-beaten souls brought together by genetics, chance, historic forces, or what-have-you and that humans, desperate for love and meaning, make themselves into families in order to survive a little longer in the harsh world and find at least some temporary individual meaning in love and self-sacrifice. These basic urges (we feel we are “fated” to fall in love with our “soul mate,” say, or that, whatever moral reasoning we may employ, we have an existential urge to rescue the young from the depredations of evil people) are ultimately revealed as the powerful tools the dragon uses to get us to work its will. It’s at these emotional touchpoints with fate that humans are at their most malleable, putty in the hands of fate – but without these emotions and desires, without love, hope, altruism, humans are nothing more than dust moving through a dusty world.But Shepard gives us a bit of dark hope in this morass of gloom. The dragon NEEDS us to think its thoughts and work its will. So while we can’t escape becoming means to an end, the harder we struggle to remain an end in ourselves, to make our individuality matter and mean something in the universe, the better tools we become for fate. It’s by resisting the urge to go along, by fighting against an inevitable smaller fate, that we most completely serve the larger purposes of the universe. Whether those purposes are good or ill, we can never know -- probably ill, Shepard suggests. But the dragon stories remind us that the purpose is there. We live in a teleological universe that perversely refuses to reveal what principle it serves, but makes liberal use of us toward its own ends, nonetheless.In “The Taborin Scale,” we get a glimpse of Griaule’s ultimate plan, or at least the method he is using to spread his influence. In a manner similar to Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"" (with which this story shares several thematic similarities), it’s an existential experiment for Griaule. The humans on the jungle plain serve as a sort of “test” group for the dragon to comprehend human drama under the most extreme and cut-off circumstances. We inevitably fall into family groups, some workable, some destructive. Taborin, who has had a loveless, childless marriage before, finally gets his greatest desire – a wife who sort of loves him and a child who is sort of his – and, in the end, he proves himself worthy of this love. This worthiness, Shepard suggests, may not mean squat in the larger universe – it probably doesn’t -- but it does mean something, and it has to be enough -- because these moments of doing the right thing in small ways, of showing and receiving the love of others, however mixed-up and tainted by self-interest and sexual desire, are the only meaning in life that we’re ever going to get....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 10, 2010","May 26, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7710587-the-taborin-scale

A detective links a vicious killer of women to his crimes while he, the detective, experiences a personal dissolution. This critically-highly-touted book has an aphoristic Japanese modernist prose format laid over a crime story. The format would be annoying, but all right and perhaps generative of a more elevated perception of human affairs were the story better. The tale is apparently historical. Who cares? You write a novel, you need to write a story. The book's not really a mystery or thriller, because the killer is caught early on. This becomes a huge structural weakness as the narrator then has very little to do but wander around Tokyo feeling bad about his cowardice, scratching his lice (I kept wanting to douse the dude with DDT), and attempting to tie up loose ends on a case that's already solved.

Cromwell is modern man in the making, the character most like us in the melange of 16th century characters. Some really fine writing up front, with a fascinating atemporal storyline, moving in and out of Cromwell's early history as crucial, life-changing moments. We're never lost, and it truly does feel like the emotional rather than chronological biography of a fascinating man. Some wonderful quips and great scenes full of constrained but deep feelings, particularly the feelings of enmity and malice. Mantel does hatred so nicely that it almost makes the reader want to go make some bitter enemies so he or she can have this much fun despising them and working their downfall! Much of the book is quietly hilarious, and really it's a comedy at heart. But alas, all eventually falls apart. The present tense works for a while, then becomes a liability later in the book. The ubiquitous use of the pronoun ""he"" without the antecedent ""Cromwell"" seems meaningless and perverse on Mantel's part from the get-go. It's a forgivable quirk while the book is moving along, but becomes a maddening device when the novel begins to slog. It's around page 300 where book falls into disarray. Mantel loses the relentless storyline she has been following to that point and Wolf Hall begins to feel like a collection of partially executed vignettes and static tableau for the next 232 pages.

Furst has a maddening way of choosing the most emotionally obscuring scenes to do his character work, with revelations handed out like bread in a concentration camp. He also obscures information that all the characters know perfectly well for no apparent dramatic purpose. It begins to feel almost perverse after a while. But Furst does give you excellent action scenes for relief. The plot is meandering and builds to no climax by design, but you quickly understand that that's the idea, and either go along with it or stop reading. After you choose to become involved, it's a bit like exploring a dark and dangerous city after midnight.

There's perhaps a bit too much conjecture and conclusion drawn on thin evidence on Shakespeare's alleged crypto-Catholicism. This seems to be a particular hobbyhorse of Ackroyd's, and the evidence is slim that it mattered that much to Shakespeare or that any Catholic underground culture shaped his life and work.

The book loses its way a bit with the big detour through the Glenn McCarthy story (which deserves its own book). The main problem with the book is Burrough's strident liberal political correctness. It's ""ultra-conservative"" this and ""ultra-conservative"" that over and over again. Burroughs can't fathom why any of these people, whom he otherwise admires, might not be political liberals, and he gives one ludicrous sociological explanation after another to account for it. The answer, of course, is that all of these folks were men and women of their times and were very much in the mainstream of their era. There is also the possibility that people like H.L Hunt, who were right about quite a few things where others were not, might possibly have been right about most of their political views, as well. That America MIGHT owe them a debt of gratitude. Burroughs thinks such an idea ludicrous. The men were political laughingstocks, he says over and over again. But if you can make it through the cloying apologies to his political masters (his editor and the ers, one supposes), the remainder of the book is a wonderful romp through a fascinating epoch of American history. And there are quite a few ecstatic, sordid, weird and wild moments along the way, from H.L. Hunt's THREE families (he was nearly a TRI-gamist!) to the great moments of long-delayed validation for the oilman's oilman, Sid Richardson. The book wanders thematically a bit through the stories of the second and third generations, but there are some good tales there as well, and we find out what ultimately happened to all those oil fortunes and what the descendants did with what was one of the biggest piles of loot in human history. Ultimately, I recommend this. Burroughs tells a good, long story well....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Nov 08, 2009","Feb 24, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3554517-the-big-rich

Eventually devolves into a 70s aging hippie luddite critique of of technological advancement, completely failing to foresee the individual, antitotalitarian empowerment the information revolution brought about. The solution to a rigid sort of eugenics experiment to breed what would be called hackers is brought down by an ""off the grid"" bunch of third-way San Franciscans. I may have a hippie heart, but my more rational brain found the ending kind of amusingly wrong-headed, as the hero uses the very information snooping tactics he accuses his opponents of misusing to bring down the evil military-industrial-CIA-whatever. Oh, he's GOOD, so it must be okay! Yawn.

Most of the poems in this collection are in flowing, completely accessible, and lambent metered verse. Turner's also a personal acquaintance, and I've seldom met a human being so authentically awake to his imagination and to the world. The poems are about the tension and collusion between earthly versions of paradise (particularly Turner's beloved Texas suburbia, which I found refreshing and unexpected as hell!) with metaphorical and spiritual types. Never naive, always hopefully critical of the vision they present, yet open to the subconscious riff of emotion that's playing alongside the thinking of big thoughts....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2010","Feb 19, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5040325-paradise
