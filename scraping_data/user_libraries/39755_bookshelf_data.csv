From a craft point of view, I cannot understand how she stuffs so much meaning and intelligence into her tiny little novels. This book is particularly irresistible to me because of its setting in the world of a shabby theater school for child actors. I was happy that Hannah, one of the teachers, (view spoiler)[ doesn't wind up marrying sad-sack Pierce merely because he was in love with her. Fitzgerald understands all the shifting dynamics of that upsetting situation, the way you feel pity, frustration, affection, and rage toward the person who adores you so hopelessly. About halfway through the novel, I started feeling nervous about the fate of Jonathan, and sure enough, we learn in the last paragraph that he inadvertently kills himself while practicing for a scene (well, we don't ""learn"" it, exactly; we can surmise it, which is the way a lot of Fitzgerald's writing works). Jonathan an artist and a genius, and I think we're meant to feel that he died a noble death, for his art. And also that while Freddie was busy consolidating power, she was neglecting the children in her charge.

As Tom Perotta says in his perceptive blurb, none of the characters are wrong here: each of them has good reason to behave exactly as s/he does, and that's what's tragic: everyone's devastated by the other characters' behavior, but none of them are to blame. America itself is the villain. My major quibble with the book is Celestial, who never came alive for me. Whereas I felt I knew Andre and Roy, Celestial remained a cipher, and for that reason I never felt fully invested in her fate. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jun 06, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage

Barnes intentionally eschews showing—this novel is mostly telling. Ruminating, really. There’s a lot of thinking about the nature of memory, and the truth about love. For a while it seems like a postmodern pulling-back of the false smooth surface of plot, and then it just seems unbearable. Also, are we meant to think the narrator is deluded? I don’t think so—I think Barnes want us to read him as smart and perceptive. In the narrator’s view of events, he fell in love with a 48-year-old woman when he was 19, and they went on to have a complicated, troubled affair. In my view, a predator ruined the narrator’s life.

Chozick is wry about them, but the emails she got from Bernie supporters were breathtakingly violent and misogynist. - High-level campaign staffers complain loudly and angrily about their coverage to the people doing that coverage. They're allowed to come the NYTimes office for meetings at which they yell at the reporters and editors. And the reporters and editors feel guilty and apologize!

Made me realize that 99% of the novels I read are written by English majors (naturally), and despite the range of prose styles, there's a fundamental sameness to their perspectives. It was as refreshing and jolting as an ice bath to read a book by someone who understands science and can write about it vividly. The protagonist is maddeningly walled off from emotion, which she knows but can't change. Her parents made her that way, and short of going back and reliving her childhood, she's stuck with herself. She's also odd, and unstable, and really funny. I loved her and wanted to spend time in her head for thousands of pages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 30, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31684925-chemistry

They include incest, rape, prostitution, shame, collusion, and kids so poor they forage for food in trash cans. Most are set up in a genre-y way (although they couldn't be less genre): we learn someone has a terrible secret in her past, and a little later on we learn what the secret is. The stories are also full of kindness and compassion—Strout's for her characters, and some of the characters' for each other. Strout is incapable of writing a cliched sentence, or setting up a familiar situation. Everything she does surprises, including linking these stories to My Name is Lucy Barton, and casting that as a memoir. What a formally exhilarating move! If I have one complaint, it's that some passages read a lot like a screenplay, with arresting dialogue interrupted by a little beat—elbows placed on knees, hands run through hair.

When presented with the fact that all human activity everywhere will soon be filmed, not one person at the FB/Google-like fictional company thinks, ""But what about privacy rights/revenge porn/stalking/etc.?""—they believe the obvious lie that these cameras will be used only for good.

But it's also so repetitive, and cloistered—intentionally, I'm sure, but it gets exhausting. In what might be a daring F-you to convention, Robinson just uses and reuses the same four beats to break up her dialogue. Jack puts his hand to his face. He laughs. He talks a little. He puts his hand to his face. He laughs. People take off their glasses. They laugh. They take off their glasses and rub their eyes. It's Sisyphean, like life. Jack and Glory apologize incessantly. No one leaves the freaking house. And although I can picture Jack vividly, I don't know if I believe in him. He reads a little like the hero of a romance: he's deeply flawed, he's a bad boy, and he's also tormented by his guilty conscience. He longs for religion and pores over the Bible, trying to find it. Most of the book is comprised of Glory, Jack, and their father having stiff, well-intentioned conversations, trying their scrupulous best to be polite and avoid giving offense, and apologizing to each other.

That's how it feels to read The Hazel Wood in manuscript form. This book is gonna be huge. It's so inventive, so dark, so FUNNY, so well-written, so tightly plotted, so original. It tells the story of Alice, who has to fight her way into a fairy tale land to rescue her mother. But that's just the premise: there are twists and surprises around every corner.

I can SEE everything Albert describes, and see it so clearly. Images from the book are still with me months after I read it. 2. It's scary. I've had actual bad dreams about characters in this book.3. The prose is sickeningly good. There's no showing off, there's no affectation, there's just perfect, incisive, crystal-clear sentence after perfect, incisive, crystal-clear sentence.4.

And then some anguished complaining about the internet and global warming. It's all very fun and uncomfortably creepy. Even though I tore through this one fast, I couldn't keep the characters' (implausible) relationships straight, and it's Franzen's fault: none of the characters (save maybe Tom) were at all believable, and I often didn't buy their actions in scene—I think Franzen saw these problems, because he often provides an elaborate rationale for some non-human action, like the way Tom and Andreas fall deeply in friend-love after about 20 minutes together, and then loathe and long for each other for the rest of time. And wait, what did Andreas's mom do that was so bad again? Space out sometimes? Have some affairs? And because of this her son turns into a sociopathic monster? The last section, with its goofy dog and tennis ball thwacking and nice boyfriend, is so sweet that I came away feeling satisfied, even though what a copout (SPOILER), giving Pip a BILLION dollars and a perfect guy, too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Apr 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23754479-purity

The story of a principled, innocent young man from Scotland who moves to London to care for a literary lion who's suffered a stroke, it's witty, humane, and surprising. Clanchy never lapses into cliche. The kindly teacher who encourages Struan turns out to be self-congratulatory and a little creepy; the angry ex-wife has her reasons for fury; the beautiful current wife is cheerfully amoral.

She has a highly visual, polished, confident style that doesn't feel show-offy or worked to death. And her paragraphs are some of the best in the biz. Each sentence follows logically from the previous one, but you have to read carefully, because the direction she takes is never the expected one. In this novel, she gets at many true things about dance and dancers. She flubs a couple of moments (writers always show dancers having intense conversations during class, which would never happen because your teacher would decapitate both of you for talking) and resorts to cliche (coke, eating disorders, Mr. Balanachine-like character, Baryshnikov-like character). However, there are major issues with the plot and structure, here as in Seating Arrangements. The story skirts melodrama and strains credulity, and there's way, way too much incident packed into its final third. I think all of this was intentional—I think she wanted to write a novel that's like a ballet story in its tidy dovetails and last-minute miracles. But I don't think it works. That doesn't change the fact that I will read whatever Shipstead publishes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jan 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18736672-astonish-me

The protagonist's dad, who's always heard the voice of God and considered himself a prophet, has a breakdown and is institutionalized, leaving his daughter and wife impoverished.

Tóibín is a wizard at capturing the huge tension all humans feel during everyday interactions: clashing with their bosses, getting in fights with their sisters, worrying about their kids. His larger project, I think, is to show us the inner life of a woman whom most people perceive as cold and combative, and by doing that to make us sympathize with her. Like most people, she's both likable and hard to like, in equal parts. Tóibín's understanding of women is almost spooky, and his prose is understated and clean as a whistle. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Jul 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20438833-nora-webster

That may be realistic, but it sure is boring. And it makes the choice of first-person plural narration feel misguided.

Clothes, furniture, light, cheekbones—she describes her fictional world more clearly than I see my real one.

It's SO GOOD!).The Goldfinch reminds me of The Art of Fielding, in that it's almost completely disconnected from the real world; both novels read like fairy tales. Tartt acknowledges the existence of smart phones and Facebook, but all of her characters, including teenage American boys, talk like they just stepped out of Dickens (""We're in a bit of a tip,"" ""What shall I do?""

Thea is such a well-rounded, appealing character: frank about her good looks and what they mean; driven by sex, and willing to do dumb stuff to get the men she wants; utterly believable in every way. There's so much here to delight your 15-year-old self: horses, cabins, oranges, dances, secrets, and a camp so well-described you can picture every nook and cranny of it. And you can enjoy all of this without feeling guilty or bored, as you do when reading YA novels, because the writing is literary and excellent, and the themes are sophisticated. Plus, there are tons of great sex scenes! A few caveats: I think some readers will find this book slow, others will get annoyed by how long we have to wait to discover the big secret, and still others will be turned off by the explicit sex.

I'm not a massive fan of Patchett's normally--I found Bel Canto laughable--so I was surprised by how much I loved this memoir. In a clean, relaxed style (that must take blood and sweat to create), Patchett tells a devastating and compassionate story about her friend, poet Lucy Grealy, who is narcissistic, charming, needy, and brilliant. Because Grealy and Patchett are writers, this is also the story of the writing life. I was reminded that writing and publishing novels doesn't just happen to you; you have to slog away at it, and carry on in the face of unending rejection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 23, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/827837.Truth_and_Beauty_

Clare killed me, with his kind heart and his delusions; the doctor's get-rick-quick schemes were maddening; and I'm worried I'll be haunted for life by Foulds' tortured lunatics, whose unreported sufferings were almost more terrifying than what Fould showed us in scene. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 31, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6256840-the-quickening-maze

The tales of violence blend together, especially because characters change their names and show up in disguises that Atkinson only removes at the eleventh hour. This novel mixes unflinching violence with silly coincidences in a very odd way. Atkinson wants us to be haunted by the image of Sylvia lying on the desk in Victor's study, but she also wants us to smile indulgently when the unrelated characters stumble upon each other in London. I'm not sure brutal realism and comic Shakespearian forest coincidences go in the same novel.Worst of all, in my opinion, is the series of tidy, wish-fulfilling bows Atkinson ties in the last pages.

The amazing Goodreads community has covered all of the important ground already; I'll chime in with my own take on a few of the most-discussed issues.1. If you've spent a few months in a Spanish-speaking country, or lived on Havemeyer Street for any length of time, there's nothing here that will confound you.2. To my mind, Díaz loves women, sympathizes with them, imagines what it's like to be them, and understands that they're real people with real thoughts——none of which you can say for the Updikes and Roths of the world.3. The plot is intentionally circuitous and nonlinear; Díaz wants to get at the way our ancestors and their lives inform every moment of our own existences.4. The mystery surrounding the narrator's identity is beside the point. One of the huge pleasures of this novel is the untold story of the narrator's life, which flickers at the edges of the main narrative but never gets looked at head-on, and his obscured identity is part of that untold story....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao

For one thing, the idea that he's a man is laughable.

I can't believe I almost made it to 30 without discovering this straight up martini of a book, which is not only brilliant, but was also a massive bestseller and the inspiration for several movies and plays--not exactly an overlooked gem.

The 13-year-old protagonist talks like a middle-aged writer's misinterpretation of a 13-year-old: ""That's so totally twisted!"" Nope. No. That's not how kids talk. And it's cheating to set the story in a town so remote that texting isn't possible. Electronic communication is now a crucial part of being a teenager, and authors who want to write about teenagers should accept that and cope with it in their fiction, not excuse themselves from grappling with it via convenient plot devices.The bigger problem is that not enough is at stake, and not enough happens. We're told that Aaron is creepy and scary, but he seems merely sad and confused. We never sense that hanging out with him puts Nico in any real danger, so when she escapes unharmed at the end of the novel, there's no sense of relief. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Apr 06, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3329521-goldengrove
