The complexity and connections of the characters lives and the premise of the happenings of New York City in 1974 made me think that the author had some big JK Rowling grand plan for the book. I was surprised to read in the author’s note, (which also was exceptional), that the writing of the book happened to him, rather than him happening to the book. The following was from the Q&A at the end of the book:“It’s strange, but as I grow older, I find myself developing more optimism. I keep inching toward the point where I believe that it’s more difficult to have hope that it is to embrace cynicism. In the deep, dark end, there’s no point unless we have at least a modicum of hope. We trawl our way through the darkness, hoping to find a pinpoint of light. But isn’t it remarkable that the cynics of the world-the politicians, the corporations the squinty eyed critics- seem to think that they have a claim on intelligence? They seem to think that it’s cooler, more intellectually engaging, to be miserable, but that there is some sort of moral heft in cynicism. But I think a good novel can be a doorstop to despair. I also think the real bravery comes with those who are prepared to go through that door, and look at the world, and all its crime and torment, and still find something of value, no matter how small.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 02, 2023","Jul 10, 2023","Jul 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

It had the elements that are on my criteria to make a good book: lyrical, witty writing, with a touch of social commentary and overture of positivity.I am stumbling upon it around the time of my 26th birthday which was precluded by a few months of unpleasant happenings. It inspired me to write down 26 things to do that (should) delight me over the weekend of my birthday. As I was beginning to dutifully execute the list of delights I found myself spectacularly pissed off. During my bike ride, I crashed and my new bike was inoperable. As I began my favorite trail walk, it began to rain. After taking the afternoon to read this book, I realized I was blind to some delights in the midst of my angst. People graciously stopped their cars to see if I was okay after the crash as my loving roommates were conveniently available and hurriedly came to pick me up.

I have read a few books on trauma and feel as though this was the most comprehensive. I think it brought me a deeper understanding of how those with trauma navigate life and hope it allows me to be more compassionate.The author does a great job weaving in stories of his patients dealing with trauma to illustrate his points, though they were difficult to read at times due to the severity of the patient’s circumstances.

Doing a happiness project is something I could see myself doing. I am glad I own the book so if some day I decide to do the project, I have a guide. I liked how many ideas it gave to cultivate more happiness or overall positive experiences, like couples having a outdoor AND indoor hobby (sent that suggestion to my parents) or her experience of following up with someone who ed her writing poorly by thanking him and telling him how she will incorporate it (turns out she made a friend!). 3 stars because at points I thought it was a little disjointed and sporadic. It sometimes was hard to follow her objectives and how she was incorporating them. I didn’t always enjoy the many comments she included from others who had posted them on her blog.
