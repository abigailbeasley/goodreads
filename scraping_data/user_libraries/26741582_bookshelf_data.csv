Not screams and tears.”The Garden Gnome by Jeff McIMy  of The Garden Gnome is published at Before We Go Blog.“Magic was supposed to be…magical. Not screams and tears.”The Garden Gnome by Jeff McIntyre is the perfect example of why you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. While the cover artwork is undoubtedly beautiful, the image of a gnome hiding in shrubbery may lead you to believe this is a middle-grade novel, or perhaps even a cozy fantasy. However, The Garden Gnome could be more accurately described as a contemporary low fantasy crossed with a Michael Crichton-style thriller.The main premise of The Garden Gnome is an imminent return of magic to our modern world dominated by science and technology. Although The Garden Gnome has a global scope, most of the book takes place in suburban Chicago. The story shifts among several different perspectives, weaving a complex web of personal and political intrigue.We are introduced first to Tony, the ten-year-old son of Daniel, a history professor, and Sophia, a businesswoman with a powerful but enigmatic boss. Bullied at school, Tony finds solace from an imaginary friend he calls Bob. But Bob, like Tony himself, may offer more than meets the eye.Jeff McIntyre blends science fiction into The Garden Gnome via an impending breakthrough at Fermilab, the U.S. Department of Energy’s national particle accelerator laboratory just outside of Chicago. For me, McIntyre’s incorporation of a particle accelerator within a fantasy novel brought back fond memories of reading The Wheel of Osheim, the excellent final volume of Mark Lawrence’s Red Queen’s War trilogy.The Fermilab plot thread also provides the basis for introducing many of the other point-of-view characters in the book, most notably Leo, a science and technology reporter for the Chicago Tribune newspaper, and Deb, an FBI agent. Leo and Deb are both investigating Nadir, an organization that opposes the advances at Fermilab and might potentially cross over into the realm of violence and terrorism.Although this is a fantasy novel, several of the characters and organizations in The Garden Gnome feel worthy of a James Bond movie. Beyond Nadir, The Garden Gnome features another shady multinational organization known as the Knights of the Stone. Derived from Arthurian mythos, the Knights of the Stone are dedicated to the suppression of magic by whatever means necessary.Gray morality comes in through this purported return of magic, which is considered an opportunity by some and a grave threat by others. But if magic is destined to bring about the apocalypse, does that serve as justification for murder?Jeff McIntyre’s prose is straightforward and enjoyable, propelling the plot forward at a fast clip. I also enjoyed the blend of fantasy and science fiction throughout The Garden Gnome, although I wish the particle accelerator had featured more prominently in the latter part of the book.The garden gnome himself is an absolute delight. Although he doesn’t get a lot of page time, I thoroughly enjoyed each of his scenes.Altogether, The Garden Gnome is a delightful surprise, a Crichtonesque thriller that blends contemporary fantasy with science fiction, Arthurian legend, and Ian Fleming levels of intrigue. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am eager to see what happens next in Jeff McIntyre’s Theory of Magic series....more",Notes are private!,10,50,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62933993-the-garden-gnome

Although the family’s surname translates to “peace” in Italian, they are not given a moment’s rest as their rental home turns out to be an infamous haunted house, feared and shunned by the local populace.The lead protagonist in Diavola is Anna Pace, the black sheep of the family who is treated like an outcast and can never live up to their expectations. Rightfully or not, Anna takes the blame for many of the family’s misfortunes. Thorne reaches a T. Kingfisher-level of narration with Anna: she is smart, funny, and so vibrantly engaging that it’s impossible not to love her.As in her previous novel, Lute, Jennifer Thorne both embraces and upends the trope of naïve, unbelieving Americans who face a supernatural threat in an historic European setting. Diavola exploits this clash of cultures to great effect, skillfully walking the line between camp and deathly serious horror. At its best, the laugh-out-loud moments in Diavola are worthy of Oscar Wilde’s classic short story, “The Canterville Ghost,” which also features an American family who take up residence in an old European haunted house while expressing a stubborn disbelief in local legends. Although this approach risks becoming self-parody in less capable hands, Jennifer Thorne’s incisive, sardonic writing strikes just the right balance between humor and horror. She is also an expert at characterization: a large part of what makes Diavola work so well is that the Pace family is so believable in their dysfunction.I especially enjoyed the final third of the novel, where Thorne brilliantly ties together the various threads of the story while delivering plenty of unexpected twists. I was delighted by Anna’s character growth in this final part of Diavola as she addresses issues of loneliness and belonging while fighting back against the embodiment of fear itself.Altogether, Diavola is a must-read for horror fans, delivering a thrill ride that is equal parts fun and terrifying....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/126918202-diavola

Dressed in his oversized clothes and top hat, Ink recalls the Artful Dodger from Charles Dickens’s 1838 novel, Oliver Twist. Jacquelyn Hagen incorporates gray morality in The Wickwire Watch through a cast of side characters with questionable motivations. The darkest part of the worldbuilding involves ghostly beings known as Spektors, who play an increasingly prominent role as the novel progresses:“Spektors were once mortal. They are the spirits of those who died so full of hate and bitterness they couldn’t bear to leave this world behind without making others feel their pain and suffering.”I also enjoyed the steampunk elements of The Wickwire Watch, including a magical pocket watch and plenty of airship action, which is always a treat for Final Fantasy fans like myself.The Wickwire Watch changes style throughout the novel, opening as a Victorian murder mystery following the death of poor Mr. Bash. By the middle of the novel, The Wickwire Watch transitions into a cozy-ish found family-type story. The latter part of the book shifts tone again, becoming a dark fantasy with mild elements of horror:“Ink opened his mouth to scream his bloody lungs out. But before the sound could form, the man reached forward, took him by the throat, and threw him onto the back of the horse.”Although Jacquelyn Hagen’s writing is excellent throughout the novel, the inconsistent pacing and stylistic shifts in The Wickwire Watch threw me out of the story rather than engaging me as I had hoped.Overall, The Wickwire Watch contains a lot of elements that I love, but these pieces didn’t come together as effectively as I would have liked. Still, readers looking for a Dickensian-inspired fantasy will find a lot to love here.

The only part of the city where these races coexist is the Glow, the neon-drenched slum that Sam calls home.Sam’s sleuthing partner in Necrotown is his voluptuous wife, the appropriately named Fox, a body-hopping kitsune with a living fox tattoo. The fox tattoo has a name, Sune, and exhibits plenty of personality as it scampers over her body, baring its teeth in anger toward any perceived threat.As the novel opens, the loving couple are desperate for rent money. They accept a job from Lloyd Burgess, a deep-pocketed sleazebag who instructs them to retrieve his wayward daughter, Sarah, from the notorious Necrotown. Was she kidnapped by gang members? Or perhaps running away from an abusive father? Sarah has more than a few surprises of her own in store for the reader.Necrotown is the worst section of this godawful city, overrun by death Mages and plenty of necromancy. As a quasi-immortal, Sam himself is not immune from death, and in fact dying is still quite painful. But if he’s lucky, death may be followed by an equally painful resurrection:“‘This week is gonna suck for you.’ Fox trails a delicate hand across my throat. ‘You are going to die at least six times.’”The loving and overly flirtatious relationship between Sam and Fox is the highlight of Necrotown, especially as Fox inhabits other beings’ bodies. This keeps their enemies guessing while also providing fuel for Sam’s lowbrow humor. Alexander Nader’s pulp fiction-style writing superbly conveys the noir vibes of Necrotown, striking a nice balance between humor and horror without ever taking itself too seriously. That being said, the novel would benefit from another round of editing to polish the text and clean up a number of distracting typos. For example, discussion of the five “burrows” of New York City conjures a more leporine image than I believe the author intended.Nevertheless, Necrotown is an intoxicating read, offering plenty of fun for fans of urban fantasy and noir fiction.

Originally published in Greek, The Fall of the Giants has been translated into English by Sophia Travlos and edited by K.E. Andrews, providing a polished reading experience that, for me, is indistinguishable from native English.The scope of The Dance of Light series is enormous, filled to the brim with political intrigue and warring factions. Thankfully, Gregory Kontaxis includes a comprehensive list of characters and information on each kingdom at the beginning of the book. I found myself consulting the list frequently, especially during the early part of the book.The Fall of the Giants brings greater nuance to all the principal characters of the series. I must confess that I was rather annoyed with the lead protagonist, Elliot, in The Return of the Knights, where he came across as brash and overconfident. I found Elliot to be much more realistic, and therefore more relatable, in this second book of the series.As in The Return of the Knights, I enjoyed the over-the-top villainy of Walter Thorn, a local warlord trying to overthrow Queen Sophie of Knightdorn. Another favorite villain is John (the “Long Arm”), a former bounty hunter and member of Walter’s inner circle, whose backstory is given in the excellent prequel novella, The Knight of the Moon.Nevertheless, my favorite character in The Fall of the Giants is Queen Sophie herself. She is, perhaps, the most complex character in the series, a lonely monarch who has lost most of her family and close allies. Sophie is weary from carrying the weight of a crown that she feels ambivalent about at best.The main story of The Fall of the Giants concerns a competition between Elliot and Walter as they seek to form alliances with various legendary races. While Elliot strives to free the Elder Races, elwyn and elves, Walter pursues a fearsome set of allies in giants and their most loyal companions, the terrifying wyverns. With the power of giants and wyverns on his side, Walter could become unstoppable.Kontaxis maintains a steady pace throughout this second volume of the series, never lagging as the story builds up to its striking climax. Despite the obvious comparisons to A Game of Thrones, Kontaxis has a tighter focus on the key storylines compared to George R.R. Martin. However, The Dance of Light series also dials back on elements of gray morality compared to Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more moral ambiguity in the lead characters in The Fall of the Giants.Overall, The Fall of the Giants improves upon The Return of the Knights in every way, delivering an impressive epic fantasy that brings new layers of nuance to both the characters and story....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Mar 30, 2024","Apr 04, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/207604562-the-fall-of-the-giants

Amor combines science fiction and horror to astonishing effect, taking the story in bizarre directions on her way to a perfectly executed, jaw-dropping conclusion.The next story, “The Reunion,” is narrated by Tim, a formerly poor boy who was bullied in school and is now returning to his high school reunion as the successful vice president of a pharmaceutical company accompanied by his beautiful wife. But Tim’s plans of proving his worth to his classmates are disrupted by his ex-wife, Louise, who exacts the ultimate revenge on her former husband for abandoning her and their child. Devoid of supernatural elements, “The Reunion” proves that the most horrific monster may be man himself.Gemma Amor drops us on a giant glacier in “Fields of Ice,” the third story of All Who Wander Are Lost, which is set in either a near-future dystopian society or some alternate reality. Hayder, an explorer working for an autocratic leader known as the Minister, is sent on a special mission in pursuit of precious ore, but perhaps she is the one being pursued.The following story, “Let Sleeping Gods Lie,” delivers an Indiana Jones-style adventure as we join an archaeological expedition in Egypt. Written in epistolary format, Gemma Amor takes us on a haunting journey through an underground labyrinth, showing that some ancient powers should be left undisturbed.Amor channels Daphne du Maurier’s “Don’t Look Now” in her Venetian horror, “The Final Wish Foundation,” bringing several thrilling twists to this familiar backdrop to horror. Next up is “A Song for Sam,” in which two brothers travel to Norway to fulfill their late father’s wish to scatter his ashes beneath the aurora borealis, but one brother has a more sinister plan in mind.The remaining stories in All Who Wander Are Lost include “The Ancient Ram Inn,” a classic haunted house horror turned inside out, “A Gentlewoman Abroad” about a businesswoman who despises tourists to an unhealthy degree, and “Less Exalted Tastes” about a rather sadistic form of artistry. The anthology concludes with “Christmas in Antarctica,” a decidedly chilling supernatural horror that will make you want to stay at home for the holidays.Altogether, All Who Wander Are Lost is a masterfully conceived and executed anthology that serves as Gemma Amor’s homage to the human desire to travel and explore.

Prindle, is a raucous ride featuring Robert Caplan, or Bob, as his friends know him. Bob is a chain-smoking recovering alcoholic, a foul-mouthed ex-garbage man from Texas who will stop at nothing to avenge his family’s death.The novel opens with Bob in the aftermath of tragedy, his wife and son viciously murdered by a gray-skinned man known as Galvidon. Powered by nicotine and an unrelenting thirst for revenge, Bob chases the killer across the various worlds and slices of reality that make up the Astraverse, carrying nothing but a backpack, a pistol, and an enigmatic object called the Gatekey. This solar-powered Gatekey, which enables Bob’s world-hopping, had been gifted to him by a mysterious creature prior to his death. Somehow the Gatekey also seems to facilitate Bob’s communication with other intelligent beings wherever he goes.While Bob the Wizard features a fun cast of side characters, Bob himself steals the show. Grimdark readers will appreciate the complexity of Bob’s character: he is a deeply flawed protagonist, fighting addiction and emotional trauma while on a monomaniacal quest for vengeance. However, despite his gruff and imposing exterior, Bob has a heart of gold and learns much about himself along the journey, discovering his own powers and reevaluating his priorities. M.V. Prindle writes with heartfelt intensity and strikes a great balance of emotions throughout Bob the Wizard. There is sadness, hope, anger, and an abundance of laugh-out-loud humor. Although Bob the Wizard also features plenty of action, there were some pacing issues in the middle part of the book. I think the story could be streamlined a bit to help maintain a more consistent pacing throughout the novel.M.V. Prindle’s layering of science fiction and fantasy elements in his worldbuilding is quite brilliant. Bob the Wizard takes the opposite approach of many other sci-fantasy novels, which often incorporate science fiction elements within a fantasy world. Prindle turns this inside-out in his debut, creating an entire fantasy world within a sci-fi multiverse framing device. The world features plenty of fantastical beasts and humanoid races, including faeries, blue elves, and lizard people. We also learn many details about the Astraverse itself, especially in the latter part of the novel.Overall, Bob the Wizard is an exhilarating and wildly creative tale. M.V.

The trio live on Dyer Street, the most dangerous street in the city of Ordshaw. Kit is a rather intimidating figure, admired by some and feared by others as she fights to bring peace, justice, and accountability to a region overrun by gang warfare.In addition to leading their punk band, Dyre Grrls, Kit serves as chief editor and publisher of a local magazine that makes a business of upsetting powerful people. Their basic tenets, as enumerating by Kit, include “challenging the establishment, defending freedom of expression, fighting for equal rights, defeating all forms of bigotry, rejecting the mainstream.”The other lead protagonist of Dyer Street Punk Witches is Aaron, a young man whose book smarts outweigh his street smarts by a considerable margin. Kit had previously saved Aaron’s life, coming to his rescue during a violent mugging. Aaron returns to Dyer Street to face his fears and come to peace with that traumatizing (and somewhat embarrassing) event.Aaron also suspects that Kit may have tapped into some supernatural powers to aid in his rescue. He decides that the best way to learn more about his savior and, perhaps, overcome his own self-doubt, would be to volunteer for Kit’s magazine. She immediately puts her new volunteer to work, pushing him out of his comfort zone.Dyer Street Punk Witches bounces between the present-day narrative and a backstory that occurs mostly in the 1990s. The notorious Saxon gang from the 1990s is making a return in the present day, bringing some frightening new powers.The worldbuilding in Dyer Street Punk Witches is outstanding, with just the right amount of occultist magic to balance the realistic street grit that sets the backdrop for the novel. I especially enjoyed the social justice aspects of the story, as well as the plentiful punk rock references. Any book that name-drops Sleater-Kinney automatically gets bonus points from this er. My only minor complaint is that Dyer Street Punk Witches finishes too quickly. A sizeable fraction of the book is spent on exposition, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I wanted a greater buildup in action during the second half of the book. I would have happily devoured another 100 pages of action before letting this story go.Altogether, Dyer Street Punk Witches brilliantly captures the feminist riot grrl spirit in a dark urban fantasy setting.

Varésh’s journey also brings him toward the Hang-Dead Forest as he uncovers truths about both himself and the Vulture goddess.The World-Maker Parable is told on two timelines denoted “then” and “now.” I won’t say anything else about the plot of the novella, since I don’t want to spoil the myriad of surprises that Luke Tarzian has in store for the reader.The dark, brooding atmosphere of The World-Maker Parable feels like a lucid dream. Tarzian’s prose is dense but engrossing. The author makes effective use of unreliable narration as he addresses issues of character identity and motivation, including one character who argues with a shadow twin. The novella is also bursting with a gamut of emotions. In the end, I realized that the title of the novella is meant to be taken quite literally.The World-Maker Parable has an almost shockingly deep level of worldbuilding for such a short book. I thoroughly enjoyed the bird-inspired goddesses and their related lore of both creation and destruction. The thermodynamicist in me was delighted by both the Vulture goddess of entropy and the spirit of Equilibrium, who tries to maintain balance in the land. Altogether, The World-Maker Parable is an impressive showcase for Luke Tarzian’s unbounded imagination and his ability to translate nightmarish visions into an unputdownable, emotionally rich story....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 08, 2024","Mar 08, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/195711797-the-world-maker-parable

Spend your time on the things money can’t buy.”TheMy complete  is published by Before We Go Blog.“Spend your money on the things money can buy. Spend your time on the things money can’t buy.”The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a masterpiece of magical realism, establishing Japanese author Haruki Murakami as one of the world’s foremost voices in speculative fiction and a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.I first discovered Murakami’s work in my early twenties, devouring all his published work in the years following my college graduation. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle became my favorite novel, impacting me in subtle ways that have become a core part of who I am today.I have revisited The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle each decade since my original read in 2004. I know it’s the same book, but it feels different each time. My format for this  is directly inspired by Mark Lawrence’s recent short story, “About Pain,” which contains the following quote:“You cannot read the same book twice. When you return to the first page it will be a different ‘you’, changed by the very experiences you are seeking to recapture.” (Mark Lawrence)2004: After rekindling my passion for reading in college, I feel fortunate to have discovered a long list of novels that I adore, books where I feel a strong personal connection with the characters and themes being explored. Most of all, these are books that have helped me to think in a new way, or to somehow broaden or deepen my understanding of our place in the world and our relationships with each other.I don’t always give the same response when people ask me which book is my all-time favorite. It depends on my mood, and there is also some recency bias depending on which books I have recently enjoyed. Despite these reservations, in my heart I know that I’ve converged on an answer: The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami. I feel like a different person after reading this book, like I’m somehow more attuned to the ways in which people treat each other and the metaphysical reality hiding just beneath the surface of our everyday lives.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a very difficult book to summarize, with a number of disparate plot lines that all converge at the end. I’m not going to attempt to write a plot summary or even a character summary. What stands out to me most is how Murakami blurs the line between the real and surreal. The main protagonist, Toru Okada, is so passive in our physical world and can only grow by entering the metaphysical realm:“In a place far away from anyone or anywhere, I drifted off for a moment.”Murakami makes such effective use of magical realism here, as he does in many of his other novels. But The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is somehow different. The magical elements are not meant to be fantasy: they are meant to be a deeper level of our true reality.It’s hard to describe how much The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle means to me or how much it has impacted me. I feel like it somehow deepened my consciousness and, in doing so, made me a better person in some small way.2014: A decade older. Am I ten years wiser or just more jaded?I’ve read a lot of great books over the past ten years, yet The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is still my favorite. However, it seems significantly darker this second time around.Ten years ago, I would have told you that the main theme of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is transcendence: discovering our true selves by digging deep into our souls, perhaps with a little help from some unlikely friends. But I missed the point.Returning to The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle in my thirties, the overarching theme is cruelty: not the cruelty of an uncaring universe, but rather the cruelty that people inflict on each other, either purposely or just plain carelessly.Murakami covers cruelty on both personal and global levels. There is the small-scale cruelty that people inflict on each other within a relationship. When The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle opens, the narrator (Toru) is obsessed with the search for his lost cat. However, he is focused on the what rather than the why. Toru should be asking why the cat left in the first place, since this seemingly innocuous event is the harbinger for the impending breakdown of his marriage with his wife, Kumiko:“I realize full well how hard it must be to go on living alone in a place from which someone has left you, but there is nothing so cruel in this world as the desolation of having nothing to hope for.”Kumiko’s troubles stem from the inexplicable cruelty inflicted on her by her brother, Noburo, who is a slick, media-savvy politician, well-loved by the public, but also a sadistic abuser, especially toward his two sisters. Noburo’s abuse is cruelty for the sake of cruelty, committed by a twisted soul.Murakami pairs these personal stories of cruelty with violence committed on a much larger scale during World War II. There is a very clear political aspect to The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, with Murakami criticizing his own government, which has been much more reluctant than Germany to admit its atrocities during the war, issue apologies, and make reparations. I really admire what Murakami is doing here in bringing the atrocities of the war front and center, entreating the public to come face-to-face with this cruel past.Murakami doesn’t restrict his criticism to Japanese violence during World War II. On the other side of the war, the Soviets were equally cruel. In The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, the embodiment of this cruelty is Boris the Manskinner. The scenes with Boris are some of the most excruciating of the entire book and have seared a permanent image in my memory.2024: I keep coming back to The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, a book that has left a permanent mark on me much like the blue mark left on the face of our protagonist, Toru, after his transcendent experience at the bottom of the well. Reading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle feels like coming home, but it’s not the home I remember:“Memories and thoughts age, just as people do. But certain thoughts can never age, and certain memories can never fade.”May Kasahara has always been one of my favorite characters from the book: a sixteen-year-old girl obsessed with aging and death, yet she is such a vibrant presence in this bleak world, even if she does have a bit of a sadistic streak: “You know, Mr. Wind-Up Bird, I sometimes wonder what it must feel like to die little by little over a long period of time. What do you think?”It feels weird that despite May’s obsession with aging, she is exactly the same age as when I first picked up the book in 2004. Instead, it is this unsuspecting reader who has aged twenty years, and I must admit that as a younger man I missed the crux of this novel.It’s about pain. It’s the pain of being human, a pain that is core to our existence. We seek to escape this pain, but the only way to escape pain is to abandon our very selves.Consider this quote from Creta Kano, who endured unspeakable cruelty but eventually came to numb herself from the pain:“A life without pain: it was the very thing I had dreamed of for years, but now that I had it, I couldn’t find a place for myself within it.”In my twenties I thought that The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle was about transcendence. But it’s not about transcendence: it’s about acceptance. We become better people by accepting our identities, becoming truer versions of ourselves while also becoming more aware and understanding of each other.We all suffer through pain: this is part of our common existence. The core message of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is that there is hope in suffering. We become better people by looking inward in discovering a truer sense of ourselves, but more importantly by looking outward at the people we love, the people we hate, and the strangers we pass by on the street who may be just friends we haven’t met yet.I know The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is the same book I read twenty years ago, but somehow it feels different each time. What will I learn from this book in ten years’ time? I have no idea, but I hope that I will have grown as a person by then.I also hope that, by next time, the Nobel Prize committee will have finally honored Haruki Murakami for the sheer genius that is The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, a novel that remains without peer more than twenty years since its original publication....more",Notes are private!,8,73,1,"Mar 06, 2024","Mar 06, 2024","Mar 06, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11275.The_Wind_Up_Bird_Chronicle

She’s had enough.”The opening scene of FERAL channels Franz Kafka’s classic novella, The Metamorphosis, as Margot awakens in a disoriented state, coming to grips with a bodily transformation:“Soon I will slough this suffocating flesh off completely, and I do not know what I will be underneath, but that is part of the joy of giving birth to oneself, I suppose: the uncertainty of the new.”As a schoolgirl, Margot was bullied for her natural body hair and later became obsessed with meeting society’s expectations of femininity:“I started the war with my body in earnest, and it consumed me.”Margot’s self-consciousness regarding her body continues into adulthood: she is always careful to present a well-groomed, professional façade, masking her face with makeup and keeping her teeth an unnatural shade of white.Then one day, Margot had enough. Exhausted by the daily obsession with her physical appearance, she decides to rebel against society’s norms. FERAL follows Margot as she discards her uptight persona and inhibitions, embracing her human body in its most natural state. However, Margot takes her newfound grittiness to an extreme, refusing to bathe or keep herself clean. Margot’s increasingly concerned boyfriend, Adam, genuinely loves her. But he looks on with despair, and perhaps a bit of disgust, as the stench from her unwashed body grows. Meanwhile, Margot finds new kinship with a neighborhood fox, adopting some of its vulpine behavior:“My evening foraging habits grew more determined. I began raiding people’s bins when they were left out the night before collection day, sharing any particularly good morsels with the fox, who was loyal to me now she had determined I was a good source of food.”FERAL dips into zoomorphism as Margot assumes animalistic features, including elongated canine teeth and a heightened sense of smell. In this manner, the story echoes traditional werewolf horror, albeit with a more gradual transformation.Although it would seem natural to describe FERAL as a story of feminist rage, its themes of freedom and nonconformity are much broader. More than anything, FERAL is a declaration of independence from the often nonsensical expectations that society places on people, especially women.Through it all, Gemma Amor writes with a savage energy, embracing Margot’s insatiable hunger as she casts aside the inhibitive for a more instinctive existence. Altogether, FERAL is a ferociously good story, and not one I’ll soon forget....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Feb 25, 2024","Feb 25, 2024","Feb 25, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/208672946-feral

The dream memory of golden childhood, the desire for a lost beloved never truly known.”Anna Smith Spark’s Empires of Dust trilogy comes to its inevitable Shakespearean conclusion with The House of Sacrifice, a finale that reaffirms Marith as one of the greatest protagonists in grimdark fantasy. Following events in the first two books of the trilogy, The Court of Broken Knives and The Tower of Living and Dying, Marith proves himself to be a ruinous king with a god complex, overrunning the continent with a seemingly undefeatable army: “We march onwards, an army like a storm, like the clouds rushing over the sun. The world trembles. The men in their bronze armour sing the paean, hold their heads high, smile as they march. The world bows before us.”Marith sets his sights on the unconquerable city of Sorlost, the decaying capital of what had once been the greatest empire in the world, a conquest that had eluded even Marith’s notorious ancestor. At the same time, the greatest threat to Marith may come from within, as his unprecedented power is accompanied by a steady descent into madness.The House of Sacrifice pivots on the tumultuous relationship between Marith and his wife, Thalia, the former high priestess and holiest woman from Sorlost. Their relationship alternates between affection and a potentially murderous hatred, with intermittent flames of passion eclipsed by their more steadfast lust for power and glory.Throughout The House of Sacrifice, Marith and Thalia leave a trail of death and destruction in their wake. As always, Anna Smith Spark is unflinching in her descriptions of gore and suffering. While Marith strives to maintain sanity, Thalia seeks to justify her choices that have led to so much slaughter:“I will not be blamed for living my life.”Altogether, the Empires of Dust trilogy is a towering literary achievement and one of the finest works of grimdark fantasy. Anna Smith Spark is acclaimed as the Queen of Grimdark for a very good reason: her inimitable prose elevates the genre to soaring new artistic heights.

Marith even terrifies himself as he discovers the evil within and awakens to his own tremendous powers. “Never go up against a drink-and drug-addled death obsessed invulnerable demon with a pet dragon. Old secret sellsword’s wisdom, that.”While Marith was the undisputed star of The Court of Broken Knives, Thalia steals the spotlight in The Tower of Living and Dying. The high priestess of Sorlost, chosen by God, flees her life of isolation to escape with Marith, wedding Marith while whetting her thirst for freedom.Thalia is fully aware of the intrinsic dangers posed by Marith and of her own unique position to stop him. But her attraction to Marith proves too powerful to resist and is also intertwined with the lure of power.Thalia’s internal struggles are set against the backdrop of growing war and changing allegiances in The Tower of Living and Dying. Anna Smith Spark never shies away from showing the brutal realities of war and its impact on personal lives.Marith’s erstwhile companion, the mercenary leader Tobias, returns in The Tower of Living and Dying, together with a woman from Marith’s past who seeks vengeance for the pain and destruction he has wrought. The scheming nobleman Orhan is also back, offering plenty of personal and political intrigue. All this builds up to the most wicked mic-drop ending since Mark Lawrence’s King of Thorns.Let’s face it, though, the raison d'être for reading The Tower of Living and Dying is to immerse yourself in Anna Smith Spark’s lyrical prose. No one writes like Anna Smith Spark. Her writing burns with emotional intensity, finding poetry in a world of violence and decay.Anna Smith Spark elevates emotional wreckage to an art form in The Tower of Living and Dying, making it another must-read for grimdark fans.

When you return to the first page it will be a different ‘you’, changed by the very experiences you are seeking to recapture.”Mark Lawrence returns to the Library Trilogy with a pair of new short stories about the indelible impact of books on the lives of their readers. This companion volume, the aptly named Returns, brings us back to the infinitely large library of The Book that Wouldn’t Burn and its excellent cast of characters, including the deputy head librarian, Yute, and the precocious young librarian, Livira.Returns also features our trio of beloved animal companions from The Book that Wouldn’t Burn, all of whom are depicted in Thomas Brown’s cover art. The oversized cat, Wentworth, is front and center, along with the ink-black dog, Volente, and the raven whose name I shall not reveal. All three animal friends are present in Returns, with Volente featuring prominently in both stories.The title story of Returns concerns the search for a missing volume, The Book of Many Stories, that must be returned to the Library. The search cuts across space and time and may have implications for Yute’s missing daughter, who has been lost in the Library for over twenty years. The second story, “About Pain,” is Mark Lawrence’s homage to J.D. Salinger’s classic The Catcher in the Rye. The goodest of good boys, Volente, brings an unwanted copy of Catcher to the lead protagonist, Holden, who detested the book when he was forced to read it in school. Upon returning Catcher to the library, Livira instructs Holden to read it every ten years and come back to tell her about it. The story then follows Holden through the decades as his life experiences make him appreciate new aspects of Catcher that he hadn’t yet considered. In a nice touch, “About Pain” also features Clovis Eventari, Evar’s imposing redheaded sister from The Book that Wouldn’t Burn.In my opinion, the Library Trilogy has now surpassed the Broken Empire in terms of its possibilities for short story adventures. Mark Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy provided an outstanding setup for short stories featuring the dark wit and haunted brokenness of Jorg Ancrath, as well as those focused on side characters from his band of Road Brothers. However, since the Library spans all space and all time, the possibilities in the Library Trilogy are limitless.The two stories in Returns serve as gentle and insightful ruminations on the universality of stories in our common humanity. In his previous Library short story, “Overdue,” Mark Lawrence focused on how books build connections between readers. In Returns, the focus is on the relationship between individual readers and the books themselves, i.e., the physical manifestations of these stories. When we return a book to the library, the book itself hasn’t changed, but we have changed irreversibly as a result of reading it.If you enjoyed The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, be sure to add Returns to your reading list today. The Library Trilogy—and its accompanying short stories—will leave a permanent impact on you, from which there is no return....more",Notes are private!,1,57,1,"Feb 17, 2024","Feb 17, 2024","Feb 17, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/207537277-returns

This second volume in the Chronicles of Hanuvar series by Howard Andrew Jones delivers everything I loved from the first book, Lord of a Shattered Land, while raising the stakes and deepening the emotional connection with our hero.The Chronicles of Hanuvar is inspired by the Punic Wars, which were fought between Rome and Carthage during 264-146 BC. The protagonist of the series, Hanuvar, is a fictionalized version of Hannibal, the famed general and statesman from the North African empire of Carthage who led the campaign against Rome during the Second Punic War. However, the ensuing Third Punic War ended in complete defeat for Carthage, which found itself utterly destroyed by Rome. While most of the Carthaginians were slaughtered, the remaining survivors were enslaved by the Romans. In the Chronicles of Hanuvar, the Dervan Empire fills the role of Rome, while Hanuvar’s homeland of Volanus represents Carthage.The City of Marble and Blood adopts the same episodic format as Lord of a Shattered Land, with fourteen chapters that act as interconnected short stories. Each chapter tells a standalone tale that can be enjoyed on its own, but the real brilliance of the series is how the chapters work together to build the overarching story of Hanuvar’s struggle against the Dervan Empire. The City of Marble and Blood also includes a short fifteenth chapter that serves as more of an epilogue for the book while also leaving the reader on the edge of their seat to find out what happens next in the series.The connections among the stories are even stronger in The City of Marble and Blood compared to Lord of a Shattered Land. Hanuvar is now behind enemy lines, navigating a complex web of high-stakes politics as he tries to free his enslaved people from within the Dervan Empire itself. The City of Marble and Blood begins on a high note and somehow only builds in intensity until reaching its climax in the epic fourteenth chapter.The City of Marble and Blood also has a more intimate feel compared to Lord of a Shattered Land as we learn more about Hanuvar’s personal life and relationships. There are many touching moments between Hanuvar and his travel companion, Antires Sosilos, who chronicles our hero’s adventures. The City of Marble and Blood strikes the perfect balance between big-picture action and its personal impact on both Hanuvar and the side characters in the book.The Chronicles of Hanuvar is an instant classic. The City of Marble and Blood will appeal to both seasoned fans of sword and sorcery and those new to the genre.

Hidden.”Dreams of Fire by Shauna Lawless is a prequel novella that takes place almost a century before the events of her main Gael Song trilogy. Lawless proves once again why she is the Emerald Empress of Grimdark, weaving strands of Irish history, mythology, and fantasy into a heart-wrenching tale of love and loss.Dreams of Fire is set in medieval Ireland in the early tenth century as two races of immortal beings—the Descendants of the Tuatha Dé Danann and their ancient enemies, the Fomorians—renew their age-old battle for supremacy in the Emerald Isle. While the first and last slices of Dreams of Fire are told from a Fomorian perspective, the main part of the novella is narrated from a single point-of-view character, the Descendant Rónnat.Rónnat and her sister, Fódla, wish only to live a long and peaceful life with their beloved father. But the waning magic of the Descendants threatens to bring an end to these once immortal beings:“Don’t be unhappy, daughter. Three hundred and fifty years have been long enough, and when I die, I will join with your mother in the otherworld. There is no sadness there, only joy.”Meanwhile, Rónnat is haunted by strange voices and visions that foretell a future battle against the Fomorians and their blazing fire-magic. Could this be a prophecy of the inevitable? Or will Rónnat have the freedom to choose her own path forward?Shauna Lawless expertly explores themes of kinship, freedom, and finding peace with one’s own mortality. The author brings an understated lyricism to her writing that captures feelings of both mysticism and lamentation.The novella format of Dreams of Fire provides just the right-sized canvas for Shauna Lawless to paint this intimate portrait of Rónnat, who has become one of my favorite characters in the Gael Song series. Altogether, Dreams of Fire is an expertly crafted novella and a must-read for fans of Shauna Lawless, who will love the opportunity to spend this quality time with Rónnat and Fódla.

I loved reading the conversations between him and Maidman as they discussed these specific works and broader topics about painting and the modern art world in general.I particularly enjoyed the artists' insights about postmodernism and the various factions within the contemporary art world. I also enjoyed reading Maidman and Desiderio's thoughts on influential works by artists of the past. This volume is also full of insights about the painting techniques. The conversational format made the entire book feel accessible even for non-artists such as myself.Maidman and Desiderio's love of art shines through on every page of this book, which is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys learning more about art....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 07, 2024","Feb 10, 2024","Feb 07, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40043615-theseus

I will keep this  completely spoiler-free for readers who have not yet started this action-packed series.Michael Roberti constructs his own game of thrones in a story that would make George R.R. Martin proud. No one is safe as competing factions vie for the throne, navigating their way through a web of political and romantic entanglements:“Apart, we are weak and distracted, but together we are strong. We all know the princes are fighting and Emil Trestinsen sits and watches. And we are all expected to sit by and watch as a single family creates a grave for us all.”Martin’s influence is evident throughout A Grave for Us All, which adopts a traditional medieval European fantasy setting akin to A Song of Ice and Fire but with an interesting twist. Roberti’s Crown and Tide series considers a world where writing disappears when its author dies, i.e., where a person’s writing is such an integral part of themselves that their words cease to exist when the writer perishes. A major implication of this phenomenon is that it becomes easy to rewrite an opponent’s history after vanquishing them in battle:“‘The histories are being amended as we speak. It is important to make it clear that the Quinlens have always been the rulers of that duchy. That’s the beautiful thing about books. They always need rewriting. And after wars like these with so much writing gone?’ Mathis smiled. ‘Everyone will be too tired or too dead to refute it.’”While Michael Roberti builds many layers of political intrigue throughout A Grave for Us All, he especially shines when focusing on his protagonists’ personal relationships. Merily continues to be the standout star among Roberti’s large cast of characters: A Grave for Us All is an absolute delight anytime she graces the page. Merily also has the best character arc thus far in the series.I occasionally worried that Roberti was falling into George R.R. Martin’s trap of giving everyone and their uncle point-of-view status. By my count, there are over ten point-of-view characters in the main narrative of A Grave for Us All, with another seven or so in the flashback chapters and epilogues. While my personal preference is to focus on a smaller number of protagonists, Roberti does a commendable job juggling all these perspectives while maintaining a coherent and engaging narrative throughout the book.Indeed, A Grave for Us All is compulsively readable from cover to cover. Michael Roberti has taken his writing to the next level, with spot-on pacing that kept me eagerly flipping the pages to find out what happens next. I love how the plot builds to its explosive climax, which took me completely by surprise.Altogether, Michael Roberti improves upon his debut novel in every way with A Grave for Us All. The Crown and Tide series is perfect reading for George R.R.

Think of it as Agatha Christie meets Neil Gaiman, with a quirky sense of humor that rivals Knives Out.Isabeau Agarwal is perfect as the lead protagonist of Murder at Spindle Manor, combining a sharp intellect with the fighting skills and marksmanship of a professional sniper. Isabeau is a Huntress, tasked with tracking and exterminating a terrible monster known as the Doppelvyrm:“Allow me to speak of the Doppelvyrm. They fear no light, for their only dream is to become human, and in the pursuit of that dream, they will kill countless men and women…The Doppelvyrm is a parasite. A grisly, ghastly parasite.”The Doppelvyrm can perfectly mimic its human victims, adopting their physical form and absorbing their memories. Isabeau’s hunt brings her to Spindle Manor, where she suspects that one of the ten guests is actually the Doppelvyrm in disguise:“Ten little guests, all collected and sat, met and filed away. Ten souls in one room, one of whom was not who they said they were.”The influence of Agatha Christie is obvious from the quote above and from the general setup of the novel. Morgan Stang gleefully embraces and/or subverts a range of murder mystery tropes, including a mentor-mentee relationship reminiscent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s pairing of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.Playing the role of Watson in Murder at Spindle Manor is Evie, an apprentice of sorts to Isabeau who gives our protagonist the opportunity to explain her thought process out loud as she considers various hypotheses. Evie herself is an interesting character who becomes more intriguing over the course of the novel.With its large cast of characters and fast-paced plot, I was pleasantly surprised that I became emotionally invested in several of the characters, especially Isabeau. Morgan Stang did an outstanding job bringing each of these characters vibrantly to life and building sympathy for several of them.The fantasy world of Murder at Spindle Manor is also a treat, featuring necromancy, a variety of bizarre and frightening creatures, and a healthy dose of steampunk. There is plenty of humor here as well, such as the author including herself on the guest list at Spindle Manor.Murder at Spindle Manor has it all: mystery, fantasy, horror, comedy, and even a touch of romance.

The Dervans destroyed Volanus.”Lord of a Shattered Land is a virtuosic sword and sorcery fantasy by Howard Andrew Jones inspired by the Punic Wars. The novel’s lead protagonist, Hanuvar, is a classic good-guy hero, a legendary general committed to freeing his people from slavery after the enemy Dervans overran and obliterated his beloved city of Volanus. Hanuvar is evidently inspired by Hannibal, the famed general and statesmen who led the North African empire of Carthage against the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War (218-204 BC).Lord of a Shattered Land parallels the Punic Wars in both its basic exposition and worldbuilding: Derva is the stand-in for Rome, and across the sea, Volanus is the surrogate for Carthage. Just as the real Carthage was mercilessly destroyed by Rome during the Third Punic War, with all its inhabitants either killed or sold into slavery, Lord of a Shattered Land begins in the aftermath of utter defeat, with Volanus razed and its people killed or enslaved.Howard Andrew Jones tells Hanuvar’s story in an episodic format. The fourteen chapters of Lord of a Shattered Land act as interconnected short stories that each provide a vignette of our hero’s adventures while working together to build the overarching narrative. The structure of Lord of a Shattered Land has a definite literary feel reminiscent of David Mitchell or Yoko Ogawa. Like Mitchell, Jones leverages this episodic format to flex his narrative style, including one chapter that is told like a folktale.Howard Andrew Jones writes with precision and gravitas, giving Lord of a Shattered Land a classic historical feel. Jones makes effective use of three in-book narrators: the corpus of the novel is chronicled by Sasilos, with edits from a distant nephew and helpful footnotes by the renowned historian Silenus. Beyond the gravity of its prose, there are also plenty of touching moments:“When his vision cleared the woman was gone. All that remained was her scarf, blowing free down the mountain side.”Despite its roots in classical antiquity, Lord of a Shattered Land is an unabashed sword and sorcery novel, full of fantastical beasts. Our hero encounters terrible nocturnal avian predators known as gatzi and large dinosaur-like carnivores called tarifen. My favorite fauna are the winged serpents known as asalda. While normally humans and asalda are enemies or have a neutral relationship, the people of Volanus developed a healthy symbiotic relationship with the asalda. Altogether, Howard Andrew Jones has created the next great classic fantasy hero with Hanuvar. I especially appreciated how the stories favored Hanuvar flexing his mind over his muscles, outwitting his opponents. Lord of a Shattered Land is sword and sorcery par excellence, leveraging a literary style to build a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. The Chronicles of Hanuvar continues with The City of Marble and Blood, the second book of the series....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jan 29, 2024","Jan 29, 2024","Jan 29, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62919877-lord-of-a-shattered-land

The novel takes place at Sunshire Chateau, an enormous, labyrinthine mansion sitting atop a hill in New York state, replete with secret passages and a mysterious past. Rumored to be haunted, the estate offers the occasional tour to brave (or perhaps foolish) groups of visitors.Six Rooms opens with one such tour, featuring a hodgepodge of nosy neighbors and unsuspecting tourists. Sunshire Chateau’s unnamed tour guide is imposing and mercurial, displaying abrupt flashes of anger that show no mercy toward uncompliant guests. The tour guide keeps everyone on their toes, although not necessarily on their best behavior, with his sudden alternations between scripted history and vulgar outbursts.The Sunshire Chateau also employs a book antiquarian devoted to the meticulous study and preservation of thousands of historic and one-of-a-kind volumes contained in the sprawling mansion. Although he would rather focus on his work, the so-called “bookie” experiences much more than he bargained for in accepting this position at the Sunshire.As implied by its title, Six Rooms is structured around the exploration of six rooms inside the Sunshire Chateau. Each room leads to a ghostly encounter facilitated through a household object that contains some form of supernatural energy. Each of these encounters involves a corresponding flashback sequence featuring the Sunshire Chateau’s late owner, Charles Lester III, revealing more details of his checkered past. The plot descends further into darkness as we explore the six rooms. This progression feels akin to visiting each successive Circle of Hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. Greater wickedness is revealed at every level, and by the end Charles Lester III seems well versed in each of the deadly sins enumerated by Dante.Beyond Dante, there is also a clear influence from Edgar Allan Poe which only grows over the course of the book. Gemma Amor explores Poe’s themes of shame, loneliness, and death but with an unexpected and delightfully satisfying feminist twist. I also enjoyed how Gemma Amor ties the supernatural elements of Six Rooms back to the first law of thermodynamics, i.e., the conversation of energy. Although energy can be neither created nor destroyed, it can be converted among many forms. In Six Rooms, Amor extends this principle to the supernatural, and it works to great effect.Gemma Amor’s writing is crisp, vibrant, and polished. Amor always has a way of pulling me immediately into a story and keeping me glued to the pages till the very end, and Six Rooms is no exception.Gemma Amor never disappoints; I am delighted to recommend Six Rooms as one of my favorite haunted house horrors....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Jan 24, 2024","Jan 24, 2024","Jan 24, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58819504-six-rooms

But Ryan Kirk elevates this trope to great emotional heights as he builds the story around a widower, Kalen, and his sixteen-year-old daughter, Sascha.As the novel opens, the past comes back to haunt Kalen when he discovers the life being drained from his beloved daughter: “He gently pulled apart her eyelids. Her dark brown eyes weren’t dilated, but the light that animated them was gone.”Kalen must confront his buried past and escape with Sascha to save her life. But Sascha has a fierce independent streak with other ideas of how she would like to live her life.The loving but fraught relationship between Kalen and Sascha forms the heart of The Last Fang of God. Both characters are beautifully characterized, especially as they learn more about each other:“It forced him to consider Sascha in a new light. Mostly, he’d not tried to teach her Vilka’s runes because he was prepared for the secrets of the old wolf to die with him. But a small part of his reason was a doubt she had the patience and will necessary to make anything of his teachings. It was dangerous to dabble with the power of runes…”Sascha is still scarred by the loss of her mother and struggles with resentment toward her father:“She hated that sword, more than she’d hated the sickness that had taken Mom’s life too soon. It was a monster that had no place in this world, and Dad was a monster for wielding it.”Ryan Kirk also packs a fair amount of worldbuilding in this slim novel, including rune magic and gods who walk amongst humans. Still, I wish The Last Fang of God had been expanded so that we could learn more about the world and its lore.The Last Fang of God is a touching read, especially with respect to the father-daughter relationship at its core.

The condemned man is officially nameless, a traitor meant to be forgotten in the annals of history. However, the piercing gaze of the dying man leaves an undying impression on Gehrin.Upon returning home, Gehrin is chastised by his father, a government counselor:“A traitor must leave the earth nameless, forgotten. Yet now you will remember him.”His dreams are haunted by the specter of the dying man, and Gehrin is abducted under the cover of night, taken to a mysterious school of boys who seem to have lost their identities. Gehrin struggles to maintain his own identity in an environment that wishes to wash it away.I was particularly touched by Tori Tecken’s descriptions of young Gehrin, who feels small and wants to disappear in the face of such an imposing evil, but who also recognizes that he must make himself big to face the challenges ahead:“In the darkness of the little box bumping along some unknown road, Gehrin had never felt more like a small boy. Tears squeezed out of his eyes and dripped down his cheeks. He impatiently tried to sweep them away, but his bound hands bumped against his still tender face, and he winced. He choked back a sob, the fear and the slow torture of the lurching movements driving him further away from his determination to stay strong.”Meanwhile, in the neighboring tribal lands, we are introduced to the second lead protagonist, Syndri, the daughter of a chieftain who lives in a seemingly unending cycle of violence, killing to bring honor to her people. Syndri’s plotline is full of intense action and political manipulation that seems destined to intersect with Gehrin’s story. The latter half of The Blood Stones is full of action, and Tori Tecken has writing action scenes down to an artform.The Blood Stones is brilliantly plotted across both storylines, with perfect pacing and several unexpected twists that I did not see coming. Tori Tecken introduces elements of worldbuilding in a very natural fashion without any awkward info dumps that sometimes mar epic fantasy. She succeeds in building a complex world without ever making the reader feel overwhelmed or confused.The Blood Stones is light on magical elements with a primary emphasis on character development. Beyond Gehrin and Syndri, I also enjoyed the cast of secondary characters, especially Gehrin’s older brother, Xario, who is a more archetypal hero figure but still struggles to meet the expectations set on him:“But being almost a man was the same as still being mostly a child.”Tori Tecken writes like a seasoned veteran in epic fantasy, hooking me from the first page. Her writing is compulsively readable and polished to perfection. Tecken has a knack for writing the perfect ending to each chapter, making it virtually impossible to set the book down. In a delightful nod to classic epic fantasy, Tecken also gets bonus points for the mouthwatering descriptions of food:“The tangy lemon scent wafted between them. Gehrin inhaled a deep whiff of the kiji before biting into the soft, chewy rice cake. Mint and jasmine swirled together on his tongue, familiar and comforting.”I hope someday there will be a companion cookbook.Tecken also excels in her realistic depictions of friendship among the young cast of characters against the backdrop of a very dark world. In this regard, The Blood Stones reminds me of Mark Lawrence’s Book of the Ancestor trilogy, especially its first volume, Red Sister. Tecken also invokes a Lawrencian level of eloquence and accessibility in her approach to storytelling.As in Tecken’s recently published young adult fantasy, Phased, The Blood Stones excels in its portrayal of mental health struggles, especially related to issues of identity. The Blood Stones also explores themes of memory in a land of forgetting.The Blood Stones is epic fantasy par excellence, Tori Tecken’s love letter to the genre and a tour de force of worldbuilding and character development that will capture your imagination from the first page and keep you guessing till the very end....more",Notes are private!,2,66,1,"Jan 16, 2024","Jan 16, 2024","Jan 16, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/201921080-the-blood-stones

King Ambrosius the Ninth of Florence wages war with the neighboring city of Genova as a mysterious woman appears in a glowing gold palanquin.The visitor is Claire, a “patricia of Zanzibar” and student of metaphysics who has constructed a device that folds space and time. But everything goes wrong when she finds herself in the middle of a faraway war zone. Claire desperately wants to return to her home of Zanzibar:“I am the last daughter Reason bore; I rose from Zanzibar and to Zanzibar I must return.”Claire recognizes that she needs help from the local populace if she has any hope of returning home. She befriends Marcus Diophantus, a Florentine city man and former pickpocket who rises to become a respected military leader. Claire and Marcus work together to forge peace between Florence and Genova.Marcus also develops a romantic interest in Claire, who becomes known as the “Sower of Peace.” The relationship between these two characters is the emotional core of the novel. But the Sower of Peace becomes entangled in a web of political intrigue amid the changing power dynamics prompted by her wartime intervention.The author, Daniel Maidman, is also an artist and an art critic. His art is included in several American art museums and is part of the permanent collections at the Library of Congress Department of Prints and Drawings. Maidman brings his artistic talent to The Exile of Zanzibar with his gorgeous interior artwork, depicting several characters and scenes from the novel. While the writing could feel a bit academic at times, I found that the artwork helped establish a stronger emotional connection with the characters.Although The Exile of Zanzibar is available as an electronic book, I’d strongly recommend investing in a hardcover copy of this novel. From the exquisite artwork to the minute details of the font kerning, Daniel Maidman has paid keen attention to every aspect of this volume.Daniel Maidman’s writing is erudite but accessible, reminding me of the late Italian master, Umberto Eco. There is a gravity to Maidman’s prose that has a feel of ancient history brought to life. Maidman obviously shares Eco’s love of history and philosophy, constructing a sophisticated, labyrinthine plot worthy of Foucault’s Pendulum. Although it’s not mentioned in his biography, I wouldn’t be surprised if Daniel Maidman is also a scholar of semiotics: the detailed attention that he pays to symbols and colors throughout The Exile of Zanzibar also echoes the great Eco.The worldbuilding of The Exile of Zanzibar is essentially classical antiquity with a splash of magic and sci-fi. There is a strong military fantasy aspect of the novel, and grimdark readers will appreciate the layers of gray morality that Daniel Maidman has woven into the political fabric of the story.Overall, The Exile of Zanzibar is a meticulously crafted debut and a must-read for fans of Umberto Eco. The story will continue with Lucky Angel, the second volume of the Railroad to Zanzibar series....more",Notes are private!,2,55,1,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 12, 2024","Jan 12, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/122812214-the-exile-of-zanzibar

The Combat Codes trilogy takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where conventional warfare has been replaced by hand-to-hand combat between trained fighters known as Grievar Knights who spar on behalf of their nations. Given their critical importance to national interests, Grievar Knights receive the highest levels of training at special martial arts schools. However, some nefarious entities try to cheat the system by enhancing fighters through technology or other illicit means.The main protagonist of the Combat Codes trilogy is Cego, a diamond-in-the-rough boy who demonstrated great promise as a fighter in underground arenas. In The Combat Codes, Cego is discovered by Murray Pearson, a retired Grievar Knight with a troubled past, who assumes personal mentorship of Cego, training him to become the next champion fighter for their nation of Ezo.Much of the action of the series takes place in the Lyceum, a training school where students both native and foreign are taught to pursue excellence in martial arts, following the greater purpose of the Combat Codes, viz., avoiding war and helping their country. However, the Combat Codes might also serve as a means to control and suppress people. The first book of the trilogy, The Combat Codes, was a case of mismatched expectations for me personally. Based on the book’s description and dragon image on the cover, I was expecting the novel to be similar to Mortal Kombat in terms of its storyline and action. However, I found The Combat Codes to be much closer in spirit to The Karate Kid, with Murray Pearson playing the role of sensei and Cego serving as his protégé. Much of the book was dedicated to the psychological and philosophical aspects of martial arts and the importance of never sacrificing one’s honor. The Combat Codes also embraced many of the standard training school tropes from young adult fantasy literature, such as making friends and dealing with bullies. As a grimdark reader, The Combat Codes left me wanting something darker and more intense.I’m happy to report that Alexander Darwin gives a deeper and more mature spin on the story in Grievar’s Blood, which picks up a year or so after the events of The Combat Codes. In this second book of the series, Darwin divides point-of-view duties among three protagonists: Cego, Murray, and Cego’s good friend, Solara Halberd, or Sol for short. Sol’s storyline is a welcome addition to the book, both for improving female representation in the series and for all the raw excitement that she brings to the novel.Alexander Darwin has also matured as a writer in his sophomore effort. The characters feel more fully formed in Grievar’s Blood, and the book definitely has a more nuanced tone. There are plenty of unexpected plot twists in Grievar’s Blood, and the last page had a revelation that left me hungry to find out what happens next.The epic fight scenes are a thrill to read, with well-earned comparisons to Fonda Lee’s Jade City. Like Fonda Lee, Alexander Darwin is an accomplished martial arts master who leverages that personal experience to write very well-crafted, cinematic fight sequences. Another point of similarity is the inclusion of rocs in Grievar’s Blood, which are also the main focus of Fonda Lee’s recent novella, Untethered Sky. Overall, Alexandar Darwin has given grimdark readers a lot more to enjoy in Grievar’s Blood, with higher stakes, darker action, and a more epic scope. The Combat Codes trilogy is certainly a must-read for martial arts enthusiasts....more",Notes are private!,3,37,1,"Jan 10, 2024","Jan 10, 2024","Jan 10, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50719176-grievar-s-blood

Caplan’s frenetic grimdark novel, The Fall Is All There Is, blends fantasy and science fiction in a brutal post-apocalyptic world dripping with familial drama. The first-person protagonist, Petre, is the youngest among quadruplets, born just minutes following his older siblings, Anoïse, Edgar, and Desmon. The death of their ruling father sets off a battle of succession that takes sibling rivalry to a whole new level. Petre is a junkie of sorts, taking frequent Intramuscular Memory Injections and walking a thin line between maintaining basic human functioning and experiencing a terrifying overdose: “…without Intramuscular Memory Injections I wasn’t even able to achieve basic competency in anything involving fighting, riding, sword work, sneaking, or court etiquette.”Petre is impulsive to a fault and doesn’t hesitate to take extreme measures. He is also neurodivergent and struggles to understand people’s emotions and the subtext of conversations:“I winced. I’d never been as good at navigating this world of double meanings as my siblings. They’d all found ways to adapt to it, and while I could manage it with the people I didn’t like much, I hated being so indirect with people I cared about.”Although it’s difficult being trapped in Petre’s mind for the duration of The Fall Is All There Is, C.M. Caplan’s vibrant writing perfectly captures the mental anarchy of his protagonist. Caplan also shines in writing fight scenes, and The Fall Is All There Is also features plenty of grimdark action.The Fall Is All There Is feels like Prince of Thorns on acid. Both C.M. Caplan’s SPFBO9 finalist and Mark Lawrence’s debut novel are told from the tunnel vision of an exceedingly violent, emotionally damaged protagonist with major family issues. Both novels skillfully combine fantasy and science fiction in the aftermath of apocalypse. However, in C.M. Caplan’s case, the world is technically post-post-apocalyptic, having suffered a First Annihilation caused by magic and a Second Annihilation caused by technology:“After the First Annihilation, the survivors built strange tech on top of the arcane landscapes left behind. Until they got so good at it that they, too, blasted themselves back to the stone age, in the Second Annihilation. The tech they’d left behind died with all knowledge of how to use it.”Although the chaos of The Fall Is All There Is felt a bit too much to handle at times, overall this is a highly worthwhile read and definitely recommended for grimdark fans....more",Notes are private!,5,57,1,"Jan 07, 2024","Jan 07, 2024","Jan 07, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/77779740-the-fall-is-all-there-is

But the stress of fatherhood seems to be taking a toll on Denny as he starts hallucinating about his estranged stepfather everywhere he goes. Denny even finds himself looking more and more like Frank when examining his reflection in the mirror. After Frank ends up dead, Denny is kidnapped and held hostage by his psychotic half-sister, Jade, who tortures Denny for information and suspects that he may have murdered her father.House of Bad Memories is completely unhinged. If you are a reader who checks trigger warnings, then this novel is not for you. I’ve never seen so many sadists gathered together in one book, all more than happy to torture or humiliate the perpetually confused and increasingly delirious Denny. When I thought Denny’s situation couldn’t get any worse, Michael David Wilson ratchets up the gore to retch-inducing levels.Somehow this works because all the violence in House of Bad Memories is balanced by a wicked sense of humor that reminded me a bit of The Handyman Method by Nick Cutter and Andrew F. Sullivan. This is a difficult balance to achieve, and Michael David Wilson pulls it off brilliantly.In between all the torture and morbid humor, House of Bad Memories addresses a number of interesting themes, including the emotional extremes that people can reach in their personal relationships. House of Bad Memories magnifies these emotions to unsettling levels, taking our human imperfections to irrational levels.Michael David Wilson also strikes a perfect balance between physical and psychological elements of horror. The reader experiences the same disorientation as Denny, uncertain of who is dead and who is living. Wilson builds the suspense until the very last brutal sentence.Overall, House of Bad Memories explodes with physical and emotional wreckage and is not for the faint of heart.

Fletcher and Anna Smith Spark, join forces on In the Shadow of their Dying, the most anticipated new grimdark novella of 2024.Tash is the third-best assassin in a city under siege, within a week of being conquered by an invading army. Although there is not much demand for assassins in the midst of all-out war, Tash is hired by a mercenary leader, Pitt, to end the siege by killing their own king and fleeing the city toward the safety of the south.But Tash encounters an unexpected problem when he crosses paths with a demon, Iananr the Bound One, occupying a woman’s body. Iananr thrives on blood and destruction and has sworn to defend the king in order to maximize bloodshed. But what Iananr really desires is freedom from her bondage.Michael R. Fletcher and Anna Smith Spark’s unique voices both shine in alternating point-of-view chapters. Fletcher holds nothing back with his fierce prose and incisive humor. Anna Smith Spark shines with the voice she has given to Iananr. Her writing is so darkly poetic, with a rhythmic cadence that I couldn’t help but read aloud:“But the dead… the dead… She had swum through them without feeling. Her molten tears eating into rotted skin. Her touch a corrosion, left them ragged. Skin and bones fretted, filigreed, fine-finger-spun cobwebbed lace. They stumbled after her, reaching. Yearned for her, as she yearned fearful hopeful longing for the thing Tash. The rustle they made around her a comfort. The sounds of bodies broken that was the sound of her world snatched from her.”Fletcher and Smith Spark have crafted a menacing, mystical, and labyrinthine feel in In the Shadow of their Dying that evokes the best of Gustav Meyrink, specifically his masterwork, The Golem. I especially enjoyed reading overlapping scenes from both human and demon perspectives.In the Shadow of their Dying is full of unexpected twists and turns as Tash, Pitt, and Iananr grapple to gain the upper hand. All of this is set against the backdrop of a war with mass, indiscriminate casualties, where true victory may be unattainable. The story also features plenty of necromancy, blurring the line between the living and the dead.The Dripping Bucket, Michael R. Fletcher’s interdimensional grimdark tavern, features prominently throughout In the Shadow of their Dying. The sights, sounds, and smells of the Dripping Bucket are exactly what you would expect from Fletcher’s infamous pub. Let’s just say that it’s a health inspector’s worst nightmare. There are also several more subtle allusions to previous works by both Fletcher and Smith Spark, which longtime readers will enjoy.In the Shadow of their Dying is a masterclass in grimdark fantasy from two of the most distinguished authors in the genre. This is an expertly crafted novella, featuring some of the most vibrant writing and character work from both Michael R. Fletcher and Anna Smith Spark.

The heroine of the story, Asha, is a fugitive engineer thousands of years in the future, long after humanity has destroyed Earth and colonized other planets. Asha is astonished to learn that she has a long-lost sister who has been captured by the emperor and imprisoned in an imperial jail. Asha’s quest to rescue her sister has dire consequences for the entire universe.The second lead protagonist in The Principle of Moments is the time-traveling Obi, who was abandoned by his father at only eight years old. Obi’s story begins in 1812 in Regency-era London, centering on his relationship with Prince George, the fictitious son of Prince Regent (later King) George IV and grandson of King George III.Prince George comes from a rather sorry line of monarchs. His grandfather, George III, is most noted for losing the American colonies, while his father, George IV, pursued a leisurely life of fiscal extravagance, without any true accomplishments to his name. Young Prince George finds himself lost, and unfortunately also shares his father’s addiction to laudanum. His greatest hope for meaning rests in his romance with Obi.Kudos to Jikiemi-Pearson for making a queer, interracial relationship a focal point of the novel, especially one set in the early nineteenth century and across such a major class divide. I immediately connected with both Obi and George: their relationship is one of the highlights of the novel. There is also an element of suspense as the mysterious character named Alarick pursues Obi and the fragment of his soul that he left with George.The Principle of Moments touches on a number of serious issues, including slavery, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, but it doesn’t probe any of them in great depth. The tone of the book stays remarkably upbeat throughout, focusing on the fast-paced action and relationships among the various characters.Although there are plenty of sci-fi elements to The Principle of Moments, this is primarily a relationship-driven novel. The relationships between Asha and Obi, Obi and George, and Asha and her sister are all wonderfully developed and kept me glued to the pages. While I immediately connected with Obi and George, the relationships involving Asha took a longer time to build. But the buildup is definitely worth it, as the story grows to an outstanding climax that leaves a big emotional impact on the reader.I also enjoyed the epigraphs at the end (rather than the beginning) of each chapter. Many of these are quotes from the Archivist, a character who is more than meets the eye:“Archivist’s Note: You must excuse my poetic license. Artistic liberty is something I am rarely afforded, and this tale begs to be transformed into scripture; everything about it is epic.”Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson’s writing can only be described as jubilant. This is an author who clearly had the time of her life writing this novel. Her genuine excitement for the story pops off every page.

Something they’ve never had before: a place where they belong. A land to call home. And a royal lineage of their own.”Pity the orc, misunderstood and maligned. John A. Douglas offers a more sympathetic view of orc-kind in his debut epic fantasy, The Black Crown.The world of The Black Crown is populated by the traditional set of fantasy races: elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, goblins, and trolls. Oh, and orcs…a cacophonous orchestra of orcs.The novel opens at the end of the Orc Wars. The orcs have been defeated, slaughtered by the thousands as their city is burned to the ground.The main protagonist of The Black Crown is Prince Ragoth, a half-orc child of a human queen and an infamous orc warlord. Being a green-skinned half-orc is not helpful for fitting in with one’s peers.Ragoth knows nothing about his father’s side of the family aside from the degrading textbook descriptions:“The Orc is feral and beast-like in nature. Its tongue is harshly spoken, broken into simple terms for the Orc is a simple creature. It is prone to fits of rage and thrives in an environment of constant conflict. It lacks the ability to reason. It delights in violence and will attack anything it sees—even its own kind. What semblances of humanity or civilized behavior it displays are a crude imitation of what it witnesses in human, dwarvish, elvish kind.”The Black Crown is a coming-of-age tale as Ragoth seeks to reconnect with the paternal side of his family and prove his royal birth. Ragoth travels with a party of adventurers including a veteran explorer past her prime, a foulmouthed farm boy, and a kindly elvish friend. The Black Crown is a quest story with a classic Dungeons & Dragons feel. Ragoth’s journey covers themes of self-discovery, found family, and overcoming prejudice, but never in a heavy-handed fashion.Aside from its 653-page count, there is nothing heavy about this book. There is no need to be intimidated by the size of this chonker: the pages fly by fast with John A. Douglas’s accessible, unpretentious writing style and fun adventure story.There are also plenty of humorous moments in The Black Crown that brought a smile to my face:“Even in her disheveled state, she was a woman of striking beauty—for a human.”Although there are a few dark moments, the overwhelming mood of The Black Crown is one of optimism. Ragoth is such a likeable character: who doesn’t love a misfit hero with a can-do attitude? To me, reading The Black Crown was a welcome palate cleanser between my usual diet of soul-crushing grimdark and horror.Overall, The Black Crown is a fun and exciting adventure story and a proficient debut from author John A. Douglas. The Black Crown is highly recommended for fans of classic D&D-inspired fantasy and anyone looking for enjoyable escapism....more",Notes are private!,2,38,1,"Dec 25, 2023","Dec 25, 2023","Dec 25, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/201534429-the-black-crown

Initially self-published, Senlin Ascends is one of the greatest success stories from Mark Lawrence’s Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO) competition, achieving widespread critical and popular acclaim.The lead protagonist of the book is Thomas Senlin, a recently married headmaster who plans a honeymoon at the Tower of Babel with his beloved bride, Marya. Senlin prides himself on his knowledge of the Tower, accumulated through years of scholarly study. But he is woefully unprepared for the chaotic reality of life in and around this architectural marvel.Senlin’s honeymoon turns into a Kafkaesque nightmare as he immediately loses his wife at the crowded bazaar outside the Tower. The bulk of Senlin Ascends is devoted to our hero’s search for Marya, believing that she will meet him at the famed third-floor baths, where they had intended to spend most of their honeymoon.The Tower of Babel itself is massive, significantly larger and taller than any skyscraper from our own time. The outer wall alone is a quarter-mile thick, and no one is quite sure about the exact height of the Tower. The Tower itself is constructed like an enormous labyrinth, giving it the feel of a verticalized version of “The Library of Babel” concocted by Jorge Luis Borges.In Senlin Ascends, the Tower of Babel is divided into levels called “ringdoms,” each with its own distinct culture, economy, and politics. In terms of literary structure, Josiah Bancroft draws a clear inspiration from Italo Calvino’s classic Invisible Cities, in that each ringdom evokes a different aspect of our greater human civilization, and we must put these pieces together to construct the whole picture. The absurdities and baffling bureaucracies that Senlin encounters at each stage of his journey are also reminiscent of The Castle by Franz Kafka. Part of the thrill of reading Senlin Ascends is making sense out of the chaos and finding the greater purpose of the seemingly random events happening throughout the tower.Senlin is an outstanding protagonist. His passivity and naïveté at the beginning of the novel gradually give way to a more active understanding of what he must do to retrieve his beloved Marya. But he always maintains the good-natured core of his personality, never acquiescing completely to the corrupting influence of the Tower. While other inhabitants of the Tower look out only for themselves, lying and cheating their way through each day, Senlin has a refreshing honesty and authenticity to his character. I love how he always believes the best in others, even when they don’t deserve that trust.Senlin reminds me a lot of Toru Okada, the similarly timid and naïve protagonist of The Wind-up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami. While Senlin and Okada spend their respective stories in search of their missing wives, these also end up being journeys of self-discovery. In a nice touch, Josiah Bancroft even includes a direct allusion to Murakami’s work in the latter part of Senlin Ascends.Beyond Senlin, Senlin Ascends also has an excellent cast of side characters who float in and out of the main story. I particularly enjoyed Edith, a beacon of feminism in a world where women are terribly oppressed. Edith’s displays of courage and resilience will stay with me long after I’ve closed the back cover of the book.The worldbuilding of Senlin Ascends has obvious Biblical roots, but with a steampunk flair. What if the Tower of Babel, as described in the Book of Genesis, survived long enough to see airships, steam engines, and electricity? I thoroughly enjoyed Josiah Bancroft’s fanciful melding of antiquity and modernity throughout the novel. Bancroft’s elegant but accessible prose is also a perfect fit for this world, with an understated tone that matches Senlin’s personality.Altogether, Senlin Ascends has established itself as one of the greatest works of modern fantasy—a book that undoubtedly will be enjoyed by readers and analyzed in university classrooms for decades to come. The Books of Babel continues with Arm of the Sphinx and The Hod King, ultimately concluding with The Fall of Babel....more",Notes are private!,6,85,1,"Feb 04, 2024","Feb 18, 2024","Dec 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35271523-senlin-ascends

Marki is summoned by hospice caretakers to comfort patients during their last moments, especially those without any close friends or family members.An occupation as morbid as death doula doesn’t lend itself to carefree dinner conversation. Marki’s girlfriend, Paula, can no longer stand this perpetual cloud of death casting a shadow over their relationship. Marki is devastated by the breakup but copes by throwing herself deeper into her work, bringing heartfelt care and compassion to each of her patients.The main story of The Death Doula begins on a requisite dark and stormy night as Marki is called to guide a dying man, Franklin Singleton, into the great beyond. Franklin, or Lin for short, is in terrible condition, filthy and appearing much older than his seventy-eight years.Although Lin warns Marki that she should leave his home to escape an unspeakable evil, it may already be too late for her:“Not the devil, girl. He’s what waits under the devil’s bed. He’s what the devil has nightmares about. He’s the thing that reaches out for you when you are helpless, hopeless, and want to die. The thing that beckons you to jump off cliffs or run your wrist along the edge of a knife. He’s who grows fat with pain and hate and rage and bleakness.”In addition to the present-day narrative, The Death Doula has flashback chapters for Lin to recount his backstory, including a deeply disturbed childhood with a father for whom “abusive” would be much too light of a word.The pacing in The Death Doula is spot-on, with plenty of unexpected scares and nary a dull moment. Ali Seay’s crisp prose adeptly conveys the intensity of the story as it builds to its astonishing climax.All in all, Ali Seay breathes new life into the familiar haunted house trope. The Death Doula is an expertly crafted tale of horror that left me guessing till the end.

Stuart’s Drowned Kingdom Saga, which is inspired by the mythology of Atlantis. The events of Book Four are destined to change everything for our protagonist, Othrun, the former prince of a sunken island kingdom who has established a new realm on foreign soil. I will keep this  completely spoiler-free for readers who have not yet started this excellent grimdark fantasy series, which began with A Drowned Kingdom and continued with The Last of the Atalanteans and Lord and King.A Lion’s Pride introduces a new point-of-view character, Rupaa, a feared pirate and warrior who offers a third-person perspective from another culture. Although I am inherently resistant to the incorporation of new point-of-view characters this late in a series, P.L. Stuart ensures that the investment pays off well with an earthshattering reveal later in the book.Soon we are back in familiar territory with Othrun’s first-person narration, where we spend the vast majority of the novel. No worries if it’s been a while since you’ve read Lord and King: P.L. Stuart naturally immerses the reader back into the story, catching us up on key events from the first three volumes.I’m not sure if the seven volumes of the Drowned Kingdom Saga are meant to align with the Seven Deadly Sins, but if they did, Book Four would certainly be dedicated to lust. A Lion’s Pride is a spicy book, with Othrun pursuing several romantic entanglements against his better judgment.Othrun is a walking contradiction: nominally a prude but unable to resist temptations of the flesh. Despite his own misogynistic views, Othrun seems inevitably drawn to strong, independent women. However, I think the more interesting question is why these women—all possessing powerful magic—would be attracted to a man who is so condescending toward them.With this heavy focus on Othrun’s lustful pursuits, A Lion’s Pride feels a bit off balance compared to the previous volumes of the series, especially since Othrun’s dalliances are described in explicit detail, too much for my own tastes. Fortunately, these plot lines are interwoven with plenty of political intrigue as well as questions about Othrun’s lineage and claim to the throne.Given all this court intrigue, A Lion’s Pride feels like the most Arthurian installment yet in P.L. Stuart’s series, with Lysi playing the role of the seductress witch, Morgan le Fay. With his penchant for self-sabotage and internal contradictions, Othrun embodies the dual role of both Arthur and Lancelot.Religion continues to be a dominant theme throughout A Lion’s Pride, with Othrun believing he is on a divine mission to convert pagans of his adopted land to the monotheistic beliefs of his Single God. Othrun’s religious intolerance is on full display throughout the novel. The cultural clashes and political maneuverings eventually culminate in an epic battle scene toward the end of the book, which had me on the edge of my seat. Although Othrun is a despicable and frustrating character, I do believe he is on a slow redemption arc. One of P.L. Stuart’s overarching themes is the power of redemption: anyone can change for the better, even those who seem beyond hope.Overall, A Lion’s Pride cements Othrun as one of the most complex and well-realized grimdark protagonists in recent memory. P.L. Stuart has certainly earned his stripes as one of Grimdark Magazine’s Rising Stars in Dark and Grimdark SFF.

It unlocked something in your brain that you didn't know existed, and nine times out of ten you found yourself grateful to the person responsible for its undoing.”The Last Haunt by Max Booth III is a chilling novella about an extreme haunted house known as McKinley Manor. Located in the small town of Pork Basket, Texas, visitors to McKinley Manor are willingly subjected to physical and psychological torture by its sadistic owner, Gus McKinley, and his band of pillowcase-wearing minions.The blood-curdling screams emanating from McKinley Manor obviously raise concerns among the neighbors, who are quick to call the cops:“I found a woman, chains wrapped around her wrists, hanging her from the ceiling. I found a man with a pillowcase over his head, eye holes crudely cut in the middle of the fabric. He was standing behind her, holding a mini chainsaw in one hand and a melting popsicle in the other.”The novella is based on the real-life McKamey Manor, known as America’s most extreme haunted house. Proprietor Russ McKamey livestreams footage of his visitors being waterboarded, drugged, forced to drink vomit, or worse, to his closed Facebook group. McKamey accepts dog food as payment from his visitors, promising a substantial cash prize for anyone who can finish the full experience. (No one ever has.)The setup for The Last Haunt is essentially identical to the real-life McKamey Manor but with the names changed to Gus McKinley and McKinley Manor. Although Gus also requires dog food as payment, he doesn’t own any dogs (due to allergies) and donates the dog food to a local animal shelter.Given the close parallels between The Last Haunt and the actual McKamey Manor, I was ready to write this off as a well-written but predictable horror. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Max Booth III takes the true horrors of McKamey Manor and escalates them to terrifying new levels in The Last Haunt.The Last Haunt is told as an oral history with accounts from witnesses, family members, neighbors, and associates after the so-called McKinley Manor massacre that occurred one tragic Halloween. Piecing together information from these various perspectives, the reader slowly stitches together what may or may not be the full story of that fateful night. I devoured this novella in a single sitting, becoming increasingly engrossed and repulsed as the events of the story unfolded. The oral history format adopted by Max Booth III gripped me throughout the book, as he masterfully guides the reader from the believable to the unimaginable.The Last Haunt is highly recommended for haunted house enthusiasts and anyone looking for a good scare. I look forward to reading more from Max Booth III in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Dec 15, 2023","Dec 15, 2023","Dec 15, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/199010486-the-last-haunt

Each person is a strand of story.”I stumbled upon a signed, limited edition copy of Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman during a lunch at Webster’s Bookstore Café in State College, Pennsylvania. I wish I could say I found the book, but the truth is that the book found me.Anansi Boys is the American Gods spinoff I didn’t know I needed. Although it’s been many years since I read American Gods, Neil Gaiman immediately caught me in this web of a tale, a contemporary low fantasy steeped in West African folklore.Why are there so many trickster gods? Whether it’s the Norse god Loki, the Greek goddess Eris, or the Monkey King from Chinese mythology, it seems like every pantheon has a resident trickster. While I’ve personally grown weary of this trope, Neil Gaiman successfully converted this unbelieving arachnophobe into a fan of Anansi, the West African spider god of mischief.We already met Anansi as “Mr. Nancy” in American Gods. Unfortunately for Mr. Nancy, he expires fairly quickly in Anansi Boys, and in a rather embarrassing fashion, leaving behind two sons who never knew each other:“Of course, everyone’s parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassment, shame, and mortification should their parents so much as speak to them on the street.”Charles Nancy, dubbed “Fat Charlie” by his father, didn’t inherit any of his dad’s divine powers. He works at a boring job in a shady investment firm in London and is preparing, rather unenthusiastically, to be married to his girlfriend Rosie.But Charlie’s life is shaken up when his brother, Spider, enters his life. Spider shares his father’s mischievous nature and magical powers. He assumes Charlie’s identity—just for fun—inadvertently ruining his job and stealing his girlfriend in the process.Charlie must seek supernatural help to fight back against Spider and reclaim his life. However, the help he receives may be more than he bargained for, as a spider’s natural enemy threatens even his own life.Neil Gaiman proves once again to be a master storyteller with Anansi Boys, a delightful tale that is full of heart. My only regret is that the story took this long to find me....more",Notes are private!,4,75,1,"Jan 21, 2024","Jan 27, 2024","Dec 12, 2023",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2744.Anansi_Boys

Named for the jagged shape of the range’s fifty-seven peaks, these remote mountains might also be home to a fabled beast of the same name.The lead protagonist, Taryn, takes her first solo trek through the Sawtooth Range under unhappy circumstances, viz., scattering the ashes of her wife, Gemma, in a secluded lake. But honoring her late wife’s final wish proves to be more disconcerting than expected, as Taryn finds an assortment of bones—possibly human—in the otherwise beautifully clear lake.Taryn’s journey in Sawtooth becomes increasingly perilous as she suffers injury and ultimately discovers the true nature of the novella’s eponymous beast. (It’s not what you think.)The Sawtooth Range provides the perfect setting for this adventure. The natural beauty of the mountainous scenery is juxtaposed with the fear of what’s lurking in the great unknown.Steph Nelson alternates Taryn’s present-day narrative with flashbacks of her relationship with Gemma, including both the happy times together as well as their struggles. While Gemma was always drawn toward a rural life in the mountains, Taryn preferred to pursue her career aspirations in the bustle of Boise.The most touching scenes involved Gemma receiving her terminal diagnosis and Taryn’s subsequent struggle with setting her priorities right. Steph Nelson captured my heart with both of these characters. The ending of the novella is quite emotional, hitting extra hard because of the relationship drama in the flashback sequences.Steph Nelson’s prose in Sawtooth is as incisive as the title would imply. Her writing is so polished that I was surprised to learn this is her debut novella. Nelson strikes the perfect balance between the tragedy faced by Taryn and Gemma in their personal relationship and then the physical manifestation of that horror. Nelson’s pacing is also spot-on, building up to a climax that I won’t soon forget. Overall, Sawtooth will sink its teeth into you from the first page, taking you on a harrowing journey that is well worth the trip.

The occupying Egril forces impose rigid martial law on Jia, forcing the defeated Jians to worship their god of darkness, Kage.The second book of the series, A Fool’s Hope, finds our protagonists gathering strength to resist the Egril invaders. The final war known as Sekanowari arrives in Until the Last, the concluding volume of the trilogy. Like its predecessor, Until the Last is primarily a character-driven novel that revolves around the relationship between two lead protagonists: Zorique, the orphaned queen of Jia, and her emotionally troubled surrogate mother, Tinnstra.The Last War trilogy is full of great characters. Tinnstra and Zorique are my two absolute favorites, both overcoming indescribable tragedies to become the reluctant heroes needed by their people. Other returning favorites include Yas, the single mother who transforms into a powerful gangster boss, and the aged general Jax who suffers from a terrible inner demon. I especially enjoyed Jax’s character arc in Until the Last, which takes an unexpectedly dark turn.As in A Fool’s Hope, Mike Shackle introduces several new point-of-view characters in this final volume of the trilogy. I have an immediate negative reaction whenever new point-of-view characters are introduced in later volumes of a series, since all I want is to spend more time with the characters I already know. Perhaps this is just lingering trauma from reading George R.R. Martin’s unnecessarily bloated A Feast for Crows, where every side character seems to get their own perspective and backstory. Although Until the Last also feels a bit bloated, Mike Shackle manages this balance a lot better than George R.R. Martin, never losing focus on the main narrative.Mike Shackle’s writing feels crisp and tight throughout the entire trilogy, and I think he has elevated his craft to a new level in Until the Last. Although the story is undeniably brutal, I also appreciated Mike Shackle’s sense of humor evident in both the freewheeling Captain Ralasis and in the author’s rather extensive use of tuckerization. Mike Shackle is especially good at writing fight scenes, with plenty of action that kept me fully fixated until the last page.Although We Are the Dead is rather light on magic, magical elements become dramatically more prevalent in A Fool’s Hope, to the point where two of the main characters felt, perhaps, too superpowered by the end of the book. However, in Until the Last, we learn that these magical powers come with a heavy cost.Given the World War II inspiration for much of the Last War trilogy, I wonder if acquiring these overwhelming magical abilities could be analogous to the nuclear arms race that occurred on both sides of the war, ultimately leading to the development of weapons with unprecedented capacity for destruction. One point that becomes clear throughout Until the Last is that these magical powers do nothing to correct the faults in our human nature.Altogether, the Last War trilogy sets a new standard for grimdark military fantasy. Mike Shackle’s worldbuilding, writing, and character development are all top-notch. Most of all, I am touched by Shackle’s focus on the humanity behind the unspeakable violence and tragedy of war.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Nov 03, 2023","Nov 24, 2023","Nov 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57343006-until-the-last

Tolkien’s influence is evident throughout The Way of Edan, starting with the circuitous path taken by Philip Chase toward publication of his debut. Following in Tolkien’s footsteps, Chase first established himself as a prominent medievalist and professor of English before devoting many years to develop his own fantasy world, Eormenlond. Like Middle-earth, Eormenlond feels fully realized, with The Way of Edan only scratching the surface of its history and lore.Chase also shares Tolkien’s love of the Old English epic poem, Beowulf, which Tolkien translated into modern English in the 1920s. Chase describes Beowulf as a lamentation for the past: “It’s about how the things that are so precious to us in the present moment won’t always be around — the people we are with and the things we surround ourselves with. There is a kind of impermanence to life, which is what makes it precious.” This sentiment also pervades The Lord of the Rings, and Chase has captured the same feeling with sorrowful beauty throughout The Way of Edan.Like The Lord of the Rings, Chase’s novel is epic in scope but has a personal feel. Chase smoothly shifts third person narration among several point of view characters in The Way of Edan, seeing the world through their eyes and helping the reader develop strong attachments to each of the main characters.The time and care that Chase has spent writing The Way of Edan is evident throughout the novel. The Way of Edan is the most perfectly conceived and executed debut fantasy that I have read since The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

The scenes of magic instilled a sense of awe and mysticism that recalled the first time I read The Lord of the Rings as a child. There is a strong overlap between magic and religion in The Way of Edan, but religion does not have a monopoly on the magical arts.The Way of Edan is surprisingly dark. Chase grabbed my attention from the opening prologue, giving realistic depictions of religious zealotry and violence. There are also a number of truly terrifying creatures dwelling in Eormenlond. Chase maintains an even pacing throughout the novel, introducing characters and worldbuilding in a natural fashion.

More like the book that broke my brain and shattered my soul.Mark Lawrence strikes the perfect balance between intellect and heart in this second volume of his Library Trilogy, which began with last year’s highly acclaimed The Book That Wouldn’t Burn. Although The Book That Broke the World follows several major plot twists from the end of the first book, I promise to keep this  completely spoiler-free for readers who have not yet started the trilogy.The Library Trilogy revolves around the Athenaeum, the legendary library instituted by Irad, the grandson of Cain and the great-grandson of Adam and Eve. While Adam and Eve committed the first sin by disobeying God and eating fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge, Cain took sin to the next level by murdering his brother in a fit of jealous rage. Following the family tradition, Irad argued bitterly with his own brother, Jaspeth, who believed Irad’s library to be a temple glorifying the original sin of knowledge and was determined to tear it down.Subsequent generations have inherited this struggle between Irad and Jaspeth as an epic battle between knowledge and ignorance, a war that is happening all around us today, tearing families and societies apart. The Library has become a literal and figurative battleground over who controls access to knowledge or whether information should be passed down at all:“An ideological war between those who believe the library should serve as a kind of universal memory. A memory we can easily access after we obliterate ourselves, which is something we appear to do on a regular basis as soon as we discover the means to do it efficiently. And, on the other side, those who believe we should start from scratch each time. Those who think that the handful of ignorant children who survive the periodic calamities should start again in a place like this. Banging the rocks together.”In The Book That Broke the World, the Library is an endlessly large labyrinth of information containing the collective memory of humankind and other intelligent species. The Library warps space and time in ways that are only starting to become clear to the protagonists of the story.Enter Livira, an irrepressible young woman who, like the resilient weed for which she is named, simply cannot be kept down. Despite coming from an impoverished background and suffering unspeakable tragedy as a young girl, Livira overcomes the odds to become a librarian in the bustling Crath City.The second lead protagonist is Evar, a young man who grew up trapped in the Library, surrounded by impossibly tall towers of books, with only his four adopted siblings as companions. The Library children were raised by two android-like figures known as the Assistant and the Soldier.While Evar and Livira’s stories pick up immediately following the shocking conclusion of the first book, The Book That Broke the World actually begins with a new point-of-view character, Celcha, who was born into slavery alongside her brother, Hellet. While excavating at the Athran dig, the slaves discover a long-lost trove of books. Echoing the Adam and Eve narrative, Hellet is punished severely for opening one of these books, since knowledge is forbidden to the slaves. Celcha and Hellet are also haunted by two ghostlike figures, who might provide a path toward salvation. Mark Lawrence takes the time for readers to establish an emotional connection with Celcha and Hellet before switching back to the characters we already know and love.Arpix, the intensely serious librarian who tutored Livira in The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, also gets point-of-view privileges in this second book of the series. His lively young apprentice always had a way of testing his patience:“Arpix led them through the bean fields where he had spent so many months pulling strands of questing livira from the ground.”I love how Arpix develops as a character in The Book That Broke the World, especially as his path intersects that of Evar’s siblings, who also get more page time in this second volume. Evar’s volatile sister, Clovis, is a particular highlight, developing a great deal of depth in The Book That Broke the World.Other returning favorites include Yute, the deputy head librarian whose daughter has been lost in the Library for over a decade, and Malar, the grizzled veteran with a tough exterior, wicked sense of humor, and heart of gold. But the real scene-stealer is Wentworth, Yute’s feline of unusual size who, much to my delight, plays a supersized role in The Book That Broke the World:“Tell us about this Wentworth. It seems a formidable weapon.”And then there’s King Oanold, the thin-skinned monarch who values affirmation over true knowledge and will never admit defeat:“Lost to dog soldiers? No, child, we’re going back. My throne’s secure. You’ve fallen for the big lie.”As in The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, the worldbuilding incorporates both humans and caniths, a race whom King Oanold derogatively dubs “dog soldiers.” The Book That Broke the World also features another species called ganar, a race of furry, intelligent beings whose civilization has had its own magnificent rise and collapse. Ganar are described as resembling small, furry bears; in my mind, I picture them like Ewoks from Return of the Jedi.As always, Mark Lawrence is a master of blending fantasy and science fiction. Normally the fantasy part comes to the foreground, with a sci-fi foundation hiding just beneath the surface, e.g., as in the post-apocalyptic Broken Empire and Red Queen’s War trilogies, where remnants of lost technology are viewed as magical. Lawrence explores a heavier sci-fi focus in his more recent series, including the Impossible Times trilogy, a pure sci-fi featuring D&D-playing teens in Thatcher-era England, and the Book of the Ice trilogy, which has a strong steampunk (or icepunk) flair.The Library Trilogy is Mark Lawrence’s most balanced effort yet between fantasy and science fiction. Although many of the sci-fi elements were already evident in The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, these are brought even more to the surface in The Book That Broke the World, often to dizzying effect.As in Limited Wish, the middle volume of his Impossible Times trilogy, there is a paradox at the center of The Book That Broke the World:“There is a book that is also a loop. A book that has swallowed its own tale. It is a ring, a cycle, burning through the years, spreading cracks through time, fissures that reach into its past and future. And through those cracks things that have no business in the world of flesh can escape.”Following this paradox, The Book That Broke the World seems to expand along multiple dimensions and then ingeniously fold in on itself.The Book That Broke the World addresses philosophical questions while delivering plenty of fast-paced action. Some of the recurring antagonists are the skeer, insectoid creatures that come in both flying and running varieties. The intense level of action here reminds me of that in Grey Sister, the second volume of Lawrence’s much-loved Book of the Ancestor trilogy.As in The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, every chapter of The Book That Broke the World begins with a clever and beautifully written epigraph. Mark Lawrence demonstrates a lyrical wit that would make even the dour and disapproving Vladimir Nabokov smile:“One fine day Truth met with Lies upon a mountainside with all of Hantalon spread beneath them: field, and town, and city stretching to the sparkle of the sea. With a disapproving frown, Truth asked of Lies how many she had slain. And true to her nature she answered with a lie. ‘More than you, brother.’ –The Basics of Deductive Logic, by I.P. Franchise”The Book That Broke the World has plenty of Easter eggs for the seasoned Mark Lawrence fan, including many obscure references to his other work. Those of you playing “I Spy a Taproot” will also be duly rewarded in The Book That Broke the World.This brings me to the ending. I’ve read close to two thousand books during my lifetime, and I’ve never seen an ending like this. Most novels are largely derivative, employing similar character archetypes, plot structures, narrative motifs, etc., as those written before. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that: it’s just very difficult to write something truly new. But Mark Lawrence does exactly that with The Book That Broke the World, culminating with an ending that left me intellectually and emotionally destroyed in ways I never knew possible.Mark Lawrence has crafted a tale that is novel in the truest sense of the word. The Book That Broke the World is a triumph of imagination and a deeply thought-provoking meditation on the nature of memory, the value of knowledge, and the degree of self-determination we may or may not have in our lives.Do we write our own stories or are they written for us? I, for one, couldn’t be happier that Mark Lawrence has written this masterpiece for us all....more",Notes are private!,18,218,1,"Dec 26, 2023","Feb 14, 2024","Nov 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/157031755-the-book-that-broke-the-world

This year’s anthology, officially titled The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4), is actually Guran’s fourteenth entry in the series, having restarted the numbering after switching to a new publisher (Pyr Books) four years ago.Across her prolific career, Paula Guran has published over fifty anthologies in fantasy, science fiction, and horror. She is a two-time winner of the Bram Stoker Award and two-time nominee of the World Fantasy Award. With Paula Guran as editor, you know it will be a top-quality collection.The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4) kicks off with “Shadow Plane,” Fran Wilde’s story of the physical and psychological isolation of two travelers stranded on a mountain that doesn’t appear on any map. The story is masterfully written and reads like an alpine version of The Blair Witch Project.The next story, “The Dyer and the Dressmakers” by Bindia Persaud, is a subtle but unsettling tale, full of enchanting colors, where dying and dyeing are more than just homophones.It seems inevitable that at least one of the stories in The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror would be a repeat from another collection that I’ve read. That story for me is the wickedly horrific “Wet Red Grin” by Gemma Files, which I also ed as part of Ellen Datlow’s outstanding anthology, Screams from the Dark . Personally, I enjoyed revisiting this masterful story set in a nursing home during the real-life horror of the COVID-19 pandemic.Next up is “The Lending Library of Final Lines,” a dark fantasy by Octavia Cade about a magical book that can pull readers into the story when the pages are eaten. The setup of this story reminded me of The Book Eaters by Sunyi Dean.Stephen Graham Jones is always a delight, and “Men, Women and Chainsaws” doesn’t disappoint. His contribution to The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4) has a classic horror feel and is inspired by the ultraviolent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.The shortest story in The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4), “The Woman Who Married the Minotaur” by Angela Slatter, is brief but fun. The story is exactly what you would think based on the title.Probably my favorite story in the collection is “The Voice of a Thousand Years” by Fawaz Al Matrouk. This story is both a philosophical tour de force and a deeply emotional tale of an old man who discovers spiritual transference.I also thoroughly enjoyed “Bonesoup” by Eugenia Triantafyllou, about a grandmother who wants to provide proper nourishment to strengthen her granddaughter’s bones. “Bonesoup” has a fairy tale-type quality that strikes the perfect balance between dark fantasy and horror.Cassandra Khaw’s contribution to the anthology, “How Selkies Are Made,” feels like a companion story to their masterful dark fantasy novella, The Salt Grows Heavy. The short story is not as dark as the novella, but it’s still an enjoyable read.I adore just about all horror stories from A.C. Wise. Her contribution to The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4), “Sharp Things, Killing Things,” is a stylistic departure for Wise, told in the first-person plural. Wise succeeds in capturing the collective zeitgeist of young people in small-town America while delivering a truly chilling tale of horror.A few of the stories were more uneven in the middle of The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4), but the anthology closes out strong with the final two stories: “A Monster in the Shape of a Boy” by Hannah Yang and “Lemmings” by Kirstyn McDermott, both of which are very creative and well written. Part of the joy of reading short story anthologies is discovering new writers. Both Hannah Yang and Kirstyn McDermott are new to me, and I look forward to reading more from them in the future.Whether your goal is to discover new authors or revisit established favorites, The Year’s Best Dark Fantasy and Horror (Volume 4) is a very welcome addition to Paula Guran’s long-running series....more",Notes are private!,2,46,1,"Nov 15, 2023","Nov 27, 2023","Nov 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/171119529-the-year-s-best-dark-fantasy-horror

Mr. and Mrs. Wilcox battle the harsh weather, traveling westward in a horse-drawn carriage, away from London and the threat of debtors’ prison.Mr. Wilcox’s unscrupulous business dealings and lavish lifestyle have finally caught up with him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Wilcox grieves over a terrible loss, much worse than that of the family fortune.The blizzard ultimately gets the best of the traveling Wilcoxes, forcing them to seek refuge in the Wheeldale Inn, where the friendly innkeeper and his silent son are mourning their own tragedy. The only other resident of the inn is a corpse, whose funeral and burial have been postponed indefinitely by the harsh winter conditions.Confinement at the Wheeldale Inn forces the Wilcoxes to confront the troubled reality of their broken marriage and determine whether they face a future together. Meanwhile, their isolation and fevered mental states plunge them into conditions ripe for horror.Christmas at Wheeldale Inn deals with several heavy themes, including domestic abuse, gaslighting, and overcoming grief. I am amazed by how much Gemma Amor packs into this slim volume and how she can ultimately find hope and autonomy amid a blizzard of despair and oppression.Gemma Amor’s writing in Christmas at Wheeldale Inn is perfect, as always. Every word is precisely chosen, without anything superfluous. Amor’s prose captures the spirit of Victorian Era literature so beautifully that I felt compelled to read several passages aloud, just to hear the lovely cadence of her words.Christmas at Wheeldale Inn is a modern-day Victorian classic. The most obvious comparison is to A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, who brought a didactic form of spookiness to the Christmas season. But Gemma Amor’s psychologically unsettling approach to Victorian supernatural fiction is more in line with The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, especially in walking the line between horror and insanity. Moreover, Gemma Amor’s melancholy tone and beautiful prose in Christmas at Wheeldale Inn evoke the best of Thomas Hardy, particularly Jude the Obscure.Gemma Amor is a literary chameleon, adapting her writing style across sci-fi horror (Full Immersion), occultist epistolary body horror (The Once Yellow House), Daphne du Maurier-style Gothic fiction (The Folly), and even a Victorian Christmas tale (Christmas at Wheeldale Inn). In every case, Amor brings a level of authenticity and stylistic perfection that blows my mind. Regardless of the genre or subgenre of fiction, Gemma Amor is always able to probe great emotional depths while telling gut-wrenching stories.Christmas at Wheeldale Inn makes the perfect holiday gift for the horror fan in your life.

Newell mines new emotional depths in Shadows of Nyn’Dira, the third entry in her dark epic fantasy series, Fallen Light. Shadows of Nyn’Dira builds upon her already strong worldbuilding and character development from the first two books of the series, Curse of the Fallen and The Forbidden Realms, as well as her masterfully written novella, The Banished. I will keep this  completely spoiler-free for readers who have not yet started the series.The lead protagonist of the Fallen Light series is Nerana Leithor, or Neer for short, a young woman who possesses forbidden magical powers. Neer is relentlessly pursued by the religious rulers of the human-controlled territories, who vilify her for her magical abilities.As Shadows of Nyn’Dira opens, Neer finds herself in the titular elven forest, her body tired and broken following the events of The Forbidden Realms. H.C. Newell skillfully juxtaposes the awe-inspiring beauty of the Nyn’Dira forest with Neer’s feelings of dread and desolation.Shadows of Nyn’Dira expands upon H.C. Newell’s world in every way, with increasingly powerful magic, deeper lore, and more extensive worldbuilding revealing a rich history and complex culture. Newell’s land of Laeroth feels truly “lived in,” much like J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth or George R.R. Martin’s Westeros. H.C. Newell earns bonus points for direwolf representation, which is fully worthy of comparison to Martin’s A Game of Thrones.Throughout Shadows of Nyn’Dira, H.C. Newell explores themes of individual, family, and cultural identity. Neer struggles to find her place, as she is rejected by her own people but can never fully integrate into the culture of a different race. At the same time, Neer must also confront her inner anger and decide whether to pursue a path of vengeance or one of forgiveness. H.C. Newell adopts a slower pace in Shadows of Nyn’Dira compared to Curse of the Fallen and especially its breakneck sequel, The Forbidden Realms. The more measured pacing of Shadows of Nyn’Dira works effectively to develop the emotional depth of Neer and her inner circle of companions. Much of the world views Neer as a monster, and she is beginning to feel like one.The story of Shadows of Nyn’Dira is engrossing from the first page and never lets up till the very end. The Fallen Light series is full of twists and turns, and H.C. Newell saves some of her biggest reveals for this third novel.Shadows of Nyn’Dira is H.C. Newell’s finest work to date, a dark emotional masterpiece that delivers high-stakes fantasy action with intricate, immersive worldbuilding and plenty of unexpected twists that kept me glued to the pages. I eagerly await the fourth volume of her Fallen Light series....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Oct 31, 2023","Oct 31, 2023","Oct 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/197113127-shadows-of-nyn-dira

I had been thrust into a new phase of life, a lonely phase, an unguided phase, which was both terrifying and oddly liberating.”The Folly is Gemma Amor’s brooding Gothic mystery that evokes the best of both Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca and Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho.The Folly opens with forty-three-year-old Morgan as she retrieves her father from prison. Morgan’s father was sentenced in a high-profile trial for the murder of his wife but is now being released following an appeal and eventual retrial. The isolation of prison is replaced by the disquieting loneliness of the COVID-19 pandemic:“What a life, I thought, in which every basic human need had become a protracted operation. Grocery shopping, doctor appointments, dentist appointments, haircuts, all the everyday shit we’d taken for granted suddenly layered with anxious complexity. What a world for Dad to come out into, after everything he suffered already.”Financial strain and the unbearable memories of her mother’s death lead Morgan to sell their family home in Bristol and build a new life along the Cornwall coast. Morgan and her father become caretakers of the Folly, a gloomy lighthouse-style tower famous for its death tourists, whose visits to the Folly are destined to be their last.“A decorative, brooding, and yet wholly frivolous endeavour, the Folly was a tall black granite tower with distinct crenellations capping the roof. It sat stoically on the very tip of a craggy, hooked peninsula, rising confidently above the sea as if it belonged to another era, as if ancient kings had resided there once.”Gemma Amor channels Daphne du Maurier’s dark, poetic writing style, perfectly capturing the atmosphere and tone of Rebecca. Like du Maurier, Amor explores themes of personal identity and isolation, while slowly revealing hidden secrets and motivations.This wouldn’t be a Gemma Amor novel without a healthy dose of horror. Amor strikes just the right level of supernatural dread to make The Folly feel deeply unsettling but without ever becoming excessive.Following up on her back-to-back masterpieces, Full Immersion and The Once Yellow House, the Bram Stoker and British Fantasy Award nominated author Gemma Amor apparently can do no wrong. Although less ambitious in scope than her previous two novels, The Folly is an understated Gothic gem from one of today’s most exhilarating voices in speculative fiction....more",Notes are private!,2,80,1,"Oct 29, 2023","Oct 29, 2023","Oct 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/126134737-the-folly

Shauna may seem kind and innocent from her official author photo, but don’t be fooled. She is an ancient enemy of humankind known as the Emerald Empress of Grimdark, possessing an immortality fueled by the eviscerated hearts of her readers. With each new book, the Emerald Empress of Grimdark grows only more powerful.Shauna lures in unsuspecting readers using advanced author techniques including: Perfect Prose, XCeptional Worldbuilding, and eMotion Mining. Next thing you know, she’s hydrofracking your tear ducts, extracting every last drop of moisture to satisfy her unquenchable thirst for pain and misery. Be warned: In The Words of Kings and Prophets, all of this happens by page six.Shauna achieves this emotional destruction of the heart while distracting the reader’s brain with purposely unpronounceable names like Fódla, Gormflaith, Aoife, and (worst of all) Brian. For example, according to Shauna’s pronunciation guide, Fódla is pronounced as “Foe-la” using a silent “d.”To make matters worse, Gormflaith actually has FOUR silent letters. That’s right, four out of ten letters in Gormflaith are only there as window dressing. Which four are silent? Using my professoring skills, the number of possible pronunciations is 10!/(4!6!) = 210, where “!” is pronounced “factorial.” Of these 210 possible ways of pronouncing Gormflaith, Shauna informs us that only “Gorm-la” is correct. Goodbye, fith; I barely knew thee.In next year’s final installment of the Gael Song trilogy, I’d like to petition Shauna to move all the silent letters to an epilogue under the title “Hello Darkness, My Old Friend.” This epilogue shall constitute 20% of the book. And it will also make the audiobook narrator’s job easier since they can charge for the epilogue but don’t actually have to say anything.What about “Aoife”? Which of the vowels should be pronounced in the first syllable? No matter which one you pick, you’re wrong. It’s actually pronounced “Ee,” as in “Ee-fa.” In much the same way, the “Shau” in Shauna’s first name is pronounced “Ee,” as in “Ee-vil.”Speaking of which, how does Shauna Lawless know so much about Ireland circa 1000 A.D.? It’s because she was actually there witnessing the events that are recorded in The Words of Kings and Prophets. You see, Shauna is actually an immortal descendant of a supernatural race of supposedly mythical beings known as Fomorians. She lives among mortal humans, pretending to be one of us while harvesting the tears of her readers.This is why she never ages. Shauna has been using that same author photo for the past 1,000 years, before photography was even invented.This is also why my ancestors left Ireland in search of a New World. Back then, Shauna employed an insidious author technique known as “oral storytelling tradition,” where she would extract the tears of her victims amidst the flickering shadows of a nighttime bonfire. Fast forward a little more than a century, and I’m sitting here in Pennsylvania with a first name that DEFINITELY DOES NOT have any silent letters, speaking with my boring American accent, deprived of the Irish lilt of my ancestors that could make reading the O’ section of the phone book seem like poetry.Oh, and that whole Irish Potato Famine thing. Where were all the potatoes? Buried in Shauna’s backyard, all part of her evil magical schemes.Returning to The Words of Kings and Prophets, Shauna Lawless has honed her tear-mining skills to a truly terrifying new level. For more than a millennium, the Emerald Empress of Grimdark has refined her storytelling skills to achieve exactly this goal, a perfect tear extraction efficiency in defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. But Shauna doesn’t care about laws, just as she doesn’t care about the number of broken hearts left in her wake.She is Lawless. And she must be stopped....more",Notes are private!,11,102,1,"Oct 25, 2023","Oct 25, 2023","Oct 25, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62847701-the-words-of-kings-and-prophets

I will keep this  completely spoiler-free for readers who have not yet started the series.No Safe Haven picks up immediately following the conclusion of Dulin’s debut novel, No Heart for a Thief. As in the first book, there are two main protagonists: Kaylo, an aging thief and spirit dancer, and Tayen, a fourteen-year-old girl on the run from enemy soldiers who murdered her family. While Tayen recognizes Kaylo as a legendary hero, Kaylo is much harsher on himself, feeling personal responsibility for the war between his homeland of Ennea and the colonialist Gousht Empire. Despite his initial reservations, Kaylo becomes an adoptive father of sorts for Tayen, serving as mentor and guardian for the orphaned girl.As in No Heart for a Thief, No Safe Haven is told on two timelines: a present-day narrative centered on the relationship between Kaylo and Tayen, and a flashback narrative where Kaylo recounts his backstory which may hold some important lessons for his young protégé.My main criticism of No Heart for a Thief was that the story felt off-balance between the two timelines. As soon as I felt fully invested in the present-day narrative, the action switched to the past, with Kaylo’s backstory taking up most of the remaining page count. I’m happy to report that James Lloyd Dulin achieves a much better balance between the two timelines in this second volume of his series.However, the dual timeline format still did not work for me as well as I had hoped. The present-day narrative in No Safe Haven mirrors many of the key thematic elements from Kaylo’s backstory. I know this is intentional, as Kaylo’s story is meant to be didactic for the young Tayen. However, the parallels between the two timelines made the present-day narrative feel a bit repetitive and predictable.There is a strong anti-colonialist and anti-racist message to the Malitu series, which works well whenever it comes to the forefront of the story. Unfortunately, No Safe Haven focuses more on Kaylo and Tayen’s anger management issues rather than the larger external conflict. I would have preferred a better balance between these introspective aspects of the novel and the greater outward conflict with the Gousht Empire.Although No Safe Haven didn’t work as well for me as No Heart for a Thief, there is still lots to love here for fans of thoughtful character-driven fantasy with a socially conscious message.

In front of them, on the side they were supposed to watch, grassland extended as far as the eye could see. Any danger could easily be spotted from half a day away. Behind them was nothing but woods, woods, and more woods.”Woods, woods, and more woods. A Tree’s Heart is the epic arboreal fantasy by Angelika Rust set in the Joined Realm, which is defended by elite soldiers known as Trees. Their newest recruit is an unnamed six-year-old boy with no known family or memories. Adopting the name Ash, the newest sapling is determined to establish roots among his new community.We follow Ash as he grows up through civil war and later becomes personal guardian of the Prince and heir to the throne.

The Third Crossing is a prequel novel to Soliman’s epic fantasy series, War of the Last Day, taking place about seventeen years prior to the events of the main series.The Third Crossing alternates perspectives between two main point-of-view characters. First up is Natsu, a widowed sea smuggler carrying on her late husband’s trafficking of enhanced bowstrings. We meet the second point-of-view character, Akira, on his way to see the Emperor. Akira is shocked when his cousin, Kim, is selected for training with the elite junior Red Cloaks.There is an obvious East Asian influence throughout the worldbuilding of The Third Crossing, apparent in both the character names and geographical locations. For example, much of the action concerns the island of Hokydo, a thinly veiled version of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.The Third Crossing has a vibrant magic system, although I was a bit annoyed by the terminology of channeling “anerjy,” which has just enough letters changed to escape being autocorrected to “energy.”As you can guess from the name of the series, the main plot concerns an impending War of the Last Day, a holy war that is at the forefront of everyone’s minds in the land of Koya. Unfortunately, The Third Crossing does not offer much context for the holy war beyond simply reclaiming the Koyans’ homeland. The novel would have benefitted from more exposition to motivate this key conflict and provide additional historical context. Despite the action-filled plot, with this underdeveloped exposition I felt detached from the characters and their motivations for most of the book.While this is a cut for SPFBO9, I believe fans of Karim Soliman’s War of the Last Day series will still find much to love here, with many unexpected twists that will enhance their enjoyment of the series as a whole....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Oct 10, 2023","Oct 10, 2023","Oct 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61757090-the-third-crossing

Newell captures the brutal aftermath of Curse of the Fallen with her novellaMy complete  of The Banished is published at Grimdark Magazine.H.C. Newell captures the brutal aftermath of Curse of the Fallen with her novella, The Banished, which is essential reading for fans of Newell’s dark epic fantasy series, Fallen Light. While the main books of the Fallen Light series focus predominantly on Neer, a young woman cursed with forbidden magic, The Banished turns the spotlight to two of my favorite supporting characters: the elven warrior Avelloch and the halfling Gil.Emotions run raw throughout The Banished, which picks up immediately following the tragic ending of Curse of the Fallen, the first book of the Fallen Light series. Since I don’t want to spoil the conclusion of Newell’s debut novel, let me just say the characters are physically and psychologically broken, suffering from both bodily injury and post-traumatic stress.Most of The Banished is told from the perspective of Avelloch, who returns to his homeland, the elven forest of Nyn’Dira, to find solace and hopefully to heal his weary heart. However, Avelloch is caught in the middle of a human invasion of the elven forest, needing to defend his relationship with Neer. Avelloch discovers that the threat to Nyn’Dira may be worse than initially meets the eye, with greater implications for the entire land of Laeroth.Avelloch shares point-of-view duties with Gil, the shapeshifting halfling who is another close friend of Neer. The relationships between characters are truly a highlight of The Banished, testing the limits of both friendships and familial relationships.Although worldbuilding takes a backseat in The Banished to focus on H.C. Newell’s outstanding character work, the novella fills in some important gaps left in the main books of the series. There are also some unexpected revelations that will change your perspective on the events of the Fallen Light series.Already a talented storyteller, H.C. Newell elevates her writing craft to new artistic heights in The Banished, capturing the deep emotions of the characters. It helps that she has slowed down the pacing of the novella compared to the main books of the series, giving her characters the time to reflect and deal with their emotional trauma.The Banished is a must-read for fans of H.C. Newell’s Fallen Light series, providing additional depth to several of the key characters. The novella format works well for delivering a character-focused story that packs a big emotional punch.

Our video discussion of A Fool's Hope is available on YouTube.“A fool’s hope. Is that all you have? It won’t keep you safe from me. There’s nowhere you can run to where I won’t find you.”A Fool’s Hope, the second volume of Mike Shackle’s epic grimdark fantasy trilogy, The Last War, picks up immediately following the explosive ending of We Are the Dead, the first book of the series.The Last War trilogy turns the tables on conventional epic fantasy, considering what would happen if evil wins the war and all the traditional heroes are defeated. In We Are the Dead, the northern country of Egril uses their newfound magic and improved military technology to quickly decimate the neighboring kingdom of Jia. The Egrils impose strict martial law on Jia, quashing any sign of rebellion against their iron grip on power and forcing the Jians to worship Kage, their all-powerful god of darkness. Only ordinary people remain to resist the occupying forces. While We Are the Dead focuses largely on survival, A Fool’s Hope finds our broken protagonists ready to fight back against the Egril invaders.Mike Shackle covers a lot of new worldbuilding in A Fool’s Hope. We spend a good share of the book off-map in the nearby seafaring kingdom of Meigore and in a mysterious land where reality is not quite what it seems.A Fool’s Hope introduces us to three new point-of-view characters starting with the opening chapter of the book. Mateon is an ordinary nineteen-year-old man training to become a soldier in the Egril army. Raised in the bloodthirsty Egril culture, Mateon is determined to join the war against Jia, capturing as many slaves as possible for his Emperor. Although indoctrinated in a violent, hate-filled program reminiscent of the Hitler Youth, Mateon has a core of humanity and becomes increasingly unsettled by the true horrors of war.Another new point-of-view character on the Egril side is Francin, one of the Emperor’s Chosen who wields magic to enforce Egril rule. Francin is a more nuanced character compared to Darus, the Emperor’s Chosen from We Are the Dead. While Darus is pure evil, deriving a sadistic pleasure by mercilessly torturing his victims, Francin seems to be more of a true believer in the Egril religion. I appreciated the new perspective on Egril culture brought by both Mateon and Francin. Mike Shackle proves once again to be a master at developing characters with gray morality: Mateon and Francin are two of his finest examples.The third new point-of-view character is Ralasis, a legendary Meigorian captain who helps Tinnstra and Zorique escape from the Egril. Ralasis is a lot of fun to read, providing some occasional lightheartedness in a book that is otherwise very dark in tone. However, as much as I enjoyed reading from his perspective, I question whether it was truly necessary to give Ralasis point-of-view status.Although Mike Shackle alternates among a total of eight different perspectives in A Fool’s Hope, Tinnstra and Zorique get the most page time, especially in the latter half of the book. The relationship between the emotionally troubled Tinnstra and the orphaned queen Zorique is my favorite part of the book, with Tinnstra becoming the adoptive mother of the four-year-old queen. Their relationship has realistic ups and downs but is built on a very real love. Tinnstra and Zorique both grow profoundly over the course of A Fool’s Hope, solidifying them as two of my favorite characters in the series.Yas is another character who beautifully captures the trials of motherhood. In We Are the Dead, Yas served as a housekeeper for the Egril soldiers but was pulled into an espionage campaign to try to siphon information to Jax and the resistance efforts. In A Fool’s Hope, Yas proves that a mother’s love for her child knows no bounds. She gradually grows into full-on gangster mode, reminding me of Shae in Fonda Lee’s magnificent Jade City.A nihilistic, self-righteous kid in We Are the Dead, Dren also experiences extraordinary character development in A Fool’s Hope. In We Are the Dead, Dren recruited troubled souls to conduct suicide bombing missions against both sides in the war, leaving fear and anarchy in his wake. Dren develops a moral compass in this second book of the series, understanding that perhaps self-sacrifice is necessary to aid in the common good.A former Shulka officer in the Jian army, Jax is haunted by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in A Fool’s Hope following the events of We Are the Dead. Mike Shackle is masterful in his portrayal of Jax’s inner struggles. By the end of the book, I still didn’t know for sure whether Jax’s inner demon is all in his mind, or if it’s a literal demon haunting him with sinister intentions.Mike Shackle explores the theme of humanity throughout A Fool’s Hope, showing how readily people from opposing cultures can dehumanize each other and how terrible violence can result from such dehumanization. One of my favorite scenes in A Fool’s Hope occurs when a character removes the hideous mask worn by an Egril warrior to discover an ordinary human face behind the mask.Mike Shackle’s writing is as tight as ever, delivering a constant stream of fast-paced action. However, occasionally the plot feels a little too fast-paced, causing some details of the action scenes to become a bit confusing. One other minor criticism is that too many chapters end with either something exploding or a fade to black.A Fool’s Hope features a major plot twist about halfway through the novel that I had somewhat mixed feelings about. On the one hand, I truly enjoyed reading that part of the story and the resulting character development. On the other hand, it felt like too much of a deus ex machina, where one of the characters becomes, perhaps, too overpowered with magic. The increased prominence of magic in A Fool’s Hope also worked a bit against Mike Shackle’s main theme of ordinary people rising to overcome extraordinary challenges.Although not quite as balanced as We Are the Dead, A Fool’s Hope remains an outstanding example of epic grimdark fantasy. Mike Shackle truly shines in giving a unique voice to each of his point-of-view characters, all of whom experience satisfying growth arcs in this second book of the series.

Rosell, is a single point-of-view revenge fantasy featuring Leiyn, a ranger from a colonialist society who protects the wilderness with her bow and unflinching determination.The Last Ranger is told on multiple timelines, and Leiyn is haunted by horrific events from both her past and present:“Memories assaulted her. Leiyn bolted upright and looked wildly around. She had a strong stomach, but hers bucked at the sight of what surrounded her. Corpses lay in heaps across the forest floor.”The worldbuilding is a highlight of the novel, especially with its beautiful wildland fantasy setting. However, as much as I enjoyed reading J.D.L. Rosell’s descriptions of the Titan Wilds, I struggled to make any connection with Leiyn as the lead protagonist.Leiyn is a frustrating character: she is hotheaded, impulsive, and horribly racist against the Gasts, the indigenous population of the colonized lands. The roots of her racism began early in life:“‘Every child should see a man’s life end,’ her father told her as they walked to the town square to see the Gasts hang.”Leiyn also abhors magic and keeps her own magical abilities hidden. She is especially biased against the magic-wielding shamans, who also serve as religious leaders of the Gasts:“Of all Gasts, she had always most despised shamans.”Unfortunately, I failed to develop any emotional connection with Leiyn as a character until about 70% into the novel. Since hers is the only perspective in The Last Ranger, this compromised my enjoyment of the story as a whole. The plot itself also follows a fairly standard vengeance arc, without offering any major surprises. Despite its elegant prose and worldbuilding, The Last Ranger suffers from an unlikeable, unrelatable lead protagonist who limits the view of this wild and wonderful world. Although I couldn’t sympathize with her as a character, other readers who can overcome this issue may find more to enjoy....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Dec 16, 2023","Feb 18, 2024","Oct 03, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62808198-the-last-ranger

MacRae, following up on her excellent first volume, The Iron Crown, which was a finalist in Mark Lawrence’s 7th Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO7).Grimdark fans will find much to love in The Shadow Gate, which takes the series in a decidedly darker direction. L.L. MacRae also presents an intriguing treatment of gray morality across several of her characters, including the lead protagonist, Fenn, an amnesiac who is trying to recover his lost memories and locate his family, if he still has one. Fenn learns that he is touched by an ancient evil known as the Myr, and he might be playing an unwitting role in their return to the Realm of Tassar. MacRae adeptly builds layers of complexity in Fenn’s character, who is both a sympathetic and potentially dangerous lead.The Myr themselves are a shadowy threat, haunting the land with death and destruction. L.L. MacRae’s descriptions of the Myr are shrouded in mystery and lore, reminding me of Patrick Rothfuss’s approach to the Chandrian in the Kingkiller Chronicle. Fortunately, the Myr get significantly more page time in The Shadow Gate than the Chandrian have seen thus far in the Kingkiller Chronicle.L.L. MacRae maintains a fast, even pace throughout The Shadow Gate. She also ups the ante on action, starting from the opening scene which depicts the terrible aftermath of a Myrish attack at Foxmouth, highlighting the death and ruin brought by this otherworldly evil.The Shadow Gate switches perspectives among several vividly drawn point-of-view characters. Beyond Fenn, my favorite characters from The Iron Crown are back: the hotheaded Calidra and her partner, the loving and supportive Jisyel, whose relationship was a highlight of the first book. Also returning are Torsten, the grand inquisitor who is another masterclass in gray morality; Apollo, a former thief looking to build a better life; Selys, a priestess with competing loyalties; and Varlot, a former soldier trying to escape his violent past.MacRae’s worldbuilding is phenomenal across both The Iron Crown and The Shadow Gate. This series is manna from heaven for dragon fans. The Shadow Gate features nine dragon spirits, powerful supernatural beings who appear in specific geographical areas such as forests or lakes and are dedicated to protecting their natural realms. The dragon spirits’ powers are channeled through the humans to whom they are bonded. The greatest of the dragon spirits is Toriaken, the enormous spirit of iron, who is bonded with Queen Surayo of the Iron Crown.The Shadow Gate also brings back L.L. MacRae’s hyperintelligent griffins, who are large enough to carry several people on their backs during flight. Fans of Thiago Abdalla’s griffin-drenched Ashes of Avarin series will also love MacRae’s work.Overall, The Shadow Gate is a spectacular tour de force in dark epic fantasy.

Cold, bruised and sore, I hung from metal manacles—my bare feet just able to touch the floor beneath me.”Daughter of the Beast, the SPFBO9 finalist by E.C. Greaves, is a strikingly imaginative story of self-discovery and found family.The story is told from the first-person perspective of Zyntael Fairwinter, a young Kikimora girl who is kidnapped by the monstrous Vulkari during a raid of her quiet forest village:“The stench of their damp hides and rancid breath made me gag, and brought water to my eyes. I told myself that this was why my vision swam and my cheeks were wet, but I was simply afraid. No matter how much I tried to choke back the fear, to abate the flow of tears, and to still my trembling limbs, I could not.”Zyntael becomes the adopted daughter of the Vulkari matriarch and is indoctrinated into their culture. She doesn’t understand why she is being treated so much better than the other kidnapped Kikimora:“I had never been so exhausted, never felt so lost, alone, and miserable as I did during those first weeks that we travelled east. But I was the luckiest of my kind.”The worldbuilding in Daughter of the Beast is a triumph of imagination. There are no human characters, just different races inspired by Slavic mythology.E.C. Greaves excels in delivering a coming-of-age story as Zyntael grows within her new culture and builds bonds with her found family:“Karthak idly played with my hair and sang to herself in her own language. The yapping and howling of the Vulkari speech was ill-suited to song, but I dared not tell her so, the many times she asked me what I thought of her tune.”Daughter of the Beast is written in six parts called Stitches. I found the writing in Daughter of the Beast to be rather inconsistent, and I could not connect at all with the first Stitch. But E.C. Greaves pulled me into the story in the second stitch as he settled into a calmer and more accessible writing style.There were several truly touching moments later in the book, especially related to building understanding across cultural boundaries:“I looked up at his eyes—a deep purplish colour, almost black. If I could see through them, I would have liked to. If only to understand how he saw me. I was a savage, or so he said, but those eyes saw me as so much more.”However, the plot felt a bit aimless at times, lacking a central conflict to drive the story forward.Overall, Daughter of the Beast was a mixed bag for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the innovative worldbuilding and themes of belonging and cross-cultural understanding. At the same time, I’d have preferred a story with more overarching direction to keep me engaged over the full span of the novel.

He is such a cinnamon roll: intelligent, thoughtful, kind, caring, and in need of protection from a werewolf friend.[Sofia] I think what he needs is a hug.[John] I’ll give you a hug, Christopher.[Sofia] I like how the members of the friend group each see werewolves from their own points of view. That’s explored in interesting ways throughout the book. There’s Christopher, an inquisitive human sympathetic to the Truebloods. There’s Lex, a “Domesticated” werewolf who gets his first taste of his natural instincts. And then there’s Jules, a sweet Were who doesn’t know firsthand what it’s actually like to be a werewolf and humanizes terms like “the pack” because she doesn’t understand the full meaning of the word in the context of werewolf culture.[John] Even though some of the characters fall into archetypes, I found them all to be very relatable.[Sofia] I agree. There’s a reason why those archetypes formed over time. I think Tecken did an excellent job with the characters.Worldbuilding:[John] Phased has a modern, present-day setting. There are phones, emails, and text messages, but fortunately no pop culture references that would make the book seem outdated a decade from now.[Sofia] I think a lot of fantasy books—and novels in general—with a contemporary setting unfortunately fall into the trap of saturating the narrative with modern colloquialisms and references that fade quickly over time. [John] Agreed. Victoria Tecken has done an excellent job balancing the modern setting with a more timeless feel to the story and narration. For me, the present-day setting helped to make the characters and story feel more relatable.[Sofia] As with most school settings in fantasy books, tropes of social cliques, bullies, and bookworms are used. This makes certain aspects of the book, especially the inter-character relationships, feel predictable. But again, these are cliches for a reason: they reflect the universal high school experience. Personally, I’m very fond of schools in fantasy and thoroughly enjoyed the drama.[John] The scope of the worldbuilding broadens in the latter part of the book, including the history of the werewolves and their relationship with humanity. This works effectively because we’ve already built a strong connection with Val, Lyla, and many of the side characters at this point. There’s also more to the DAO than is initially apparent.[Sofia] Overall, the worldbuilding was immersive, interesting, and effective.Plot and Pacing:[John] Victoria Tecken maintains a consistent pacing throughout the novel: not too fast, not too slow, building up to some intense action at the end.[Sofia] Phased is so enjoyable. The plot doesn’t demand a lot of reading between the lines, but it’s still emotionally subtle when it needs to be. [John] That’s an excellent point about Tecken’s subtlety, a refreshing change from many other young adult werewolf fantasies…[Sofia] Everything falls together in a satisfying yet realistic way. There were several surprising and well-paced plot twists. It’s definitely a carefully planned book. Themes:[John] Victoria Tecken is especially strong when it comes to depicting mental health issues in her characters, focusing on the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by the sisters as a result of childhood trauma. These struggles are handled with nuance and honesty, which set this book apart from many others.[Sofia] I agree. That was the most impactful aspect of the book for me.[John] I was particularly struck by the numbness that the sisters experienced at certain points in the novel. Their human and lupine identities are both critical to who they are as characters. By suppressing a part of themselves, they risk becoming numb to their entire being.[Sofia] The DAO wants to eliminate the aspect of the werewolves that they see as primitive and feral. By forcing them to masquerade as human, something that is a fraction of who they are, the DAO condemns them to live what is basically only half a life. That’s one of the things the sisters struggle with throughout the book. But we know they can find friendship and happiness with humans while also living as they were meant to live. That’s what the DAO refuses to understand.[John] There is also a strong focus on themes of sisterhood, friendship, and found family. There’s even some light romance. Do you think this worked effectively?[Sofia] I don’t think much about the story would have changed had these characters been “just friends.”[John] Agreed. The romance was unnecessary but ultimately innocuous. I’m also curious to hear your thoughts about friendship versus blood bonds, which kind of forced a different type of relationship between characters.[Sofia] I didn’t see it that way. I think the characters involved were concerned that a blood bond would cause them to misconstrue their own feelings for each other, but I don’t think the formation of the blood bond forced any development to occur. [John] Perhaps it only accelerated the inevitable.[Sofia] The author also did a great job presenting misunderstanding between people who come from different backgrounds and the danger of dehumanizing those you don’t understand.[John] I appreciated the surprising sympathy that came from some unexpected sources.Writing:[John] Victoria Tecken’s writing is well-polished and straightforward, written in a young adult style that serves as an effective vehicle for delivering her story. The flashbacks to Val and Lyla’s childhood days in the forest are well done and pack an emotional punch. [Sofia] For me, the bigger emotional punch came from the sisters’ reactions to situations in the present day that reminded them of their past and the life that they lost.Overall Thoughts:[John] What are your overall thoughts on the novel?[Sofia] I really liked Phased. It’s a book that I can appreciate from a thematic and emotional perspective and also enjoy as an entertaining story. My rating is 4.5/5.[John] I fully agree with your assessment and also rate this book 4.5/5. Although it’s a young adult novel, I highly recommend this for adults as well....more",Notes are private!,2,69,1,"Sep 18, 2023","Sep 18, 2023","Sep 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55782846-phased

I deserve much worse.”Mike Mollman channels the classic epic fantasy feel of Lloyd Alexander and T.H. White with his debut novel, Becoming a Druid. The year is 819, and the land is Pretanni, a fantasy version of medieval Wales and southwest England.Becoming a Druid is a coming-of-age tale of sorts for our narrator, Grahme, a druid-in-training who must prove himself on a quest to retrieve the legendary ghost orchid from the dreaded Obsidian Lord. Grahme is a treat as narrator, projecting hubris that might mask his inner feelings of inadequacy for the task at hand.The novel is built around two mentor-mentee relationships, with Grahme sandwiched in the middle: Grahme is a student of the master druid, Boswen, but he also serves as a mentor for his nephew, Figol, who joins the quest.I love the nature-based magic system in Becoming a Druid, which includes animal communication and animorphing, i.e., humans adopting animal forms. Other druidic masteries include herbology and runes, elemental summoning, and the difficult-to-master weather magic.The animal morphing action reminds me of Merlyn’s scenes from the first part of T.H. White’s The Once and Future King. Grahme proves himself to be a fluid druid with his animorphing skills, and he has a special penchant for avian forms. Becoming a Druid is a special treat for bird lovers, with a variety of owls, kites, kestrels, puffins, and (appropriately) merlins all making an appearance:“I let the avian brain take over and I flee north to safety.”The Welsh-inspired setting and mythology of Becoming a Druid recall Lloyd Alexander’s masterpiece series, The Chronicles of Prydain, except with more druids and fewer assistant pig-keepers. We discover much more of the Pretanni lore and worldbuilding along Grahme’s journey.Mike Mollman’s writing doesn’t achieve the same level of artistry as Alexander or White, but his straightforward, accessible style works well to convey the tale at hand. Mollman’s choice of first-person, present-tense narration gives a sense of immediacy to the quest. There is a great buildup of action in Becoming a Druid, culminating with a twist that I didn’t see coming.There is something immensely satisfying about a traditional quest fantasy, and Mike Mollman has done an excellent job with Becoming a Druid.

Sergei’s mother is missing and presumed dead after helping her family flee across the Iron Curtain.Plagued by bizarre hyper-realistic dreams, Sergei is determined to understand his family’s past and find closure with respect to his missing mother. Sergei is helped by his best friend and college roommate, Cameron, and an excellent cast of supporting characters as they discover a portal called the Lake which leads to a parallel fantasy world.On the other side of the portal, Sergei and friends discover a dark fantasy world with warring tribes and contentious magic. Connections between the parallel worlds develop slowly over the course of the book, with plenty of unexpected twists along the way.Angela Boord’s prose is compulsively readable, blending a 1980s Stranger Things vibe with a Bulgakovian sense of humor. The beginning of the book is perfectly executed, including some incisive humor that made me laugh out loud:“At first, I cursed at him in Russian, because I’m polite like that. After I got to know him, I still cursed in Russian, but I used his name so he’d know I was cursing him.”However, the rest of the book carries on for Tolstoyan lengths, which slowly sapped away my enjoyment of the story. At nearly 900 pages, Through Dreams So Dark would benefit from some significant cuts to tighten up its plot and pacing.My favorite part of Through Dreams So Dark are the subtle nods to classic Russian literature. For example, Sergei’s family name, Preobrazhensky, is taken from famed Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov’s Soviet-era novella, Heart of a Dog, a biting takedown of the Communist party’s embrace of eugenics.Angela Boord echoes a similar theme in Through Dreams So Dark, which features a potential Soviet conspiracy involving eugenics-tinged laboratory experiments. She pairs this with the enduring Russian émigré experience, a staple in Vladimir Nabokov’s canon of literature.Through Dreams So Dark is recommended for fans of classic Russian literature and for anyone who enjoys a well-written portal fantasy....more",Notes are private!,1,39,1,"Sep 16, 2023","Sep 16, 2023","Sep 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62081315-through-dreams-so-dark

Baker’s bleak paranormal fantasy. The largest of these gangs, the Candle Children, is led by Beth Lansdown, a blind girl with a special connection to the spiritual world.Candle Children has a distinct Dickensian air with its cast of destitute orphans and plenty of ghosts and spirits. What’s the difference?“A ghost is the soul of someone from this world originally. A spirit comes from another world. Apart from that, the difference is a little blurred.”The children know ancient songs that can help placate the spirits, keeping them at bay. However, the Emperor seeks to leverage the children’s influence over the paranormal to weaponize the spirits toward his own ends.“Never trust a man who feels the need to convince the world that he’s brave.”The Emperor is also bigoted against the children since a high fraction of them are tainted as Orcbloods. Although only about five percent of babies are born as Orcbloods, they are much more likely to be abandoned by their parents. Hence, the orphaned children in the street gangs have a disproportionally large number of Orcbloods in their ranks and end up being targeted by the authorities.The world also features a mysterious encroaching Ice that kills people in their sleep and steals their souls. The Emperor believes that the Orcbloods are somehow responsible for the Ice, but actually the Candle Children help keep the Ice at bay through their use of holy candles.To complicate matters further, the spirits may actually be manipulating the children and the Emperor toward their own goals, painting another layer of gray morality on this already very dark world.Although Candle Children has a lot of intriguing ideas, I found it often pulling in too many directions at once. As a result, the story never quite gels as coherently as I would have liked.Nevertheless, grimdark fans will enjoy the originality and eerie atmosphere of M.J.

What seeks demise of impossibility?”Opening the cover of a new Kallattian Saga book from Andrew D. Meredith is like uncorking a bottle of well-aged Châteauneuf-du-Pape, a rare opportunity to savor the work of a master vintner whose art is intertwined with centuries of religious history. As the third volume of the Kallattian Saga, Gloves of Eons is vintage Meredith, with a timeless feel that captures the essence of humanity in a well-realized world far removed from our own.Many authors strive for an immersive worldbuilding experience, but few achieve it as successfully as Andrew D. Meredith in Gloves of Eons. Every aspect of Meredith’s world is meticulously crafted, giving it a lived-in feel that evokes the depth and nuance of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth.Gloves of Eons brings back all our favorite characters from Deathless Beast and Bone Shroud. It feels like catching up with old friends as we spend time with each of Meredith’s main protagonists.First up are Hanen and Rallia Clouw, the brother-and-sister duo who, after suffering a stinging betrayal, struggle to find their path forward among the Black Sentinels. Meanwhile, Jined Brazstein continues navigating the politics of his religious order while discerning his own personal faith among competing theologies. Among the Paladames, Katiam Borreau and Astrid Glass care for an unexpected companion who brings both promise and uncertainty.As much as I loved spending time with these well-established characters, the star of Gloves of Eons is Ophedia, a young Black Sentinel with surprising parentage and the most captivating character arc in this third volume of the series:“Yeah,” Ophedia said. “I’m a responsible adult now, which is why I’m jailbreaking foreign spies and acting as an accomplice to a guy with a cloak made of darkness.”Gloves of Eons largely focuses on the fallout of events from Deathless Beast and Bone Shroud. Like the first two volumes of the Kallattian Saga, the plot of Gloves of Eons has a hockey stick-shaped buildup, with a slow and methodical start leading to an unexpectedly tense climax that brings a satisfying, albeit too abrupt, conclusion to the novel.Andrew D. Meredith’s prose is Proustian as ever, timeless in its understated beauty. Like Proust, Meredith brings a charming eloquence to every page, regardless of whether he is describing the astounding or the mundane.Gloves of Eons is a stunning lamentation: a remembrance of things past with a hopeful eye toward time regained. As his characters discern their legacies, Andrew D. Meredith establishes himself as a master of the literary epic fantasy.

He was thirteen years old, he shouldn’t be crying like a child.”Master of the Void is the C.S. Lewis-inspired SPFBO9 finalist by Wend Raven, an epic fantasy and coming-of-age story that will capture the imagination of readers of all ages.Wend Raven’s debut takes place in the magic-infused Seven Lands. The children of the Seven Lands are evaluated for their magical abilities precisely thirteen years following their birth.The various magical abilities are categorized by color and connected to astrological symbols from the moment of their birth. Those few souls without magical abilities are imprinted with the dreaded Void Mark on their hand, making them outcasts in a world where magic means everything.Master of the Void has a vibrant cast of characters, consisting mostly of young teenagers as they find their paths forward within this society. Although there are several points of view, the book features two main protagonists. First is Orimund Laetus, the third son of an archmage, who has studied diligently as he tries to meet the high expectations of his parents:“At fourteen and fifteen, Orimund’s older brothers had already passed their testing and had begun to excel in their magical practices. Most days, the pressure of living up to their successes was only a nagging thought in the back of his mind. Other days, he thought he might drown in it.”But when Orimund’s testing goes terribly wrong, he must make a new path for himself.The other lead protagonist is Derrius Mendi, a poor boy with uncommon abilities who studies hard to build a better life for himself and his family. But an ill-timed disaster on the eve of his testing forces Derrius to reevaluate his plans.Master of the Void also features an outstanding group of side characters, several of whom get point-of-view duties throughout the novel. I especially enjoyed reading from the perspectives of Orimund’s best friend, Imber, who has an arranged engagement to Orimund’s older brother, Arrin. Both Imber and Arrin are willing to exploit the engagement as a means to help the troubled Orimund.Master of the Void is full of positive messages as the children overcome their challenges, gaining self-confidence and finding purpose:“‘Eventually, I came to the realization that no one in the Seven Lands had the power to make me feel good about myself,’ his brother continued. ‘Even if Father had suddenly decided to hug me and tell me he was proud, or the prettiest girl in school decided she was crazy about me, it wouldn’t mean anything if I wasn’t already happy with who I am.’”These personal journeys are set against a rising evil that threatens to destroy the only world the children have known.Master of the Void embraces all the well-worn tropes of middle grade and young adult fantasy. There are also the usual themes of friendship, familial relationships, overcoming adversity, and finding joy in a time of suffering, as well as an innocuous love triangle. Yes, all of this has been done before in countless other novels. But Wend Raven accomplishes everything so compelling in Master of the Void that I really can’t fault her for her embrace of classic tropes.Master of the Void is a wholesome fantasy that parents can give to their middle-grade children without worrying about objectionable content. Wend Raven even captured my imagination as an adult reader who has seen these tropes innumerable times, providing a truly entertaining read that I am delighted to recommend.Most of all, I’d consider Master of the Void to be a perfect gateway book for introducing young readers to fantasy, which could very well foster a lifelong love of reading. Honestly, I can’t think of any higher praise than that.Master of the Void is the first book in a planned trilogy.

Our video discussion of A Fool's Hope is available on YouTube.“She was a coward and she did what cowards do—she ran.”We Are the Dead is the thrilling first volume of Mike Shackle’s grimdark fantasy trilogy, The Last War. The title of the book is taken from the oft-quoted 1915 war poem, “In Flanders Fields,” written by the Canadian poet and physician John McCrae during the second year of World War I. McCrae’s poem hauntingly captures the consequences of war from the perspective of fallen soldiers. Similarly, Mike Shackle considers the aftermath of a lost war after all the traditional heroes are defeated, and only ordinary people remain to resist the occupying forces.The southern country of Jia has enjoyed relative peace for hundreds of years, protected by its seemingly invincible army of Shulka warriors. The Jians are contemptuous of the Egril, their neighbors to the north, whom they consider to be blond-haired, square-jawed savages. Unbeknownst to the Jians, the Egril developed advanced war technology and rediscovered magic, ensuring them a swift victory over the unsuspecting Shulka.The story jumps ahead six months after the Shulka defeat, with Jia under occupation by the victorious Egril soldiers, also known as Skulls because of the hideous masks that they wear, as depicted on the cover of the book. The Egril impose their religion on the people of Jia, forcing them to abandon their four gods in favor of the Egril god Kage, the Lord of Great Darkness.We Are the Dead is primarily a character-driven novel told from the perspectives of ordinary people with broken lives, who must overcome their personal issues in the face of a brutal occupation. First is Tinnstra, the daughter of the country’s most elite Shulka warrior, who considers herself to be a coward who would rather run away from danger than face it head on. Readers should be aware that the first chapter of We Are the Dead has quite a trigger warning as Tinnstra attempts suicide to escape the overwhelming expectations placed on her by her warrior family. But Tinnstra must overcome her self-doubts and do the right thing for her country when her brother sends her on a special mission in defiance of the Egril occupation.Next is Dren, the obnoxious and self-righteous teenaged son of a fisherman who would rather mock warriors from the shadows than stand up and fight. Dren follows an increasingly dangerous path of political radicalization, becoming a terrorist who recruits others for suicide bombing missions. I actively hated Dren for most of We Are the Dead, but he experiences some rather unexpected growth by the end of the book which made him a more sympathetic character.Jax is an older Shulka officer from a small military camp near the border with Egril. Jax’s overconfidence has cost his country dearly. Now one of the only remaining Shulka, he must embody the core principles of the Shulka prayer, “We Are the Dead”:“This core belief gave the Shulka their strength. A man who is already dead has no fear and can act without hesitation to vanquish even the most fearsome foe.”My favorite character in We Are the Dead is the widow Yas, who works as a cleaner for the Skulls. Yas is instructed not to even look at the Egril warriors, lest she be assaulted or even killed. But Yas becomes entangled with a spy who enlists her as part of an espionage campaign to aid the rebel Jians.Mike Shackle excels at his depiction of gray morality with each of his main protagonists. That being said, one point-of-view character is pure evil: Darus, one of the Egril Emperor’s Chosen, who leads a Gestapo-type security force to quell any sign of rebellion. What if the Nazi torturer, Klaus Barbie, the infamous “Butcher of Lyon,” also had magical powers? That’s the best way I can describe Darus, who uses his powers of healing and regeneration to the most nefarious ends as he tortures his victims, only to heal them and torture them again.Fortunately, the Egril aren’t the only ones with magic. There is also Aasgod, the Lord Mage who served as advisor to generations of Jian royalty and plays a critically important role in Tinnstra’s mission.The worldbuilding in We Are the Dead is essentially a fantasy version of Nazi-occupied France during World War II but with elements of Chinese and Japanese cultures reflected in the countries of Jia and Egril, respectively. Mike Shackle’s carefully honed writing serves as the perfect vehicle to propel this fast-paced story forward. We Are the Dead is nearly impossible to put down.

The Narrow Road Between Desires is told from the perspective of Bast, the mischievous fae and friend of Kvothe, the main protagonist from the series. With his good heart but regular trickery, Bast is reminiscent of Puck from William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.The main story of The Narrow Road Between Desires was originally published as a 58-page novella, The Lightning Tree, as part of the Rogues anthology compiled by George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozios. In his recent interview with Grimdark Magazine, Patrick Rothfuss describes The Narrow Road Between Desires as a renovation project. He knew that there was a great story in The Lightning Tree, but it also had plenty of room for improvement.The Narrow Road Between Desires represents a complete rewrite of The Lightning Tree, bringing it to a state of polished perfection. Once again, Rothfuss proves that his prose is timeless. The Narrow Road Between Desires is also significantly longer than The Lightning Tree—it includes new and extended scenes, as well as about forty illustrations from the talented Nate Taylor.In The Narrow Road Between Desires, we spend a day with Bast as he helps and/or manipulates the village children. Bast hangs out at the Lightning Tree, waiting for children to come with their problems or questions. Bast agrees to help them in exchange for secrets, favors, or labors.There are a lot of questions about Bast and his motivations after reading both The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man’s Fear. Bast is highly manipulative, but he also has a heart. The warmer side of Bast’s personality becomes apparent in the latter part of the novella, when he helps a young boy, Rike, deal with his abusive father. This part of the story is touching and somber, bringing tears to my eyes.Nate Taylor contributes gorgeous artwork throughout The Narrow Road Between Desires, which truly enhances the experience. Taylor and Rothfuss previously collaborated on The Slow Regard of Silent Things, the first Kingkiller Chronicle novella which focuses on Auri. Taylor and Rothfuss also collaborated on The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle, the children’s book series that’s not actually for children.The Narrow Road Between Desires is an instant classic and a welcome return for Patrick Rothfuss. Rothfuss and Taylor strike the perfect balance between whimsy and earnestness. The novella tackles the issue of domestic violence with nuance and honesty. Seasoned fans of the Kingkiller Chronicle will love spending this time with Bast. The Narrow Road Between Desires also works great as a standalone novella, even if you haven’t read the other entries in the series....more",Notes are private!,2,191,1,"Aug 30, 2023","Aug 31, 2023","Aug 24, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/157265081-the-narrow-road-between-desires

Anna Smith Spark’s latest novel is a timeless epic dedicated to the universal trials of motherhood and the power of familial bonds.Now a mother with a loving husband (Dellet) and three daughters (Calian, Morna, and Sal), Kanda was once the bravest and strongest warrior of the legendary Six Swords of Roven. Kanda’s family knows nothing of her bloody past spent defending the realm against an unspeakable evil. But as the novel opens, her peaceful agrarian life is threatened by the return of this ancient wickedness.Anna Smith Spark’s writing is so poetic that I felt compelled to read several passages aloud, allowing the full impact and beauty of her words to resonate around me:“I have found peace here for a little while. I have borne three children, and hoped for them. They will suffer and die—but now they live. And at times it has been so very good.”Shifting fluidly between first- and third-person narration, A Sword of Bronze and Ashes perfectly evokes the style of early folk tales recorded from oral tradition. The novel’s structure is particularly reminiscent of The Mabinogion, the earliest recorded prose stories from Wales, compiled in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.Beyond its technical similarities, A Sword of Bronze and Ashes also beautifully captures the feminist spirit of The Mabinogion, with a powerful female protagonist who balances epic battles with real-life family struggles. Kanda reminds me especially of Rhiannon, the Welsh goddess of strength, endurance, and sovereignty who also inspired Fleetwood Mac’s song of the same name, written by Stevie Nicks. Among the characters of Welsh mythology, Rhiannon is noted for maintaining her dignity and autonomy even under the greatest of external pressures.As in The Mabinogion, A Sword of Bronze and Ashes is permeated with natural mysticism. From the pastoral beauty of its opening chapter through its terrifying scenes of violence, Anna Smith Spark captures both the serenity and brutality of the natural world.No fantasy author characterizes motherhood as thoughtfully as Anna Smith Spark. Like her previous book, A Woman of the Sword, Anna Smith Spark’s latest novel is fundamentally a book about the struggles and comforts of being a mother:“We argue, I shout at the children, the roof leaks, my favorite plate gets broken. I sit up awake five nights running with a screaming puking baby cursing you that you can’t feed it—yes, that would be you, Calian. All this you gave me, Dellet. I was lost and alone and grieving. Here with you, I found my peace.”Kanda’s struggle between her violent past and present domestic life also recalls Cold West, the Weird Western grimdark masterpiece by Clayton W. Snyder, which features a father haunted by a violent past that he can’t seem to escape, despite all the love he has for his family.Anna Smith Spark brings Kanda’s struggles crushingly to life:“I don’t trust myself to help my own children. I am death and killing. If I try to help them, I will kill them too.”Ultimately, A Sword of Bronze and Ashes is about appreciating the simple virtues of a peaceful family life in what is often a very dark world:“Hug them tight, hold them tight bury your face in their hair, kiss them so they can’t see your face and your tears. Squeeze them tight so they can’t feel you shake. Breathe them in.”Anna Smith Spark weaves layers of complexity into her characterization and worldbuilding, enhancing the immersive experience for the reader and providing opportunities to discover more details upon subsequent reads. Although sometimes disorienting with its blurred line between life and death, everything becomes clear by the end of the novel, culminating with a mic drop King of Thorns-style ending that left me with mouth agape, shouting to my family about what a brilliant novel I had just read.A Sword of Bronze and Ashes is a triumph in every respect. As always, Anna Smith Spark writes with lyrical beauty and frank brutality. Her latest novel is a technical tour de force, giving a faithful representation of early dark mystical fantasy passed down through oral tradition, most notably The Mabinogion. But more importantly, A Sword of Bronze and Ashes is an emotional masterpiece, crushing me as only Anna Smith Spark can....more",Notes are private!,4,101,1,"Aug 20, 2023","Aug 20, 2023","Aug 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/128014530-a-sword-of-bronze-and-ashes

This final installment of the Edan Trilogy is a book of extraordinary thematic depth, also delivering an unputdownable story with a well-realized cast of relatable characters. The novel opens with a nine-year-old village boy, Oran, trying to survive in a cruel world following the death of his father. A mysterious figure enters the scene, bringing a sudden transformation to a local thug and demonstrating firsthand the power of the famed Prophet of Edan.Return to Edan has a melancholy feel reflected in the dark color palette of its stained-glass cover art. The cover depicts a new point-of-view character, the nature-loving girl Seren, who quickly becomes a highlight of the novel. She suffers terrible tragedy but may also hold a key toward salvation. Meanwhile, the sorceress Sequara and her friends are searching for the lead protagonist, Dayraven, who has lost his identity and much of his memory in becoming the fated Prophet of Edan.The first two books of the trilogy, The Way of Edan and The Prophet of Edan, leaned heavily into a Buddhist-influenced journey of self-discovery. Return to Edan retains this Buddhist influence but also serves as a Christ allegory with numerous Biblical parallels. As Dayraven travels the land, he preaches very Christ-like lessons on the importance of love:“The path of love is not always easy, and it is not always clear, though it will reward you like no other. You may stumble away from it at times, but it is always awaiting your return. It requires courage and determination to stay on it. You must be true to yourself and your deepest beliefs. Most of all, it requires being the person you choose to love.”Dayraven also uses his powers to reveal the sins of evildoers, forcing them to confront the horrors of their own actions:“A long wail escaped the king’s mouth, which gaped in a rictus of agony. When his scream ceased, the man gasped for breath as he knelt and stared ahead with eyes that did not see.”There is clear Biblical inspiration for this from both the Old Testament, “Though his hatred covers itself with guile, his wickedness will be revealed before the assembly” (Proverbs 26:26), and the New Testament, “But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known” (Luke 12:2).But Philip Chase has given a grimdark twist to the typical Christ allegory, since the source of Dayraven’s powers is not goodness but rather a morally ambiguous elven power that could be evil in nature or simply indifferent to the affairs of humanity.Dayraven’s power is not an intrinsic part of his existence: it is something foreign to him, embedded in his being, constantly threatening to take over. Dayraven wrestles mightily with the internal struggle that this creates, trying to harness the elven power for good. In this way, Philip Chase has also captured the essence of Frodo’s conflict in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, another Christ allegory where the power of the One Ring is an evil that threatens to consume Frodo’s own identity.Like Frodo, Dayraven must consider if he is willing and able to make the ultimate sacrifice for others. Humanity is capable of such deep love and beauty but also terrifying evils. After the War of the Way from the last book, the world of Return to Edan is rife with violence and disease. An outside observer like the elf might justifiably ponder if a species that has caused so much suffering and destruction is truly worth saving. Is humanity just an irredeemable cancer on the face of the planet?Grimdark fans will find much to love in Return to Edan. Set in a dark and brutal world, Philip Chase doesn’t shy away from realistic depictions of violence and the shadows of war. The rawness depicted in several scenes made me wince in pain. There is also moral ambiguity, as Dayraven’s powers are both wondrous and terrifying: he could end up being either a savior or a destroyer. In this sense, Philip Chase threatens to subvert the chosen one trope in a manner that could potentially go the way of Frank Herbert’s Dune Messiah.Continuing the trend in the characters’ personal journeys, both eastern and western theologies are reflected in Philip Chase’s concept of Edan, which seems to encompass both the Buddhist notion of nirvana and the Biblical notion of paradise (“Eden”) as a state without suffering or sin. But Chase also astutely captures the inherent tension between loving human attachments and the emotional detachment required to achieve such a state.My  barely scratches the surface of Return to Edan. The Edan Trilogy can be read on multiple levels, and a complete analysis is more worthy of a Ph.D. dissertation than a short  such as this. But putting aside such in-depth analysis, I should emphasize that Philip Chase also delivers a perfectly paced story with beautiful prose and engaging, empathetic characters.Taken as a whole, the Edan Trilogy is a modern masterpiece, a lamentation as timeless and beautiful as the stained glass depicted on each of its three covers. With the Edan Trilogy, Philip Chase proves that fantasy can achieve the highest echelon of literary greatness while delivering a gripping story, epic in scope and deeply personal in its impact....more",Notes are private!,2,87,1,"Sep 07, 2023","Sep 12, 2023","Aug 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/196301282-return-to-edan

Stuart soars to magnificent new heights with Lord and King, the third volume of his Drowned Kingdom Saga inspired by the legend of Atlantis. The first book of the series, A Drowned Kingdom, introduces us to Prince Othrun and the events leading up to the dramatic submersion of his island kingdom. The second book, The Last of the Atalanteans, follows Othrun as he builds a new kingdom in a foreign land, together with the remaining 1,800 Atalantean survivors who escaped the Drowned Kingdom.Lord and King finds Othrun as the newly crowned King of Eastrealm, trying to strike a balance between strict Atalantean values and the divergent views of the local populace. For Othrun the mission is divine, sent by his angelic father to spread the religion of his Single God throughout a land of pagans.As king, Othrun seems well poised to live up to the Atalantean reputation as ruthless conquerors and colonizers. Othrun is obsessed with crafting his legacy, both through present-day political manipulation and by rewriting history to conform to his bigoted views. Othrun is intent on erasing inconvenient truths from his people’s history.I remain in awe of P.L. Stuart as a writer, especially the way he captures immense emotional and psychological depth with prose that is eminently readable. Stuart also manages to keep up an exhilarating pace throughout Lord and King from the opening prologue through the final page. With each book in the series, Stuart further refines his craft.My favorite character in Lord and King is Aliaz, Othrun’s wife who is now expecting their first child and heir to the throne. Aliaz is the perfect foil to Othrun: kind, honest, tolerant, and considerate of those coming from different backgrounds. She is also a pragmatist, understanding when compromises need to be made for the benefit of the kingdom.Despite his significant flaws, Othrun is surprisingly self-reflective. Othrun’s introspective nature is evident early in the novel when he asks Aliaz, “Am I a good king?” and then, “Am I a good man?” Othrun seems genuine in asking these questions, and Aliaz offers her honest answers.Lord and King is brimming with scenes that provide new perspectives on events from the first two books of the series. Stuart’s use of foreshadowing is brilliant, truly astounding me at around the halfway point of the novel.I’ve described the Drowned Kingdom Saga as a dark fantasy series in each of my s. But could it also be described as grimdark? Here at Grimdark Magazine we use the working definition of grimdark as “a grim story told in a dark world by a morally ambiguous protagonist or anti-hero.” In that sense, the Drowned Kingdom Saga truly is grimdark. Although P.L. Stuart eschews the ultraviolence found in many grimdark novels, there is still plenty of excellent action in this series. But with its primary focus on the evolution of Othrun’s mental state, I’d argue that the Drowned Kingdom Saga can most appropriately be classified as psychological grimdark. It’s the type of story that Fyodor Dostoevsky would write if he were into fantasy.Othrun also experiences an unexpected amount of character growth in Lord and King, suggesting that the Drowned Kingdom Saga might ultimately be a tale of redemption comparable to Mark Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy. At this point, I could see Othrun going either way.P.L. Stuart truly knocked this one out of the park, as Lord and King is outstanding in every respect. The Drowned Kingdom Saga is highly recommended for grimdark fans and anyone who enjoys a deeply thought-provoking, character-driven fantasy. The story will continue with A Lion’s Pride, the fourth book which also marks the midpoint of the planned seven-book series....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Aug 10, 2023","Aug 10, 2023","Aug 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/93891433-lord-and-king

Newell puts the fun back in dark fantasy with The Forbidden Realms, the exhilarating second volume of her Fallen Light series and the follow-up to her highly accomplished debut novel, Curse of the Fallen. I will keep this  100% spoiler-free for people who have not yet read Curse of the Fallen.As in Curse of the Fallen, the lead heroine of the story is Nerana Leithor, or Neer for short, a young woman imbued with magical powers, including the ability to teleport short distances. But magic is forbidden in the land of Laeroth, making Neer the target of religious fanatics and rulers in the human-controlled territories.Neer is an absolute joy to read: strong but vulnerable, funny but with a deep-seated sadness carrying over from events in the first book. In The Forbidden Realms, Neer finds herself stranded in the desert wastelands of Aragoth without any of her companions from Curse of the Fallen.The Forbidden Realms introduces us to a new point-of-view character, the powerful elvish sorceress Aélla, as well as a delightful cast of supporting characters who have more than a few surprises in store for our heroine. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about getting a whole new setting and cast of characters in The Forbidden Realms, but I quickly became attached to the new characters and their rip-roading adventure.The Forbidden Realms is much faster paced compared to Curse of the Fallen. H.C. Newell delivers a constant stream of action which keeps the reader on the edge of their seat:“Neer curled on top of the ground, gasping for breath. The burning in her veins had reduced to a low simmering heat. Her muscles were rigid and hard to move, and she reached shakily for her sword, just out of reach.”Beyond the heart-pounding action scenes, there are also plenty of emotional moments:“Leaning onto his shoulder, she closed her eyes and was comforted by his embrace as he wrapped his arm around her back. They sat in a comfortable silence for the rest of the morning, and for the first time in months, she knew she wasn’t alone.”H.C. Newell is a natural storyteller, and her writing is the perfect match for this dark tale. The story includes some rather gruesome action scenes that are never gratuitous but will delight even the most skeptical grimdark reader.Newell’s worldbuilding in The Forbidden Realms is also outstanding, a Tolkienesque nightmare with an undercurrent of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Newell builds an impressive depth of lore in her series, with plenty of nuance and Easter eggs that will reward the careful reader.I still have mixed feelings about Newell’s use of footnotes to explain some of the worldbuilding elements. While it’s great to learn these additional pieces of history and lore, it would have been preferable to incorporate this information into the main text of the novel somehow.H.C. Newell improves upon her craft in every way with The Forbidden Realms, delivering a fast-paced epic adventure that is equal parts dark and delicious.

Tamsin works for the shady tech firm Myrica Dynamic in the fictional Silicon Valley-inspired San Siroco.The city of San Siroco is sinking for unknown reasons, which may or may not be related to research at Myrica Dynamic. Tamsin discovers that her basement is sinking at a faster rate than the city itself. The plot thickens when Tamsin finds a strange door that has materialized in her basement.Ever the meticulous scientist, Tamsin develops hypotheses around these strange phenomena, making careful observations and measurements to find a rational solution for these mysteries. But her corporate overlords at Myrica Dynamic constantly peer over her shoulder, making sure that she does nothing to tarnish the company’s image.Last to Leave the Room suffers from inconsistent pacing. The first part of the book is a slog, with far too much focus on Tamsin’s corporate meetings and domestic chores, all of which seem especially tiresome as told in the novel’s unadorned present-tense narration.Fortunately, Last to Leave the Room takes off as Tamsin discovers a doppelgänger who appears to be a mirror image of herself. The original mystery of the sinking city is pushed aside as the book’s focus shifts toward Tamsin’s double.The horror elements of the story build slowly, and I found the novel to be quite engrossing in the latter half, which offers plenty of unexpected plot twists. By the end, the novel is hard to put down.Last to Leave the Room is at its best when Caitlin Starling focuses on questions of personal identity, including which qualities define us uniquely as individual humans. Tamsin’s treatment of identity recalls that of The Double, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s original masterpiece of doppelgänger fiction. Tamsin follows essentially the same character arc as Dostoevsky’s protagonist in The Double: the main character and doppelgänger begin as friends, but then the protagonist gradually loses their identity to the double. Like Dostoevsky, Starling offers a thought-provoking assessment of identity with no clear answers.The blend of science fiction and horror around a doppelgänger motif also recalls the movie adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer’s Annihilation. But while VanderMeer considers accelerated mutation within the realm of biology, Caitlin Starling focuses primarily on the physical sciences.In the end, Last to Leave the Room rewards the patient reader with its unique and thought-provoking fusion of science fiction and psychological horror. However, the novel would benefit from more consistent pacing and a tighter focus on the doppelgänger motif....more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Aug 13, 2023","Oct 19, 2023","Aug 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65213922-last-to-leave-the-room

Among the casualties of the Magiclysm are friends of the novel’s lead protagonist, the humanborn Kaja Modrzewska.Ten years after the Magicylsm, a terrorist attack threatens to destroy the fragile peace between the humanborn and mythborn communities. There’s plenty of action and intrigue as Kaja navigates the opposing communities, who are all too eager to blame each other for any wrongdoing. A perpetual outsider, Kaja questions her loyalties as she tries to avert a reignited war in her adopted homeland of Ireland, now known as Eireland.Humanborn is well-written, but it falls into many of the standard young adult tropes that I find tiring, such as the sassy not-like-other-girls protagonist who finds herself as an outsider in a war-torn world. I was hoping for something more unique to pull me into the story. While this is a cut from SPFBO9, I do think that young adult fantasy fans will enjoy Humanborn, especially if they are interested in an Irish urban setting.

I can say this with authority, having spent time in both.”The New World continues the story of Mark Lawrence’s fantasy odd couple, Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, after the conclusion of his brilliant Red Queen’s War trilogy, which began with Prince of Fools and continued with The Liar’s Key and The Wheel of Osheim. Previously included as part of The Red Queen’s War omnibus from Grim Oak Press, The New World is now available as a standalone novella through Amazon.Formerly a playboy prince, Jalan has been appointed a cardinal by Pope Gomst III. Yes, apparently Father Gomst from the Broken Empire trilogy has received a promotion since his Emperor of Thorns days.The premise of The New World is that Cardinal Jalan is sent on a voyage to America, nominally to serve as a missionary. The story itself revolves around the journey rather than the destination:“The good thing about being a cardinal was that I got the biggest cabin on the ship. The bad thing was that I was in a cabin. On a ship.”The story itself is a lot of fun. There’s seasickness, mutiny, and even some of Lawrence’s subtle Star Trek humor (not necessarily in that order). I laughed out loud several times while reading The New World, particularly during Jalan’s ill-fated chess match:“I’m a cardinal! I push bishops around for a living.”Mark Lawrence fans who enjoy playing “I Spy a Taproot” will be more than satisfied with this novella, which also features appearances by the enigmatic Dr. Elias Taproot, the key character who unifies Mark Lawrence’s greater universe across his trilogies.If you love the Red Queen’s War trilogy as much as I do, be sure to check out The New World. Jalan is such a vibrant narrator, always bursting with incisive humor, self-deprecating and otherwise.

As with her first novel, Vampires of El Norte combines elements of horror, romance, and historical fiction to create a chilling tale in an historical Mexican setting.Vampires of El Norte alternates perspectives between Nena and Néstor, an adolescent couple in northeastern Mexico in 1837. Tensions are rising between the local Mexican ranchers and Anglo settlers who are crossing the border from Texas.Meanwhile, Nena is fascinated by her grandmother’s folktales, which are haunted by menacing nocturnal creatures that suck the blood of their victims and leave them to die.A nighttime tryst gone terribly awry causes Nena and Néstor to separate for nine long years. Néstor drowns his sorrows in a life of debauchery, while Nena trains as a healer in the art of folk remedies.Nena and Néstor unexpectedly reunite as the Anglos bring full-scale war to Mexico. But can Nena forgive Néstor for abandoning her and succumbing to a life of vice? A possibly rekindled romance is set against the shadows of the Mexican-American War and the constant fear of an unspeakable horror.Isabel Cañas manages a careful balance between the romantic and horror aspects of the novel. In my view, the first and last portions of the book strike just the right balance. However, the middle part of the novel takes a lighter romantic tone that left me craving something darker.Oral traditions play an important role throughout Vampires of El Norte, lending a folk horror aspect to the novel. I especially enjoyed the author’s unique representation of vampires, which is genuinely terrifying at first and later adopts a more melancholic feel. Isabel Cañas delivers one of the most creative and compelling depictions of vampires that I have read in a long time.Another highlight of Vampires of El Norte is its mid-nineteenth century setting during the Mexican-American war, which Isabel Cañas leverages to draw parallels between fictional creatures of horror and the real-life terrors of nationalistic aggression and war. Vampires of El Norte is an excellent example of how fantastic elements can help enhance our understanding of historical tragedies and their impact on both the individuals involved and society as a whole.Vampires of El Norte is compulsively readable, blending the usually disparate genres of horror, romance, and historical fiction all in one compelling Weird Western story.

The Pyres of Vengeance continues the story of Selene, who is now pregnant and about to give birth, fighting to stay alive in a land full of violent monsters and religious zealotry.The Pyres of Vengeance represents a seismic shift in tone compared to the first book of the series, especially with the introduction of Richter, a new point-of-view character who is the embodiment of all the most terrible things you can imagine, and probably a bit more. Normally I don’t pay much attention to trigger warnings, but here I suggest that readers take them seriously, as The Pyres of Vengeance includes sexual abuse, rape, pedophilia, infanticide, and plenty of extreme violence.Personally, I found the change of tone between The Sword of Mercy and Wrath and The Pyres of Vengeance to be quite jarring. Koussis uses The Pyres of Vengeance to make social commentary about sexual abuse, including that of children and disabled people. His commentary is undeniably effective, but it is probably too much to take for many readers, and the nonstop onslaught of violence, especially sexual violence, becomes gratuitous in many places.NC Koussis has largely abandoned the gray morality of The Sword of Mercy and Wrath, focusing more on the pitch-black soul of Richter. One of my favorite parts of The Sword of Mercy and Wrath is the internal struggle experienced by lead protagonist Selene as she tries to find her identity in a world that has taken part of her body and manipulated her mind. Selene’s character development was outstanding in The Sword of Mercy and Wrath. Although she struggles with becoming a new mother in The Pyres of Vengeance, the main conflicts in the book are external rather than internal, which isn’t quite as compelling for me.On the topic of external conflict, there is plenty of werewolf action in The Pyres of Vengeance. NC Koussis maintains excellent pacing throughout the novel, and the action scenes are particularly well written. Koussis should again be commended for his representation of a lead heroine with a physical disability. Selene’s disability neither defines her as a character nor limits her action in any way.In case there was any doubt that The Pyres of Vengeance is grimdark to the core, the book also features Michael R. Fletcher’s interdimensional grimdark tavern, the Dripping Bucket. Introduced by Fletcher in Black Stone Heart , the Dripping Bucket also appears in books by Peter McLean, Ryan Cahill, Alicia Wanstall-Burke, Sarah Chorn, Clayton W. Snyder, Krystle Matar, and J.E. Hannaford.To me, reading The Pyres of Vengeance feels like listening to Jane’s Addiction’s debut album, Nothing’s Shocking, with Perry Farrell repeatedly yelling “Sex is violent!” over music that is somehow both messy and overindulgent in its artistry, yet strangely compelling in its own unique way.Overall, The Pyres of Vengeance is an extremely dark fantasy that forgoes the subtleties of gray morality in favor of a brutal representation of violence and abuse. This may be appreciated by many readers, but personally, I hope that NC Koussis will return to a more nuanced approach in the third volume of his Swords of Dominion series. Grimdark should not be defined in terms of its depiction of extreme violence; rather, it should provide an allegory for hope in a world full of complex morality....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 05, 2023","Jul 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63899154-the-pyres-of-vengeance

The main action in “Overdue” takes place in independent bookshops, focusing on the store owners’ love of literature and their relative isolation from society. All bookstores need a cat, and “Overdue” opens with Wentworth, the feline of unusual size from The Book That Wouldn’t Burn. Wentworth is based on Mark Lawrence’s own cat, Wobble, a Maine Coon who may intimidate even the fiercest mountain lion. “Overdue” also has guest appearances by two other animal friends from The Book That Wouldn’t Burn: the pitch-black dog, Volente, and the raven whose name I shall not reveal.Mark Lawrence blew away my expectations with “Overdue.” I expected “Overdue” to be a simple story about an oversized cat going on an adventure. But “Overdue” is so much more: it’s a touching tale full of nuance and emotion, and one of Mark Lawrence’s best short stories to date. Last year, I published a listicle of Top Ten Mark Lawrence Short Stories over at Grimdark Magazine. “Overdue” easily falls within the top five on that list. The plot is more complex than I had anticipated, as Mark Lawrence constructs a circle of literary influence that transcends geographical and temporal boundaries. The interwoven nature of the tale beautifully conveys how aspiring authors can discover inspiration in the most unlikely sources. I particularly enjoyed the unexpected symmetry of inspiration presented in “Overdue,” which left a great emotional impact on par with Lawrence’s best stories.Although “Overdue” is set in the same universe as the Library Trilogy, it’s not strictly necessary to read The Book That Wouldn’t Burn before picking up this short story. There are no spoilers here that would lessen your enjoyment of The Book That Wouldn’t Burn, and other than the trio of animal friends, there is only one overlapping character: the kindly and enigmatic librarian, Yute. All the other characters are self-contained within the short story. Hence, “Overdue” can be enjoyed as a standalone tale, although readers who are already familiar with The Book That Wouldn’t Burn will appreciate many subtle and not-so-subtle references made within this short story. A deep love of literature connects us all in the bookish community, a bond that manifests poignantly in “Overdue” as Wentworth helps lonely booklovers find both inspiration and companionship. “Overdue” is an ode to the power of literature which binds us together. This short story is a must-read for fans of The Book That Wouldn’t Burn and highly recommended for anyone who shares Mark Lawrence’s passion for the written word....more",Notes are private!,0,114,1,"Jun 28, 2023","Jun 28, 2023","Jun 28, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/181696679-overdue

The Bram Stoker Award-nominated author adopts an entirely epistolary format for The Once Yellow House, with the story told through a combination of diary entries, newspaper clippings, and transcripts of audio recordings. The plot of The Once Yellow House focuses on the events leading up to the Yellow Massacre of 2020, in which 347 members of a cult known as “The Retinue” were brutally killed on a property in upstate New York called the Once Yellow House. The Once Yellow House was owned by a married couple, Thomas and Hope Gloucester. Thomas is presumed dead from the Yellow Massacre, while Hope is now missing and needed for questioning.Thomas originally started The Retinue online, gaining a following that somehow expanded exponentially after he and Hope moved into the Once Yellow House. Before long, cult members gathered to camp out in their yard, treating Thomas as a divine figure.This epistolary style of The Once Yellow House is especially effective at revealing bits of information, allowing readers the chance to put together pieces of the puzzle. Gemma Amor also makes brilliant use of this format to delve into the minds of her two main protagonists: the presumably widowed Hope and one of the few cult survivors, known only as Once Yellow Kate. Hope and Kate are both murky about the events leading up to the Yellow Massacre and must rely on each other’s perspectives to piece together the full story.I particularly enjoyed the discussions between Hope and Kate comparing art and religion. As an artist, Hope interprets many of the occultist practices in terms of artforms, noting how both art and religion embrace symbolism. Moreover, both famous artists and religious leaders earn followers who fervently await their every word.I also appreciated Gemma Amor’s incorporation of artwork throughout the book, which provides another dimension of disquiet as we try to grasp the true nature of Hope’s situation. All of the artwork in The Once Yellow House, including the cover, were made by the author herself.Through her believable and somehow relatable characters, Gemma Amor explores themes of emotional abuse and the corruption of love. The unsettling elements of The Once Yellow House span a range of psychological and cosmic horror, as well as truly grotesque body horror. This book is definitely not for the squeamish.The Once Yellow House also serves as Gemma Amor’s love letter to the color yellow. Yellow is the color of happiness, light, energy, and friendship, but also the color of caution, cowardice, and deceit. I enjoyed reading Hope’s musings on these multifaceted meanings of yellow in art. Hope is particularly attracted by Vincent van Gogh’s prolific use of yellow in his paintings, reflecting on how his choice of color scheme mirrored his evolving mental state.Gemma Amor’s writing is perfect, as usual, with a keen attention to detail. As an upstate New York native, I was pleasantly surprised to see that she even used our correct telephone area code in the novel.Gemma Amor is one of my favorite horror authors, and The Once Yellow House only reinforces that view. The Once Yellow House is both a brilliantly constructed puzzle and a first-rate work of art....more",Notes are private!,2,89,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jun 27, 2023","Jun 27, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/123220572-the-once-yellow-house

Sullivan that provides a heinous twist on the classic haunted house theme while delivering equal doses of hilarity and horror. As the novel opens, the young Saban family moves into a newly constructed home in an unfinished, isolated neighborhood. Despite being new, the house seems to be falling apart, starting with an enormous crack that Trent and Rita Saban discover in their walk-in closet. The crack itself is concerning, but not nearly as disturbing as what they find hidden inside.To address these problems, Trent consults a series of YouTube videos by Handyman Hank. The YouTube star apparently has the solution to every problem, extending well beyond the domain of home repair.But Hank also promotes old-fashioned toxic masculinity through subliminal messages that are readily absorbed by Trent. Handyman Hank becomes an increasingly nefarious figure as the book progresses, with his videos becoming more personalized for Trent’s specific situations. Before long, Trent is a pickup truck-driving, contractor card-carrying tough guy complaining to his disbelieving wife that she doesn’t understand how difficult it is to be a man.The Handyman Method is a cutting satire of home improvement culture, featuring several side-splitting trips to Home Depot that highlight the one-upmanship of the Y chromosome crowd who compete to display the highest levels of testosterone-fueled manliness.The Handyman Method is both a hilarious and horrifying read. I couldn’t stop laughing at the authors’ brutal takedown of Infowars-style toxic masculinity. At the same time, there are some truly excruciating scenes that made me wince in pain. This is the rare horror book that elicits genuine tears of both agony and laughter.The collaboration between Nick Cutter and Andrew F. Sullivan is seamless.

Burgess. As I got older, I became captivated by the brilliant Redwall middle grade fantasy series by Brian Jacques. The characters all seemed surprisingly human in their challenges and aspirations, making them highly relatable, especially for young wildlife-loving readers.As an adult, I didn’t realize how much I missed such stories. With The Builders, Daniel Polansky has written the grimdark animal adventure that I didn’t know I needed. Polansky packs loads of fun in this short novel, which clocks in at just over two hundred pages.I’m not sure how mice became the de facto lead protagonists in anthropomorphized animal adventure stories. Is it because mice are especially vulnerable creatures with no special abilities to defend themselves other than their own quick wits?Daniel Polansky embraces the mouse-as-lead protagonist trope in The Builders with the Captain, a grizzled mouse soldier, who assembles a ragtag team of adventurers in his pursuit of revenge. Besides the mousey Captain, The Magnificent Seven-style team consists of a stoat, an opossum, a badger, a salamander, a mole, and an owl.My favorite character, by far, is Bonsoir, who is both a stoat and a Frenchman:“A Frenchman, as any Frenchman will tell you, is a difficult condition to abide, as much a privilege as a responsibility. To maintain the appropriate standards of excellence, this superlative of grace, was a burden not so light even in the homeland, and immeasurably more difficult in the colonies. Being both French and a stoat had resulted in a more or less constant crisis of self-identity—one which Bonsoir often worked to resolve, in classic Gallic fashion, via monologue.”The Builders is a fast-paced thrill ride of action as the motley crew face their odious, odorous skunk enemy. The story is instantly absorbing, a testament to Daniel Polansky’s outstanding writing, which is full of dark wit, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Personally, I found The Builders to be unputdownable, devouring the entire book in one afternoon. Daniel Polansky left me hungry for more in this world. I hope he will follow up with more adventures featuring this delightful cast of characters....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Jun 22, 2023","Jun 23, 2023","Jun 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25667920-the-builders

You go your whole life thinking you’re the protagonist, but really, you’re just backstory.”The Refrigerator Monologues is Catherynne M. Valente’s incisive takedown of the common mistreatment of female characters in comic books, who are often treated as disposable objects to stimulate the protective instincts of male superheroes so they can further their own character development. With The Refrigerator Monologues, Valente has created her own compelling universe of superheroes, villains, and side characters to drive home her point in spectacular fashion.Women in Refrigerators Syndrome, or simply “fridging” for short, is a literary trope where female characters are assaulted, injured, disabled, killed, or depowered for the sole purpose of advancing the male protagonist’s story arc. Comic book author Gail Simone originally coined the term in 1999 as she highlighted the ubiquity of this sexist trope. Simone cited a specific Green Lantern comic as an example, wherein the eponymous hero returns home to find his girlfriend murdered and stuffed into a refrigerator. Simone has since compiled a long list of instances of fridging across a wide variety of comic books.The Refrigerator Monologues consists of six interconnected short stories told from the perspectives of female characters who have been fridged under various traumatic circumstances. All six women—Polly, Paige, Julia, Blue Bayou, Daisy, and Samantha—are now deceased and living in Deadtown, where they have created a support group known as the Hell Hath Club to share each other’s tales of misery, including a literal fridging:“I belong in the refrigerator. Because the truth is, I’m just food for a superhero. He’ll eat up my death and get the energy he needs to become a legend.”Catherynne M. Valente’s writing is brutally incisive in recounting each woman’s story. The women’s justifiable anger is matched by a forlorn sense of the inevitability of their fates:“What’s the difference between being dead and having a boyfriend? Death sticks around.”Although it feels like the violence depicted in these stories is exaggerated to make a point, it’s not any worse than what has been incorporated into many mainstream comics. But Valente presents a more honest account of this violence from the perspective of the victims.While most of the attention is on fridging in comic books, this trope occurs throughout literature and in other forms of media more broadly. My only minor complaint with The Refrigerator Monologues is the inclusion of a character known as “Grimdark” who is driven entirely by gratuitous violence. While this is clearly intended as a general criticism of grimdark fantasy, I’d argue that it’s a mischaracterization of the genre. Although there is plenty of fridging in grimdark novels, the genre itself is not nihilistic violence porn: good quality grimdark is full of nuance, offering glimmers of hope in an uncaring world.Each story in The Refrigerator Monologues packs a powerful punch. The book also features internal comic book-style artwork from Annie Wu, which is the perfect accompaniment to Valente’s writing.Reading The Refrigerator Monologues is truly an eye-opening experience, especially since fridging is part of a broader objectification of women in media. The Refrigerator Monologues is the type of book that will leave a permanent mark on its readers....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Jun 20, 2023","Jun 22, 2023","Jun 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32714267-the-refrigerator-monologues

Bledla argues that his control over the dragons is “irrefutable proof of Edan’s blessing” in support of his blood-soaked war.While The Prophet of Edan is full of exhilarating dragon-fueled battle sequences, this outward action is balanced by a delicate introspection that showcases some of Philip Chase’s most lyrical prose to date, especially as he recounts lead protagonist Dayraven’s journey of self-discovery.Throughout literary history, ravens symbolize wisdom, magic, and understanding, often acting as psychopomps that connect the physical world with the spiritual realm. In Greek mythology, the raven is also a symbol of Apollo, the god of prophecy, providing a direct connection with The Prophet of Edan. Philip Chase is also heavily influenced by Welsh mythology, where ravens represent bravery during battle. Even today, a flock of ravens guards the Tower of London; a superstition dating back to the English Civil War states that, if the ravens are removed, the entire Kingdom of England will fall.Dayraven’s path toward enlightenment is, for me, the highlight of The Prophet of Edan. Dayraven is torn between earthly pleasures and embracing his call toward something greater, afraid of losing his attachments while also recognizing the need to detach himself for the benefit of those he loves.There is a strong Buddhist element to Dayraven’s training, which evokes the lyrical reflections of Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse’s masterpiece of self-discovery. The mystical introspection of The Prophet of Edan also reminds me of the journey of enlightenment in Haruki Murakami’s The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, where the main protagonist seeks inner truth in a world full of cruelty.Dayraven’s internal struggles pit his own identity versus that of the elf-shard, which became embedded within him in The Way of Edan. Dayraven often feels like the elven will is somehow taunting or controlling him. As he strives for deeper meaning, Dayraven oscillates between fighting this magic inside him and accepting its presence. Dayraven’s journey of self-discovery is set against the seemingly unstoppable Torrlond war machine, where Bledla exploits Torrlonders’ faith as a rationale for military and political conquest. Bledla’s outward manifestation of magic is juxtaposed with Dayraven’s internal quest toward finding the magic within himself. The conflict between Bledla and Dayraven also highlights the contrast between organized religion and a more personal spirituality, especially when the former becomes a perversion of the faith that it supposedly professes. In many ways, The Prophet of Edan also serves as a commentary on the inadequacy of any religion to decipher the full mysteries of the universe.Moving beyond this spiritual commentary, another highlight of The Prophet of Edan is the relationship between Dayraven and Sequara, a young sorceress and future queen who is wise beyond her years. Sequara forms a special bond with Dayraven and helps him to find his own inner truth. I was truly touched by the development of their relationship throughout the book, which left me in tears by the end.Philip Chase also excels in worldbuilding, having created an expansive fantasy world with Eormenlond, which is fully explored in The Prophet of Edan. The Prophet of Edan seems to have a greater influence from George R.R. Martin compared to The Way of Edan. In true style of A Game of Thrones, Philip Chase does an excellent job introducing us to the various cultures and politics across a sprawling world.The pacing of The Prophet of Edan is excellent. I was a bit afraid that the plot would wrap up too cleanly at the end of this second volume, leaving little to be explored in the third book of the trilogy. Fortunately, my concern turned out to be misplaced, and Philip Chase left me eager to continue with Return to Edan, the final volume of the trilogy which will be published this fall.The Prophet of Edan is an instant classic, the perfect follow-up to Philip Chase’s masterful debut, The Way of Edan, and a glorious lamentation that somehow transcends its own epic scope....more",Notes are private!,0,137,1,"Jun 06, 2023","Jun 16, 2023","Jun 06, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/171285064-the-prophet-of-edan

I am delighted to see how Palladino has grown as a writer since publishing his first novel, The Trials of Ashmount. Palladino already showed great promise with his debut, and he has made all the right moves with Buzzard’s Bowl. As with The Trials of Ashmount, Buzzard’s Bowl is told as a third-person narrative from the perspectives of five main protagonists. Palladino has improved upon his already strong character development skills, building layers of complexity and strong emotional connections to each of the lead protagonists. Palladino cites Joe Abercrombie as a key influence, and I can definitely see that inspiration in his outstanding character work. The protagonists of Buzzard’s Bowl are all profoundly broken in different ways; yet each of them is sympathetic and relatable.First up is Edelbrock Brendis, formerly a minor nobleman who, through his own strategic missteps, finds himself as an enslaved gladiator fighting in the Buzzard’s Bowl arena. Edelbrock is a deeply pathetic and tragic figure, drawing equal parts sympathy and repugnance. Edelbrock grows a lot throughout Buzzard’s Bowl while oscillating between depth and shallowness of character.My favorite protagonist from The Trials of Ashmount, Demri Slarn, returns in Buzzard’s Bowl with even more emotional baggage than in the first book. Demri is clearly inspired by Sand dan Glokta, Joe Abercrombie’s greatest creation first introduced in The Blade Itself. Like Glokta, Demri is simultaneously a despicable and sympathetic character who experiences tremendous emotional and physical suffering. Like Edelbrock, Demri occupies the full spectrum of gray morality, keeping the reader guessing as to his intentions and actions.Next is Sera Wintlock, a bird-farming girl who rises to heroism as her family and village are slaughtered. In my previous  of The Trials of Ashmount, I noted the lack of a strong emotional connection with Sera, despite the tragic situations that she endures. This is no longer an issue in Buzzard’s Bowl, as Sera experiences one of the best character arcs in the book, growing as a leader while the emotional trauma from her past finally catches up with her.Another character who fell strangely flat for me in The Trials of Ashmount was Villic the Imbuer, a nomadic warrior from the Camel Clans who is haunted by a mysterious voice in his mind which he calls Speaker. Villic is a revelation in Buzzard’s Bowl. His inner monologue with Speaker is by turns hilarious and tragic. The suffering that Villic endures in Buzzard’s Bowl and his ensuing character growth make him one of the most endearing characters in this second volume of the series.Palladino also introduces a new point-of-view character with Ashen, a former street urchin who masquerades as Lady Hyrel to gain access to the inner circle of a particularly despicable noble. I was immediately drawn to Ashen’s character from the moment she was introduced. She reminds me of Vin from Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn, but with a more grimdark storyline.Buzzard’s Bowl is fast-paced and full of surprises for each of the main characters, especially when their storylines converge. Palladino shines in writing pulse-pounding action sequences. My favorite is the scene captured on the outstanding cover designed by Dusan Markovic , which depicts a flooded Buzzard’s Bowl arena with battling gladiator ships electrified by levitating Magicai wizards. This is one of several epic action sequences in the book.Although I’ve already mentioned Joe Abercrombie, I’d argue that George R.R. Martin has an even greater influence on Buzzard’s Bowl. Like the first three volumes of Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, Palladino manages a sprawling scope and depth of worldbuilding with excellent pacing and a character-driven focus. As with both Abercrombie and Martin, Palladino doesn’t shy away from the raw brutality of his grimdark world.Getting Sarah Chorn on board as editor was also a wise decision, as she has helped bring out the best in Palladino’s writing. In his most impactful moments, Palladino’s prose reminds me of Anna Smith Spark at her most emotionally devastating. This emotional wreckage is balanced by Palladino’s wicked sense of humor, which recalls Scott Lynch’s The Lies of Locke Lamora and had me laughing out loud several times.Overall, John Palladino gleefully embraces the best of grimdark fantasy in Buzzard’s Bowl, which reads in many ways like an irreverent version of A Game of Thrones. Palladino shares Joe Abercombie’s talent at developing broken, morally complex characters, George R.R. Martin’s epic worldbuilding and well-paced story arcs, Scott Lynch’s incisive humor, and the raw emotional impact of Anna Smith Spark. Buzzard’s Bowl firmly establishes John Palladino as one of the most exciting new voices in the grimdark fantasy community.

Ortez is accused of poisoning Everett Day, the greatest mind and most successful entrepreneur in the mining town of Aurora. Also a generous and beloved philanthropist, Everett Day strikes me as a fantasy version of Andrew Carnegie.Trial of the Alchemist alternates between third-person narration of the present-day trial and Alchemist Ortez’s first-person account of the events leading up to Everett Day’s untimely demise. Ortez recounts how he was initially called to Aurora to investigate a serious accident during the mining of cobrium, the key ore enabling Aurora’s recent advances in electricity and other modern technology.The magical elements of Trial of the Alchemist are alchemical in nature. There are three kinds of alchemists presented in the book: psycho-alchemists such as Ortez, legal alchemists who assist with the integrity of the justice system, and research alchemists working toward the next alchemical discovery. During the trial, Ortez is forced to take an elixir that allows Alchemist Freya, a legal alchemist, to access Ortez’s mind in a lucid dreamlike state to ensure the veracity of his account.Trevor Melanson’s background in journalism shines throughout Trial of the Alchemist.

Balstrup and a semi-finalist in Mark Lawrence’s ninth Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO9).A psychic priesthood known as the Intercessors oversees blood rites and spiritual purity in the Seven Lands of Velspar. The Intercessor priests can probe individual minds, leveling harsh punishment against those with sinful “red” thoughts. The unchallenged religious authority of the Intercessors leads to their heightened political influence, which puts them on a collision course with the elite Skalen families who rule Velspar.The Way of Unity is built around a central event known as the Fire, a fateful attack by the Intercessors that leaves Skalen Sybilla of Vaelnyr as its sole survivor. Sybilla rises to power in the painful aftermath of the Fire, intent on religious reform and pursuing justice against the Intercessors. However, a rogue Intercessor is bent on Sybilla’s own destruction. The Way of Unity is told from multiple points of view, but Sybilla steals the show as the most compelling and well-developed character in the book. She is emotionally complex and may be either lionized as Velspar’s great reformer or vilified as its worst heretic.Sarah K. Balstrup excels in her nuanced worldbuilding. Of particular note is the Meridian, a magical headband that prevents intrusion into one’s thoughts and also hampers the wearer’s psychic vision and sensory perception. The Meridian is also used as a symbol of personal autonomy.Balstrup’s prose is beautiful and well-polished, conveying a sense of gloomy mysticism throughout the story. Although The Way of Unity emphasizes religion as its main theme, there is also a touch of romance, which is tastefully done and helps in the development of Sybilla as a character.On the downside, The Way of Unity is marred by overly stiff dialogue and a disjointed flow, with sudden jumps in time between chapters that make the plot confusing to follow in places. Overall, The Way of Unity would benefit by devoting more time to exposition and building smoother transitions between chapters.

Stuart’s masterful debut novel, A Drowned Kingdom, a fantasy inspired by the mythology of Atlantis. A Drowned Kingdom asks the question: when the most powerful country in the world is swallowed by the sea, can a new kingdom rise again?The novel opens with a colonialist mission conducted by the First and Second Princes of the island kingdom of Atalanyx. While their objective is obviously political, they use religion to justify their actions, having the goal of converting pagans from their polytheistic religion to the one true God of Atalanyx. The monotheistic Atalantean religion is represented by the sign of the triangle and the circle, as depicted on the minimalistic cover of the novel.A Drowned Kingdom is told as a first-person narrative by Othrun, the Second Prince of Atalantyx and half-brother of First Prince Erthal, heir to the kingdom. P.L. Stuart’s decision to employ single-perspective first-person narration works very effectively, although it is often discomforting being stuck inside the head of a despicable character such as Othrun. It doesn’t take long for Othrun to reveal his racism, misogyny, and religious intolerance.Being inside Othrun’s head creates a morality distortion field on par with some of the greatest grimdark protagonists. But P.L. Stuart’s approach is also unique with the deeply religious influences on Othrun’s reasoning. Othrun’s belief in the Atalantean religion with its one true God seems genuine, but there are moments when his religious fervor may cross over into delirium. Othrun’s faith-based explanations for major events in the novel push him further into zealotry. P.L. Stuart has done a marvelous job plumbing the depths of Othrun’s psychology as he justifies treachery and sets himself on a path toward possible tyranny.A Drowned Kingdom is also heavy on politics, and P.L. Stuart is adept at capturing the nuances of political interactions and the subtle games that people play to give themselves an advantage. Although this is his debut novel, P.L. Stuart writes like a well-seasoned veteran. His prose has a gravitas that feels Biblical in some parts and like a historical diary in others. Despite its formality, Stuart’s prose is remarkably accessible, captivating me from the first page. The story itself is a slow burn but methodically paced.P.L. Stuart is a master of characterization. The worldbuilding in A Drowned Kingdom is exceptionally well done. Yet this is just the tip of the iceberg, as our view is limited by Othrun’s unreliable tunnel vision.Overall, A Drowned Kingdom is a remarkable debut that will appeal equally to grimdark and classic epic fantasy fans.

Witch King marks her much-anticipated return to fantasy after completing her Books of the Raksura series.Kai, the eponymous Witch King, is a powerful demon with a necromancy-type magic enabling him to occupy the bodies of deceased mortals. As the novel opens, Kai slowly regains consciousness to find that his mortal body has been murdered and his spirit is imprisoned in some sort of water cage:“Waking was floating to the surface of a soft world of water, not what Kai had expected. Reaching out in that darkness, he found a cold, black sea ebbing and flowing, dropping away like a tide rolling out. Something was wrong with his body, everything was impossibly distant.”Witch King alternates between two timelines. In the present day, Kai tries to piece together the puzzle of who betrayed him. The present-day timeline is interspersed with chapters from the past, showing a more powerful Kai imposing his will on the world. Clues from the past timeline help to inform the reader about the present-day narrative.Kai is a fascinating character who exhibits a wry sense of humor, making Witch King fun to read in places, such as in the following exchange:“I didn’t know you were a…demon.”“You idiot. I’m the demon.”Despite these humorous moments, most of Witch King is a dry read that fails to establish much meaningful connection to the world or characters. Although Kai exhibits sparks of charisma, the other characters mostly fall flat.Martha Wells’s writing is solid, but Witch King suffers from slow pacing and a dense, disengaging style that makes the book a struggle to read. As a result, I never felt fully invested in the story or characters.There are hints of great worldbuilding in Witch King, but unfortunately it is never fully developed in a satisfying way. Martha Wells drops the reader into the world at the beginning of the story, but her approach generates more questions than answers. Overall, the worldbuilding feels surprisingly shallow, and Witch King proves to be an unnecessarily challenging read where the payoff is not commensurate with the effort involved.Despite its intriguing premise and flashes of sardonic humor, Witch King fails to deliver a story with enough depth or emotional connection for me to care as a reader.

The novella is set in the stormy town of Aloisville, an isolated village with fewer than two hundred inhabitants whose memories are rinsed away with every raindrop.The story is told as a series of journal entries by sixty-three-year-old Laverne, a retired doctor who keeps a diary as a “backup brain.” Suspecting chemical contamination of the water, Laverne conducts experiments in puddles and her bathtub to test the effects on her own memory.Aloisville is also under a suspicious military quarantine. It is unclear whether the quarantine is meant for the safety of the Aloisville residents or to prevent them from spreading news of their dire situation.Laverne experiences few human interactions in Nothing but the Rain and struggles to remember people’s names. Her main interactions are with a distrusting neighbor, Katie, and her young daughter, Zoe.Although written as a dystopian sci-fi story about environmental disaster, Nothing but the Rain also serves as an allegory for the onset of dementia:“Sometimes I wish I could forget what’s been happening. Then I remember that’s what I’m most afraid of.”Naomi Salman expertly probes the link between memory and sanity. Laverne is afraid of forgetting, and the loss of memory makes her paranoid. Yet the suppression of memory can also act as a coping mechanism for those who have undergone trauma.Nothing but the Rain further examines the lengths to which people will go to exploit memory loss in others. In this way, Nothing but the Rain explores a spectrum of gray morality that mirrors the perpetually gray, rainy days of Aloisville. Naomi Salman’s writing is spare and haunting. Nothing but the Rain makes expert use of unreliable narration to keep the reader guessing and to bring an unexpectedly satisfying conclusion to the story.The worldbuilding in Nothing but the Rain is slight but captivating. Naomi Salman employs the minimal level of worldbuilding necessary to tell her story, which works quite effectively for this short novella. Still, the end of the novella came too soon for my taste, leaving me thirsty for more time in this world. Additional material would deepen the themes already presented in this excellent novella and create an even more immersive experience.Naomi Salman’s debut novella is delicate yet disturbing. Memories may fade, but Nothing but the Rain will linger with me for a long time....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"May 21, 2023","Jun 03, 2023","May 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60784307-nothing-but-the-rain

StuartMy complete  is published at Grimdark Magazine.A drowned kingdom may rise again in The Last of the Atalanteans, the second volume of P.L. Stuart’s Drowned Kingdom Saga, a dark epic fantasy inspired by the mythology of Atlantis.The Last of the Atalanteans picks up immediately after the end of P.L. Stuart’s excellent debut novel, A Drowned Kingdom, as Prince Othrun of Atalanyx seeks to rebuild his kingdom in a foreign land following the dramatic submersion of his former island home.Othrun considers the restoration of his kingdom to be a divine mission, viewing himself as the savior chosen by his one true God. By establishing a new kingdom in pagan lands—through political manipulations and force, if necessary—Othrun might also convert people he considers as heathens to his own monotheistic faith.As in the first book of the series, The Last of the Atalanteans is a single point-of-view narrative told from Othrun’s first-person perspective. Single point-of-view epic fantasies are a rare breed these days, presumably due to the influence of George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones. When done properly, the focus provided by having a single narrator can bring an unparalleled depth to the psychological analysis of that character.P.L. Stuart achieves this goal exquisitely in The Last of the Atalanteans. His depiction of Othrun reaches a Dostoevskian depth that also recalls Mark Lawrence’s outstanding characterization of Jorg Ancrath in his Broken Empire trilogy. Both Stuart and Lawrence present complex worlds from characters having tunnel vision; but while Jorg is angry and impulsive, Othrun is calm and methodical in his very ambitious pursuits.The first half of The Last of the Atalanteans had some minor pacing issues as Othrun and two other lords go on an undercover political mission, but P.L. Stuart absolutely nails the second half of the novel, leading up to one of the strongest finales that I’ve read since Lawrence’s King of Thorns.Grimdark readers will also love P.L. Stuart’s masterful depiction of gray morality in this series. Othrun has constructed a system of internal logic that, at times, makes him seem like a beacon of rationality in a world gone mad. But readers will recoil in horror as Othrun applies this same system of logic to justify racism, sexism, colonialism, and religious zealotry.P.L. Stuart demonstrates how irrational and often dangerous conclusions can be drawn from a self-consistent but twisted set of moral codes. In this way, Othrun captures the seductive arguments employed by leaders throughout history, who have used similar tactics to justify evils ranging from oppression and colonialism to slavery and genocide. Shades of Othrun are also evident in many of today’s world leaders, who use a similar morality distortion field to justify their nationalistic pursuits.Beyond the lead protagonist himself, P.L. Stuart excels at describing Othrun’s complex relationships with other characters. The bond between Othrun and his elderly uncle is a highlight of the book, especially as Othrun learns of the horrific deeds committed by this man whom he so idolizes. These deeds are really just magnified versions of Othrun’s own sins. Holding this mirror up to Othrun’s own morality could be an opportunity for introspection, or it could merely clear the pathway toward greater evil.Other highlights are the evolving relationships between Othrun and two of the lead female characters. Othrun appears genuine in his feelings for his wife, Aliaz, infatuated by her physical beauty and appreciative of her marital fidelity. But as a woman, Othrun considers Aliaz to be an inherently inferior being: a subject rather than an equal.However, Othrun’s interactions with Lysi—a feared warrior, powerful mage, and ascending queen of a pagan land—lead him to question these gender stereotypes. With Lysi, Othrun finds someone strong enough to be considered his equal, which he perceives in terms of masculine traits in her character. Othrun is strangely drawn to Lysi while knowing full well the danger that she poses to both his political aspirations and his marriage. Stuart provides plenty of opportunities for Othrun to grow as a character. Part of the appeal of this second book of the series is seeing whether Othrun will actually take these opportunities to grow in a positive way, or if he will delve deeper into his bigoted thinking and actions.P.L. Stuart’s writing is immaculate in The Last of the Atalanteans, drawing me in from the very first page. As in A Drowned Kingdom, Stuart’s prose strikes the perfect balance between gravity and accessibility.Overall, The Last of the Atalanteans is an outstanding follow-up to A Drowned Kingdom and left me eager to dive into Lord and King, the third volume of P.L. Stuart’s planned seven-book Drowned Kingdom Saga....more",Notes are private!,0,71,1,"Jul 03, 2023","Jul 16, 2023","May 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60431339-the-last-of-the-atalanteans

The novel again centers on the hybrid Rohan, who has inherited superpowers from his father’s (alien) side of the family.Whereas the previous book in the series, Return of the Griffin, brought Rohan to Earth and explored the relationship with his mother, in Blood Reunion Rohan is back in space and dealing with daddy issues.In Blood Reunion, JCM Berne strikes just the right balance among character development, worldbuilding, and raw action. Berne’s writing is witty without becoming a self-parody, and his pacing is spot on.The Hybrid Helix series is definitely recommended for fans of space opera.
