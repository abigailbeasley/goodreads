Brace for Impact reminded me a lot of I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy, though in a quieter and queerer way. In this memoir, Gabe Montesanti shares her journey of finding an empowering queer community in her roller derby team in St. Louis. Concurrently, she writes about her relationship with her family of origin, especially her mother, who’s critical of Gabe in so many ways – of her body, of her queerness, and of her vulnerability. I liked the honesty in which Montesanti wrote about her tumultuous relationship with her mother. I think there’s still stigma related to sharing about abusive parents; Montesanti plows right through that stigma and is real about the messy parts of her emotional arc, such as when she still wanted her mother’s approval or care. I also deeply appreciated Montesanti’s writing about finding queer community and in a way, chosen family. Though she writes about her wife Kelly a fair amount, it’s clear after reading this that Montesanti values connections outside of heteronormative romance and the nuclear family, which I resonate with. Overall, props to Montesanti for a moving memoir. The prose isn’t flashy, and its earnestness made her story feel down-to-earth and solid. Toward the end there were moments where I wanted even more internal exploration and reflection on how her relationship with her mother – and where it stood at toward the end of the memoir – affected her, though perhaps that will be for a future memoir. For the sake of transparency, I actually know Montesanti loosely. We actually met when she I think was in between her first and second year of her MFA program; I was an undergraduate who was doing a brief summer program at her grad program’s campus. We’ve been friends on social media since then and she’s been nothing but lovely, warm, and supportive of my various updates. I’m glad I got around to reading this and I wish her the best....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Mar 02, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Mar 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58210923-brace-for-impact

The positives: I thought Izzeldin Abuelaish did a great job ofSome mixed feelings about this book but giving it four stars from a place of good will. The positives: I thought Izzeldin Abuelaish did a great job of writing about the devastation he and his family experienced at the hands of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. More specifically, three of his daughters and his niece were killed by an Israeli shelling. Just so heartbreaking and awful. It was wild to see how some Israeli individuals used certain justifications (e.g., your home where your daughters were killed was hiding members of Hamas) in response to his daughters’ deaths, the EXACT same justifications people are using to defend the horrific genocide of Palestinian people occurring right now at the hands of Zionists. I also appreciated the honesty in which he wrote about how parents who face discrimination can lash out at their kids. It’s of course not a justification for how marginalized parents can mistreat their children, but I think it’s important to name this as a relational dynamic within families who face systemic oppression.I’m going to reference Raheleh Abbasinejad’s  for why I had some issues with this book. I agree with Raheleh that it seemed like Izzeldin would at times minimize the reactions of Palestinians to their own oppression. He had a very “Palestinians and Israelis just need to listen to one another” and “it does no good to hate your oppressor” attitude which felt a bit patronizing. I know this isn’t the same thing, but as someone who’s faced abuse from people in power at different points of my life, it would anger me if someone were to say something like “Thomas you just need to listen to your abuser and not hate them so we can all move forward.” Within the context of race relations in the United States (which, again, I know we can’t draw an exact parallel) it reminds me of people who get mad when people of color, particularly Black individuals, are angry and hostile in reaction to their oppression – which I think they have every right to be. In relation to this point, I found it odd at times that Izzeldin would quote Martin Luthor King Jr., but would use his quotes in a way to back up his own points instead of adhering more closely to King’s criticism of white liberals, for example. Anyway, clearly this author has suffered a lot, and this book’s existence does shed light on how Palestinians have been oppressed by Israel for a long time. On the sentence level I found the book well-written and easy to get through even though the content was brutal. I would perhaps recommend it to those who want to educate themselves about the ongoing genocide occurring in Palestine, while cautioning readers to take into accounts the critiques raised in the prior paragraph....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Mar 20, 2024","Mar 22, 2024","Feb 22, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8550813-i-shall-not-hate

Dr. Noliwe Rooks does a great job of explaining and providing evidence for her term “segrenomics,” in which wealth disparities within education create wildly disparate and unequal opportunities for Black and Latinx students compared to wealthy white and Asian students. She makes several great arguments, including advocating for the importance of integration as opposed to allocating funds toward private schools and criticizing programs like Teach for America for not doing enough to dismantle root causes of educational inequity (e.g., poverty, policies that create segregated educational opportunities).I liked too toward the end of the book how she emphasizes the need for us to actually listen to teenagers about their experience.

When We Were Friends follows Fern, who was best friends with Jessica when they were in high school. They shared their deepest and darkest secrets with one another, slept over at each other’s places and had fun silly times together, and talked about school and boys and their parents. But Jessica did something that betrayed Fern’s trust so Fern cut her off. Ten years later, Fern works as a writer and an aspiring mental health counselor, when Jessica reemerges out of the blue. They start to rekindle their friendship, but can Fern trust Jessica after what happened in their shared past?I will start with some of what I didn’t like about the book before moving onto the positives. I found the writing style kind of clunky, especially the first 50% or so of the book – the characters’ jokes felt a bit forced, some dialogue came across as awkward, and I couldn’t really fully immerse myself in Holly Bourne’s prose. I was definitely leaning toward three stars for a large portion of my reading experience.But, around the 65% mark, something about this book really clicked for me. Part of it I think was the suspense of whether Fern and Jessica would be able to actually form a friendship again. I also felt like Bourne’s writing came across as more authentic in the latter half of the book. Finally, several of the book’s themes came together toward the end. Throughout the novel Fern is obsessed with the male gaze and what men think of her, and there’s also an emphasis throughout the novel of the casual violence and degrading ways boys and men treat women. While the delivery of those ideas didn’t feel 100% skilled in the first half of the book, Bourne really did make the feminist commentary about sexual violence and female friendship come through by the end of the novel. I was impressed by how she wrote about Fern and Jessica’s friendship and the ways they were both able to mature and grow. Overall, if the story sounds interesting to you I’d recommend. I think there could have been a bit more unpacking of the male gaze theme (something that is unfortunately super prevalent in the gay male scene too), though I respect and appreciate Bourne’s overall commitment to her feminist message in this novel. Other friendship-focused novels I’ve liked included When You Were Everything by Ashley Woodfolk and We Used to be Friends by Amy Spalding!...more",Notes are private!,2,48,1,"Jan 14, 2024","Jan 17, 2024","Jan 10, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60023128-when-we-were-friends

I liked the thoughtful representation of OCD, the portrayal of a wholesome sibling dynamic, and some deeper commentary about how past generations affect the present. I didn’t love the story because I found the writing style hard to get into. First, I felt like Greta’s perspective was almost trying too hard to come across as Fleabag-esque and quirky, which pulled me out of the narrative. Also, within the dialogue, there were some really long speaking turns that were either used to convey information or for a character to engage in an in-depth monologue.

In They Called Us Exceptional, Prachi Gupta writes about growing up iA powerful, somewhat uneven memoir with some sections that absolutely gutted me. In They Called Us Exceptional, Prachi Gupta writes about growing up in an Indian American family that some would describe as the American ideal: a doctor father, a nurturing mother, and two high-achieving children. Underneath this veneer though lies a family simmering with conflict and painful unaddressed wounds. Gupta details her journey of breaking free from the cycles of violence plaguing her family and dissects the cost of “achieving” what may appear as the American success story.I found the first 100 pages or so of this book okay, somewhere between three and four stars. Gupta does a nice job of detailing her childhood and naming some sociocultural complexities: her father’s patriarchal violence, the racism that everyone including in her family including her father experienced, and her desire to figure out what she wants for herself. Gupta’s tone felt a bit formal for me in this first half or so of the memoir and even throughout the book. I can see why she chose to write in the second person but I felt that that created some emotional distance or dilution in the prose.However, something happens around the 125-page mark and onward that wrecked me. I won’t spoil it so all I’ll say is that Gupta’s writing about her relationship with her brother *gutted* me. I read this book on a plane and I was holding back tears in several parts of the second half of the book. I think Gupta wrote a successful essay about her brother that got some attention which then led to this book, and I can see why that essay was successful. Gupta’s writing about her brother felt both sophisticated and deeply emotionally resonant. Honoring the complexities of how Asian American men and Indian American men in this case are dehumanized and made to feel inferior in the United States. While at the same time writing honestly about her brother’s faults and shortcomings, the pain and power of setting boundaries with him, and the deep love between the two of them born out of shared experience and tenderness. Her writing about him and their relationship and her feelings about him floored me. I’m typing this  in the Atlanta airport listening to “Ghost in the Machine” by SZA and staring into space, a heartbroken mess!Despite how some of the writing, especially the use of the second person, felt dry, Gupta accomplishes a lot in this memoir: breaking down the model minority myth, detailing her journey to know more about her own culture and come into her unique feminist voice, sharing a bit about her therapy process and destigmatizing mental illness. Her father’s abusive behavior reminded me my mother’s and I appreciated her sharing about how this abuse (and the abuser’s potential mental illness) is often conflated with stereotypes about harsh immigrant parents. Still, though, her writing about her brother, wow. My heart aches just thinking about it (and if you saw a gaysian crying in the Atlanta airport holding a copy of this book and crying, it was me!)....more",Notes are private!,2,97,1,"Jan 14, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Jan 08, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/142601047-they-called-us-exceptional

I thought all the characters sounded the same voice-wise even though the book featured multiple points of view. In addition to the dry writing, I felt that Godkiller focused so much on action (e.g., character does X, character does Y, character does Z) that it sacrificed more of the emotional component of each character and each character’s interiority.

What stands out the most about this book was Donovan Ramsey’s smart decision to include the perspectives of four people whose lives were actually affected by the crack epidemic. This lived experience made the impacts of discriminatory policies feel more vivid and visceral. I also thought Ramsey did a nice job of choosing which perspectives to include, such that he featured someone who was addicted to crack, someone who sold it, someone whose family member was addicted, and someone who tried to affect it from a policy level.For those who are already aware of the racist consequences and underpinnings of the war on drugs, this book might not offer you too much new information.

In Good Material we follow 35-y3.5 starsDeeply enjoyed the last 150 pages or so of this novel, felt so bored by much of what came before that though. In Good Material we follow 35-year-old comedian Andy, who was recently broken up with by his girlfriend. After Jen breaks up with him, Andy struggles in all sense of the word – to find a place to live, to resuscitate his failing stand up career, and to get over Jen at all. We follow him through his meandering messy life post-Jen as he tries to cope with a new fitness regime, a new situationship, and eventually maybe a new perspective on what transpired in his old relationship.One of my favorite things about this novel was that when I finished it, I had a renewed sense of empathy for my friends going through breakups. Ending relationships, even when it’s the right move, is tough! I thought Dolly Alderton did a great job of honestly portraying the messiness of the post break-up stage. I really did struggle to get through the first half of this novel though. For the majority of the novel we’re in Andy’s head, then we move to Jen’s for the last bit. Andy… wow. He really was a self-absorbed white man who pitied himself and had little empathy for others. It was hard to get through his perspective and I can’t help but think Alderton wrote his point of view in an intentionally annoying way. I’m still not sure how much of my “eh”-ness about the first half of the novel stemmed from Alderton making Andy intentionally unlikable versus the actual writing quality lacking a bit. The first half felt repetitive to me and I was leaning toward two to three stars max.But, Andy does grow a little by the end of the novel which was nice to read. And I loved when the perspective shifted to Jen’s point of view. As a more femme gay man/genderqueer person who’s not into the whole get married and have kids thing, I related a lot of Jen’s perspectives and experiences. I also found the writing in Jen’s section fluid and entertaining, while still feeling grounded and convincing. So, mixed feelings about this one. I wonder if Alderton could have done anything differently to the first half of the novel – maybe actually exploring Andy’s emotions more in-depth like with some of his father stuff? Still, after thinking about it I think I will at some point read more of her work, especially given how people in my Goodreads community seem to be a fan of hers....more",Notes are private!,5,54,1,Feb 2024,"Feb 04, 2024","Dec 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96177629-good-material

Put in overly simplistic terms that the book does a better job of delving into, Antony Loewenstein writes about how Israel has used the captive Palestinian population as a testing ground for surveillance and military equipment, which it then disseminates to regimes such as the devastating Hutu regime in Rwanda and the Argentinian dictatorship which targeted Jewish people itself. Lowenstein also touches on the active silencing of Palestinian voices on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube all in support of the Zionist movement. It’s so disgusting and frustrating knowing that the United States is contributing to this wretchedness!! And I appreciate Loewenstein taking a stand especially as a Jewish person himself (perhaps a low bar, but still).

The main character’s voice and development felt consistent and authentic, and I appreciated her journey to uncover more about her identity and history. The incorporation of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table was unique.Unfortunately I found the writing a bit of a slog to get through, mostly because of the large amounts of info-dumping and the repetition of how chapters ended (e.g., lots of the main character running away mid-conversation, blacking out, etc.) I think it’s hard for fantasy/sci-fi writers to build a convincing world while also keeping readers grounded in compelling scenes – I know I could not pull it off – and I don’t think Tracy Deonn nailed that task in Legendborn. I also didn’t love the romance between our main character Bree and Nick; their connection felt too insta-lovey for me and Nick almost came across as kind of white saviory/oblivious to his own privilege and power even though he may have had “good intentions.” It looks like many people loved this one so I’m okay having a different opinion!...more",Notes are private!,4,45,1,"Dec 24, 2023","Dec 26, 2023","Nov 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892338-legendborn

What I appreciated: Viet Thanh Nguyen names and dissects colonialism, internalized white supremacy, and anti-Asian racism in the United States. Loved his critiques of media such as the horribly racist Miss Saigon. His writing about his family feels sincere and moving if not a bit sparse, too, including his deep affection for his wife and kids and the way he honors the three-dimensionality of his parents.I didn’t love the more experimental elements of this memoir. More often than not they distracted me rather than added to the book. For example, I didn’t understand the blacking out of Donald Trump’s name (like, I abhor him too, but…) I also didn’t get why Nguyen wrote so much of the book in second person. He hints or addresses this choice indirectly (maybe directly but felt indirect to me) toward the end, though the use of the second person felt to me like a way to avoid digging into more of his own emotional arc and exploration about his life. At times, it came across to me that Nguyen just didn’t have enough bandwidth to link the different elements of his life together in a more traditional memoirish way, so he resorted to this more hybrid experimental form. I preferred Sigh, Gone to this, though A Man of Two Faces punches up toward white supremacy and colonialism enacted by the United States in interesting ways. I’ve read a few of Nguyen’s books at this point and his writing feels a bit over-intellectualized for my taste, however, I really do respect what he’s done for Vietnamese American and Asian American representation in literature. I also hugely respect his public and uncompromising call for a ceasefire for Palestine and how he’s used his platform to speak on the dehumanization of Palestinians even though it’s cost him professional opportunities....more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Dec 16, 2023","Dec 17, 2023","Nov 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/124948662-a-man-of-two-faces

One of the first novels in a long time where I felt like I was on the edge of my seat; I flipped through the pages quickly so I could figure out what happened. Happiness Falls centers on a half-Korean, half-white family in which the white father goes missing, leaving the two older twin siblings, their younger brother who has autism/Angelman syndrome, and their mother reeling. Angie Kim did an excellent job both on the sentence-level and on the greater plot level of keeping me on my toes with their father’s disappearance. Each twist and turn made sense and added to the development of the story.I did want a bit more from other elements of the story. I actually don’t think the characters were too well-developed. They each had somewhat distinct personalities and features that distinguished them from one another, but I honestly didn’t get too much depth from them. There were some interesting themes about disability and disability justice, too. But other than that I left this book feeling more like I just finished a well-written thriller that excited me, rather than a novel that made me reflect more deeply about relationships, issues of justice and equity, etc. Overall, it was an enjoyable read and I think Kim was both sensitive and electric in her writing, even if I’m not sure if Happiness Falls will leave too much of a longer-lasting impact on me....more",Notes are private!,4,65,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 15, 2024","Nov 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75495002-happiness-falls

In The Rachel Incident we follow Rachel, a university student working at a bookstore who meets James, a charismatic and supposedly heterosexual fellow early-20-something. The two become roommates and form a close, affectionate, and at times intense friendship. When Rachel develops a crush on her married English professor Fred Byrne, James devises a plan for her to seduce him. When their strategy takes a left turn it sets into motion a string of events that dramatically affects both of their lives and their bond with one another.I loved how Caroline O’Donoghue captured the layered emotions of being in one’s early 20’s. The mess, the yearning, the being in relationships with people who aren’t right for you and kind of knowing it but not really, the intensity of not yet loving who you are but wanting to. I resonated with Rachel’s emotions; O’Donoghue wrote her internal experience in a way that felt real, unguarded, and honest. Though the first third or even first half of the book meandered at times – I was wavering between three and four stars during that beginning portion – when things came to a head in the latter part of the book, I felt my heart clench. There were certain big moments, certain reveals (e.g., (view spoiler)[when Rachel learns that James is moving to New York, I was shaken, similarly when she and Carey reconnect later (hide spoiler)]), that made me pause and think, dang, I really am invested in these characters now. I felt both for and with Rachel.I also deeply enjoyed the growth of Rachel’s characters. Her development felt realistic, happening in bumps and starts, not in a grand awakening in a single moment but in little choices that built up to subtly change the course of her life. I felt proud of her and her trajectory. Though people may compare this book to Sally Rooney’s novels given the parallels of white emerging adult protagonists living in Ireland, I liked The Rachel Incident much better, even though both books portray young adults being dysfunctional. I found this book more intentional, the drama more purposeful even if in a similarly slice-of-life way. I also felt that O’Donoghue’s writing was more earnest, refreshingly so, with bits of humor that didn’t come across as unnecessarily cruel.Finally, I loved the subtle yet strong feminist messaging in this novel. There’s a clear commentary about abortion, though also themes related to class and how women can take things out on one another. All of these components of the novel felt smoothly integrated into the narrative, such that The Rachel Incident always felt first and foremost a story about Rachel’s life, her coming of age within a larger society.Overall, I’m pleasantly surprised by how much this book moved me. 2023 is coming to a close though there’s still room for books to shine! The first third of the novel may have been a bit off pacing wise – though perhaps reflective of the ennui that can pervade one’s early 20’s – and one part of the novel’s ending didn’t sit exactly right ((view spoiler)[I found Rachel and Carey reconnecting, while definitely super cute and a great portrayal of how people can grow up while apart, a little too convenient/slightly amatonormative (hide spoiler)]). Still, The Rachel Incident had me rooting for Rachel even when I didn’t expect to invest that much, and it made me reflect on how much I know now at 28 compared to when I was like, 20, or 21, or 22. Furthermore, there were a few insights in the novel that struck me as deeply wise, without trying too hard. Overall, I’d say this book deserves its hype....more",Notes are private!,6,68,1,"Dec 20, 2023","Dec 21, 2023","Nov 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63094957-the-rachel-incident

Their labor is generally unseen and their working conditions are often poor. Then, a shocking murder accusation is made against one of their friends which disrupts their day-to-day status quo. Each of these women has secrets to keep and allegiances to maintain, though in part through their connection to one another they also gather the strength to challenge the structures that have silenced them for so long.Balli Kaur Jaswal does a nice job of mixing aspects of different genres in this novel. On one hand, there’s a thriller element about the murder that runs throughout the plot. At the same time, Now You See Us thoroughly interrogates labor conditions of Filipina domestic workers in Singapore and the constraints imposed upon their autonomy. I liked that each of the three protagonists felt distinct in their challenges and desires and for the most part in their voices. I felt that Jaswal effectively captured their struggles while also highlighting their resiliency and capacity to support one another and resist their oppression. She doesn’t minimize their suffering though and how people with power mistreat them. I appreciated that she didn’t sugarcoat the workplace abuse they face. The final two pages brought me to near tears in relation to one of the protagonist’s journey with her grief.I liked reading how she interviewed Filipina domestic workers in the acknowledgements section. While I didn’t love this book as much as Jaswal’s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows, I can’t deny that she has a talent for storytelling and can write a relatively complex set of plotlines smoothly.

At its core is a story about a couple who’s dissatisfied by their marriage. Somehow, Nathan Hill stretches this basic premise across 600 pages, when I think everything insightful about these two characters could’ve been communicated within 200 pages. I found some of the conflicts within their marriage and some of the flashbacks into their pasts interesting, though a lot of times the prose felt dry or the characterization came across as too try-hard. Hill also includes a lot of commentary about the wellness industry which came across as a bit random to me. I felt like these portions of the book could have been better distilled into a few paragraphs of straightforward critique instead of being interspersed throughout the book. Finally, throughout Wellness he incorporates basic psychological principles in a name-dropping kind of way (e.g., here’s this psychological premise, here’s how this character uses it) which also felt distracting and oddly jammed into these characters’ lives (maybe I was particularly unimpressed because I am a Psychology professor, lol.)

Evil Eye follows Yara, a Palestinian American woman who grew up in a conservative and emotionally tumultuous family in Brooklyn, New York. Flash forward and she’s working at a local university teaching art, while at the same time raising her two school-aged daughters and doing the majority of the household chores while her husband focuses on his job. Yara is discontent with the makeup of her life, however, it’s not until she responds to a racist comment made by one of her coworkers that her emotions of disappointment and despair start to fester to a boiling point. Yara begins seeing a therapist and the difficult journey of unpacking her memories that are so dreadfully shaking her to her core.I loved this book. Loved it. First, Etaf Rum’s writing is immaculate. Not flashy, and so compulsively readable and so clear and concise. The prose didn’t get in the way of the story and in fact conveyed Yara’s emotional state with immense clarity and heart – her post-traumatic stress disorder, her depression and anxiety, and all the intergenerational and present-day racism and sexism that contributed to her mental health. I flew through about 200 pages of this novel last night because I felt so invested in Yara, and Rum’s writing, similar to her debut A Woman is No Man, was enthralling in its simple effectiveness.The depiction of mental health in this novel got me floored. I was shaking, and by the end I was in near tears too! The way Rum described intergenerational trauma and how Yara’s mother was both a victim of and perpetrator of abuse, whew I was emotional. And Yara’s long, arduous journey of learning how to stop blaming herself for other people’s mistreatment of her, of opening up to her friend Silas and her therapist(s), and of starting to actually sit with the physical sensations of her body and self-regulate all made me both devastated and proud of her. Even writing this  makes tears come to my eyes because as a PTSD survivor Yara’s fight for her life is relatable to me, though of course we come from different backgrounds even though we share immigrant parents displaced by war. All in all, one of my top books of this year and that I’ve read in my life. Rum does such a fantastic job of portraying the micro and macroaggression Yara experiences, as well as her use of journaling and coming into her own voice to heal. Yara’s friendship with Silas and how friendship acts as a conduit for Yara’s healing, increased self-compassion, and learning to open up to other people had me near tears. Also, the portrayals of therapy were excellent, top-notch, so thoughtfully written without sacrificing either the momentum of the plot or what therapy actually looks like. Etaf Rum, you have my whole heart! Also, this book came out in March of this year (2023), and unfortunately is so relevant. In the novel Yara’s grandparents were displaced from Palestine by Israel’s colonial oppression, which is literally what is happening right now. Here are some actions you can take to advocate for a ceasefire. While it’s already way too late for thousands of people, we need to take action to *prevent* intergenerational trauma, not just provide care for people after the trauma happens. You can also read The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Jewish historian Ilan Pappe if you want to educate yourself on the matter. I’m appreciative of Rum for speaking out about this on her café’s Instagram. FYI, if you leave an oppressive remark about my pro-Palestine, anti-genocide stance in the comments, that’s whatever, I probably just won’t reply. Anyway, this book was spectacular and I don’t want to divert from that, I just felt it’d be disingenuous not to comment on the genocide happening in Palestine now....more",Notes are private!,23,280,1,"Nov 10, 2023","Nov 12, 2023","Nov 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59381516-evil-eye

Unfortunately I struggled to feel invested in the story and the characters though.

I think that Emily Austin did a decent job of portraying a woman struggling from social anxiety, intrusive thoughts about death, and relationships where she doesn’t open up to people. However, by the end of the novel I didn’t feel like I got a deeper understanding or connection with the main character. I felt like Austin put a lot of effort into making the prose and the protagonist “quirky,” instead of fleshing the protagonist out more deeply.

I thought Aja Barber did a great job of writing about how consumerism intersects with oppressive forces such as racism and fatphobia. Her writing is conversational, though still thorough and intelligent. I appreciated how she included specific strategies for resisting consumerism in regard to clothes (e.g., actually wear the clothes you buy several times, unsubscribe from notifications from stores and companies, check in with yourself emotionally before going to purchase something). Her commentary about class and how some people may underestimate their wealth made a lot of sense to me.

Laura Gao portrays her journey to self-acceptance, especially pertaining to her racial identity after growing up in a predominantly white town. I appreciated Gao’s honesty about confronting her internalized racism, in particular when she moved from Texas to Philadelphia for college. She doesn’t sacrifice complexity in this memoir either; she writes and draws with honesty in relation to her complex dynamic with her father. At the same time, her story exemplifies the importance of embracing and loving oneself and one’s roots, and it’s wonderful that she’s able to honor her heritage and her parents even if her relationship with her father isn’t 100% perfect. This felt like an easy read, though not in a negative way. For some reason I wanted a bit more punch, though perhaps that would’ve detracted from Gao’s story.

The novel follows a trans criminal defense attorney who represents a young Black trans woman accused of murdering a rich white man. I thought Robyn Gigl did a nice job of portraying the horrendous transphobic violence encountered by trans women, both in terms of grotesque physical assault as well as awful interpersonal jabs. At the same time, I liked how she represented a trans female lawyer doing her best to navigate life post-transition, across her job, family, and romantic relationships. There were a few passages where I could sense a, “this is here to educate cis people about this topic” vibe, though they were brief and didn’t detract from the book much in my opinion.I didn’t love the thriller aspect of By Way of Sorrow.

Unfortunately Whereabouts lacked the elements of her work I love the most, namely her rich characterization and understated yet powerful prose. I found Whereabouts rather listless, about an unnamed woman wandering and meandering around a European city. She observes her surroundings and doesn’t do much else; she seems to struggle with depression or a depression-adjacent worldview and perspective. Perhaps there are some themes about isolation, the intermingling of solitude and self-fulfillment and connection, and navigating an urban landscape, through the writing dragged so I couldn’t feel much connection to the story either way. I know she wrote this in Italian and translated it to English so perhaps that played a role.Anyway, The Lowland and Unaccustomed Earth (especially “Hell-Heaven”) both have played a huge, huge role in helping me navigate my mid to late 20’s and bolstering my mental health, so I’m always grateful to Lahiri even if I didn’t enjoy Whereabouts.

I thought Victoria Ying did an excellent job of portraying how an eating disorder can narrow your worldview and make it so fixated on weight, calories, and restriction. Ying’s illustrations showcased Valerie’s emotions well, like her self-loathing and her difficulty breaking free from her disordered eating. I thought Ying did a great job too of portraying Valerie’s relationship with her mother. Ying definitely showed that Valerie’s mother’s behavior was toxic, while also highlighting the complexity of putting up boundaries with someone, still having them in your life, all while knowing they won’t change. Valerie is a super fatphobic character and takes her fatphobia out on her best friend, so watch out for that going into the book if that’ll activate you. Ying does highlight this fatphobia as horrible and toxic. Overall, I give this book four stars for its accurate and emotionally resonant portrayal of disordered eating. I think the novel could have gone deeper in certain areas, such as the issue of wanting boys/men to like your appearance, intergenerational trauma, perhaps some general deepening of Valerie’s character. However, given the graphic novel format, I feel like it told a meaningful story that I imagine will resonate with people who’ve had difficult relationships with their mothers or with food.

I enjoyed An Echo in the City, a book about two star-crossed teenagers falling in love during the 2019 Hong Kong protests. I feel that K.X. Song did a great job writing about a topic that doesn’t get much mainstream attention in the United States (I’m referencing the U.S. just because that’s where I live.) She highlights sixteen-year-old Phoenix’s journey from privilege and lack of awareness to activism, from her disinterested path in attending Yale to her taking action to capture key moments in an activist movement. Song also portrays seventeen-year-old Kai’s evolution from working as a police officer to fulfill what his father wants from him, to honoring what he wants from his life regardless of what other people may think. In the afterword of this novel, Song writes about how people told her that this book may not do well because it doesn’t feature a white protagonist. While the book doesn’t seem to be super popular, I’m so glad Song stuck through with it because it definitely raises intersecting themes of identity, politics, and pursuing what’s right even when doing so comes at a cost.I also enjoyed the characterization and romance in this novel. Loved the development of a healthy romance between two Asian protagonists! I also thought Song did a nice job of having both Phoenix and Kai come to terms with what they really want and who they really are despite familial pressures.

Héctor Tobar writes about so many nuances of Latinx identity and experience, ranging from the border crisis/border trauma, colorism, colonialism, racist depictions in media, immigration, and more. I like how he integrated his own life story, perspectives from students he’s taught, diverse forms of art, and more. I feel that it can be difficult to write a nonfiction book about topics like these in a way that doesn’t become a pure rant (which is also fair given how heinous racism against Latinx people is), though Tobar is able to both write with compelling, controlled flourish and convey his points with conviction and poignancy. In a way, this reminded me of Cathy Park Hong’s Minor Feelings, which felt similarly striking at the time of its publication. While the ending was a bit abstract, I appreciated Tobar’s note of hope and his call to activism.

Shen includes a nice diversity of plot lines: Jia Lee, who feels pressured to stay at home and support her family’s business, Ariel Kim, an academic superstar grieving the death of her sister, and Everett Hoang, an aspiring actress who faces racist challenges that make her question herself. I appreciated that Shen didn’t stereotype or lazily characterize these characters or their parents/families – each of the main characters and the main side characters felt multidimensional. I also enjoyed that while the book did address anti-Asian racism, it didn’t center whiteness or make any of the characters aspire to be white or be in relationships with white people. Finally, Shen did a great job of emphasizing the characters’ friendship with one another and how they supported one another through positive and negative experiences.I give this book four stars instead of five because I felt like it was missing that little extra emotional punch to make me feel super invested.

I just don’t like how so many novels about gay men are about gay men in unhealthy, abusive relationships in which the abuse remains unaddressed?? This novel features a young gay man who falls into an obsessive relationship with a man ten years older than him. Aside from the general unhealthiness of their relationship, there’s one scene where the older man sexually assaults the younger man and the repercussions of that assault are never really contended with throughout the whole book. Also, the young gay male protagonist is described as “chubby” and the novel definitely contains at least one scene where a thinner physique is glorified – again, this fatphobia is never written about in a way that indicates growth, unlearning internalized fatphobia, etc. I guess I’ll give this book two stars for the gay representation but even that feels amiss because I question whether representation like this is better than no representation at all (not a question worth exploring because there is indeed better gay representation out there.)...more",Notes are private!,1,48,1,"Aug 05, 2023","Aug 06, 2023","Aug 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51332766-box-hill

In one I liked this novel about a forbidden love between two boys in war-torn Syria and how their tragic fallout reverberates into their adult lives. In one perspective we follow Hussam, an openly gay man in Canada coping with his trauma through sex, drugs, and alcohol. In the other perspective we witness Wassim living on the streets of Damascus, having left behind a wife and child and a false narrative he could no longer keep up. We watch as both men contend with heartache, painful memories, and present relationships as they try to grow from their tumultuous pasts.I found this novel moving and a genuine portrayal of trauma and recovery. Danny Ramadan does a nice job highlighting the intersectionality of homophobia as well as racism within different contexts for queer men of color. I was definitely emo about Hussam’s connection with Dawood, we love this representation of queer men and nonbinary folks of color who are messy yet doing their best to grow! I did find the writing a little lopsided in parts. I skimmed some s and it looks like other folks on here may have resonated more with Wassim’s narrative than Hussam’s, whereas I felt more invested in Hussam’s narrative than Wassim’s. I thought the writing in Wassim’s perspective was less grounded and more abstract. Despite this quibble I’d still recommend the novel to those interested in its synopsis.

Kate Flannery writes about her time working at American Apparel and how she witnessed the blurring of lines between sexual liberation and outright exploitation. There’s an entertainment factor in this memoir that’s derived from the kind of glitzy glamor LA millennial lifestyle, intersecting with the struggle to make it as a young woman in a corporate world still dominated by men.I think one theme that this book addresses particularly well is the pressure between adhering to your values or loosening up on your values so you can get money to feed yourself and pay rent. Without a doubt Dov, the CEO of American Apparel, created a misogynist, exploitative work environment. At the same time, Flannery reflects on multiple points throughout the book about her own perceived complicity in the American Apparel system (e.g., recruiting other young women to this hostile environment) – though it’s not like she just had another job that could sustain her at a whim’s notice. Perhaps it’s a testament to how capitalism can intersect with other systems of power such as patriarchy.I give this four stars instead of five because the writing, while relatively engaging, didn’t wow me at any point.

Elise Hu’s writing is wonderful in that it feels both conversational and easy-to-read while also capturing nuance and complexity. She describes aspects of the K-Beauty industry such as skin care routines and makeup products as well as plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures. She researches and reports on the darker sides of the industry, such as the sexist expectations placed upon women’s body image and how people feel compelled to get surgery to perform better on the job market. At the same time, Hu doesn’t stereotype or orientalize Korean culture; she draws both upon history (e.g., class dynamics) to discuss issues such as why colorism persists and upon interviews with Korean people who engage with K-Beauty. I appreciated too her writing about South Korean who are defying sexist and gendered expectations. Hu does a nice job of including some well-placed self-disclosure and it was nice getting to know her as a human too, in addition to her reporting. I liked her takeaways about learning to expand what we consider beautiful and to divest from viewing beauty as important in the first place (e.g., practicing body neutrality instead).On a personal and somewhat related side note, yesterday I got into Seattle to visit one of my best friends. Before getting dinner with her, I squeezed in a quick workout. When I stepped on the treadmill, it automatically displayed my weight which I was like what?? I purposefully haven’t weighed myself in years. The number it showed was probably the highest I’ve ever weighed. Thankfully though, I really didn’t care about the number. I had an eating disorder in my earlier teen years, and for the past several years I’ve really stopped valuing appearance, weight, all of that. My lack of a reaction to my weight I think has reflected this work. I’m at a place in my life where I feel so fulfilled with my close friendships, work, hobbies, etc. and I have everything that matters. As Hu writes about toward the end of the book, weight and appearance aren’t central at all to me. Just wanted to share this tidbit as I’ve written about this on my blog in years past and figured I’d include it here instead of writing a full blog post about it (though maybe later I will)!...more",Notes are private!,7,93,1,"Jan 08, 2024","Jan 12, 2024","Jul 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62121560-flawless

In Notes on a Silencing, Lacy Crawford writes about her experience being sexually assaulted by two older male peers while attending St. Paul’s School, a New England Prep school. I loved Crawford’s honesty in this book, both about the pain and trauma of the assault itself as well as just how awfully so many people treated her (e.g., the school, her peers, even people who heard about her in casual conversation way later in life). Crawford does a great job of showing how people can be so cruel and choose to silence survivors, as well as how people, including other women and girls, can blame victims instead of holding perpetrators accountable. I also think Crawford owns up to her privilege as a white woman who grew up with/among wealth and “prestige.”I do agree with other more critical ers that this book could have been shorter. Especially in the first half of the book Crawford included a lot of detail about miscellaneous events that I don’t think added much to the narrative stylistically.

I definitely I’ve enjoyed Melissa Broder’s previous novels The Pisces and Milk Fed, however I found Death Valley quite lacking in comparison. I definitely appreciate how she tackled the experiences of being in an intimate relationship with someone with a chronic illness as well as how portrayed a narrator whose father is ill. As someone who’s dealt with grief I can imagine how these elements of the novel may resonate with folks.At the same time, I thought this novel lacked a lot of substance. The protagonist enters a cactus and engages in some form of a mythical journey inside of it, idk. I think this component of the novel lowered its quality a lot – I wish Broder had instead written more deeply about the protagonist’s relationship with her father, with her husband, with her sister and mother, and even with herself. The characters felt pretty thin and underdeveloped to me because of all the attention paid to this cactus space trip ordeal. Maybe other people liked that part of the book, though to me it felt avoidant of a more tangible emotional arc for the characters and their relationships with one another.

To start with the positives, I think Ruth Madievsky did a great job portraying the difficult cycle of addiction, both in regard to substances and relationships. Our unnamed protagonist struggles with pills and with a toxic, codependent relationship with her sister – all until her sister disappears. Madievsky highlights how the recovery process isn’t linear and that sometimes healing means you feel worse before you feel better.One element of the book I *loved* was how Madievsky showed that in some relationships, you really need time apart from the other person to grow and recover on your own. I felt emotional reading about the intensity of our protagonist’s relationship with her sister Debbie, then Debbie’s disappearance, then the ending which moved me in its subtlety and its restrained hopefulness. The characters’ growth in this novel felt messy and hard-won and not like a salve that cured all wounds, which made it feel realistic.The reason why I give this book a slightly lower star-rating is that I do think lots of the narrative kind of felt a bit lackusterly-written? There are large swaths of the novel where our protagonist makes self-defeating decisions. That’s totally fine and part of her life story, though the writing in these sections felt either overwritten or monotonous (or at times both).

I liked how Sarah Rose Etter portrayed some of the complicated dynamics of our protagonist’s work life, such as how her female boss treats her so awfully (exemplifying that women can be horrible to women) and how the protagonist is complicit in making a new hire move 15 hours away from his family (highlighting how we can all commit cruel actions for a paycheck). It all felt a bit millennial malaise which I think may resonate with some folks.Unfortunately I didn’t find the writing that compelling in Ripe. I think there’s a lot of overdrawn sentences and images that to me, felt too obvious in their attempts to elicit emotion. For example, Etter constantly used the image of a “black hole” to represent the protagonist’s depression/mental anguish as well as her “fake self” to show the protagonist’s disembodiment/performance for other people. I felt the writing would have been more effective if she had found more subtle or specific ways to phrase her main character’s emotional experience. Etter also included so many different sources of anguish – an oppressive workplace environment, an unintended pregnancy, conflict-ridden friendships, abusive/cruel parents, a dissatisfying romantic relationship – and it was disappointing to me that none of these, aside from maybe the oppressive workplace environment, had time to really develop and have a full story arc. So, I can see why this book has amassed some popularity even though I didn’t love it.

The characters, while distinct enough that I could tell them apart, all sounded super similar. The writing lacked a vitality or a more original flavor that would have helped me feel more invested in the story.I also didn’t quite understand the purpose of the strings dystopia setup. Beyond the prose making a potentially interesting premise fall flat, it seemed to me that Nikki Erlick wanted to make the strings stand-in as a metaphor for another form of discrimination, like racism or sexism or homophobia (e.g., discrimination against short stringers is like other forms of oppression). I don’t think this premise added anything new or interesting to the conversation about societal oppression though. Furthermore, I felt that the book did an awful job of addressing how the string situation would actually affect people of color, LGBTQ+ communities, fat people, etc. – it felt like the story glossed over these important junctions for more shallow-level commentary.

I liked elements of Everyone Wants to Know, which follows Honor Lo, one of five siblings of a famous influencer family. The book begins right when Honor’s father announces that he’s moving out of their California home to rent an apartment in Brooklyn, which starts a social media cascade about their once-seemingly-perfect family. Then, one of Honor’s best friends leaks their private conversation to a gossip site. More drama ensues soon after leading Honor to spiral, all while doing her best to reunite her family that keeps feeling more and more fractured.Starting with what I liked: I think Gilbert did a great job of writing about an influencer family in a way that felt believable. Around the 40-50% mark, I did feel interested in the plot and motivated to find out what would happen next. I also feel like Gilbert portrayed anxiety super well; she has a talent for rendering mental illness in a believable and thoughtful way, as she did in When We Were Infinite. I also enjoyed how both Honor and her mother grew by the end of the book after what felt like a potentially catastrophic lack of growth for most of the novel. Gilbert includes interesting themes related to boundary-setting within families as well as the role of social media in promoting unauthenticity/attention-seeking.My main dissatisfaction with this novel is that I just didn’t find much to emotionally attach to. I unfortunately didn’t find the plot that engaging until about the 40% mark. Even then, I struggled to develop a connection to Honor or other characters. I think Gilbert has an amazing talent for creating complex plotlines that are emotionally raw and resonant; however, with this novel I felt like there was almost too much going on and not enough focus on a specific set of characters’ relationships. For example, I still remember with When We Were Infinite, Gilbert’s powerful rendering of Beth’s relationship with her friend group, with Jason specifically, and with her family members, and how she captured so much nuance and heart in each of those relationships. However, in this novel I didn’t feel that same spark or magic with Honor and any of the characters around her, even though I did appreciate Honor’s trajectory by the end of the book.Overall, an okay read that I wish I could have written more positively about.

I found our protagonist, Damani, an honest narrator and I thought Guns did a great job portraying the tolls of capitalism on Damani as well as Damani’s complex family dynamics. Jolene came across as an exaggerated, though also accurate representation of white women who will hashtag social justice phrases or even go to protests, though when they’re asked to actually put their resources on the line or to self-reflect about their own racist behavior, they don’t. The short chapters also helped Your Driver Is Waiting feel readable and punchy.I give this book three stars mostly because I had a hard time feeling a deeper emotional investment in the characters. On an intellectual level I think Damani’s experience is important in the context of class and activism, though the satirical writing style of the novel made it hard to feel with the characters instead of for them. Some of the pacing both on a plot level and a character development level felt a bit clunky to me.

In particular, I enjoyed reading Elliot Page’s raw reflections about his life, both related to his trans identity and his family dynamics. Though he uses a nonlinear frame in Pageboy, I still felt invested in the memoir because he writes each scene with enough specific detail that I could visualize his experiences and get a strong sense of his emotions. I found the nonlinear approach effective in this memoir because Page has a *lot* of trauma and life stuff broadly to share about, including parental stuff, coming out as a lesbian initially, then coming out as trans, sexual trauma, messy relationships, connecting with nature, and more. Getting snippets from each component of his life as opposed to a linear timeline of everything probably saved this memoir from being 600 pages long.I hovered around a 3.5 for a lot of this book so I’ll share what tipped me over to a four. First, I did get a sense of Page’s genuine healing and self-growth in this book, such as when he reflected about how he’s working on his attachment issues, setting better boundaries, and going to therapy. He also acknowledges his privilege, especially in regard to his wealth, which is something I appreciate in art. He doesn’t do it in an in-your-face “I have X privilege and Y privilege which means I was able to do A thing and B thing,” rather, he slips it in in ways that felt both subtle and important (though perhaps he could’ve named the problems with the cult of celebrity that contributed to people being obsessed with him in the first place, but anyway.) I liked too that he was real about his family estrangement and his separation from his father and his father’s current wife. Bio family members can be toxic, unwilling to change, and totally oppressive, and in my opinion it’s great for more people to be honest about that (my favorite read of the year so far, the novel Post-Traumatic by Chantal Johnson, addresses family estrangement from the perspective of Black Latinx woman. Would highly recommend this novel.)I don’t think this was a perfect memoir and I agree with other ers that Page could have tightened up some of the different narrative threads or provided a little more direct reflection on his emotional growth and healing journey.

On one hand, I can see the merits of A Quitter’s Paradise’s concept: a Chinese American woman struggling to cope with the grief over her mother’s recent death as well as estrangement from her other family members. Our main character is quite messy and I’m so in support of messy and nuanced Asian American protagonists.Unfortunately, our protagonist in A Quitter’s Paradise, Eleanor, is avoidant. Portraying an avoidant character is fine, but Eleanor is avoidant in a pretty one-note, one-dimensional way throughout the entire novel, which made for a dull reading experience. Elysha Chang employs multiple points of view in this novel and while I can see the utility of that (e.g., expanding empathy for other characters than Eleanor), the perspectives never really gelled together well. Finally, Eleanor is in a dissatisfying relationship with a white man – who she herself describes as condescending – and then this dissatisfying relationship is never addressed, she just persists in it?? The white man’s privilege and condescension is never interrogated either, which, big ugh (for novels centering Asian American women that do address this, see Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou which does it bombastically and Joan is Okay by Weike Wang which does it subtly). Also, Eleanor uses her colleague of color, Samir, for casual sex and basically treats him like dirt and then her treatment of him is never addressed either?? In sum, I wouldn’t recommend this novel and would encourage you to check out the titles I linked above, or other higher quality books, instead....more",Notes are private!,2,81,1,"Jun 28, 2023","Jul 02, 2023","Jun 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60635756-a-quitter-s-paradise

At times I felt that Catherine Lacey could capture a singular emotion – like a character’s ennui, or disconnection from their parent, or desire to move somewhere else. However, I don’t think the characters in these collections grew much if at all, nor do I think that the stories transcended describing one particular emotion. Quality short stories generally have to make every word count, and when they do – I’m thinking Jhumpa Lahiri’s Unaccustomed Earth or some of Adam Haslett’s You Are Not a Stranger Here – they can really sink you into a character’s heart and mind.

I Could Live Here Forever follows Leah Kempler, a woman in her mid-twenties completing an MFA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, she meets Charlie Nelson, a man with big feelings and grand proclamations of love. Leah is swept up in Charlie’s affection and soon finds herself in an all-consuming relationship with him. When Leah learns that Charlie is in recovery for a heroin addiction, she pauses, though presses on in the romance that’s become irresistible to her. As Charlie’s behavior grows more erratic and Leah’s friends and family grow increasingly concerned, her doubts increase, even as she proclaims to love him just as much as he loves her, flaws and all.I found this book mesmerizing. Leah is a deeply flawed protagonist who relies on people’s external validation of her, though I thought Hanna Halperin did an excellent job characterizing Leah and providing context into the roots of her behavior (e.g., Leah’s complicated relationship with her mother, who abandoned Leah several years ago). Halperin’s writing felt smooth yet magnetic; I wanted to know every twist and turn that awaited Leah and Charlie’s relationship as well as Leah’s own emotional journey throughout her twenties. It was difficult to see Leah crave men’s desire for her, though Halperin crafts her character with sharp writing that renders her in a sympathetic light. Halperin really showed us the toxic forces of amatonormativity and how people can try to use romance to fill up the voids within themselves! Whew.I also appreciated Halperin’s portrayal of Charlie. There’s still so much stigma surrounding substance use disorders, and I liked how Halperin portrayed Charlie as a three-dimensional character with some positive qualities (e.g., capacity for love and affection, artistic and a skilled singer) while also not shying away from showing the devastating effects of an opioid use disorder. Charlie definitely was emotionally manipulative and codependent a lot of the time too, and I think Halperin highlighted the cruelty of those behaviors instead of glorifying Charlie and Leah’s relationship as some nonproblematic intense love affair.The one element of this book that I felt disappointed by was that I don’t think Leah grows very much as a character? Perhaps she does a little bit by the end of the book as evidenced by how she (view spoiler)[broke up with Charlie, though her moving back to Boston made that convenient (hide spoiler)]. However, I don’t think she developed much insight into her propensity to throw herself into romantic relationships over and over without addressing her internal issues (e.g., lack of self-love, attachment wounds from her relationship with her mother). It’s not like I necessarily needed or expected a “Leah goes to therapy and after several sessions learns to love herself slowly yet surely” or even a “Leah develops an amazing best friendship with someone where she’s able to love healthfully and fully” type of thing, though something just a little more than where we left off would have been more satisfying for me.Overall, a strong novel that I could see many people enjoying, such as fans of realistic fiction, romance, and stories in general about complex women and relationships. Halperin’s debut novel Something Wild is on my to-read list for sure after witnessing the quality of her writing in I Could Live Here Forever!...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jun 15, 2023","Jun 17, 2023","Jun 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61151270-i-could-live-here-forever

Lata and Suresh Raman divorce after 36 years of marriage, with both wanting new starts in life. Suresh tries his hand at internet dating while Lata enjoys her new independence until she’s caught off guard by a professor in his early sixties who expresses an interest in her. Meanwhile, Lata and Suresh’s daughter Priya finds her father’s internet trysts distasteful even when she herself is embroiled in a clandestine affair with a married man. Finally, Lata and Suresh’s son Nikesh, their more affable child, struggles to adjust to life with a newborn child and a “marriage” with a woman that may not live up to Lata and Suresh’s expectations. The novel follows each of these four as they try to find happiness both in their own lives and with one another.I think Late Bloomers did such an excellent job of conveying the theme of new beginnings and how we can form and repair relationships at any stage of life. Deepa Varadarajan shows this theme through her masterful writing. Her prose felt so effortless and smooth; the novel’s tone is relaxed and casual, though I found myself immersed in each of the four character’s unique perspectives and flipping the pages to see what would happen next. Varadarjan really shows instead of tells with her writing and each scene entertained me while giving me more insight into each of the character’s fears and hopes. I appreciated that this novel centered fully-developed Indian American characters and that the plot didn’t focus on racism, whiteness, or anything too out of the ordinary – it was about four family members navigating their own lives with a lot of heart and humanity.I liked that Varadarajan made each of her four characters’ so well-developed. It can be difficult to juggle even two points of view in a novel, though she somehow created four narrators who each felt distinct. By the end of the novel, I could clearly see how each of them had grown. Late Bloomers ends on a realistically hopeful note, not with all the conflicts perfectly resolved though with enough movement that I felt satisfied with the plot’s progression. I was feeling a strong 4.5 for this book until some of the passages at the end brought tears to my eyes. And, by the last 75 pages, I was already processing my sadness about the novel ending. I wanted to keep learning about these characters and seeing how their lives played out, which always indicates a high quality read.I hope Varadarajan writes more books because I already know I’m definitely reading what she puts out next!

This book took me by surprise. In Five Years follows type A Manhattan lawyer Dannie Kohan, a woman who’s checked off all the boxes in her five-yWhew! This book took me by surprise. In Five Years follows type A Manhattan lawyer Dannie Kohan, a woman who’s checked off all the boxes in her five-year plan: crushing her career as a corporate lawyer and soon-to-be-married to her kind, wholesome boyfriend David. The night after David proposes, however, Dannie wakes up for one hour and finds herself in a surreal state, one in which she’s sleeping with a different man, in a different apartment, five years into the future. When Dannie wakes, she’s back in 2020 and still sleeping beside David. Her life continues on track, until four and a half years later, she meets the man from her dream, and destiny takes a turn Dannie wasn’t expecting.On a plot level, I think Rebecca Serle did a great job of using the flashforward in time to keep the suspense of the novel going. We sense this future vision is what’s going to happen, but we don’t know how Dannie will get there. And, I really was taken by surprise by the plot twists that led us there, in a pleasant way – the events made sense and didn’t feel too random yet were surprising all the same. This plot device also speaks to Dannie’s character growth, about her learning to let go of planning for the future and living in the moment. As a fellow type A planner, it was a nice reminder for me that sometimes life will just happen and all you can do is practice mindfulness, compassion, and enjoyment of the moment.I was also surprised in a good way by the theme of friendship and its significance in this novel. There are romantic elements in In Five Years, but Dannie’s relationship with her best friend Bella really takes center stage. I won’t spoil any of the plot, though I will say I was genuinely moved to tears a couple of times. Serle did that!All that said, I don’t think this was a perfect novel by any means. I felt that Dannie and Bella’s friendship could have been more richly constructed from the beginning of the novel. Serle’s writing got the job done but didn’t wow me as much as the five-star novels I’ve read over the past few years. Dannie’s loss of her brother from her childhood could have been more deeply explored. Still, In Five Years conveys an important message about living in the moment and skillfully portrays a heartrending friendship story.

Thao Thai highlights the effects of intergenerational trauma as well as how compassion and care can be passed down through families as well. I for the most part also appreciated the portrayal of patriarchy and how Thai highlighted that the different men in this novel either fully participated in sexism and misogyny or did small yet meaningful actions to support the women in their lives.On the more negative side, I felt that the quality of the prose didn’t fully support the ambitious themes of the novel. Sometimes the writing felt dry or the similes or metaphors came across as forced. I also didn’t love the one passage where one of the Vietnamese women basically thinks that a white man thinking of her as fragile or doll-like is similar to her making assumptions about him because he’s a white man; there’s a huge power imbalance between white people making stereotypes about Asian people and Asian people generalizing about white people. I think where Thai left Ann’s character was a smart and empowering choice, though the inclusion of Noah’s character – and the space devoted to him – felt unnecessary....more",Notes are private!,1,46,1,"Dec 23, 2023","Dec 24, 2023","May 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62800971-banyan-moon

One compelling theme is the push and pull between assimilating to mainstream American culture and resisting such pressures. I liked that John Okada was honest and angry in his writing about racism, especially given that the main character in this novel spent two years in a Japanese internment camp. I didn’t find the writing style of No-No Boy super engaging, though I appreciate the novel for its historical significance in regard to Japanese American/Asian American literature.Also, note that there’s some fatphobia, glorification of whiteness (e.g., saying that an Asian woman’s legs were “strong and shapely like a white woman’s,” which, yikes), and anti-Blackness (e.g., use of the n word) in this novel. These issues didn’t heavily influence my rating, though I feel like it’s important to name these things even if people might feel like they’re a product of the time in which this novel was written....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"May 16, 2023","May 17, 2023","May 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/129910.No_No_Boy

Roxanna Asgarian did a great job of discussing the nuances of transracial adoption and highlighting the privilege and abuses of power white adoptive parents can enact, in controlled yet effective prose. I was struck while reading her descriptions of this case about how we often stereotype white women as fragile or dainty or needing of care and protection, which can then obscure instances of when they perpetuate racism such as in this case.At the same time, Asgarian makes sure to also focus on the six children and their birth families, to not just provide perspective on the two white women in this tragedy. She discusses their experiences with the foster care system and the racism they faced time and time again. Through her journalism and reporting, she makes a convincing case for addressing the root systemic inequities that perpetuate racism and the disempowerment of birth families, particularly Black and brown birth families facing poverty, addiction, and mental illness.

Sindya Bhanoo offersIt’s rare for me to give a short story collection more than three stars, though doing so for Seeking Fortune Elsewhere felt easy. Sindya Bhanoo offers an intimate view into the complex lives of South Indian immigrants living both in the United States and in India, as they navigate issues including grief and loss, heartbreak, cultural mismatches, estrangement from family members, community expectations, and more. Bhanoo’s short stories are generally on the longer side (~20 pages each) which I tend to like, especially because in this case these tales kept my attention from the first page to the last.I think one of Bhanoo’s strengths as a writer is that she can create a strong emotional arc for her characters and show them to us through vivid yet understated scenes. Oftentimes I feel like short stories either don’t develop their characters well enough or they portray an interesting concept that doesn’t really go anywhere super satisfying. In these stories though, Bhanoo sets up each story with an interesting premise (e.g., an Indian professor whose former grad students reveal how he mistreated them years later, a woman grieving the loss of her son to a school shooting, a group of classmates who bullied a chubby girl who then grew into a powerful politician) and executes the emotional buildup and climax with accessible and moving prose. By the end of each story, I understood “the point,” instead of only feeling like the story was intriguing yet didn’t go anywhere. She also does a great job of showing and not telling and writing dialogue and scenes that all captured my attention.My only constructive critique is that I felt that some of these stories lacked that extra oomph to take me to five star territory. There’s a softness to Bhanoo’s prose that I really enjoy and don’t necessarily want to shift, though at times I wanted more of an emotional impact. I suspect that may come as she continues to develop as a writer. Thankfully, these stories don’t center or idealize whiteness/white characters, at least from my reading of them, a low bar yet one that doesn’t always get met. I’m looking forward to Bhanoo’s future work!...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jun 11, 2023","Jun 13, 2023","May 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57427936-seeking-fortune-elsewhere

The novel follows a tournament that happens once every generation, where seven families each offer a “champion” to fight to the death. The prize: that family gets to control a secret wellspring of high magick, the most powerful resource in the world. While the tournament had once been a secret, this year a tell-all book has exposed its inner workings and the families’ strengths and weaknesses to the whole world. The champions must decide whether to accept their fate or try to change what’s expected of them.I was hooked on this one by page 50 or so. All of Us Villains contains so much of what I’ve been missing from fantasy, YA or not – a magick system that’s compelling and explained in a non-boring and non-distracting way, characters with distinct and interesting personalities and motivations, and writing that flows well and makes me want to keep reading. Even with four different narrators, I found myself so riveted and invested in what would happen to each of them and the world of the Tournament overall. I thought Amanda Foody and C.L.

The novel follow3.5 starsI feel super torn between three and four stars for this book, so even though I’m lowering to three please keep that in mind! The novel follows Angie, a high school swimmer who comes across an affluent white boy, Henry, lying bleeding on a football field, stabbed and bleeding. She calls the police for help, and soon enough a young Black girl, Chiara, is accused of having hurt Henry. Angie is torn trying to figure out her place in the politics of what has happened, all while navigating dynamics related to her out of touch father and absent mother.I’ll start with the pros. I found Our Best Intentions relatively well-written and a page-turner. I was invested in knowing what would happen next both on a plot level and on a character development level (e.g., how will Angie come more into her identity or politics or not?) The book does a nice job of conveying themes related to Indian Americans’ place in the racial hierarchy of the United States, the pull between assimilating to white supremacy and wealth versus taking a stand against anti-Blackness and racism. I liked how Vibhuti Jain exposed the toxicity and the power of white privilege and how she didn’t let Angie off the hook for her silence. The novel also had some interesting themes about generational divides between Asian immigrant parents and their children.My main critique is that while the book was a good read for sure, I didn’t feel like it particularly excelled in any area. First, while I liked the relationship between Angie and her father and how they grew, I felt that the characterization or the writing about their dynamics could have gone even deeper (perhaps this could have manifested if Jain did not include so many different points of view in the novel.) I also felt odd about the Black girl’s suffering being used in a way to advance the Indian American character’s self-growth? While I don’t think Jain wielded that plot device in a horrible way, something about it didn’t feel completely satisfying or unproblematic to me. I’m still mulling it over! Overall, an okay novel that kept my interest even if it’s not one of my top books of the year....more",Notes are private!,2,39,1,"Nov 24, 2023","Nov 26, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61319775-our-best-intentions

In All That’s Left Unsaid, we follow Ky Tran, a young Vietnamese American woman who returns to her hometown of Cabramatta after her younger brother is brutally murdered. After attending his funeral and learning about the ineptness of the police who handled his case, Ky takes matters into her own hands and seeks out the people who witnessed her brother’s death. Through this pursuit Ky realizes truths about herself, her brother, and others from her past that shakes her foundation of right and wrong, as well as the expectations she placed both on her family and the people around her.One strength of this novel that stood out to me from the start was Tracey Lien’s ability to write from multiple perspectives effectively. Usually books that include more than two or so points of view do so in awkward or stilted way where the multiple voices detract from the story instead of adding to it. However, Lien does an excellent job of giving each perspective a distinct voice, and she focuses each one so that they all ultimately add to the suspenseful and thrilling elements of All That’s Left Unsaid. Thanks to the multiple perspectives, we also get to see how the heroin epidemic of the 90’s in Australia affected various Vietnamese community members, furthering our empathy and understanding. This is a novel about race, class, and injustice, though Lien foregrounds her characters so it feels more like we’re learning about and developing concern for them, instead of solely ingesting lessons about social justice. I could tell that I was going to give this book at least four stars from early on in my reading experience, though some plot and character events that occurred in the second half bumped it closer to a five star for me. Namely, I love how Lien developed Ky and Minnie’s friendship and showed where both characters were right and where they messed up. I love when an author creates a situation where characters are messy and human and there’s a conflict that feels well-earned with both parties doing their best and still failing, instead of a conflict that comes across as cheap (e.g., characters fighting primarily because of repetitive miscommunication). I felt that the dynamic between Ky and Minnie served as a powerful vehicle to communicate broader themes about intergenerational trauma in a subtle way. By the end of the novel there’s growth from these characters too, which I deeply enjoyed witnessing. Overall, a powerful novel I would recommend to fans of contemporary novels focused on family/community drama as well as fans of mysteries/thrillers/books about race and class and immigration.

I liked how Alejandro Varela focused on the queer Latinx experience, in particular queer Latinx men who exist at the intersection of race and class. I found his writing gripping and energetic, each story delivering a scenario or a conflict rarely seen in literature before. From a restaurant worker who sells high-end designer clothes to support his family, to a childcare worker for a well-meaning yet awkward and occasionally problematic Swedish family in an affluent co-op building, to a queer man in an interracial relationship trying and failing to break up with his yikes-worthy therapist, Varela holds our interest with prose that is smart and self-aware.Unfortunately there were a couple of elements of this short story collection that dampened my enthusiasm. First, I found the stories sometimes veered into intellectualism a bit too much at the cost of more emotional connection or payoff from the characters. Perhaps this intellectualism is a feature of some of Varela’s characters who come from more educated backgrounds, though I think the discussion of social justice issues in the abstract may have precluded the inclusion of scenes that could have felt more heartrending. I also felt puzzled by the centering of whiteness and white male romantic partners in the queer relationships in The People Who Report More Stress. White men take up a decent amount of space in these stories and for the most part I don’t think they do so in a way that really challenges white male supremacy or the idealization of white men within the queer community. Books with queer men of color that felt more empowering to read include Tell Me How to Be by Neel Patel, Boys Come First by Aaron Foley, and Such a Lonely, Lovely Road by Kagiso Lesego Molope. Overall, an okay collection. I would still probably check out Varela’s future works.

I resonated with and appreciated a lot of what Eirinie Carson wrote about grief: how the first therapist she saw was horrible and took up all the space and how fortunate she felt to find her second therapist, the way grief can still feel devastating even when other people cease to recognize it, and refusing to portray the people who die as all good or all bad. As she writes about with great self-awareness, oftentimes the only way to cope is to go through it, to face the sad and painful feelings head-on instead of avoiding them. I liked that she centered her best friendship in this book too, as deaths of friends aren’t talked about as often. Unfortunately I didn’t love Carson’s writing style in this memoir. I think it’s a courageous and risky choice to use the second person point of view, though I didn’t feel that it worked too well. I read a lot of telling and not enough showing, in my opinion.

I liked a lot of the content though I found it difficult to immerse myself in the writing style. Jane Wong has published poetry predominantly, and I think that’s evident in how she writes this book. There’s not really a concrete or linear flow of events, and at times I wasn’t sure what certain sentences meant (e.g., “What does it take to want myself? I stare deeper. I slurp noodle after noodle, ravenous. The noodles bounce back against my teeth, deliciously resistant to the bite.” … so… how does this relate to wanting yourself? Also how are the noodles resistant to your bite??) However, Wong seems like such a lovely and thoughtful person that I found myself still enjoying her life stories by the end of the book. I liked reading about her honoring her anger as an Asian American woman, her experience growing up working-class, how she found her way with writing in predominantly white literary spaces, her deep connection with her friends, and her wholesome relationship with her mom and her complex relationship with her dad. Even how she wrote about her students, I could tell she’s a caring person who’s invested in both creating and supporting Asian American literature. Thus, even though the writing style of Meet Me Tonight in Atlantic City isn’t my favorite, I believe that Wong bared her soul both honestly and powerfully in its pages....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,Jun 2023,"Jun 02, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62972517-meet-me-tonight-in-atlantic-city

I enjoyed reading some details about a twelve-year-old boy’s difficult coming of age in a Chinatown housing project. There’s a metafiction element about a graphic novelist trying to rewrite his narrative after experiencing child abuse and trauma. I think the theme of coping with trauma and trying to rewrite one’s narrative to heal is interesting. Unfortunately the metafiction device employed by Kevin Chong made it difficult for me to connect with the characters; I felt so conscious of the device itself and trying to understand what was happening in the story that I got taken out of the narrative.

Zoulfa Katouh did a great job of imbuing As Long as the Lemon Trees Grow with a message of hope without downplaying the atrocities the characters witness and experience.

What did I just read.I almost gave this book two stars. I think My Year of Meats contains some interesting commentOkay you all… what did I just read. What did I just read.I almost gave this book two stars. I think My Year of Meats contains some interesting commentary about the production and marketing of meat on a global level. It also highlights the cruelty of patriarchal abuse and violence. However, I just cannot get past the horrible anti-Black racism that Ruth Ozeki perpetuates in this novel. I was literally shocked when I read these passages given how I hadn’t seen anyone point them out before. I’m going to provide a few examples, though be warned they’re super racist.At one point the Asian American protagonist, Jane, studies abroad in Japan and meets a Black man there, Emil. Ozeki describes Jane’s encounter with Emil as such:“He towered over them – tall, coal black, utterly different. Our eyes met over the tops of the schoolgirls’ heads and he froze like a panther, hungry after a long nap, at the sight of an antelope jogging by.”What the actual f*ck?? Why could you compare a Black man to a literal animal? That’s literally so dehumanizing and degrading and racist. And then, on the same page, Ozeki writes this of Emil’s voice: “his voice was like chocolate.” Now you’re comparing a Black person to food. Also, what does chocolate even sound like? Does chocolate make a sound?? And to top this all off, on the following page, Jane assumes that Emil is an athlete. When Emil points out that this is a racist assumption, Jane gets defensive, and then, the worst part – Ozeki literally writes their interaction so that Emil doesn’t care that Jane was racist toward him, and the two proceed to have a romantic relationship for two years. I am not even kidding. This is 100% what happens.You might say: but Thomas, this book is at least slightly satirical, so maybe that’s why Ozeki wrote these racist passages. Okay, sure, satire, whatever, but even if that were the case, I feel like satire is supposed to have an actual point. In my opinion satire should have some sort of purpose, like to communicate social commentary (that ideally punches up). In this book, Ozeki’s anti-Black racism served no purpose. There are at least two other examples of anti-Black racism I detected in this book, one in which an interracial lesbian couple perpetuates the stereotype of Black men as hypersexual (the quote from the book: “Yeah, apparently black men don’t have a lot of problems with potency”) and another passage where Black people are described as “poor colored folk” who “make do with lugging along some home-cooked fried chicken.” To my fellow Asian Americans… we really have to do better than this. Not to center my feelings, though I’ll just say it’s frankly embarrassing to me that this book exists.To top it all off, I found Ozeki’s portrayal of her Japanese characters as one-dimensional and stereotypical. Her Asian American protagonist Jane comes across as more three-dimensional and “progressive,” whereas her Japanese female protagonist Akiko is portrayed as submissive and passive *until* she makes contact with Jane. Idk what else to say to you all about this novel. Fingers crossed for much better reads moving forward....more",Notes are private!,4,100,1,"Apr 03, 2023","Apr 05, 2023","Apr 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12349.My_Year_of_Meats

The authors highlighted many of the stereotypical roles Black folks are forced to in this film genre, including but not limited to the spook, the witch doctor, the magical n****, the sidekick, the person who gets killed off first, and more. They named how anti-Blackness intersects with other forms of oppression such as sexism and homophobia. I also enjoyed the humor they sprinkled in throughout the book to add some levity without sacrificing the gravity of the issues they raise. I think The Black Guys Dies First got a little repetitive by the end, though I’d still recommend it for those interested given the importance of deconstructing racism both in the media we consume and in the real world.One point in particular I appreciated the authors making is that there are so few Black gay characters in romantic relationships with other Black gay characters in the film – the authors make the astute observation that perhaps queerness is only tolerated when it’s paired with a non-Black (from what I’ve seen, primarily white) love interest. I see this in a lot of media, like for Asian Americans how oftentimes we’re only allowed to shine if we’re paired with a white person, which like… can we please promote Asian love and other forms of love that don’t need to center whiteness!

In Family Meal, Washington tackles themes of grief, how loss can intersect with sex and disordered eating and substance use. I appreciate him for tackling difficult mental health related-topics. I also like how Washington writes queer men of color without centering whiteness and white people in his novels. There’s a cultural authenticity in Family Meal that doesn’t feel forced. I also felt that Washington’s ability to develop three-dimensional characters who actually grow – albeit in messy ways – has improved since his prior book Memorial.Unfortunately I still find Washington’s prose itself unconvincing. The characters’ conversations with one another, especially the more emotional ones, felt contrived. Because of the clunky writing I felt myself reading these characters from a distance, more like “okay, this character is growing through X grief thing” or “now this character is coping with Y grief thing through Z” instead of feeling immersed in the story.Three stars, though I appreciate what Washington is putting out there when the lgbtq literary scene is still so white. Also, big shout out to Washington for mentioning Onces, NewJeans, and Red Velvet all within the span of two to three pages.

She’sOmg… for all my fellow sensitive souls with abandonment issues… this one is for us!Ok, a plot summary before I fanboy/girl further: Ro is stuck. She’s a Korean American woman entering her thirties, spending her days in an unfulfilling job at a mall aquarium and drinking herself to sleep at night. People have left her, like her father who went missing on an expedition several years ago and her boyfriend who recently joined a mission to Mars. Ro struggles with the people who haven’t left, too, like her mother, who she doesn’t speak to, and her best friend Yoonhee, whose upcoming marriage has eclipsed their friendship. Ro feels a connection with Dolores, a giant Pacific octopus who’s also Ro’s last link to her father. But when Dolores is sold to a wealthy investor who plans to take her away, Ro is faced with the choice to stay submerged in her unaddressed grief and trauma or to reclaim the parts of her life worth living.Anyone who’s followed me for any period of time knows that I love a well-developed angsty character arc, and Sea Change blew that out of the park. There’s a lot going on in Ro’s life, including the upcoming sale of Dolores, Ro’s melancholy distant relationship with her mother, her conflict with Yoonhee, and more. Gina Chung does an excellent job of keeping the ball rolling with all of these elements of Ro’s life in the present while also portraying how Ro’s grief about her father’s disappearance and her breakup with Tae have gutted her emotionally. Chung’s use of flashbacks was excellent; her scenes set in the past felt vivid and provided important, heartrending context for Ro’s present circumstances. I’d describe Chung’s writing style as understated yet effective, as I cared deeply for Ro and felt for her across all her relationships.With that said, I want to highlight that Ro as a character won me over. Unlike her best friend Yoonhee, Ro isn’t flashy. She’s just trying to live her life, and I loved that for her and about her. I felt compelled by her messiness and compassion for her struggle, like her calling Tae in a bout of missing him and her submerging her grief in alcohol. Ro’s growth throughout the novel moved me so much, and her realizations about grief, connection, and attachment had me teary-eyed at least a couple of times toward the end. As someone who’s faced multiple instances of deep grief in my life, I felt so connected to Ro and her journey of recognizing that grief isn’t something you can avoid nor is it something you ever fully get over even when you do address it. Grief can feel better with time though it often has to feel worse, first. I also enjoyed the Asian American (specifically Korean American) representation in Sea Change. The representation didn’t feel overly in my face, rather, it’s these three-dimensional Korean American characters living their day-to-day nuanced lives, and I loved that. I liked and resonated with the complexity in which Chung portrayed Ro’s parents’ immigration experience and how that went on to affect Ro’s own psyche. Ro’s parents felt like full people and not stereotypical Asian American parents, thank goodness. Also not to be thirsty in a Goodreads  but where can I get a gay or bi version of Tae lolol anyway I’m wholesome.Overall, highly recommended. In my top two favorite books I’ve read this year so far. Gina Chung is an author to watch and I am highly anticipating her short story collection coming out next year. Also, for those who’ve already read Sea Change, the scene where (view spoiler)[Dolores splashes the white man who’s trying to buy her and Ro starts laughing was SO funny I literally giggled while reading this book at like 10:30pm in my bed (hide spoiler)] made me laugh, I appreciate Chung for including it....more",Notes are private!,0,95,1,"Apr 15, 2023","Apr 17, 2023","Mar 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61387972-sea-change

The Town of Babylon follows Andrés, a gay Latinx professor of Public Oh wow a lot happened in this novel, and it all came together for the most part! The Town of Babylon follows Andrés, a gay Latinx professor of Public Health who returns to his suburban hometown after finding out that his husband cheated on him. Andrés attends his twenty-year high school reunion, and afterward he encounters many significant people from his past, including: his sexy first boyfriend who broke his heart, his best friend who he abandoned when he moved away for college, a white Evangelical minister who Andrés suspects of killing another boy back in high school in a homophobic rage, and his family, namely his brother who died after Andrés left for the city. These people force Andrés to reconcile not only his relationships with them but also his relationship with himself, flaws and all.I’ll start by sharing that this book made me feel sad and depressed though in a positive way. Andrés purposefully left his hometown so he could create a better life for himself. Returning to this suburban landscape with many Trumps supporters and people who perpetuate microaggressions against him – it sucks. Not only from a political perspective, Andrés also must confront his own teenage inadequacies and selfishness. I thought Alejandro Varela did an excellent job of capturing Andrés’s angst. His writing felt easy-to-read yet vivid in a subdued, moody way. As a queer person of color who also worked hard to get out of my childhood home and hometown, I felt for Andrés as he navigated the intersection of his Latinx identity, his queerness, and just the mess of his adolescence and his past regrets and issues.I felt a bit concerned about if Varela would be able to wrap up the book in a satisfying way, though thankfully he pulls it off with style and sophistication. Andrés is still a sometimes annoying and definitely flawed character by the end of the book, though he grows a lot in how he treats people and reflects on his past, especially his relationship with his dead brother. Varela did an excellent job of showing how oftentimes, you can’t really grow and move forward until you face your issues, even if it feels hard. This element of the book reminds me of the superb James Baldwin quote: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” Also, I give props to Varela for his on-point political commentary related to racism, colorism, and what immigrants and refugees leave behind when they come to the United States.There were just a couple elements of The Town of Babylon that didn’t 100% work for me. First, I felt like there was a lot happening, and I don’t know if all of it had to happen for the book to work. Namely, the storyline with the homophobic Evangelical priest. I can see how people may resonate with that plot if they encountered that type of brutal homophobia in their teen years – which I luckily managed to avoid, mostly – and I’m all for pointing out the hypocrisy of people who preach love though practice hate. I just felt like that plotline didn’t wrap up in an altogether satisfying way and I wondered if that’s because it had to compete with all the other storylines for space. Finally, there were a couple of times where Varela left Andrés’s perspective and went into the point-of-view of a bunch of different people, including the homophobic priest’s parents and his best friend’s parents. While I can see how that provides more in-depth perspective into those characters’ lives, I wondered if the emotional impact of the novel would’ve felt even greater if we stuck a bit closer to Andrés. As you can see I had feelings and thoughts about this book so it didn’t bore me! I think this author released a short story collection so I may check that one out.

It reminded me of one of my absolute favorite television shows Insecure. Even though I miss that show a lot, reading Boys Come First brought so many of the positive Insecure-inspired feelings back. In Boys Come First, we follow three gay friends: Dominick, an advertising copywriter who’s returning to Detroit after his long-term romantic relationship in New York City collapses, Troy, an idealistic high school teacher who comes from a financially privileged background, and Remy, a successful real estate agent who’s struggling to find similar success in his romantic life. When Dominick returns to Detroit, he reignites his long-term friendship with Troy who’s also best friends with Remy, and the three hit it off. However, when one of Remy’s real estate projects morphs into a ploy to enable gentrification in this trio’s hometown, the three men will have to figure out a way to navigate conflict in their friendship or face a more permanent separation. I enjoyed reading about these three characters so much. It can be hard to pull off with multiple points of view, but Aaron Foley excels at making each of their perspectives unique while still blending together well. One of my best friends and I have talked about how oftentimes it can feel like fiction centering Black characters has to revolve around police brutality or slavery to make it into the mainstream; I loved how Boys Come First instead focuses on how these men navigate their careers, romantic lives, families, friendships, and the changing tides of Detroit. This novel reminded me of Insecure in the best way possible, such that the characters felt so dynamic and three-dimensional and worth paying attention to. Horribly traumatic things did not need to happen for me to feel invested in Dominick, Troy, and Remy, rather, Foley’s quality of prose kept me engaged in their stories and immersed in their day-to-day lives.At the same time, this novel does address real and important themes, such as the impact of gentrification, coping with emotionally unavailable and/or abusive men, and dealing with aging. Yet, all these themes fold into the characters’ narratives seamlessly. The novel puts its characters and their development at the forefront, not shying away from topics like gentrification though also not putting the social justice issues above and beyond our connection with the characters. As an Asian American person I recognize I’m not the best person to judge this, though Boys Come First felt unapologetically Black to me, like I sensed and appreciated that Foley wrote this with love for the gay Black Detroit community and not to appease white or non-Black people of color. Overall, I loved this novel. I felt sad for the characters when they faced challenges, happiness for when they found success in various domains of life ((view spoiler)[okay while I loved the friendship between the characters the most I will say I screamed a little at the hint of a happy ending with Remy and Terrell, ah!!! (hide spoiler)]), and laughed at the many humorous moments too. The theme of friendship made me smile and Foley executed the three characters’ friendship dynamics so well. This is the first time I’ve given two books in a row five stars since June 2021, so big thank you to Aaron Foley and Gina Chung for writing two bomb books and bringing me much comfort, solace, and entertainment even when I’m dealing with grief and other life issues.

I loved Davis’s honesty about her childhood growing up in poverty and in an abusive household. She doesn’t hold back any details and reading about all the rats she lived with and the abuse she witnessed and experienced felt heartbreaking. I enjoyed too her journey of growing up and getting out of that household, to develop into the talented and amazing actress she is today. Throughout the memoir, she recounts specific scenes, conversations, and events so the book felt immersive rather than boring. I liked her realness about so many elements of her life, including the awful colorism she faced as a dark-skinned Black woman, the difficulty of making a living as an actress, and what it felt like for her to witness her abusive father change into a genuinely kind person over time. Also, always appreciate when someone writes about what they learned from therapy. Toward the end of the book, the intersection of her writing about her career and her writing about the evolution of her family dynamic sometimes merged in a way that didn’t always work for me.

I enjoyed reading Brontez Purnell’s Since I Laid My Burden Down, about a queer Black man who grew up in the South and then left for San Francisco. The novel is a bit like a fever dream with a lot of sex and reflections about relationships and men, as well as some darker themes related to abuse, especially the problematic normalization of child abuse. I tend to vibe with novels that follow a more linear plot, however I didn’t mind the flashing backward and forward in this book because our narrator, DeShawn, has such a clear, unapologetic voice that made the reading experience fun and engaging regardless. I liked how Purnell captured DeShawn’s shamelessness and thirst for life. It’s wonderful to read a novel where a queer person of color, in this case a queer Black man specifically, does interact with whiteness though the novel itself doesn’t feel weighed down by or excessively focused on whiteness or white people at all.Though the book as a whole felt immersive, there were moments of hope, self-reflection, and growth toward the end of the novel that I wanted more of. However, I’d still recommend this novel to those interested in realistic fiction that centers unapologetic Black characters....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"May 14, 2023","May 16, 2023","Mar 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31944956-since-i-laid-my-burden-down

In Mad Honey we follow Olivia McAfee, a beekeeper who moves from Boston to her New Hampshire hometown to escape a marriage that turned toxic. Olivia’s son, Asher, finds young romance with Lily Campanello, a girl in her senior year of high school who also moved to Adams, New Hampshire for a fresh start. All seems to go well until one day Olivia gets a phone call: Lily is dead, and Adam is being questioned by the police. Over time we see how this situation unfolds at Asher’s trial as well as how the characters’ lives developed to get to this juncture in the first place.This is the first novel I’ve read by Jodi Picoult in seven years; I used to read her books all the time and then paused when she went the YA route and after seeing some mixed s of some of her most recent works. I will say she still definitely has that addictive quality to her writing, especially with the courtroom drama. The whole time I was like, omg, *what* is going to happen next. She and Jennifer Finney Boylan did a great job structuring the plot of the novel, and their writing felt fluid and effortless enough that I kept flipping the pages, eager to know what would happen next. What I find interesting is that when I finished the book, I did wonder if Picoult’s tried and true method of the courtroom drama eclipses some potential for even deeper emotional character growth in her work. However, I flew through this book and enjoyed the reading experience nonetheless.On the note of her characters, I did find myself compelled by their stories. It’s hard to write about without spoilers, though I’ll say that Lily’s identity development and hard-won search for herself did make me emotional and tear up a bit. I know it’s the bare minimum for men, and at the same time Asher’s love for Lily including every part of her identity did move me. There were a few scenes where the book definitely slipped into (view spoiler)[now it’s time to educate cisgender people about transgender identity (hide spoiler)] though I suppose given the range of Picoult’s audience, that content may be necessary? Especially with everything repressive going on in the United States right now. The authors also do an excellent job of portraying the consequences of male rage/patriarchy and repressive gender roles in a show and not tell way.Overall, an entertaining and moving read. Picoult knows how to write and she knows how to write a lot, and I respect her for that!...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Mar 29, 2023","Mar 31, 2023","Mar 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59912428-mad-honey

I found her prose vivid and enjoyed how she forefronts issues of race and class while still keeping the focus on the emotions and desires of Jamaican women living across the United States, Jamaica, and Europe. There’s an interesting theme that runs across these stories related to feeling disconnected from who you are and what you want, even when you may have had “more” opportunities than your immigrant or less-privileged parents.At the same time, I found the stories unfortunately repetitive in their tone and affect. Most of the stories end on an unhappy or despairing note. It’s not like I expected every story to end in a super positive way or for the characters’ lives to be wrapped neatly in a bow, however, the repetition came from how I felt that Irving would introduce an unhappy character struggling with a personal dilemma in the context of a societal issue (e.g., colorism, classism, toxic masculinity) and then the character never really grew or made more than maybe a tiny step toward overcoming the obstacle in front of them. It’s like, yes, I get that white supremacy is undeniably a negative force in the lives of these characters, though I wanted more than just that.

Given that no one in Quebec wants to hire her as a French teacher, she takes a job as a hotline operator at a weight-loss center. After work, at home, she tries to care for her son while they both acclimate to a new country.Dimitri Nasrallah does a great job of portraying how Muna, our protagonist, takes every effort possible to secure a life for herself and her son Omar. His prose is quiet yet powerful and highlights the pressures Muna face to assimilate to Canadian culture. He also portrays the impact of grief and loss on Muna as she tries to keep everything in her life together for herself and Omar. I found Muna such a resonant protagonist; I’m the son of Vietnamese immigrants to the US so it made me reflect with nuance on my parents’ journey, and I imagine it may pull thoughtful and similar reactions to those with related life experiences. What shines brightest in this book is Muna’s determination to put one step forward and to advance her station in life even when she’s been cruelly knocked down again and again.

In In Limbo, Deb JJ Lee details theOh wow, what a powerful graphic memoir and one of the most enjoyable illustrated works I have read in a long time. In In Limbo, Deb JJ Lee details their experience growing up in a New Jersey suburb as a Korean American child of immigrants. They write about feeling like the Other and facing racism from their white peers as well as mistreatment and abuse from their mom. As their feelings of isolation and mental suffering escalate throughout high school, they start to turn to art as a way to heal. They also take a trip to South Korea that helps them discover a new perspective on their family, their heritage, and themselves.In Limbo swept me up; I felt so much empathy and sympathy for Deb JJ Lee’s tumultuous childhood and adolescence. Their illustrations felt vivid and alive to me and captured the raw honesty of their experiences so well. I appreciated the themes of not belonging and not meeting both the white beauty standard or really the Korean beauty standard either. As someone who was also abused by my mother, I felt my heart leap up in my throat when I read the scenes about Deb’s abuse at the hands of their mother. This graphic memoir felt so real, though in a way that also showed Lee’s processing and perspective developing over time and not like a first draft diary entry.I most loved reading about Lee’s growth and hard-won emotional maturity. After a lot of suffering, toward the end of the graphic memoir they learn several important lessons about not expecting your friends to fix your mental health (even if you can receive support from them, just not in a codependent way) as well as honoring their Korean heritage and seeing their mother as a full-person. The therapy session they go to where their therapist made the pillars analogy made me legit choke up because I felt the exact same way about my life, about how once you can escape your childhood environment (e.g., by going to college) you can eventually go back to your childhood and witness it with newfound perspective and maybe even peace. I also felt so moved by Deb’s healthy relationship with their father. We love seeing supportive and three-dimensional Asian fathers portrayed on the page! The main reason I give this book four stars instead of five is because I felt like some of the themes related to race and racism could have been further developed. I think the end of In Limbo highlights Lee’s initial start to developing a deeper understanding of their Korean heritage. However, I felt that Lee highlighted several instances of internalized racism (e.g., not wanting to be friends with the other Korean kid in their class at one point) but didn’t really address that internalized racism fully. There are a lot of white people in this book and while that makes sense because In Limbo is a memoir and that’s how things played out in the author’s life, I found myself wanting more growth in the area of racial self-esteem. However, I recognize that journey may have occurred after the events shown in this memoir.

Though I didn’t love this one as much as Sword of Kaigen, I still feel that Blood Over Bright Haven has a lot to offer: a compelling dark academia setup, an interesting and well-written magic system, and on-point, well-integrated commentary about sexism and gender. Though the book is somewhat long, I finished it in two days because the prose was so readable and I wanted to know what would happen next.The main reason I give this book four stars instead of five is because the first half or so of the story felt a tad predictable to me. It came across as almost didactic, and the parallels between a privileged person learning about their privilege from a marginalized person (e.g., I was thinking of a white person learning about their white privilege from a person of color) almost felt too obvious to me. This element of the novel slightly redeemed itself toward the second half when Sciona started to recognize her own problematic behavior and self-correct.I will say though, the last 20% of Blood Over Bright Haven had me *shaken*. It really saved the novel for me. Things happened that I did not expect though felt so satisfying from a plot and character development perspective. I felt genuinely moved by the characters and their growth. To avoid spoilers, all I’ll say is *that* is how you put your money where your mouth is in terms of allyship, standing with people with less privilege than you, etc. All in all, a solid four-star read....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Aug 13, 2023","Aug 15, 2023","Mar 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57915993-blood-over-bright-haven

In my circles Simu Liu has a reputation for being a bit of a himbo so I wasn’t sure how I’d react to this memoir. However, I found it a well-written, down-to-earth portrayal of his parents’ immigration from China to Canada as well as his childhood upbringing and his subsequent foray into business and then acting. As the child of Vietnamese immigrants myself, I liked reading about Simu’s parents’ journey and Simu’s raw honesty about the difficult and abusive parts of his childhood. I also felt quite entertained learning about his time working at Deloitte and all the effort he put into developing his acting career. One thing I appreciated in particular is his ability to name when and where he messed up in his life, to face those mistakes instead of covering them up. The main thing I wanted more of was additional reflection on his dynamic with his parents later on in his life. He wrote with candor about what they went through as immigrants as well as their abusive behavior toward him, though I think how he processed those events later in his life felt glossed over. I know in September 2022 he tweeted about going to therapy (not sure if that’s when he first started) so I wonder if there will be even more self-insight into that part of his life later on, whether he wants to share about it publicly or not....more",Notes are private!,0,81,1,"Feb 24, 2023","Feb 27, 2023","Feb 24, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52582665-we-were-dreamers

Joy DeGruy explores and unpacks how some of Black Americans’ present-day behaviors may stem from slavery (i.e., glorifying whiteness and viewing Blackness as inferior, possessing low self-esteem, and persistent anger). Through her historically-attuned arguments, she makes the case for both understanding the past and using that knowledge to change the present. I think this book may be of particular benefit to people who don’t know much about the history of slavery in the United States as well as those who want to think more deeply about intergenerational internalized racism.

I felt immersed in our protagonist Katrina Kim’s story. She’s stuck in a lukewarm office job, barely making ends meet, while nursing an obsession with her co-worker Kurt. When Katrina receives a cryptic message from Kurt that implies that he knows about Katrina’s lurking, she takes desperate measures to reclaim control in her life even when everything has already spiraled out beyond her wildest imagination. I liked the mental health components of Liar, Dreamer, Thief as well as the thriller components. I felt a lot of empathy for Katrina in relation to her mental health struggles; Maria Dong does a nice job of showing Katrina’s symptoms in a vivid and realistic way. Similarly, Dong’s writing is fast-paced and entertaining enough that I felt compelled by the more suspenseful parts of the story. I finished this book last night in my apartment and literally felt creeped the heck out, in a positive way, as I learned more and more about the revelations underlying Katrina’s obsession with Kurt.Unfortunately I’m giving this book three stars because I didn’t feel like the mental health storyline or the thriller storyline were properly resolved? There was a lot of buildup to both parts of the novel though the ending kind of felt like a copout to me. The ending took this approach that almost came across as magical realism to me where certain things fell into place that were either too convenient or too nonsensical, to the point where I couldn’t fully emotionally connect with the narrative anymore. In sum, Liar, Dreamer, Thief kept my attention for sure, even if it’s not a novel I would recommend right away....more",Notes are private!,2,38,1,"Mar 02, 2023","Mar 04, 2023","Feb 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61030718-liar-dreamer-thief

Lamya H does a great job of writing about the intersection of her queerness with her Muslim and immigrant identities. I liked her honesty in unpacking and then moving forward from her earlier internalized racism and internalized homophobia. I think she is able to point out her family’s homophobia without playing into tired narratives of people in the United States being superior for their “progressiveness.” She holds the complexity of her love for her family and her religion alongside her queerness. I also enjoyed her self-insight about her difficulty trusting people and learning about how to pick her fights related to social justice while maintaining her mental health.Unfortunately I just found Lamya H’s writing style a bit tedious.

I felt happy for her growth, though bored by the format in which it presented itself in the memoir.

I like that he makes the point that alleviating poverty would require wealthy people to give up some resources and that that sacrifice is worth it if you’re actually an empathetic person. He addresses intersections of race and poverty with an emphasis on Black Americans, and he also details how expensive poverty can get through the presence of factors such as unnecessary banking and paycheck fees. At times I felt like the book read like a manifesto or a well-researched rant. I didn’t disagree with many of his points, however.

Julia Lee writes about the racism she faced both in these educational spaces and outside the walls of academia. She shares with riveting honesty the tremendous anger she felt due to her tumultuous household as well as from the numerous instances of microaggressions, racial exclusion, and internalized racism she herself experienced and/or witnessed. One of the aspects of this memoir I appreciated the most is Lee’s commitment to calling in/out fellow Asian Americans on how we can either fight to dismantle white supremacy alongside Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities in the United States or we can align ourselves with white supremacy and reap its (heinous) benefits. While I have Asian American close friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who act to combat white supremacy, I also know many other Asian Americans who try to align themselves with whiteness (e.g., pursuing upward class/educational mobility while perpetuating anti-Blackness, exhibiting anti-Black and colorist dating preferences, and more). I hope this book can help stir some dialogue and change from within the Asian American community broadly.I also enjoyed reading her raw recounting of her relationship with her parents. I resonated with how she acknowledged the traumas they faced and how those traumas influenced their parenting, while at the same time not condoning child abuse or cruelty toward children. Love this ability to hold nuance and I feel like Lee’s self-awareness shines through when she writes about her parents, amidst many other aspects of her life she writes intelligently about.

To start off with the positive, I think Erum ShaziA novel that tackles important issues though also felt really frustrating to read at the same time. To start off with the positive, I think Erum Shazia Hasan addresses important issues related to colonialism, white saviorism, and people’s complicity in those forces even when they are not white. Our protagonist Maya, is a south Asian woman whose colleague, Marc, a white man, is accused of sexually assaulting a local girl in the fictional village of Likanni in an unnamed African nation. I think We Meant Well is a unique story in that it covers the issue of foreign “aid,” and I do think Maya grew in the right direction by the end of the book.However, I have to say Maya was such a frustrating character to read. She has so much unaddressed internalized racism and complicity in white supremacy, it’s painful to witness. For example, one way she copes with the trauma of witnessing brutal human suffering in Likanni is to marry a rich white man in the United States who literally is a gross “liberal” type who thinks philanthropy is the answer to addressing global poverty, YIKES??? Maya does grow by the end of the novel, thank goodness, though idk, I know I’ve never done foreign aid work so I can’t speak to that experience, but it felt really annoying that basically Maya is in her late 30’s and she’s just now realizing that maybe siding with whiteness and viewing people living in Africa through a paternalistic lens isn’t the right way to go?? Like why didn’t she address any of these issues before she decided to go work in Africa?? I think people who are more sympathetic to her struggle in this area may enjoy this book more because I was just waiting for Maya to improve. Unlike her, the people in this fictional village don’t have the privilege to waddle in self-guilt and self-flagellation. Anyway, I thought this book was okay overall and while I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, if you’re really into the synopsis maybe check it out. I do think the novels Caucasia by Danzy Senna and The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett do a better job of showing characters struggling and reckoning with their proximity to whiteness. I know these novels differ from We Meant Well in that they focus on Black Americans as opposed to a South Asian woman doing aid work in Africa, though I thought I’d include them so that people may have books to turn to if they’re searching for something to read....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jul 04, 2023","Jul 08, 2023","Feb 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62320837-we-meant-well

She’s real about her life, including her internalized colorism as a child, the faults of her first marriage, feeling competition with younger Black women in Hollywood, and more. She also shares courageously about topics such as her experience of sexual assault in her young adulthood and people’s intrusive probing about her fertility as an older adult. She reflects on these topics with the wisdom of someone who’s both had enough time to process and who’s unafraid to delve deeper into her initial thoughts and emotions about a situation. I particularly appreciated when she shared about mistakes she made (e.g., perpetuating homophobia in her young adulthood) and what she learned.While there were a couple of topics I felt she could analyzed a bit more rigorously (e.g., beauty standards, like Tressie McMillan Cottom in Thick), I still enjoyed Union’s book.

I felt like I did learn some interesting tidbits related to romance, like how decades ago people tended to meet their romantic partners through close geographical proximity (e.g., living in the same apartment) which has changed now with online dating. The issue of having “too many” options living in a city made sense to me too (so maybe it’s not just patriarchy’s socialization of men and white supremacy that’s made me romantically single for all of my life, but also living in predominantly urban environments?? intriguing!) One glaring limitation of this book is the lack of discussion of amatonormativity. I find it almost laughable to write an entire book about romance without discussing heteronormativity and amatonormativity and how they shape the prevalence of romance and the wedding industrial complex in our society. Aziz Ansari kind of almost barely touches on this through mentioning that women’s increased economic power made it so they didn’t have to marry men to access financial security. I also found a couple of small statements in the book… annoying in a mosquito bite-y sort of way. For example, Ansari makes a joke about having an “Indian stalker” and I was kind of eye-rolling about the stalker being Indian, like why do you have to implicate your own race (and it made me think of this broader criticism of Ansari and his lifting up of white women over women of color). And in another section of the book he implies that a man he meets isn’t a “stud” because he’s on the shorter side. Yawn! Where are our critical thinking hats in regard to desirability and gender norms?? I wouldn’t recommend this book though at least the writing was accessible and easy to read.

I appreciate how Modern Loss normalizes the ongoing grief process and refutes outdated stereotypes that grief is just something you get over after a certain amount of time. These essays touch on some of the complicated parts of grief, such as when the person you grieving had committed adultery or when your grief is exposed to a wide mass of people on the internet. I liked how there was some diversity in regard to race and sexual orientation of the authors.Mainly giving this three stars because I think the book favored quantity over depth – there are a lot of essays in this collection though each of them are pretty short.

Dr. Marisa Franco foregroOverall, I found this a wholesome, research-backed, and warmly and accessibly-written book about making and keeping friends. Dr. Marisa Franco foregrounds her ideas in Platonic by articulating how contemporary society often overlooks friendship and prioritizes romantic relationships. Thus, many of us may do not know how to form friendships and how to keep them, especially after high school or college where friend networks are more built-in, in a sense. Franco then provides a lot of helpful strategies for making and keeping friends, such as taking the initiative to see your friends and to build friendships, expressing affection and concern in a genuine way, and developing healthy boundaries. She draws upon attachment theory in thoughtful and intelligent ways to support her claims and recommendations.I liked this book! It felt easy to read while still offering smart strategies that I imagine can help many people out, especially those who may struggle with social anxiety or those who haven’t thought about investing in their friendships. There were times where I wish the book had been a bit more… hard-hitting, for lack of a better word – I wanted more of a callout of amatonormativity and how the deprioritization of friendship aligns with how patriarchy and heteronormativity prioritize the nuclear family. But I recognize that Franco may have intentionally kept her tone on the lighter and more positive side to appeal to a wider audience. I also for some reason don’t love the insight of assuming that people like you. For me, it feels more authentic to try to cultivate self-regard so that even if people don’t like me, that’s fine, I can still find my people.

In this essay collection, Mimi Zhu reflects on their healing journey as a survivor of intimate partner violence. I liked their honesty about the pain of their abusive relationship and the wide range of emotions they experienced after it. They share many avenues and resources they used for healing, including individual therapy, group therapy, living in a rad group home, attuning themselves toward their body, and connecting with their ancestry and the wisdom of their elders. Their path toward healing wasn’t linear and it took work. They reference several feminist and social justice-oriented texts in this collection, including writings by bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Ling Ma, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Mia Mingus. I cherished and resonated with a few of their insights in particular, such as not conflating the presence of passion in a relationship with actual healthy communication and behavior, learning to prioritize friendship and alternative forms of community over heteronormative monogamous romance, and engaging in mindfulness and appreciation of simple beautiful things throughout one’s day.I think Zhu flips between “showing” us snippets of their past relationship and their healing with “telling” us things about the emotional and political insights they’ve acquired. I think the telling can feel less immersive than the showing, however, I did agree with pretty much everything they told.

While Amani Haydar was five months pregnant, her father killed her mother in a horrifying act of domestic violence. Haydar wriA heartbreaking memoir. While Amani Haydar was five months pregnant, her father killed her mother in a horrifying act of domestic violence. Haydar writes with great honesty and clarity about the court case that followed, as well as the support she received and the vitriol aimed at her from those who supported her father. I deeply appreciated how Haydar honors the nuances of the legal system, about how men of color are overrepresented in Australia’s jails and at the same time her father perpetuated murder. She addresses the topic of patriarchy with a similar eye toward complexity, calling out/in men to stop their misogyny against women while highlighting examples of men who are effective allies/advocates, such as her husband. I liked, too, how Haydar writes about her healing process from her trauma, such as going to counseling and becoming an advocate to prevent violence against women.Furthermore, while this was by no means a focus of the memoir, I am appreciative that Haydar wrote about how her grandmother was brutally killed by an Israeli airstrike against Lebanon in 2006. I also was grateful when she included an anecdote of when she was talking about violence against women at an event, she mentioned her grandmother’s death at the hands of Israel, and a woman told her that it was “triggering” that she mentioned Israel and asked Haydar to not talk about Israel?? What the heck?? Again, her grandmother’s death, while an important part of Haydar’s story, is not the center of this memoir, though I’m glad she spoke out against violence given Israel’s genocide of Palestine occurring right now.I think there were a few sections of this memoir that I felt could have been condensed or more concisely written, however, I enjoyed reading about Haydar’s process, both her vulnerability and her strength....more",Notes are private!,2,76,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 04, 2024","Jan 07, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57650420-the-mother-wound

The first two stories landed in the 4-5 star range for me, as they described a raw and honest search for self as well a richly unfolding family saga.

For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman’s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged in Yellowface’s story. I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn’t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn’t agree with all of Kuang’s satirical commentary in Yellowface (e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn’t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don’t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don’t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I've written about in at least one other , one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!...more",Notes are private!,0,286,1,"May 30, 2023","May 31, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59357120-yellowface

Aside from that though, I found The School for Good Mothers a chore to read. First, the plot seemed like such a mess to me. The novel’s synopsis notes that it focuses on upper-middle-class parenting, which is fine, but women of different class backgrounds were lumped in together in this dystopian school system as if their “crimes” or mistakes were the same?? As Samantha writes about cogently in her , child separation and revoking parental rights does occur especially for Black and brown mothers so it felt odd and underdeveloped for this to serve as the premise of this novel. The plot didn’t make sense; I get that dystopia requires some suspension of disbelief, though so many random things happened that I found myself flipping pages just to get through to the end.Jessamine Chan’s writing also felt dry and repetitive. The characters came across as one-dimensional. I think Chan made an honest attempt at portraying some of the racial injustices Black and Latinx mothers face as well as the specific microaggressions experienced by Asian American women, though the racial element of the book didn’t feel richly explored and stayed on the surface level. Our main character, Frida, is angry at white people at times (totally understandable) yet predominantly dates white men, and this tension isn’t interrogated in any deep way. Overall, ugh, a lot of promise, and I can see why this book is popular, but it didn’t impress me....more",Notes are private!,2,52,1,"Jun 05, 2023","Jun 08, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61273720-the-school-for-good-mothers

I liked Edafe Okporo’s vivid and clear-eyed writing style, how he captured his coming-of-age in Nigeria and the anti-gay bullying and outright physical abuse and beating in his country of origin. He does a nice job of showing that while he escaped a potentially lethal level of anti-gay persecution in Nigeria, he still encounters xenophobic and racist policies and treatment when he arrives in the United States. He writes with humility and conviction about his work now centers LGBTQ+ asylees, as well as shares how going to therapy helped him heal from the trauma he experienced at the intersection of homophobia, xenophobia, and racism.Overall, a moving memoir that shows we have a lot of work to do to combat xenophobia, colonialism, homophobia, and other forces of oppression. Toward the end of the memoir, I thought he could have done more to interrogate dating and committing to a long-term relationship with a white man from a wealthy background (e.g., interrogating proximity to white privilege and power).

What if we replaced the nuclear family with more communal and collectivistic forms of care? Lewis references queer activism, Indigenous feminism, and more to build her argument against many of the trappings of the family. This book spoke to a lot of feelings and critiques I have of the nuclear family, such as how a lot of abuse, mistreatment, and even societal loneliness and isolation could be prevented with more collective models of care. Lewis makes some intriguing points, such as how oftentimes people will justify careers that hurt other people by saying things like “well I have to provide for my family” – what if we deconstructed relational networks and reimagined them so that isn’t the case? I agree with other ers’ on Goodreads that sometimes Lewis’s argumentation didn’t quite make sense to me. For me, I felt like sometimes the language felt a bit too academic jargony/theoretical, and I wondered if more practical, direct examples of family abolition would have bolstered the overall strength of this book.

On the more foundational level, Teri Quatman does an excellent job providing a relatable yet rigorous introduction to listening skills and forming the therapeutic alliance (e.g., not rushing in to reassure a patient in distress and instead sitting with and exploring that negative emotion with them, avoiding small talk that may dilute the therapeutic process, etc.) She also provides a great overview, with many examples, of how early childhood attachments affect mental health and how a psychodynamic therapist can utilize the therapeutic connection to address and hopefully heal childhood wounds. I liked too that at the beginning of the book she honors the strength of other therapeutic modalities (e.g., behaviorism) as well as the contributions of neuroscience, while still making a solid case for psychodynamic therapy’s contributions.I think the book could have delved into deeper psychodynamic territory; I was surprised that splitting seemed like the only or one of the only defenses she ed.

At its core is a touching and heartbreaking story about a Black man who is losing his daughter to a degenerative disease. I thought Percival Everett included a few scenes that were emotionally resonant related to his protagonist, Zach, and Zach’s relationship with his daughter. The novel does an effective job of portraying Zach’s experience of grief in all its nonlinearity and messiness.Unfortunately, I found the writing style a bit detached and intellectualized. Perhaps this is a function of Zach’s character – he’s a geologist-slash-paleobiologist – but I think other writers have pulled this off better, such as Yaa Gyasi in her novel Transcendent Kingdom. There were parts of the story (e.g., Zach’s relationship with his colleague Hillary, Zach’s own upbringing) that I thought merited more exploration. Still, I have Everett’s novel Erasure on hold at the library and I look forward to reading it!...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Mar 26, 2024","Mar 28, 2024","Dec 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51541232-telephone

Jon Kabat-Zinn details some important Don’t get me wrong, I love mindfulness, though this specific book about mindfulness felt so long and drawn-out. Jon Kabat-Zinn details some important and helpful information about mindfulness, and he then applies it to many, many areas: mindfulness for doctors and patients, walking meditation, mindfulness applied to pain, mindfulness applied to stress, mindfulness applied to work, and so on. While I can see how this approach may resonate for folks who do want to read about mindfulness applied to literally everything, for me it started to feel repetitive. I don’t regret reading this because I like little boosters/reminders for me to engage in mindfulness in my packed day-to-day life. However, for those who want a more concise or targeted introduction to mindfulness, I’d recommend Kabat-Zinn’s Wherever You Go, There You Are or Tara Brach’s Radical Acceptance. I read both of those books around a decade ago or even more than that I think, so I don’t recall everything from them, though they resonated with me then and still impact my day-to-day life positively.Also, this should be the bare minimum, though I’m glad Kabat-Zinn acknowledges the roots of mindfulness in Eastern and Buddhist philosophies....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jan 28, 2023","Mar 18, 2023","Nov 03, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41016873-full-catastrophe-living

I loved the representation of a young Asian trans girl, Katrina Nguyen, who runs away from her biological family and finds acceptance, support, and love from her chosen family. Seeing an older person unconditionally accept Katrina felt powerful, and the overall happy ending of this novel is a welcome change from LGBTQ+ stories that often end in tragedy.I unfortunately just didn’t love the writing style of this book. The perspective/narrator often changed in the middle of scenes and conversations and left me wanting a more consistent throughline. The science fiction elements felt both confusing and too convenient for my tastes. I found it difficult to feel invested in these characters beyond my appreciation of how they represented trans and queer liberation and joy.

I’m a little sad because as a Vietnamese American I wanted to root for it though I just felt confused. Build Your House Around My Body follows Winnie Nguyen, a Vietnamese American in her 20’s teaching English in Saigon. The novel also describes the story of Binh, the teenage daughter of a wealthy Vietnamese family who flees her angry father. Reading these characters’ stories, I struggled to grasp what was happening in their individual plot lines given the constant back and forth. I also couldn’t see how their stories were related. The prose felt difficult for me to get into which obscured my understanding of the story.

I thSuch an interesting and well-written book about a somewhat narrow topic – Asian Americans and white Americans at suburban well-resourced schools. I thought Natasha Warikoo did a great job of describing her interviews with her research participants and applying critical analysis to develop themes such as: white parents criticizing Asian American parents for their parenting styles when it threatens white children’s success, Asian American parents distancing themselves from the “other” Asian American parents who white parents criticize, and white parents focusing on non-academic extracurriculars so that their children can get ahead. One aspect of this book that I enjoyed is that it is both academic and highly readable. It’s not full of jargon and I felt like I was reading this book for fun and not just poring through a boring academic text.I also highly appreciated that Warikoo both was adept at conveying her research findings and at the same time did not shy away from naming the centering of whiteness and some of the subtle racism white parents practiced toward Asian American parents, even though these white parents often identified as liberal. Warikoo’s research has many important implications for race relations and what happens when the dominant racial group is challenged. I can definitely see how some white people and white parents will get defensive and angry reading this book (as you may observe from a couple of the s on Goodreads already… anyway!) I feel like it’s tough to critique racism in and of itself but as a researcher I can imagine it’s even more intimidating to name some of the racism practiced by your research participants, who may feel upset toward you for portraying them in that way.I think this book is narrow in scope on purpose, though it’d be interesting to read more about the ways in which both Asian American and white parents practice racism and exclusion against Black, Latinx, and Native American children and their families. Then we can take action to prevent that. Warikoo names the exclusion of these racial groups a few time in the book, but I couldn’t help but want a little more especially given the news stories about how some Asian Americans are aligning with white supremacy by supporting affirmative action. Anyway, in sum I read this for a book club at my job and enjoyed it. I’m probably partial to this book because I attended a well-resourced, academically-rigorous high school that was predominantly Asian American and white (I actually started my Goodreads account 14 years ago when I was a freshman at that high school, whew!) Reading this book made me reflect on my own academic journey and the many privileges I had that propelled me to where I’m at now professionally. I liked that Warikoo did not stigmatize Asian Americans’ parenting styles because even though my parents were/are imperfect in many ways, I now can view how they pushed me with appreciation because they did instill in me a rigorous work ethic that’s benefitted me in many ways. So… if you may be interested in this book, I’d recommend it for sure. Perhaps great to read alongside The Asian American Achievement Paradox....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Mar 09, 2024","Mar 11, 2024","Oct 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59133684-race-at-the-top

Galit AtI found this book an insightful and sometimes deeply moving look at how generational trauma affects people’s mental health and relationships. Galit Atlas a psychoanalytic therapist, describes several of her therapy cases and how people’s family histories affected the course of their treatment with her. I appreciated her consistent empathy for her clients as well as her accessible writing style. I felt really emotional in a couple of instances while reading this book, such as when she described a woman having an extramarital affair and the deeper reasons underlying her cheating (e.g., avoiding agency, wanting someone to take care of her) and how this woman grew and healed, as well as the man who tried to distance himself from Atlas (e.g., saying things like “it’s okay if you don’t want to see me, you’re my therapist not my mother) because of how his own mother rejected him. Compelling content! A couple of things I didn’t love: first, I found the stories a little too neat at times? While Atlas definitely includes nuanced cases, I felt like they followed a format of, client experiences some angst, Atlas helps the client draw an insight to their family of origin, and then this insight pretty much does all the work of aiding the client’s recovery. I know insight is a cornerstone of psychoanalytic and dynamic approaches though this portrayal almost felt a bit too convenient for me at times. I also felt iffy about a couple of things Atlas wrote about in relation to sociocultural issues. While generally I thought she did a nice job of addressing issues like the restrictive norms of masculinity, there was one comment for example she made about a certain sexual act between a man and a woman meaning X thing, which I found a kind of odd, heteronormative, and somewhat gender-stereotypical/binary statement.

In How Not to Drown in aLoved the distinctive voice and structure of this book; it reminded me of the sharp characterizations in Weike Wang’s novels. In How Not to Drown in a Glass of Water, we follow Cara Romero, a Dominican immigrant living in New York City, who goes to career counseling after getting laid off from her factory job. Over 12 sessions with her career counselor, Cara reveals the story of her life, including her abusive ex-romantic partners and mother, her struggle to pay rent in a rapidly gentrifying city, and her estranged relationship with her son.I found that the unique setup of this book worked. It’s rare that a novel told in second person doesn’t feel gimmicky to me, yet with this novel, Cara’s voice came across as authentic, funny, and full of energy. I think Angie Cruz’s use of vivid details and her consistency with the way Cara described both external events and her own emotions helped the book come alive. Though at times humorous, How Not to Drown in a Glass of Water touches on several important and oftentimes harrowing topics: abuse, gentrification, and discrimination against immigrants. I found the theme of intergenerational trauma the most poignant part of the novel, especially witnessing the separation of a son and his mother from the perspective of the mother, who hurt him. I think the tightness of the prose loosened a little in the middle of the book which shifted my rating to four stars, however, I still enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to those interested in literary fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Dec 06, 2022","Dec 09, 2022","Sep 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808037-how-not-to-drown-in-a-glass-of-water

In Stay True, Hua Hsu writes about his close bond with his Japanese American college friend Ken, as well as Ken’s untimely, awful murder in a carjacking. Though most of the memoir revolves around Hsu’s memories of his friendship with Ken, it also describes what Hsu learns when he goes to therapy after Ken’s death and begins to let go of his feelings of guilt surrounding Ken’s passing.I loved how this book focused on a friendship between two Asian American men without solely being about being Asian American. Hsu shows us the small, everyday intimacies of friendship that he experienced with Ken – watching movies together, laughing about strangers on the internet side by side in their dorm, sharing about their dreams for the future with one another. I whispered “oh my goodness, I am so sad” to myself when I read about Hsu’s grieving process after Ken’s death, like how he still wrote to Ken about his day-to-day life and how when Hsu moved to Boston – where Ken always imagined himself going after college – he imagined the outline of Ken at a baseball game, selling concessions while going to law school. Ugh, my heart!I think people who grew up in the 90’s and/or are familiar with the Berkeley, California area may get an extra kick out of this memoir. I was born in 1995 on the east coast so I didn’t recognize a lot of what Hsu wrote about on a personal level, though I appreciated the general high quality of his writing. The memoir flowed well; I felt immersed in it. At times I felt that Hsu talked about some subjects that came across as a bit random to me, though I recognize that those subjects were often a part of his upbringing and/or his college experience.Overall, wow, what a memoir. I love witnessing Asian American men write about their relationships, their messy emotional moments, and going to therapy. What makes me most enthused about Stay True is that it’s such a beautiful tribute to Hua Hsu’s college friend Ken. One of my best friends, who I met in college, texted me while I was writing this  and I almost started crying.

I found the intergenerational aspect of how Reed communicates with his activist Asian American parents and learns their history interesting and unique. This book helps dismantle the stereotype of Asian Americans as apolitical, submissive model minorities within the United States.At the same time, I found the characters a bit one-dimensional. Though politically engaged and cool in that way, the characters seemed to me like conduits for Ryan Lee Wong to convey his messages about activism and social justice, while I wanted more depth of feeling and introspection. For example, with Reed, I wanted to understand more of what drove his desire for activism on an internal level, as opposed to only reading about his external focus on changing the world and his twitter speak dialogue.

Starting with some of my perceived negatives before going into the positives, I thought that a couple sections of Strangers to Ourselves just felt boring to read (e.g., “Ray,” “Bapu”.) In these sections, Rachel Aviv’s writing didn’t come alive to me and I felt like I was reading a series of facts as opposed to something more stylistically compelling. I also wonder if the book would have benefitted from a more explicit unifying theme.However, other sections of this book impressed me a lot. For example, the section about Naomi Gaines, a Black woman who struggles with schizophrenia, did a great job of capturing how anti-Black racism and incarceration interact with mental health symptoms. I also enjoyed how Aviv explored the nuances of psychotropic medication in “Laura” and touched on the impacts of colonialism in “Bapu.” While I had leaned toward giving the book three stars, the epilogue “Hava,” in which Aviv writes about a girl who she met during her inpatient treatment for anorexia and what happened to her afterward, touched my heart.

His deep dive into the stories of elderly people living in nursing homes/assisted living helped me gain greater knowledge about what end-of-life scenarios may look like. I walked away from this book understanding more about the importance of autonomy and meaning for elderly people. I also did get a bit teary-eyed reading about Gawande’s father’s passing.My two main critiques of this book center on its writing style and its lack of attention to sociocultural factors. First, the actual writing of Being Mortal felt so dry to me – the topics are of great importance, yet I felt like the tone vacillated between journalism and creative nonfiction and didn’t really land on either. Second, I found it odd that Gawande didn’t discuss or at least mention cultures in which talking about grief and death are more normalized (e.g., Native American culture). Furthermore, he didn’t discuss how lack of access to healthcare due to socioeconomic constraints or other barriers (e.g., racism in healthcare) affect issues of death and dying.

In O Beautiful, we follow forty-something-year-old Elinor Hanson, a biracial Asian American former model who travels to a town in North Dakota, close to where she grew up, for a journalism assignment. Elinor learns about the town and its people and their struggles all while reconciling her own past, including a mother who left her, her sister, and her father before Elinor had all grown up.I liked this book’s incisive portrayal of the racism and sexism Elinor experiences as an Asian American woman. O Beautiful also does a nice job of capturing issues of classism in this booming North Dakota oil town as well as the xenophobia and racism of its white inhabitants. Jung Yun highlights Elinor’s own shortcomings and growth in regard to issues of race and gender which made her realistic as a character. Yun’s writing is superb, too, a quality I remember from her debut Shelter - her prose feels effortless, easy and melodic to read.My main constructive critique of O Beautiful is that I don’t feel like all the elements of Elinor’s character and relationships came together? Namely, she has a complicated connection with her sister as well as a nuanced, troubled former relationship with one of her writing professors. While I get that not all relationships are resolved in life, I didn’t feel compelled by where Elinor’s relationships left off. I wanted more focus on them and a deeper dive into her own character and feelings. While writing this  I went back and forth between three and four stars. I’m landing on four because I think the ending of this book ends on a hopeful though not unrealistic note, showing Elinor’s growth through the messiness of her journey in O Beautiful....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Oct 22, 2022","Oct 26, 2022","Sep 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56269143-o-beautiful

The intrigue and the angst of it all. However, I found the quality of writing a huge detriment to enjoying this novel. The two characters’ voices sounded too similar, there was a lot of abstract language that I think tried to make “deep” points though fell flat, and the tone of the prose was cold and distant though not in a way that felt purposeful or executed well.

Yitian travels back to the rural village in China where he grew up to search for his father. There, he reaches out to his childhood friend Tian Hanwen, a woman who once shared his desire for an educated life. Through this journey Yitian grapples with his past, like the lack of acceptance he received from his father and why he and Hanwen fell out of touch.I liked this book and found its focus on the gaokao, China’s newly reinstated national college entrance exam in the 1970s, particularly compelling. Belinda Huijuan Tang does a nice job of portraying how class and gender shape who gets access to education and therefore more stable and secure lives. She also highlights how our parents’ and grandparents’ struggles affect our own, consciously and unconsciously.In the middle of reading this book I leaned toward giving it a three-star rating – at times the writing felt a little “tell” and not “show” and the emotionality of the book almost one-note in how depressing it was. The depressing tone is fair given that the events in the book are depressing, though I wanted a bit more variety. However, I enjoyed how Tang ended the book by subtlety yet explicitly showing Yitian and Hanwen’s growth, in their actions and in their realizations about themselves and their families.

I think I felt most disappointed by how a lot of these stories featured an interesting concept, though they didn’t have a fleshed-out character arc or plot arc. The majority of these stories felt more like statement pieces to me – a woman who lives in a house with all of her ex-boyfriends, a toxic friendship built around a drug that makes you invisible – without a more tangible protagonist or storyline to hold onto or invest in.The one story I enjoyed, “Peking Duck,” saved this collection from a two-star rating. This story follows a Chinese American woman who, as a girl, followed her mom to her job as a nanny for a wealthy white family and one day observes a stranger force his way into the home where her mother works. The Chinese American woman writes about this incident for a writing class and gets roasted by the only other Asian person in the room. I feel like “Peking Duck” raised thought-provoking questions about authorial authenticity and ethics, and the complex dynamic between the main character and her mother made my heart ache in a bittersweet way by the end of the story.

All This Could Be Different follows Sneha, a young queer Indian woman who graduates colOkay so I loved the portrayal of class dynamics in this novel. All This Could Be Different follows Sneha, a young queer Indian woman who graduates college during the Great Recession and moves to Milwaukee to take an entry-level corporate position. I thought Sarah Thankam Mathews did a great job portraying Sneha’s economic anxiety and how she connected her sense of self-worth to her income and career. Mathews also shows Sneha’s struggle with emotional intimacy and her journey to eventually open up and form more healthy relationships with her close friends, which I enjoyed reading. The compelling prose, strong themes related to class and culture, and emphasis on community make this novel stand out to me in a positive way.At the same time, I felt frustrated by the centering of whiteness in All This Could Be Different. At the beginning of the book Sneha’s Black friend Tig tries to kiss her, and Sneha *literally* has the thought that she only wants physical intimacy with thin white women. Which, you know, is definitely yikes, fatphobic, and reeks of internalized racism, though unfortunately I know quite a few Asian Americans who feel similarly. My issue is that Sneha’s internalized racism, proximity to whiteness, and fatphobia are never actually interrogated in the novel – instead she engages in an obsessive and sometimes toxic relationship with a white woman, Marina (who commits several racial/ethnic microaggressions against Sneha/Indian people), that is centered throughout the book. While I enjoyed Sneha’s friendship with Tig, I did feel a little uncomfortable by how it seemed that Tig kind of served to teach Sneha how to actually care about racial justice. Especially because Marina, a white woman, is centered throughout the book in no way that actually benefits Sneha’s growth or character development! So yeah, I’m pretty much over media that portrays people of color in dysfunctional relationships with white people in which they literally don’t grow beyond their own internalized racism. More stories like Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi that portrays romance between people of color or A World Between by Emily Hashimoto which highlights romance between queer people of color. Or, if you’re going to tackle the issue of internalized racism and dating among people of color, do it in a way that actively challenges white supremacy, like Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou. I’ll end my  by pointing to this  of All This Could Be Different by Goodreads user Sitaphul that describes similar issues with the novel, with more depth and quality than my ....more",Notes are private!,2,211,1,"Oct 07, 2022","Oct 08, 2022","Aug 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59576064-all-this-could-be-different

Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling in Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow that helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky. I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy. I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out to Bri one of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!)As a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Lowland and Unaccustomed Earth earlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too in A Little Life, though I don’t recommend her other books lol.I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literally (view spoiler)[says that he felt insecure that Sadie didn’t want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth… which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along… which undercuts the importance of friendship. Yikes (hide spoiler)] Like, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (like this tweet depicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s.Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a  from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure....more",Notes are private!,4,452,1,"Dec 02, 2022","Dec 05, 2022","Aug 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow

On top of that switch up, she’s adjusting to a new job, trying to date for the first time, and contending with her mother who doesn’t respect her boundaries. When a tragedy strikes, Maddie is forced to face some of the deeper and more difficult parts of both her family and her acclimation to adulthood.I enjoyed how Jessica George wrote about so many different challenges in Maddie’s life and still made Maame flow so well. George addresses nuanced family dynamics, experiencing microaggressions and outright racism at work, deeply satisfying and unsatisfying friendships, mental health, and sexual pleasure. At the same time, this book reads like an unrushed, unbothered slice-of-life telling of Maddie’s day-to-day. The novel feels real, funny, and grounded in an honest 25-year-old’s pursuit of a better way of living amidst multiple stressors.I will say I am *so* thankful for how and with who Maddie’s romantic life ended with by the conclusion of the novel. I also appreciate how George honors complexity in Maddie’s life. Like with Maddie’s family, George highlights the role of boundary-setting while still showing an understanding of Maddie’s mother, both her culture and what she’s experienced as an immigrant woman.

For example, in one section Sun writes about how he uses work to cope with his anxiety and negative emotions. However, he doesn’t elaborate beyond that – so are you motivated to change that? If you’re not motivated to change that that’s fine, though what’s that about? Where in your life or in society broadly did you internalize these messages about work and what do you want to put out into the world about work? This deeper reflection felt missing to me.I also found a lot of the essays very tell and not show. He writes broad sentiments about family, nostalgia, belonging, etc. yet does not use specific details from his life to make his writing more poignant or powerful. At points I felt like the underlying writing mechanism was like, “let me make this as vague and non-specific as possible so that as many people as possible can find it relatable” when in reality I think utilizing more descriptive content from his life, if possible, would’ve strengthened every essay.There are many Asian authors who write with self-awareness and deep emotional intelligence, and to highlight a few here I’d recommend What My Bones Know, a memoir by Stephanie Foo, Kelly Loy Gilbert’s young adult fiction Picture Us in the Light and When We Were Infinite, and Jhumpa Lahiri’s fiction The Lowland and Unaccustomed Earth....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Aug 20, 2022","Aug 22, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41952241-goodbye-again

One day a journalist reaches out to Sarah and asks her to share about her time working on the film. Through revealing her story, Sarah takes her long-awaited chance to hold to power the injustices she witnessed all those years ago – and to release some of the guilt she holds about her part in them.I really enjoyed how Complicit details how patriarchy and capitalism intersect to disenfranchise women in the film industry. Winnie Li does a great job of showing through specific scenes and details the ways in which rich men can throw around their money and treat women like objects with no agency. The novel fits in well with the #MeToo movement. Li also effectively captures Sarah’s guilt and the complexity of having both (view spoiler)[experienced a sexual assault (hide spoiler)] while staying quiet in situations that harmed other women. Ideally, people in power will be held accountable for mistreating those with less power than them *and* we will get to the point where people know not to abuse others, so these situations and narratives can be prevented in the first place.I agree with other ers that the beginning of the book feels a little slow. While I found the second half of the novel a fast read, I do wonder if Li could have made slight stylistic changes to get the reader invested sooner, such as substituting details about Sarah’s ascent in her film company with more details about her family or how her cultural background influenced her reactions to the horrific events she experienced and witnessed. Still, a solid novel that held my attention and delivers a solid message....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Oct 18, 2022","Oct 22, 2022","Aug 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59366258-complicit

Nightcrawling details the story of seventeen-year-old Kiara Johnson, a young Black teenager who turns to sex work to pay her family’s rent and care for the abandoned nine-year-old boy next door. I think Leila Mottley does an excellent job portraying the many pressures and forces of oppression in this Black girl’s life: the weight of caring for the Black men in her life, the abuse enacted upon her by the police, and how some women (e.g., women affiliated with the police, her own mother) judge her for the actions she took to survive. Despite the intergenerational and present-day trauma Kiara experiences, she still cultivates some moments of joy and connection, such as with her on and off-partner Alé and her connection with the boy next door, Trevor.Overall, I felt immersed in this story and so angry and saddened by the immense difficulties in Kiara’s life. Mottley’s writing is vivid and gripping and expresses Kiara’s pain and how she’s forced to put one foot in front of the other to just get to the next day. I appreciated how Mottley didn’t give us a happy ending, because it’s up to us with privilege to fight for a world where Black women aren’t forced into these horrendous circumstances. In her author’s note, Mottley says she felt inspired to write this after learning about the Oakland Police Department’s sexual exploitation of young women – I think she did a successful job of capturing this injustice and bringing it to readers’ attention with Nightcrawling....more",Notes are private!,0,116,1,Oct 2022,"Oct 03, 2022","Aug 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58537371-nightcrawling

My reaction to this book reminds me of why I tend to avoid reading poetry collections – I tend to rate then a bit lower because *I* struggle to resonate with them which makes me feel a tad guilty. I liked how Woodfolk portrays the immersive grip of an intense friendship turned romance and the complexity of caring for someone even when they are not right for you.

So excited for all of these K-Pop women to step on me! Onto the book though. I enjoyed I’ll Be the One a lot because it’s both so cute and confronts serious topics. I’ve felt cognitive dissonance as a K-Pop fan because I love the music though the fatphobia and colorism are so toxic like ugh??? Lyla Lee tackles the fatphobia head on through this story that details a fat teen, Skye Shin, competing in a K-Pop reality television show with the hope of winning and joining an established K-Pop entertainment company in Korea. Lee does an excellent job of portraying difficult mother-daughter dynamics, fatphobia, and bisexuality and stigmas against bisexuality. She highlights these topics in an empowering way without undercutting their complexities. I also appreciated Skye’s character – she’s confident and charismatic while still real and vulnerable. Lee’s writing flows well and the story moves fast in a pleasant way. I had mixed feelings about Skye’s romantic relationship with Henry Cho. On one hand, I love the representation of Asian American men (I guess in this case Henry is still a teenager, though you know what I mean) as desirable and Asian American folks dating one another, because white people are still so prevalent and that’s yikes. At the same time, I think the romance made the book super fluffy – as opposed to just fluffy – and I wonder if the book could have more deeply explored its central topics related to fatphobia, bisexuality, etc. with that page time instead. I suppose some books, especially young-adult books, are allowed to be this fluffy though. Also, I’m not sure how I feel about Henry being written as this near six foot tall, super fit (I think he has abs?) guy. I suppose in this case it’s fine though I know men in the K-Pop industry, as well as men outside the industry, suffer from body image even if they’re not held to the same standards as women.Overall I liked this book a lot and would recommend it to K-Pop fans looking for a light read!

Some of the primary s4.5 starsI enjoyed this evocative, intelligent, and self-aware memoir by Tessa Miller about her experience with Crohn’s disease. Some of the primary strengths of this memoir in my opinion:1) Miller writes about her experience with Crohn’s disease in vivid detail that captures the pain, shock, and at times terror of her journey. Passing blood and mucus as stools, the medical trauma of multiple agonizing hospitalizations, losing control over her ability to poop as well as her appetite and even sometimes her hope for a better future – her use of specific and thoughtful language to show these events all helped them come to life. Her background as a journalist and as a writer felt evident to me while reading What Doesn’t Kill You.2) Her self-awareness also made this book enjoyable to read. She writes both about her experience with Crohn’s disease and how she has processed and coped with those events, like the grief that ensued after her experience, how her disability has affected her relationships, and the insight she has gained about herself through her process with Crohn’s. I liked how she wove in different elements of her life, like her fraught relationship with her father, into her narrative and how she has reflected on those elements in a deep way. Emotional intelligence, we love to see it! 3) She connects the personal to the political. While I wish everyone would do this, I appreciated how she owns her privilege as a white thin cis woman, in addition to how she names the faults in the healthcare system of the United States and how it especially often fails those with multiple marginalized identities (e.g., Black women). Health is inextricably tied to systems of power and oppression and I’m glad that Miller made this clear in What Doesn’t Kill You.Overall, a gripping and informative read that I learned from as a temporarily able-bodied person. Would recommend to those interested in issues related to health and disability, memoirs, and/or narratives from people who’ve done a decent amount of thoughtful self-reflection. She integrates some more direct guidance throughout the memoir too about topics such as navigating the healthcare system as a disabled person and how loved ones of disabled people can show support, which may prove helpful for readers too....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Aug 17, 2022","Aug 20, 2022","Aug 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138101-what-doesn-t-kill-you

One ironic thing is that he makes a point about white people centering themselves as advocates for social justice instead of centering Black people which I was like… John you just did that with this book though?

I really liked Jennette McCurdy’s writing style – very show and not tell, focusing on specific scenes and moments from her childhood. She vividly captures her mother’s codependency on her, her encouragement of disordered eating behaviors, and her emotional instability. I think it’s courageous of McCurdy to tell the truth about her mother’s abuse given how as a society we often valorize mothers/the nuclear family.

I can see how Katie Kitamura writes about her protagonist’s difficulty with intimacy and asserting herself in professional and personal spaces. The unnamed protagonist’s job as an interpreter dovetailed interestingly with her desire to observe others and fade into the background.Unfortunately I found several other elements of the book lacking. First, I didn’t understand why the protagonist had such an intense desire for the white male love interest Adriaan. Like, I get that he’s privileged and wealthy and that might afford a sense of stability, but I wish Kitamura interrogated that desire or relationship as opposed to filling the novel with cliché phrases about longing. The opaquer writing style made it hard for me to feel invested in Intimacies. Finally, I wanted more growth from the protagonist on her journey; the book felt stagnant to me even though the main character perhaps made minor changes in her life.Other novels that come to mind written by women of color about or related to intimacy that I loved include Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi, A World Between by Emily Hashimoto, and You Exist Too Much by Zaina Arafat....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Dec 10, 2022","Dec 11, 2022","Jul 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61190504-intimacies

Refusing Compulsory Sexuality does a fantastic job of addressing the intersectionality of acephobia and anti-Black racism. Sherronda Brown explores topics such as anti-asexual messaging from within the queer community, how the media often portrays asexual people as villains or as deficient in some way, and how society is set up to privilege allosexual people (e.g., prioritizing the nuclear family and romantic coupling). She integrates this information with commentary about how acephobia especially harms Black asexual people, given the prevalence of anti-Black stereotypes of Black people as hypersexual. While I don’t think all of this book’s information will be new to people who’ve read Ace by Angela Chen, its emphasis on intersectionality is a plus. Sometimes it felt like Brown packed a lot of topics into each chapter, though I still found the book quite readable overall.

I think one could generally describe the plot as lesbian necromancers take on dark foes, featuring eerie politics and lots of sword fighting. Despite how exciting this premise may sound, I found the writing pretty flat and repetitive.

A few times in the memoir, I felt her writing came across as almost a little too conversational and unfocused which reduced the compelling-ness of her story. However, in the last 25% or so of the memoir when she writes about her depression, I felt immersed again in her narrative. I think this final 25% serves as the strongest part of Crying in the Bathroom, as it integrates Sánchez’s funny tone with a gripping story of trying to find the right treatment for depression as well as finally landing a romantic partner that feels like the right fit. When she wrote about her beautiful husband of color and made fun of Tony who believes in blue lives matter I was like lolol get it! Overall, I enjoyed this memoir, especially the sincerity in which she wrote about her mental health and how those struggles related to her identity as a Latina woman. I didn’t really detract a star for this, though I do think penis size-shaming and preferring tall men (both instances in the memoir that were very subtle) contribute to patriarchy and outdated gender role norms of men as like, towering paternalistic caregivers, which yikes.

Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows follows Nikki, a young Punjabi woman living in West London who takes a job teaching writing to a group of older Punjabi widows. To Nikki’s surprise, the class takes on a life of its own as the women begin to share stories that center erotic fantasies and desire. While this sequence of events may sound funny and naughty, Balli Kaur Jaswal incorporates rich themes of female solidarity and empowerment throughout this novel as well.I enjoyed this book so much, both its humor and its powerful messages about sexism and women standing up for themselves! Kaur Jaswal sets this novel up so well with a humorous, attention-grabbing premise: older Punjabi widows sharing salacious, sexual stories with one another. She maintains a lightness to her prose that made this book feel readable and suspenseful in a positive way.At the same time, Kaur Jaswal tackles heavy topics in Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows. One of the most powerful themes that stood out to me is internalized sexism and how women can turn against one another when they come to believe in patriarchal messages about right and wrong. I loved how Kaur Jaswal shows us the process of unlearning internalized sexism through Kulwinder’s character. There were a couple of scenes of feminist solidarity toward the end of the novel that brought tears to my eyes – the female characters’ growth and their bonds with one another made my heart swell. I also liked reading about Nikki’s romance with Jason – yay for a healthy romantic relationship between people of color – and Kulwinder’s journey of grief after the loss of her daughter, Maya.Overall, a well-written novel that touches on some heavy topics yet stays light enough for a fun time. I’m in the middle of a super intense job application process now so reading this book definitely helped improve my mood, thank you Balli Kaur Jaswal!...more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,"Nov 18, 2022","Nov 24, 2022","Jul 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32075853-erotic-stories-for-punjabi-widows

This short story collection pulled strong reactions out of me, mostly in the positive direction. I loved the sheer range Don Lee showed off in these stories, where he writes about Asian American actors, news journalists, academics, and much more entangled in sticky and complicated life scenarios. The collection features a lot of messy longing, thwarted life ambitions, and unresolved personal issues. Yet, at times, Lee imbues some of his stories with a real sense of heart and love for his Asian American protagonists, even if none of them get a carefree happy ending. I liked how the characters’ race were a part of the story, like experiences of racism, though the stories were not solely about these characters being Asian American. I almost gave this collection three stars instead of four because some of these stories are DEPRESSING. A sense of sadness and unhappiness kinda sits atop all of the stories, though there were two stories in particular (“Confidants” and “UFOs”) that were almost like, too bleak for me?? In the former, an Asian man dating an Asian woman is plagued by insecurity which causes him to “lose” his Asian female partner to a random white man and then the insecure Asian protagonist ends up dating this conniving white woman and I was like?? Yikes! And then there’s another story where an Asian woman pretty much only dates white men and considers Asian men “ugly fucking orientals” and she treats this super sweet Asian guy SO poorly and doesn’t really grow at all in the story and I was like?? Omg why??? I have mixed feelings about these stories because on one hand I do know Asian people of all genders and sexual orientations who have internalized racism/white supremacy and prefer to date white people, so I guess it’s important to represent that real issue in literature, and at the same time these stories just felt so bleak to me. However, my mixed feelings probably stem from my own background as a mental health worker who has a preference for human growth – though I acknowledge growth isn’t always possible or realistic – and as an Asian American who grew up around a lot of other Asian Americans and never really idealized white people. That all said, there are other stories where the characters overcome or grow out of internalized white supremacy or they don’t struggle with it much to begin with. Furthermore, Lee writes pretty well on a scene and sentence level. I always felt immersed in the story itself and never felt bored or that I was noticing myself reading because the story itself didn’t compel me. I hope these complex and somewhat cutting representations of Asian Americans continues across various forms of media – especially with Asian Americans interacting with other people of color and not just distasteful white people! Some stories that stood out to me in a positive way include ""The Partition,"" ""Commis,"" and the three interconnected final stories that centered Alain (""The Sanno,"" ""Reenactments,"" and ""Days In, Days Out"")....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jul 24, 2022","Jul 28, 2022","Jun 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59515190-the-partition

In Men Who Hate Women, Laura Bates discusses the roots of misogyny and how they manifest in online communities such as incels, pickup artists, trolls, and more. She does a great job of describing the online radicalization process of vulnerable young boys and men into these sexist and violent spaces. I’m gonna describe some of my key takeaways:1) As a society we (people of all genders, though especially men) need to take the threats of incels and similar populations seriously. They’re not just a “fringe group,” rather, their beliefs have permeated and affected women across multiple domains of contemporary life and have literally led to sexual assault, mass shootings, and other forms of terrifying violence. 2) I think Bates writes well about holding two truths at once, a) that a lot, or at least some of these men on these forums and such feel insecure and defeated in life through circumstances not of their own doing (e.g., the man she writes about who was abused as a child and has physical scarring due to his parents’ mistreatment) and b) misogyny and violence are not appropriate ways to cope with those feelings. It’s important that we as a society think of ways to foster healthy vulnerability and emotional processing in boys and men.3) The internet is a big yikes?? Bates explores how boys view and gain access to sexist, defamatory, anti-feminist content on platforms such as YouTube without much effort from the boys themselves. I think this issue requires a multifaceted approach though if I had a son I’d be talking about this issue with him ASAP – parents of boys watch out because it’s awful out there.4) Media outlets may consider putting an end to platforming false equivalency arguments, or the notion that just because someone provides a sexist/misogynist idea that that idea deserves any airtime – or at least airtime that doesn’t rebuke that idea thoroughly. Bates names an interesting tension between not wanting to give misogynists airtime and at the same time not wanting to censor them lest they claim the victim card. At this point I think it’s important to at least call out misogyny and sexism when it happens.Overall a great book. I think the writing style itself can feel a little repetitive though that doesn’t detract from the important takeaways and real-world implications of these topics. I appreciate Bates’s courage in writing this book especially given the rampant sexism she’s experienced due to her outspokenness....more",Notes are private!,1,116,1,"Aug 04, 2022","Aug 09, 2022","Jun 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54717153-men-who-hate-women

The authors detail too ERP games for OCD mastery and strategies for long-term mastery of OCD such as tips and tricks for relapse prevention. Big kudos to the authors for sharing vulnerably about their own experiences of OCD – we need more of this destigmatizing behavior in the psychology field! Two small constructive critiques of the book: first, I wish the authors had more explicitly acknowledged the role of eastern philosophy in the development of Buddhism instead of whitewashing it. Second, at one point the authors write that people with OCD “are considerate, incredibly compassionate, and overflowing with empathy.” While I understand the authors want to reduce the stigma around OCD, I always feel a bit iffy when people make general statements about any group of people, including groups of people with mental illness/mental health difficulties. I feel like people deserve compassionate treatment even if they aren’t necessarily compassionate or extremely empathetic, and I also think it may put negative pressure on people to live up to those ideals as well (e.g., someone with OCD may feel a lot of pressure to be extremely empathetic after having been described as such).Still, a worthwhile book for those with OCD, those who know care about someone with OCD, or someone generally interested in the topic....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Aug 02, 2022","Aug 04, 2022","Jun 21, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33776087-everyday-mindfulness-for-ocd

Post-Traumatic follows Vivian, a Black Latinx lawyer who advocates for mentally ill patients at a psychiatric hospital in New York City. Even though she seems ambitious and put-together on the outside, in private she struggles with intrusive memories and overwhelming emotions from her dark and difficult childhood. For years Vivian coped with these difficult thoughts and feelings through obsessive infatuations with men, relentless dieting, dark humor, and smoking weed with her best friend Jane. But when Vivian takes a scary, bold step in relation to her family, all the other parts of her life start to crumble, forcing her to decide just how much she wants to try and heal from her past.This freaking book. So sad, so dark, and yet so funny at the same time. Vivian, our protagonist, makes the wittiest observations. The book’s official blurb accurately describes Chantal Johnson’s prose as “razor-sharp” which makes Vivian’s humor land like that of a lovingly neurotic yet self-aware friend. Vivian is so problematic throughout most of the novel too; she constantly compares herself to other women and critiques other women’s bodies (even while fiercely identifying with feminist politics on an intellectual level) and does everything she can to appeal to the (often white) male gaze. I imagine readers will feel frustrated with her, like with this passage: “Vivian felt rapturous in Matthew’s bed, high on a drug that couldn’t be bought, only earned: oxytocin! His attention gave her permission to exist. She was desperate not to lose it.” And yet, she’s such a compelling character and Johnson’s writing is so precise I couldn’t stop reading. As a reference point, Vivian’s wit is similar to that of the television show character Fleabag.I marked over ten passages where I either laughed out loud or smiled and giggled to myself. Here’s one from page 14, when Vivian reflects on not receiving male attention:“Ambiguity, though central to aesthetic greatness, was horrifying in real life. When a man inflicted it upon you in a romantic context, it highlighted his cowardice and your abjection. They did it casually, like flinging a toddler into a body of water and walking away, insisting calmly that it will swim. Huey Lewis was right, man – if loss of interest is inevitable, just get it over with and leave me, already.”(The “flinging a toddler into a body of water” literally made me lol. So good, and there are so many other examples!)At the same time, Chantal Johnson does an excellent job of showing how Vivian’s problematic, women-hating and self-hating tendencies stem from her trauma. Through vivid flashbacks and non-sentimentally heart wrenching conversations with the people in her life, we see how Vivian has suffered through her constantly critical mother and her constantly critical mother’s abusive boyfriends, her sibling who died and her currently-living sibling who faces severe mental illness exacerbated by anti-Black racism, and her attempts to set boundaries and how her family tries to trespass them anyway. All of these personal stressors intersect with Vivian’s identity as a Black Latinx woman residing in the United States. Again, Johnson really shows Vivian’s hypervigilance and the dysfunctional ways she tries to protect herself. I felt right there with her, entertained by her wit while also hoping and hoping for her healing. And the best part: there is hope at the end of this story, and Vivian does grow as a person. She hits her rock bottom and decides to pursue therapy and make amends with her best friend. Also, can I just say as a former recipient and current provider of therapy, the therapy scenes in this book are so freaking well-written! You may think that an author writing about a character talking to another person about her feelings would be boring, but Johnson’s prose is so impressively taut that she makes those scenes feel so alive and gripping. I’m so grateful that Johnson didn’t just portray Vivian’s suffering and that this book can join the slowly growing set of books that describe therapy both accurately and enthrallingly, like the memoirs What My Bones Know and I’m Glad My Mom Died. Anyway, wow, 2023 really made me wait for over a month for a five-star read and yet it feels so worth it. As a survivor of trauma and PTSD I resonated with Vivian a lot, not all the specifics of course but the planning, perfectionism, and emotion dysregulation – I’ve been there too! Some of those therapy scenes felt lifted right from when I sat on my first long-term therapist’s couch circa 2015-2017, lol. Johnson disclosed about coming from a violent home in an interview and I’m so grateful to her for writing this book. I wouldn’t be surprised if other PTSD survivors feel the same. Vivian has already secured her place as one of my favorite protagonists ever: her sharp wit, her big heart, and her growth. I get teary-eyed and feel warm and hopeful just thinking about her....more",Notes are private!,1,155,1,"Feb 05, 2023","Feb 07, 2023","Jun 12, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58684299-post-traumatic

I liked this novel in that the writing felt smooth and easy to read. Lee Cole includes some relevant and interesting themes related to class, social disenfranchisement, and how one accident can negatively alter the course of someone’s life. At the same time, I felt like Groundskeeping didn’t really say much. “Meandering” captures this novel’s vibe, to me. For example, I feel like Owen, our main character, seems vaguely aware of his white male privilege and his general self-centeredness though he pretty much remains at the same level of critical consciousness and self-centeredness by the end of the novel? Which maybe is how some people are though, I’m not sure what that accomplishes in fiction? I also found his love interest, Alma, daughter of immigrants from Bosnia, rather underdeveloped. It seemed like she functioned as Owen’s love interest solely rather than as someone who has her own desires and ideals, even though Cole did reference her writing career. I found their relationship a little stiff, their communication continually ineffective, and their projection onto one another tiresome as neither of them really addressed their core issues. I also wondered why Alma wanted to date Owen in the first place.Overall an okay read though not one I’d jump to recommend unless you want to specifically read about a white guy who lives in Kentucky and wants to not live in Kentucky anymore, kind of....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jun 05, 2022","Jun 11, 2022","Jun 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58395053-groundskeeping

IAn interesting set of three stories, each focused on tenants living on different floors of the same upper middle class apartment building in Israel. I liked the subtle complexities of the characters’ lives in this collection – an overly possessive father unaware of his own toxically masculine shortcomings, a woman yearning for some connection or excitement in the space left by her absent husband, and a widow trying to reconnect with her estranged son. The characters in Three Floors Up all act in messy and at times self-destructive ways, and Eshkol Nevo humanizes these folks so that their behaviors make sense and warrant some compassion as opposed to coming out of nowhere.While I found this framing and setup with the apartment complex innovative, I wanted a bit more from the writing and plot in this book. It feels difficult to quantify exactly what felt missing, though I know in the second section I found the narrator’s unreliability unhelpful in cementing the emotional gravity of the story, and in the third story I wanted some sharper prose to drive the feelings of the protagonist’s loss – both of her husband and son – even deeper. I think the first story felt the strongest to me, as we’re immersed in this problematic man’s interpretations of events so that we understand him even when we know he’s at fault.Thanks to my friend Ariana for the thoughtful  that tipped me off to this book!...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jun 30, 2022","Jul 02, 2022","Jun 01, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35185844-three-floors-up

The novel follows Tanya and Nessa Bloom, two adult sisters who return to their childhood Okay this book destroyed me and I can’t recommend it enough. The novel follows Tanya and Nessa Bloom, two adult sisters who return to their childhood home for a weekend and realize that their mother, Lorraine, is in a violent relationship. Tanya urges Lorraine to get a restraining order while Nessa struggles to reconcile her fondness for their stepfather with his cruelty toward their mother. Seeing Lorraine’s suffering triggers painful memories for both Nessa and Tanya, related to the abuse they faced in their adolescence. As Lorraine’s situation escalates, Tanya and Nessa are forced to grapple with the legacy of trauma and hurt that follows the women in their family. First, I found Hanna Halperin’s portrayal of domestic abuse so real and so harrowing. I can see that she worked as a domestic violence counselor because she wrote about the cycle of abuse in so vividly and honestly – the violence, the begging for forgiveness and gifts and false promises of change, the lack of accountability, the violence again, and so on. Halperin writes about the issue without sugarcoating it or glamorizing unhealthy relationships. Her descriptions of how Jesse, the sisters’ stepfather, abuses Lorraine are raw, horrifying, and I think ultimately necessary to shed light on this issue of domestic violence.I also loved Nessa and Tanya as characters. They’re both so well-written, with distinct personalities that come alive on the page. Nessa is more insecure, shy, and patient with their mother, whereas Tanya is more confident and quicker to anger. My heart broke for both of them as they navigated seeing Jesse abuse their mother. I thought Halperin wrote about the complexity of their bond so well and captured the messy care and hurt that can occur between sisters. She highlights how both of their lives are shaped by various struggles such as their parents’ divorce, sexual violence, and patriarchy broadly. There’s not a convenient or easy ending for either of these characters, though Halperin leaves us with just the tiniest sliver of hope that made my chest literally loosen in relief as I read the final pages of this powerful novel.Overall, I am so impressed with this debut. I read Halperin’s second book, I Could Live Here Forever, and I gave it four stars. With this book though, I couldn’t rate it any less than five. It’s dark, with brutal depictions of physical abuse and sexual assault. At the same time, by the end of the book I felt so much care for the characters, and I wanted to be updated about their whereabouts and their (hopefully healing) journeys. As someone who’s experienced and witnessed abuse both in my personal and professional live, and as someone who’s worked with survivors of trauma and abuse, this book moved me deeply.

The portrayal of treatment, medication, and doctors’ advice is wholly fictional.” I know other people liked this book, but this note really came across to me as a way to dodge accountability.

The book’s structure is pretty much like, 75% Nietfeld’s traumatic childhood, 20% her time at Harvard, and 5% an epilogue where she goes to therapy and physical therapy after having earned over six figures at Google. She does experience challenges at Harvard, though that segment of the memoir wraps up with her high salaried-job offer and her dating a privileged white man whose mother and grandmother went to Harvard too? Again, I enjoyed reading Nietfeld’s vulnerable recounting of her childhood, though the supposed interrogation of the American Dream, promised by blurbs about this book, did not really manifest for me. For example, while I’m happy that Nietfeld finally got the resources to afford therapy, I wanted more of an interrogation of why Harvard had the power to so drastically alter her life’s trajectory, the ethics of working at tech companies that regularly offer six figure salaries, the intersection of whiteness and Nietfeld’s upward mobility, etc.I’ve read articles about how a lot of writers come from financially privileged backgrounds, so I’m glad Nietfeld shared her life how she did in Acceptance. I also wish that the healing and self-reflection in the epilogue could have had more room in this memoir....more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Oct 26, 2022","Oct 29, 2022","May 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59576065-acceptance

It has the same therapy appeal of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone though with more attention paid to how culture and race affect mental health. In What My Bones Know, accomplished journalist Stephanie Foo writes about receiving a diagnosis of complex posttraumatic stress disorder and the steps she took to heal herself. One of the elements of this book I enjoyed right from the start includes how Foo writes about her trauma with such realness and vulnerability. The physical and emotional abuse her parents put her through felt painful to read though also cathartic as a fellow survivor of child abuse. In addition to destigmatizing child abuse and PTSD, Foo shed lights on her estrangement from her father that occurred later in her life. I imagine this book will feel comforting for folks who have also experienced difficult family dynamics, as Foo does not hold back about her pain even as she persists in her path forward to healing.I also appreciated the nuance in which Foo wrote about Asian American mental health and intergenerational trauma. She avoids a simplistic and flattening explanation of “tiger parents” and opts to explore the impacts of intergenerational trauma instead. I found it both compassionate and assertive of her to recognize the immense struggles her parents and ancestors faced while at the same time recognizing the not-okayness of how her parents treated her. What I felt most moved by in this memoir: Foo’s determination to heal. As someone who’s greatly benefited from years of receiving therapy myself and who works as a mental health clinician, I always admire when people are committed to addressing their issues even when it feels painful as heck. In addition to writing about the rewarding parts of help-seeking, Foo also shares the many ugly parts, like the difficulty of finding a therapist who actually felt helpful, the costs associated with therapy and how therapists are often underpaid, and her doubts about herself as someone capable of living a healthy and relationally-satisfying life. Despite these adversities, she somehow kept going, kept trying new and incrementally-helpful approaches like EMDR and gratitude journaling. When she writes about finding the therapist – Dr. Jacob Ham – who really helped her with her complex PTSD toward the end of the book and what her work with him consisted of, I found myself getting teary-eyed because it reminded me of my first long-term therapist who helped me heal from my own PTSD, as well as my own work as a clinician. Without a doubt one of the most genuine and most skillful portrayals of therapy I’ve seen across all forms of media.Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in mental health, race and/or Asian American identity, and well-written stories imbued with self-awareness. Big kudos to Stephanie Foo for writing this book, an amazing accomplishment....more",Notes are private!,5,559,1,"May 31, 2022","Jun 04, 2022","May 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58214328-what-my-bones-know

Craig Malkin does a great job of describing narcissism using everyday language while still capturing the complexity of the condition. One of my main takeaways from this book is that having a moderate level of narcissism can be quite healthy – it’s important that we take pride in who we are and what makes us special as long as that is balanced with empathy and concern for others. He also describes a variety of topics centered on narcissism, such as how to detect a person with narcissistic tendencies, specific strategies on how to set boundaries with narcissists, and ways to parent children so that they have a healthy sense of self and care for others instead of only thinking about themselves. Malkin touches a couple of times on how gender and gender roles may relate to narcissism though I would love to read more about how narcissism relates to gender, race, and other forms of social identities. I think the intersection of these topics feels interesting even if they fall outside the scope of this specific book. For example, I wonder if for people who are systemically and systematically marginalized and denied opportunities, if that may instill even more of a narcissistic tendency to want attention, fame, etc. as a way to compensate. Just drawing a bit from what I’ve observed in my own life (though of course not generalizing about any group of people here).

I appreciate Jennifer Risher’s willingness to write in-depth about being rich I found this memoir an interesting foray into the lives of the wealthy. I appreciate Jennifer Risher’s willingness to write in-depth about being rich and the complicated emotions that that experience can elicit. In addition to delving into a topic that is still not talked about too openly, the memoir is overall well-written, readable, and generally self-aware.At the same time, I thought Risher could have explored a lot deeper, both personally and politically. On a personal level, I wanted more interrogation of what money means. For example, at one point she writes with great honesty about her conflicting emotions when she realized she wanted a bigger diamond wedding ring after having grown up middle-class. I wished she had explored more about the emotional current underlying the desire for a ring, about how people are conditioned to project security onto material objects (I think of Caroline Knapp’s Appetites when she writes that consumerism fills emotional voids.) I also found it odd that Risher did not examine her white privilege and her husband’s privilege as a light-skinned biracial man.I also wanted more from a political level. Risher mentions that she supports wealth redistribution a couple of times in this memoir, I think once at the beginning and once toward the end – yet she doesn’t write about what that looks like in a more extensive way. I felt curious too about how she writes that she and her husband made their fortune through her husband working at Amazon, though she doesn’t unpack the ethical implications of that given reports of Amazon’s mistreatment of employees. Finally, I wished she had written more about the overarching political issue of: how can we live in a world where some have literally so much and others have close to nothing? My final critique: intermittently throughout the book and especially toward the end, Risher engages in a thought process that comes across as “rich people are people too and we have problems too.” While I understand that rich people can and do have problems and that rich people aren’t a monolith, the persistent emphasis of this point did strike me as similar to “not all men are bad people” or “not all white people are bad people.” This idea strikes me as a deflection from the real issue at hand, which is a matter of wealth inequity. Sure, rich people can face challenges in their lives, though I’m more interested in how we can reduce the needless excessive suffering of those who don’t have financial resources to begin with.Anyway, I did find this an enjoyable read despite these critiques and clearly the book elicited reactions from me....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 20, 2022","Sep 22, 2022","May 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52452466-we-need-to-talk

I feel like she cut through the stigma surrounding assisted suicide with her clear and heartfelt writing about her emotions throughout the decision process and her love for Brian. As other ers have said, Bloom wrote with much-needed candor about the toll of caretaking for someone with Alzheimer’s, an experience only heightened in this case by her deep care for her husband and his autonomy and wellbeing.I had a few qualms with this memoir. First, in different places throughout the book Bloom inserted side comments (e.g., toward the beginning she ends a paragraph with her daughter saying that she and Brian have traits of sociopaths, almost like a joke) that distracted from the core emotions communicated in the memoir. Instead of these side comments I felt curious to know more about her grieving process after Brian’s passing and more about the formation of their bond. Also, toward the end of the memoir, Bloom writes about seeing a Black man at an airport, imagining spending a pleasant evening with him, and then calling 911 on the Black man. Like what?? I get that she was grieving and at the same time that’s not an excuse to write something unnecessary and racist about imagining calling the police on a Black person. Ugh.Overall an okay read and much warmth to Bloom in her grieving process. It’s nice to know that Brian had someone by his side who cared for him so much and empowered him in his decision-making after receiving the Alzheimer’s diagnosis....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Apr 10, 2022","Apr 14, 2022","Apr 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065372-in-love

However, the execution of these concepts felt lacking. First, Diana Reid’s characters reminded me of Sally Rooney’s in terms of having a put-on disaffected tone. I felt like Reid really drove home how her characters try hard not to show that they care about things. Reid’s prose reflected this detachment in a way that maintained distance form me and the characters. Thus, I struggled to connect with the characters even when they went through difficult times. I also felt a little offput by the kinda random mentions of privilege – like these white characters, at least some of whom are thin, will name being white and being thin and then?? Nothing really comes of it?? I’d rather these elements of the characters be shown than told, which, is a component I did like about Sally Rooney’s Conversations with Friends in terms of class.

Later on the novel focuses on Renshu, who renames himself Henry, as he immigrates to the United States and forges a life for himself. I sensed and felt such great care that Melissa Fu put into Peach Blossom Spring. First, care in terms of her research – all the details of the Second Sino-Japanese War as well as the conflicts between China and Taiwan came across as believable and thoughtful without distracting from the characters and their emotions. I also appreciated the depth in which Fu wrote about her characters’ experiences, such as Meilin’s journey and the gendered/sexist barriers she faced as well as Renshu/Henry’s nuanced process of acculturation into the United States. Fu writes with subtlety yet great poignancy about how our pasts affect our present relationships and mindsets, both through Meilin’s relationship with her brother-in-law Longwei and with how Henry tries to minimize his Chinese heritage while in the United States.As a second generation Vietnamese American I loved the theme of using stories and tales to understand ourselves and our histories.

It’s interesting that Asghar is a poet because the writing itself felt almost too lyrical for me, like the emotions and events weren’t grounded enough in reality (on a prose level, not doubting that these types of things really happen to real.)

Seriously though, so many of the insights in Why Do I Do That? reminded me of my pre-therapy self as well as issues I still work through to this day. Toward the beginning of this book, Joseph Burgo outlines common challenges of the human experience:1. needing or desiring contact with other people and depending on them for support and connection, as well as withstanding frustration, disappointment, and helplessness in those relationships2. coping with difficult and painful emotions such as fear, anger, and anxiety3. developing a sense of self-worth and self-regard about ourselves in relation to othersHe writes about how when we struggle with these challenges – especially for those of us who grew up in abusive or neglectful childhood environments – we develop defense mechanisms to ward off our subsequent pain and shame. These defenses include though are not limited to projection, denial, repression, idealization, and intellectualization. Burgo writes about these defenses in an understandable, non-jargony way. He blends deep insight about these defense mechanisms with understated compassion for why we use them. He includes specific strategies for disarming these defenses so that we can attain healthier relationships with ourselves and others.I enjoyed this book and could tell that Burgo has done the necessary work on himself and his own defenses. I feel that the insights from this book could easily be integrated with principles from cognitive behavioral therapies. I primarily give it four stars instead of five because there were a few statements Burgo made that reflected to me a lack of sociocultural sensitivity. One example includes the assumption that all people without sex drives are actively repressing or intellectualizing something - Ace by Angela Chen may correct these assumptions about the ace community. Another example includes when Burgo writes about a gay man who he describes as slightly overweight and also calls him something like “physically unremarkable” which made me go like, uh this unchecked fatphobia though?? For these reasons I went back and forth between three and four stars for this book though landed on four just because of the quality writing about psychodynamic defenses. I think Polysecure by Jessica Fern does a better job of addressing social justice issues in relation to attachment styles so I’d recommend that book as well....more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 22, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16096251-why-do-i-do-that

Winnicott made about how as children, we are dependent on our caregivers and how they treat us shapes how we turn out. I also liked his writing about the “good enough parent” forming a base for healthy attachment and how what happens in society shapes us as individuals.However, there were quite a few comments he made where I was like, what is happening?? Yes, these essays came out a long time ago and at the same time even the logic of these statements made little sense controlling for that time gap. To provide a few examples, first, he writes about “healthy heterosexual trends” which I was like uh there are a lot of unhealthy heterosexual relationships so idk why heterosexuality is positioned as the norm here. He also writes about how war is beneficial so that men can develop a sense of confidence and self-worth and I was like um have you heard of PTSD? Yikes! Finally I think at times his writing was a bit over-intellectualized and he could have made some of his points in a more direct way. If you’re looking for psychology/mental health books, I’d recommend Why Do I Do That? by Joseph Burgo for psychodynamic content, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Made Simple by Seth Gillihan for cognitive behavioral content, and the memoirs Tastes Like War by Grace Cho and The Body Papers by Grace Talusan for content about how social forces affect mental health....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"May 22, 2022","May 29, 2022","Mar 11, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/791136.Home_Is_Where_We_Start_from

In particular, I appreciated how Mia McKenzie characterized Skye as someone with a lot of heart and humor as well as issues related to attachment and intimacy given the traumatic elements of her childhood. The novel contains many touching moments and relationships between Skye and the woman in her life, both younger and older. The characters grow in ways that feel like progress without minimizing the messiness of healing from difficult family dynamics.I give this book three stars just because the writing style itself didn’t sit well with me. I found it forced and difficult to get into, thus obscuring the emotional depth of the novel.

I liked how Elaine Hsieh Chou directly confronts topics of internalized racism and the racist underpinnings of Asian woman/white man relationships. I notice people, including fellow Asian Americans, often get defensive and reactive surrounding these issues and it felt refreshing to see a writer address these topics in a holistic and history-informed way. Furthermore, I appreciated seeing our protagonist Ingrid Yang’s growth from someone with a ton of internalized racism into someone who feels more comfortable and interested in fellow Asian Americans. By the end of the book she’s more on her way to contributing to social justice instead of hampering it, thankfully.I had mixed feelings about the satirical narration of the book. First, I felt that Stephen Greene (Ingrid’s Japan-loving, fetishizing white boyfriend) wasn’t too helpful of a character. While I totally know white people who do fetishize Asian people and I recognize that that’s important to address, I’m concerned that readers might miss the nuance that internalized racism can underlie your attraction to white people *even if the white people aren’t explicitly problematic*. Second, this book really does center whiteness. I see how this book is important for Asian Americans with internalized racism and who want to disentangle themselves from whiteness. However, I hope more books can come out that center Asian Americans without white people being involved at all, similar to the television show Insecure that focuses on the complex, humorous lives on Black millennial adults. Then we can explore deeper topics within the Asian diaspora outside of whiteness. Kelly Loy Gilbert’s young-adult novels When We Were Infinite and Picture Us in the Light stand out to me as examples of Asian American books that center on Asian Americans without undue attention to white people.An intriguing book that I could see eliciting engaging discussion. Not gonna lie, I really vibed with Vivian Vo and Alex, Eunice’s sister. I did laugh a few times, like when Vivian shares that she’s writing an article “Still Thirsty: Why Boba Liberalism Will Not Save Us” (LOL).

How High We Go in the Dark contains several interconnected stories in a world This book started off interesting though I got bored with it over time. How High We Go in the Dark contains several interconnected stories in a world ravaged by a climate change-induced pandemic. We follow protagonists including a man who works at a euthanasia park for terminally ill children, a scientist who finds a second chance at fatherhood when a pig in his lab develops human speech, a father searching for his daughter who prioritized her environmental justice work over her family, and more. Common themes include a search for connection and the decisions people make at the end of the world.The first few stories in this collection touched my heart. Sequoia Nagamatsu also conveys interesting concepts throughout How High We Go in the Dark. However, over time I felt that the emotional atmosphere of the stories got repetitive – they’re sad and gloomy though they don’t approach sadness and gloominess in particularly striking ways, at least as a whole. I agree with this Goodreads er that several of the characters felt more like concepts than fully fleshed-out protagonists.

I liked howThis novel follows seventeen-year-old Lily Hu, a young Chinese American teenager coming to terms with her queerness in 1954 San Francisco. I liked how Malinda Lo wrote about the racism Lily experienced in her newfound, predominantly white queer community, as well as the homophobia she faced from her Chinese family and friends. Lily’s coming to terms with her queerness – the fear, the longing, the search for understanding and connection – all felt real and honest. Lo incorporates some interesting scenes pertaining to xenophobia and anti-communism that help ground the novel in its time period and add nuance to Lily’s experience as well as those of her family.My main disappointment from this novel comes from how I felt the Chinese American characters came across as underdeveloped. For example, Lo includes a riveting flashback scene from the perspective of Lily’s mom, Grace, though she never revisits that and by the end of the book Grace and Lily’s relationship feels underdeveloped and unfinished. Similarly, Lo drops hints that Lily’s best friend, Shirley, has some nuanced family conflict and a potentially intriguing romantic relationship, though those elements of Shirley’s character never come to fruition. It felt like Lo focused on Lily’s relationship with her white love interest Kath, which is whatever, though I wish that focus did not come at the expense of other elements of Lily’s life. Also, I feel like white queer love interests are overrepresented in queer literature, so I hope that future books can include romances and friendships between queer people of color....more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,"Jun 25, 2022","Jun 26, 2022","Jan 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59514393-last-night-at-the-telegraph-club

We lear4.5 starsI felt immersed in this story about a serial killer, Ansel, and the women in his life – a mother, a sister, and a homicide detective. We learn about Lavender, Ansel’s mother who gave birth to him at the age of 17 at the brink of desperation, Hazel, twin sister to Ansel’s wife who bears witness to how her sister’s romantic relationship escalates in dangerous ways, and Saffy, the detective determined to bring Ansel to justice with a troubled past of her own. I loved Danya Kukafka’s take on gender and trauma in Notes on an Execution. She weaves in several great themes about toxic masculinity, complicated relationships between women, and contemporary society’s morbid and problematic obsession with serial killers through showing instead of telling, so the characters come first and the messages never feel heavy-handed. Her prose felt fluid and rich with detail, while still concise and clipped enough to keep the suspense churning throughout the novel. I liked how she cultivated empathy for all of her characters, even the atrocious male serial killer, while firmly and justly positioning patriarchy and the restriction of women’s autonomy as core issues that negatively impact both the women and the men in this book. A couple of elements that further stood out to me: Kukafka’s effective and emotionally affecting portrayal of Ansel’s childhood which contributed to his horrendous actions, as well as the complex sister dynamic between Hazel and her sister Jenny (one of the last passages in which Hazel reflects on Jenny made me tear up.) While I found the book a little overwritten on a handful of occasions – like moments when the vibe of darkness throughout the book felt a bit obvious or much as well as an early scene in which Hazel eats one of Jenny’s hairs which felt a bit drastic in regard to characterization – I still enjoyed the speed of the plot and felt connected to the characters. There’s a lot to discuss in Notes on an Execution and I’m grateful to Kukafka for encouraging us to think and feel critically about how we often normalize women’s suffering at the hands of men, when we, especially men, should take action to prevent violence against women from happening at all....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"May 03, 2022","May 04, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57773248-notes-on-an-execution

They make a lot of sharp, astute points about the politics of body image: how all desire is related to systems of oppression, the power of embracing ugliness, and the complexity of body-related trauma in their own intimate life. Their analysis embodies intersectionality fully in relation to Blackness and fatness, such as how they write about the murder of several Black men by the police and the importance of recognizing these victims’ fatness as part of the violence they experienced. Harrison’s writing is also poignant and to the point which made this short book fly by even faster, in a positive way. They write with a confidence that is admirable and the surety of their voice makes their arguments about deconstructing anti-fatness and anti-Blackness even more convincing. I agree with other ers that perhaps they could have elaborated a bit more in several sections by providing additional historical context, research, personal reflection, etc. though this book still serves as an excellent primer about politicized body image.A quick and helpful read especially for myself as someone who struggled with disordered eating several years ago and is now committed to dismantling white supremacy, anti-Blackness, fatphobia, and other forms of oppression.

I most loved Vivek Shraya’s confident writing voice, especially as a trans woman of color. She integrates analysis of popstars like Madonna, commentary on Indian culture, and reflections on her personal life in powerful ways. I liked her honesty about her struggles growing up as well as her consistent themes of self-compassion and self-acceptance throughout this book.Toward the middle and the end of People Change though, I felt that her writing got more abstract and based on broader platitudes without a grounding in deeper analysis of pop culture or herself. I also thought at times desired more from the logic of the book. For example, Shraya writes about how we judge people, especially femmes, who change themselves using things like Instagram filters, and then she critiques that judgement because of how change can be powerful in and of itself. While Shraya does critique the pressure on femmes to look thinner and whiter, I thought at times her core message of “embrace change” ignored the ways that marginalized people are taught to try to change themselves to fit dominant beauty standards and cultural standards of patriarchy and white supremacy – in those instances I would argue that change is indeed harmful. I found it odd that she did not delve deeper into this given her past film, Seeking Single White Male, that is all about internalized racism. Overall, a quick read with some thoughtful ideas....more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Mar 05, 2022","Mar 06, 2022","Dec 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58587364-people-change

This one reminded me a lot of Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou in terms of how it used satire to make a point. In Black Buck, we follow 22-year-old Darren who’s initially content working as a barista, until he gets an offer to join a fancy tech startup in Manhattan. He’s the only Black person in the company and soon enough starts believing in its mission enough to sell the startup’s promise himself. When things in his personal life take a dark turn, he devises a plan to recruit other young Black people to infiltrate America’s sale force, with devastating repercussions. I think this novel does a fantastic job of raising important, timely questions: what are the personal, moral, and relational costs of advancing in a predominantly white workforce? Is there a way to advance in a capitalistic society that doesn’t involve dehumanization or exploitation? While the tone and execution of Black Buck is very much a satire, Mateo Askaripour conveys the real and serious themes of race and labor underlying all of the novel’s chaos. Like Chou’s in Disorientation, Askaripour’s writing is fluid and entertaining enough to keep folks flipping the pages even as the plot devolves further into absurdity as the story progresses.A unique novel. Similar to how I felt with Yellowface by R.F. Kuang, I think it can be hard to feel a deep emotional connection to characters when they’re clearly being used to convey a broader social message within a satire.

Olga Dies Dreaming follows Olga and her brother Pedro “Prieto” AcevedI felt so much heart in this novel even though I wanted more from its execution. Olga Dies Dreaming follows Olga and her brother Pedro “Prieto” Acevedo, siblings whose mother, a Young Lord-turned-radical, abandoned them to fight for liberation. Olga now works as a wedding planner for rich people while Prieto represents their gentrifying Latinx neighborhood as a congressman. The story covers a lot of ground: Olga’s dissatisfaction with her career, Prieto’s closeted queerness, Olga’s lack of vulnerability in her romantic relationships, Prieto’s questionable political choices, how their mother’s abandonment affects both of them, and more.Olga Dies Dreaming explores a lot of interesting ideas. I felt fascinated by the notion of a parent who turns to activism over their own kids (honestly reminding me of some of the emotionally unavailable/harmful leftists I’ve met, oops). The commentaries throughout the book about gentrification felt important and I liked how this book both addressed issues of power and privilege while still saying centered on the siblings’ lives and emotions. Olga and Prieto both grow in tangible ways throughout the novel which increased my satisfaction in reading it.I give this book three stars because I felt like it tried to do a lot and I’m not sure that worked for me. Some books can do a ton of different things plot-wise and character-wise (I’m thinking of Kelly Loy Gilbert’s books Picture Us in the Light and When We Were Infinite) while still having a core emotional center and I didn’t feel that way with Olga Dies Dreaming. So much happens yet I didn’t really feel emotionally impacted by the events even though I felt happy for Olga and Prieto’s growth. I wonder what it would have felt like if a few of the elements were removed to give the other elements more space to breathe and sink in for the reader. Still, I recognize the appreciable elements of this novel as well as Xochitl Gonzalez’s ambition to try and tackle a lot....more",Notes are private!,1,127,1,"Feb 03, 2022","Feb 07, 2022","Dec 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693171-olga-dies-dreaming

It follows Misaki, a housewife who The best fantasy book I have read in a long time, The Sword of Kaigen blew me away and I loved every second of it. It follows Misaki, a housewife who married into the legendary Matsuda family for a more secure future and later gave birth to four sons with her cold, detached husband Takeru. Unbeknownst to her new family, Misaki left behind her days as a skilled and fearsome fighter, though an impending threat may awaken some of her long-buried combat abilities. We also experience the perspective of fourteen-year-old Mamoru, Misaki and Takeru’s oldest son, who has trained to defend his homeland for all his life. However, Mamoru learns that the empire he was always instructed to venerate may not value its citizens as much as he had been taught. When an invasion looms closer to the Matsuda family’s home base, we see these characters strive to fight for those they love, even at high and painful costs.I most appreciated the quality of writing in The Sword of Kaigen as well as its well-developed characters. In terms of the writing, I just felt immersed in M.L. Wang’s prose. Sometimes the writing in fantasy and sci-fi books can feel clunky or cumbersome for me to read, though with this book, Wang had such a talent of describing world-building and action sequences in a way that kept me engaged. The book includes several fight scenes where I felt so excited and positively worried about what fate would befall my favorite characters; the violence never felt present for shock-value and Wang inserted her characters’ personalities even in the ways they fought. Wang’s talented writing definitely made this book one where I said “omg omg omg” to myself as I pressed the button on my e-reader to learn who would survive and not.What elevates the amazingness of Sword of Kaigen even more is its characters. Misaki is such a freaking iconic character, a woman who’s a ferocious fighter, contends with sexist gender roles, and experiences complex emotions about her life and the decisions she’s made. I felt like Wang wrote her with such care and passion, as there were a few points in the book where Misaki stood up for herself that I pretty much was just like “omg Misaki non-monarchial QUEEN please ruin my life with your three-dimensionality and talent for vanquishing your foes.” Not only is Misaki a nuanced character who grows throughout the book, Wang even manages to make her husband, Takeru, a sympathetic and multidimensional character as well. His characterization speaks to how toxic masculinity’s repression of emotion and (view spoiler)[child abuse (hide spoiler)] can harm someone’s psyche and by the end of the book I even felt tender toward him. Wang includes several other side characters too who are distinctly drawn and memorable, even as they get less page time than Misaki, Takeru, and their son Mamoru. The friendship between Misaki, Setsuko, and Hyori also felt so beautiful to read about.Overall, highly recommended to fantasy fans and folks who want to support an Asian author. This book is self-published and felt so much better-written and riveting than many fantasy books I’ve read that were traditionally published. Props to M.L. Wang for her success with Sword of Kaigen!...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jan 29, 2022","Feb 03, 2022","Dec 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41886271-the-sword-of-kaigen

In this narrative and highly 4.5 starsI heard about How the Other Half Eats through NPR’s Code Switch podcast and feel so glad that I checked it out. In this narrative and highly readable book, sociologist and ethnographer Priya Fielding-Singh details how and why a variety of American families eat the way that they do. While Fielding-Singh conducted over 100 interviews, we follow four families in-depth: the Bakers, a Black family living below the federal poverty line; the Williamses, a working-class White family; the Ortegas, a middle-class Latinx family; and the Cains, an affluent white family. Through her rigorous and thoughtful observation, Fielding-Singh lays bare the nuanced factors affecting these families’ food choices and what we as a society must do to provide families, especially mothers, with more support for their health and wellbeing. I learned fascinating information reading this book. One of my first takeaways: while the idea of food deserts and lack of public access to healthful foods is prominent, lack of access is not actually the key determinant in shaping families’ food choices. Fielding-Singh documents how families living in poverty and lower socioeconomic statuses use food as a way to provide comfort for their kids (e.g., if I cannot afford to buy my kid a new videogame or an expensive fun trip, I can at least provide them with this bag of Doritos or a soda). I appreciated the nuance in which she wrote about the intersection of food and emotional comfort. Secondly, Fielding-Singh writes about the extreme pressure placed on mothers specifically to obsess and monitor their children’s food intake. She details how low-income mothers specifically are often strapped for resources and time, and thus they sometimes are forced to fall back on takeout or processed foods after working long hours and supporting their kids in other ways.As a researcher and reader I enjoyed How the Other Half Eats for many reasons. Fielding-Singh’s writing is keen, intelligent, and easy to follow, such that she captures both the nuances of these families’ lives while still describing their experiences in a story-like format. She’s nonjudgmental and empathetic while remaining astute and precise in her observations. I felt her deep care for these families and these issues of food, gender, and health, and I liked that she maintained both her humanness and her role as a researcher. She makes tangible recommendations for action at the end of the book and describes her research methods with clarity and depth. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in inequality, family life, and/or food and nutrition. While I don’t have any intention or desire to write a book myself, after reading this I was like, oh wow, how cool if someone could somehow write like, the therapy equivalent of this book. Anyway, props to Priya Fielding-Singh for a great read and I hope her research continues to thrive....more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Aug 23, 2022","Aug 27, 2022","Dec 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57007694-how-the-other-half-eats

I felt that he showed us the effects of his growing up in a lower socioeconomic status as well as how he faced pressure to appear as more masculine and less flamboyant. He writes with honesty both about his struggles with femmephobia and classism as well as the joy and resilience he cultivated as a gay Latinx man, through developing pride in his identities and what makes him special.I give this memoir three stars because I wanted Gomez to go a bit deeper at times, both with his analysis of himself as well as the emotional impacts of some of the events he describes. Toward the very end of the novel he writes about cultivating self-worth, though I wish that had been integrated more consistently throughout the novel – how specifically did he reckon with femmephobia, for example, to come to accept himself? I also felt uncertain about the inclusion of his various romantic and sexual encounters: while they came across as honest to his life experiences, I wanted to read more about what these relationships meant to him, as well as how he interpreted them in the context of his own identity development.

The book starts by A fascinating novel set in Tamil Nadu, India, about a boy born with blue skin whose parents raise him to believe that he is a God. The book starts by following Kalki in his youth as he uses his powers to heal people and confronts three trials to prove himself as the tenth human incarnation of Vishnu. However, as Kalki grows older, he begins to question the rigid religious life his father created for him, with severe consequences both for Kalki and for those he loves.I found the first part of this novel a riveting exploration of the impact of psychological manipulation, both from parent to child as well as from broader swaths of society too. SJ Sindu does an excellent job of embodying Kalki’s perspective, both his innocence as well as his growth in perspective as he gains bits of exposure into worlds outside of his own. Kalki’s father aptly represented patriarchal control and domination. Sindu weaves in commentaries about sexual fluidity, casteism, and colorism throughout the book in meaningful ways that did not feel overbearing. I feel like the latter third of the book or so felt rushed. While I considered the book’s first half or two thirds more richly textured, this last section came across as underdeveloped to me. While I suppose this vibe may match the chaotic energy of the New York City setting, I found Kalki’s characterization suddenly shallower and more predictable as well as the intricacies of his relationships less immersive.

It’s a slice-of-life, quiet, character-driven novel about Nina Dean, a 32-year-old successful food writer who gets ghosted by an Oh I loved this one. It’s a slice-of-life, quiet, character-driven novel about Nina Dean, a 32-year-old successful food writer who gets ghosted by an attractive man. Even with a great career and loving friends and family, Nina feels despondent by this man’s entrance and exit from her life. Not only does she navigate this ghosting-induced heartache, she also contends with her dad’s worsening illness and conflict with her longtime childhood friend. In Ghosts we follow Nina as she navigates friendship, romance, family, and more.Before I gush into how freaking relatable I found this book, I’ll start with some of its basic strengths. I found Dolly Alderton’s writing compulsively readable. Her prose felt simple yet consistently enjoyable. Her main characters came across as believable – especially their dialogue – and I found every scene in the novel well-constructed and engaging. I think she does a nice job of fitting in interesting insights about relationships, heteronormativity, and gender in a way that wasn’t distracting from the story or the characters. I also laughed out loud multiple times so I’m grateful to Alderton for the humor she infused into these pages.I have to admit that my five star rating largely stems from how relatable I found this book to my own life. I’m self-obsessed sometimes I must admit! But, yeah, as a 28-year-old (turning 29 in May wow) genderqueer person who has a thriving career and amazing friends, who’s attracted to men and been romantically single my whole life and hurt by men in dating contexts, I found this novel so relatable. Just the vibe of it honestly – like having your life so together in one context (e.g., Nina and I are rocking our work lives) and then having the worst luck in other contexts (e.g., dating men… though honestly many men aren’t socialized to be date-worthy anyway). I found so many of her subtle observations about friendship, the heteronormative dating game, and relationships spot on and things I’ve thought and felt before, like how a lot of women/femmes are socialized into really wanting marriage and to self-sacrifice and lower our standards for it even if we’re outwardly advocate for social justice in other areas of life. Also, I’m grateful that Alderton captured the atrocious ways men can treat people in dating and relational contexts (and I know people of diverse gender identities can be awful relationally, this just speaks to me as someone who’s been hurt by men). At the same time, Nina takes accountability for her own idealization of the man she meets, which I appreciated.Anyway, I’m grateful for this novel, my first five-star read of 2024. Reading this book also made me feel grateful for my closest friends, all of whom question the wedding industrial complex and heteronormativity and embody relationship anarchy at least in some way. At the same time, I’m literally the only one in my friend group who hasn’t dated a man (which honestly, I’m probably better off for having not done so lol) so Ghosts spoke to me in that regard.

The Sweetness of Water begins with Prentiss and Landry, two brothers freed from enA gorgeous debut novel, my first five-star read since June of 2021. The Sweetness of Water begins with Prentiss and Landry, two brothers freed from enslavement by the Emancipation Proclamation, who seek refuge on the home of George Walker, a transplanted northerner white man who wants the brothers’ help to farm his remaining acres of land. The novel focuses mostly on George and his wife Isabelle and the escalating tension they face with the white people nearby – consisting of plantation owners who recently lost the Black people they enslaved, as well as returning Confederate soldiers – who do not approve of the Walkers’ more equitable treatment of Prentiss and Landry. Slightly parallel to this conflict runs a forbidden romance between two Confederate soldiers, Caleb, the son of George and Isabelle, and August, a well-connected son of rich parents who’s set to marry a woman. Nathan Harris writes so beautifully, especially in how he shows instead of tells about his characters’ interior and exterior lives. Though I felt skeptical at first when I realized the book would focus mostly on the white characters instead of Prentiss and Landry, I soon grew to care deeply about all of the characters in The Sweetness of Water. Harris crafts such distinct, well-developed characters with realistic limitations and a relatable desire to do better (excluding the racist white people who were straight garbage, just gonna say it like it is). His writing reminded me of Adam Haslett’s in its emotional depth that felt both direct, understated, yet so moving at the same time. I am always impressed by writers who can craft fiction with important social commentary that still centers the characters’ growth and relationships with one another – Harris accomplishes that with this debut without a doubt.One of the two themes I loved the most in The Sweetness of Water is: what does it look like for white people to actually be allies/accomplishes for racial justice (and even more broadly what does it mean for any privileged group to try to advocate for oppressed groups)? Harris does a masterful job of showing how George, a well-intentioned progressive-minded white person, actually really messes up in his initial attempts to be an ally which has serious, devastating consequences for Prentiss and Landry. I think this idea of performative allyship and advocacy is increasingly important in a time when some academic institutions, corporations, etc. are embracing “diversity and inclusion” while still perpetuating racism and other forms of bigotry. What does it mean to truly walk the walk and put your life and resources on the line for justice? Though I’m still processing the profound way Harris writes about this question in The Sweetness of Water, I feel pretty certain that Harris avoids any white savior tropes and instead shows the complexities of racial solidarity, including the uncomfortable parts.I also loved how Harris shows how white queer men can be extremely racist and problematic. Yes, the summary of this book mentions a queer romance between two men, though I think this romance is definitely secondary to the Walkers’ relationship with their own whiteness and the bigotry of their neighboring white townspeople. In fact, the romance, or at least one of the characters within the romance, exemplifies how just because someone is marginalized doesn’t mean they’ll actually support other marginalized people – they may just cling to whatever power they do have to advance in their lives. Reading about this part of the book reminded me of a time when I tweeted about white gay men perpetuating racism and sexism, and a white gay man I used to respect direct messaged me and essentially said that “not all white gay men are like that” and tried to gaslight me. He unfollowed me when I stood my ground and asked him why he isn’t trying to call out/in white gay men who are racist and sexist instead of defending himself to me. While I recognize this little Twitter exchange is by no means comparable to the anti-Black racism experienced by the characters in this book, I share the story because I think pretty much all of us can practice more intensive introspection about the ways we put down other marginalized people intentionally or unintentionally, even if we ourselves are marginalized.Harris also writes about important themes including softer forms of masculinity and the bonds between mothers and their children. His prose never feels intellectualized or didactic though. He shows us these characters’ desires and their struggles and lets their actions and emotions convey the deeper themes of the novel. Highly recommended and I’m definitely keeping an eye out for whatever Harris writes next, if he does want to write another book....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Nov 27, 2021","Nov 29, 2021","Nov 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54404602-the-sweetness-of-water

Beyond that though, I struggled to feel invested in Love in the Big City. Mainly, our protagonist has several romantic relationships with men where I struggled to understand what drew him to these men in the first place. Our main character possesses a distinctly brash voice yet not much else about him – hobbies, particular vulnerabilities aside from general attachment issues, early life experiences – stood out to me, so I couldn’t figure out why he and his romantic partners felt drawn to one another. These romantic relationships also all came across as pretty unhealthy or filled with unresolved miscommunication. While these types of relationships do exist, I didn’t detect any trend toward growth in any of the main character’s relationships nor any growth from the main character himself. I liked the more rigorous development of the main character’s relationship with his best friend Jaehee as well as his difficult relationship with his mother, though neither of these relationships felt explored to a satisfying level either. The character does a lot of things though his internal exploration felt lacking.

We follow the 40th prisoner, a young girl who sits outcast in the corner until their group of 40 escapes into the aboveground strange world that awaits them. Harpman’s writing made the events in this book feel scary and important. Her prose is ominous, sparse yet vivid enough to create a satisfyingly creepy atmosphere.

Feelings from and thoughts about the story came to me all throughout Sunday, then I reread the story Sunday evening and cried and felt such catharsis. I genuinely thought to myself “wow, I’m so glad I decided to keep living even through difficult times so I could experience the bliss of reading this story.”Fanboying “Hell-Heaven” aside, I felt so impressed by Lahiri’s rendering of human emotions and relationships. She has an impeccable eye for detail both in relation to setting and capturing small mannerisms and reactions that underlie the ways we connect to one another. Whether writing about an older sister who feels complicit in her younger brother’s substance use disorder, or a graduate student caught up in his roommate’s unhealthy relationship, or parents’ feelings of entanglement with and separation from their children, Lahiri manages to capture it all through writing that feels realistic and immersive. Themes of South Asian culture and immigration pervade these stories in both subtle and powerful ways. Beyond “Hell-Heaven,” I felt stunned by “Year’s End,” a short story about grief that literally made me roll around on my couch and scream “omg Jhumpa Lahiri step on me” because of how beautifully and painfully she portrays the main character’s emotions of loss, as well as the first story “Unaccustomed Earth,” about the push and pull of family ties.Other ers have critiqued how Lahiri focuses on the experiences of highly-educated, upper middle class South Asian immigrants. I personally didn’t have as much of an issue with that given that I think classism is an oppressive force that the publishing industry as a whole should confront. However, I did find the almost cynical leaning of some of these stories a bit much at times, like the emphasis on intrapersonal wounds or trust issues and how they affect relationships negatively. I don’t think Lahiri’s necessarily at fault for portraying these dynamics given that people do avoid intimacy or mess up intimacy because of their past unresolved issues; it’s my personal taste that prevents me from giving this collection five stars. Still, I would highly recommend Unaccustomed Earth and I commend Lahiri for her talent and ambition....more",Notes are private!,0,95,1,"Nov 06, 2021","Nov 10, 2021","Oct 31, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/85301.Unaccustomed_Earth

Just Last Night follow Eve, a woman in her thirties, whose closest friends include her best friend Suzie, her longtime secret crush Ed, and the caring jokester in the group Justin. One night a tragic event occurs that forces Eve to confront difficult truths about her friend group. In the process, she learns more about the dynamic between her and Ed, as well as how she feels about what – and who – she wants in her life.This book felt fluffy to me. I liked several things about it: Eve is a flawed yet honest and relatable protagonist, Mhairi McFarlane’s writing flows well and is easy to read, and Eve’s grows in meaningful ways through the duration of the novel. I think my three star rating may stem from a mismatch between my expectations and what I want in novels versus the genre of the book itself. I wanted more of an emphasis on Eve and Suzie’s relationship and Eve’s grieving process, whereas I felt the book focused a lot on the romances with the male characters. While this focus makes sense given that it looks like this book is categorized as a romance novel, I myself would have enjoyed more of an emphasis on Eve’s grief and her relationship with Suzie. This shift would have helped the book feel deeper to me, though I see why others appreciate it as is....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Nov 30, 2021","Dec 02, 2021","Oct 29, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54870201-just-last-night

I sensed that they wanted to write a book about overcoming oppression and stereotypes as well as finding love and connection against the odds, and The Witch King succeeds in putting forth those messages.With those positives stated, I found the execution of The Witch King rather messy. In terms of the writing, Edgmon included pop culture references on almost every other page, which distracted me and took me out of the narrative and world they created. The plot felt all over the place and a lot of it occurred through characters verbally stating past events and misunderstandings. Aside from our main character Wyatt, a lot of the characters blurred together for me in the way they spoke and presented themselves.Overall, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend this book though again I am a fan of Edgmon’s intention and purpose behind writing this book and this series.

Alison Kafer makes several astute points about contemporary society’s offensive use of disabled people as inspiration porn as well as the exclusion of disabled people from certain feminist texts. A main takeaway I derived from this text includes simply thinking more critically about disability and its intersections with issues such as environmental justice, as well as centering disabled people’s voices generally. I liked her application of queer time to issues of disability justice and her commitment to properly politicizing disability instead of undermining the vitality of the disability movement.My main constructive critique of this book is that sometimes I was like, what is going on right now?? There were certain sections (e.g., the cyborg section) where I felt like the use of jargony academic language obscured some of Kafer’s points.

I liked how the author took into account how society can glorify overcontrol such as through rewarding people who delay gratification and who invest so much of themselves in work. I research eating disorders and see how the themes of overcontrol especially relate to anorexia nervosa. The main downside which other ers have also noted is that the book is extremely long and I’m not sure all the content actually related to the central issues of overcontrol. I also thought the lack of attention paid to issues of culture and social oppression and how those factors may motivate or affect a desire for control was a bit egregious.

Eyal Press does a fantastic job of showing how these forms of work, especially the ones that poor and working class people get saddled with (i.e., not the tech workers who often have prestigious degrees) dehumanize these employees and often result in intense mental health problems such as PTSD both for the employees and their loved ones. Press also zooms out and highlights how people of privileged positions in society, such as upper class individuals, contribute to the existence of these jobs through engaging in behaviors such as relying on fossil fuels, consuming meat, and funding prisons through our tax dollars. However, those of us in these positions of privilege often turn our attention away from the “dirty work” that Press writes about in this book, because it can feel easier to let more disadvantaged people suffer than to face our own complicity in their oppression.Overall I enjoyed this book a lot and appreciated how Press heavily featured the voices of those within these professions. He writes intelligently about why and how industries and corporations keep these types of jobs away from the public eye, as well as how those of us with privilege are just as complicit as those carrying out this work unless we take action against the systems that create these jobs in the first place. Throughout the book I felt curious about Press’s own positionality in relation to these issues and if the book would have benefitted from Press just slightly more explicitly naming some of the systems that maintain these forms of labor (e.g., white supremacy, capitalism).

I will start with what I liked. I feel liA conversation-provoking text that I give three stars to because I feel like it could have been even better. I will start with what I liked. I feel like Jay Caspian Kang did an excellent job of challenging us to question and to think more deeply about “Asian American” identity, in particular how Asian Americans may try to assimilate to whiteness instead of engaging in solidarity with refugee, undocumented, and working class Asian Americans. He weaves in historical analysis to further flesh out his arguments and to show how the topics he’s writing about have manifested in the past and into the present. In general, I appreciated the consistency of his voice and tone in The Loneliest Americans: it emanated this existential dread angst vibe that felt authentic to him as a person even if a bit intellectualizing of his emotions at times.One of the major elements of this book I found lacking includes a lack of tangible narratives and actions to disrupt white supremacy and whiteness from within the Asian American community. Kang repeatedly makes the argument that Asian Americans should align themselves with the most marginalized in our community, an argument I agree with, yet he doesn’t delve as deeply into this recommendation as I would like. For example, the book could have benefitted from including voices of actual working class, refugee, undocumented Asian Americans. Furthermore, I do know Asian Americans who are doing the work of fighting for the most marginalized in our communities as well as engaging in solidarity with the Black community – I’m curious why he didn’t include more of those perspectives as well, which would’ve given more examples for readers to follow or learn from.I also felt a little frustrated by how Kang wrote about his own positionality. I appreciate his openness about naming his privilege, how he married a white woman, and the nuanced emotions he has about having a biracial kid. However, I personally wanted a more thorough self-analysis here: so if you’re going to (rightfully) criticize Asian Americans who ascend into upward class mobility and whiteness, how do you feel about your own decision to engage in whiteness in your own life? I don’t want to assume his emotions because only he knows them, though I sensed some unspoken meandering guilt about marrying a white person and having a half-Korean, half-white kid. If he does or even if he doesn’t feel that guilt, instead of wallowing in it, I wanted to know what specifically is he doing to counteract and dismantle the privilege he has and the privilege his child will inherit? Similar to my point in the second paragraph, I also feel like Kang could have included the voices of Asian Americans who have chosen specifically not to date or marry white people and who rather engaged with other people of color or fellow Asian Americans either as romantic partners or lifelong friends. A couple of more minor points (lol I feel like I’m writing one of my s for a peer-ed manuscript, oops): I found a couple of places in the text I wanted a bit more specificity and precision. For example, on page 59 he writes that “the flood of Asians who came to the United States after Hart-Cellar had no experience with American racism or oppression.” While I appreciate his point about disentangling Asian Americans’ experiences of racism/oppression based on year of immigration as well as his use of a more dramatic tone for rhetorical effect, I think statements like the one on page 59 can obscure the experiences of marginalized groups within the Asian American community, such as LGBTQ+ Asian Americans. Also, there were two places in the book where Kang describes half-Asian, half-white people as especially attractive, once on the first page when describing half-Asian kids he met in his youth and once later on when he describes a half-Asian, half-white man he interviews in the chapter “Flushing Rising.” While my sense is that Kang would want to reject the glorification and idealization of half-white, half-Asian individuals’ appearance over monoracial Asians, I wish he would have more explicitly addressed these incidents in the text and where they came from.Clearly this book was compelling enough to elicit such a strong response from myself and other readers. I’d recommend it as a starting point for conversation and self-reflection, with the additional recommendation of even more reading, introspection, and action to enact some of the more abstract ideals purported by Kang in this book....more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Oct 31, 2021","Nov 06, 2021","Oct 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58145392-the-loneliest-americans

Joan devotes herself entirely to her work, where she’s extremely competent and successful. She’s unbothered by her solitary existence outside of work, though at times she thinks about how much of herself she should give to her tight-knit family. When her father suddenly dies, her mother moves back to the United States to connect with her children, and the COVID-19 pandemic begins, Joan is forced in even deeper ways to consider what matters most to her.The Goodreads blurb for this book describes it as “deceptively spare yet quietly powerful” which I agree with so much. For a lot of Joan is Okay I felt a bit bored. I enjoyed Weike Wang’s concise prose and laughed out loud a couple of times, yet Joan as a character felt distant. However, toward the end of the novel, many of the elements within Joan’s life came together in a way that felt so emotionally powerful. Within the last 40 pages or so I cheered for Joan and the last page of the novel literally made tears spring to my eyes (while sitting in a Washington D.C. airport with my KN95 mask on, just to set the scene). I feel like Wang incorporates a lot of important commentary throughout the book about Asian immigrant dynamics, anti-Asian racism, existing as an Asian woman in a white-dominated work environment, yet the strings aren’t pulled together until the end of the novel. When they did come together, I felt so impressed by the subtle brilliance of Wang’s writing and the complex yet loving dynamics between Joan and her brother, mother, and father. Wang avoids the common stereotypes about Asian family dynamics (e.g., overbearing and emotionally cruel parents, an emotionally stunted yet professionally successful Asian brother) for more dynamic characterizations which I really appreciated.I also appreciated the quiet, subtle, yet powerful way Wang destigmatizes Joan’s content existence as a romantically single, childless Asian American woman. I feel like there’s so much societal glorification of the route of romantic love, having a nuclear family, etc. and I loved Joan’s consistent dedication to her career throughout the book. Wang writes in a way where Joan’s choice to remain devoted to her job as an ICU doctor felt less like a feminist political statement, even though it is, and more like a natural extension of her character and personality. Icon behavior from Joan and from Wang.There were several moments at the end of the book that made me so, so happy for Joan and one scene on the last page that made me teary-eyed so I’m just gonna put them all in spoilers to avoid giving them away: (view spoiler)[when her brother texts her to check in about her health and the novel flashes back to when he walked her outside when their parents fought, the scene she gets featured on the pamphlet at work, the passage when she aptly characterizes Mark and Reese as privileged and annoying, the moment she opens her door and sees all the food/resources, and the last recollection of the Asian father and daughter she saw talking about the lottery omg that felt SO poignant (hide spoiler)].

Raw and honest stream of consciousness essays about existing and resisting within white institutions, as well as faux and performative progressivism. I appreciated Jill Louise Busby’s willingness to get real about her experience working in the diversity and inclusion industry. She describes people, especially white people, who will proclaim social justice values and then engage in oppressive behaviors in nonpublic settings. She writes with nuance and an openness to ambiguity about the discomfort of getting paid to do work that aims to advance equity, within a white supremacist system that should not exist in the first place. I wish the essay had gone a little deeper in its introspection in a few areas. For example, she mentions being light-skinned and how people have called her out for her refusal to acknowledge the ways she benefits from colorism, but I did not see any further unpacking of that privilege or a desire to dismantle the systems that have allowed her to benefit from colorism. In another section, she writes about the anxiety and negative emotions she experiences when she sees that people unfollow her on social media, yet I didn’t detect a more thorough self-investigation about what makes followers matter to her in the first place, how she copes when she loses followers, what systems benefit from people caring about their followers on social media, etc. I wonder if not writing in the second person would have allowed for more of this self-searching.Overall, I appreciate Busby’s willingness to name things as they are, even though I wanted a bit more from this set of essays....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Sep 30, 2021","Oct 04, 2021","Sep 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55891836-unfollow-me

Aside from that though, I founI liked the vulnerability Larissa Pham displayed in this essay collection about art and romantic connection and travel. Aside from that though, I found this book a frustrating reading experience. This  by Phoebe highlights a lot of the issues I took with it so I will just emphasize the main points. First, I felt like a lot of Pop Song read like vaguebooking. Pham makes a lot of intense emotional statements that didn’t communicate anything concrete enough to resonate on a deeper level. I’ll provide an example to exemplify this point:“Remembering that – morning how he emerged in his towel to me in the kitchen, pleased, wet, and surprised – I think to myself, I wasn’t entirely happy then, but that was definitely a sort of happiness.Maybe, then, it was a sort of preparation, for a greater kind of happiness. And in that happiness, a greater heartache. I didn’t know then how it could feel – how it would feel when I met you.”I have so many questions about this passage that I don’t think were ever answered?? So if you weren’t entirely happy, what do you mean by “a sort of happiness” – like what is the actual emotion there? Also, how did this interaction serve as a preparation? What do you mean when you say a “greater kind of happiness?” Also, how are you supposed to know what it’s like to meet someone in the future if you didn’t know you would meet them yet? Finally, who is the “you” here (Pham uses the second person “you” throughout the book to generally refer to one or multiple of her romantic connections though I think this is disadvantageous because it’s unclear who she’s talking about at any specific point)? I don’t state this to overly criticize her writing. In fact, I am curious about what she’s actually referring to, like the people she’s interacting with, as well as what lessons she’s taking away from her experiences. As Phoebe writes in her , Pham doesn’t really draw any conclusions in this book, which felt like an avoidance of more genuine or tangible insight that would have helped us understand more specifically what she’s going through or what she’s been through. For example, there's a lot of romantic relational strife in this book though I'm still unclear about what continually caused this strife and what Pham has learned from it or how she's grown from mit. Perhaps this book may appeal to those interested in art though I hesitate to recommend it, unfortunately....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Apr 14, 2022","Apr 16, 2022","Sep 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54777446-pop-song

Saaba Tahir tackles so many important topics in All My Rage, including Islamophobia, abuse, substance use disorders, racism, financial stress and more. I felt that she captured the full emotional weight of these issues through her main characters, Salahudin and Noor, and through their journeys she showed us that anger and rage act as appropriate responses to mistreatment and trauma. She also highlights how her characters cope and begin to heal from the struggles they face which felt hopeful though not overly optimistic. Through reading this novel I could feel Tahir’s deep care both about these important issues and about her characters.I only give this book three stars because the writing style distracted me from the story and its characters. I felt at times that Tahir would “overwrite” some of the emotions and thoughts of our protagonists, so it came across as tell and not show.

I’m here for stories with kickass Asian women who are also fiercely complicated and emotional.Sadly, I didn’t enjoy many other aspects of this book. I found the framework of Romeo and Juliet boring – Juliette and Roma’s romance didn’t spark much for me, and I felt like the “screen time” taken up by the romance could have been spent developing all the characters in more interesting ways. While the plague mystery plot felt high-stakes-ish, it failed to capture my full attention, especially because I felt like so many of the scenes served as filler to build up the tension between the not-so-exciting romance between Juliette and Roma.

I appreciated how Jordan Ifueko included asexual representation and some interesting commentary about state repression of people’s dissent. The ending surprised me in a pleasant way with its more thrilling execution, which made me curious about the sequel to this book.The reason I do not rate this book higher is because I felt that a lot of the book’s events came across as predictable. The majority of the conflict in the novel did not come across as high stakes to me because I could assume early on how they’d be resolved. While Ifueko ended Raybearer on a high note, I wanted more of that tenseness and surprise throughout the book, even if this first book served to set the stage for future installments.Overall, would recommend to fans of young-adult fantasy who find the book’s synopsis interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Sep 11, 2021","Sep 16, 2021","Sep 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50158128-raybearer

Jamie Cortez does a great job of showing how childhood bullying and binary gender roles enforce toxic masculinity and homophobia. I didn’t love this book because the main character’s voice felt a bit passive and one-note to me. I understand Gordo is a child and a child who is marginalized based on his social identities, but the narrative voice lacked a certain precision, power, and growth that I felt amazed by when I read Caucasia by Danzy Senna, for example.

These five linked stories center a high school studeA profound novel about characters who may seem simple on the surface yet have very complex lives. These five linked stories center a high school student who has cosplay sex with an older woman, a sad housewife obsessed with anime, a single mother and midwife who works herself to the bone to provide for her son and her mediocre ex-husband, and more. So We Look to the Sky follows their ordinary day-to-day lives while capturing profound themes related to gender and women’s (dis)empowerment, online bullying and abuse, and the healing power of adult role models and caregivers.I found this book addictive. Even though the novel stays within the bounds of realistic fiction – no murder, no magical realism, no mystery/thriller elements – the details of these characters’ lives felt so vivid immediate. From the sensory images of how the characters interacted with the weather to the sharp, poignant dialogue between characters who hurt or supported one another, I felt invested in the many struggles and few hard-won victories in So We Look to the Sky. I think the theme of powerlessness connects the main characters in these five linked stories: all of these characters are high school students or women, and the novel does an excellent job of portraying how they do their best to cultivate some form of a meaningful, satisfying life even while facing patriarchy and classism. The two final stories almost elevated So We Look to the Sky to a five-star novel for me. In “A Goldenrod Sky,” we follow Ryoka, a high school student who struggles to make ends meet with no support from his parents, all while looking after his mentally-deteriorating grandmother. This story ended in a way that reinforced for me how a caring adult who believes in you can really alter the trajectory of your life. I felt my heart soar and also breathe a sign of relief for Ryoka at the end of the story due to the mental space he finds himself in. In the final story, “A Pollen Nation,” we read about a midwife who has to work and work to carve out a living for herself and her son, who then finds out about pornographic images of her son that got leaked online. Though in vastly different contexts, the protagonist of this story reminded me of Sunja from Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko, a woman who has gone through so much shit in her life, in large part because of sexism, and how she manages to still cultivate some form of a happy, hopeful ending. I loved the unsentimental positive way this story concluded and its overall message about how even if you have suffered again and again, new possibilities await if you do not close yourself out to them.I only give this book four stars instead of five because a couple of the characters or their motivations felt either unrealistic or unexplained to me. For example, in the first story, a high school student has cosplay sex with a much older woman (warning: in the United States, this would have counted as statutory rape, though I googled and it looks like the age of consent in Japan is 13.) While I understand that adults can manipulate teenagers for sure, I felt that the way the main character in the first story was written did not sufficiently explain how and why he developed an emotional attachment to the older woman. I felt a similar way about a few other characters in the novel, like the cruel husband in the second story and the quirky brother in the third story. I’m not sure if it’s too much to ask for within the context of five short stories, but I wanted just a bit more depth in these side characters to help explain their desires and actions.Overall, I would recommend this novel to those who want a quick and immersive reading experience. It is sexually explicit, however, it does not feel like the author uses sex for cheap shock value, especially after the first story. I want to read more translated fiction now and I’m hoping other works can live up to the high standard set by So We Look to the Sky!...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Aug 19, 2021","Aug 21, 2021","Aug 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711380-so-we-look-to-the-sky

In No Bad Parts, Richard Schwartz describes his psychotherapy Internal Family Systems, which centers on how we have different parts within ourselves that take on different roles in response to trauma we may have suffered in our childhoods. For example, we may have Exiles, which represent the psychological trauma itself and embody the pain and fear from our negative early experiences, as well as Firefighters, which symbolize coping mechanisms (e.g., binge eating, substance use) that try to mitigate the suffering elicited by Exiles. Schwartz writes about how we can view each part with kindness to work toward leading our lives with the Self, the wise and compassionate essence of ourselves.Overall, I found Schwartz a personable and genuine writer and his approach to therapy a kind and affirming one. I appreciated the thoroughness in which he infused this book with self-kindness, like recognizing the importance of not stigmatizing how we cope with suffering so we can then cope in ways that feel even better for our psyches. He does a nice job too of touching on how social injustices (e.g., racism, patriarchy) contribute to psychological suffering, and he also gives credit to Buddhism for heavily influencing mindfulness. When he wrote about how bullying can manifest in leftist/social justice spaces because of people’s unresolved or unaddressed issues, I was just like, yep exactly glad someone named this dynamic!I did want a bit more differentiation between internal family systems and other therapeutic approaches. In some ways I struggled to distinguish this approach from psychodynamic therapy generally – perhaps this approach is psychodynamic therapy with more specific names for certain phenomena (i.e., a clearer labeling of parts)? The notion of Firefighters reminded me a lot of emotion dysregulation concepts too. Finally, while I appreciated Schwartz naming the importance of addressing our own oppressive feelings and thoughts (e.g., racist beliefs we hold, sexist beliefs we hold, etc.) I do think a little more elaboration about the next step to address those feelings and thoughts would have elevated that section even more....more",Notes are private!,0,136,1,"Aug 24, 2021","Aug 25, 2021","Aug 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55384168-no-bad-parts

Every word moves the plot forward or illustLet me start this  by saying that I think Sally Rooney is an excellent writer on the sentence level. Every word moves the plot forward or illustrates a meaningful detail about her characters. Her dialogue in particular is extraordinary. Even though I had mixed feelings about Conversations with Friends and kinda detested Normal People, I still read this novel because I remembered how immersed I felt in her past characters’ conversations with one another. For example, in Beautiful World, Where Are You there’s one scene in which Eileen sees Simon at a wedding and the narrative does this montage-esque time lapse thing where it recounts a significant portion of Eileen and Simon’s coming-of-age with one another within the span of half a chapter or so. This section of the novel literally took my breath away, like I literally paused at the end of the chapter and thought to myself “wow, she did that.” That being said, I still significantly disliked this novel, especially its latter half. For the first 50% I thought Beautiful World, Where Are You might serve as my first higher-than-three-star Sally Rooney novel, then many elements of the book took a nosedive. Here are the top three features of this book that soured it for me.1. A lack of depth in the characters’ motivations and desires. For example, at one point Eileen writes to Alice that she feels that her life would have been significantly better if she had married Simon earlier on. Eileen also pushes and pulls Simon away from her throughout the novel. However, there’s no deeper exploration of why Eileen feels so incomplete and wretched without Simon nor is there any sincere introspection about why she treats him the way she does. I feel like because Rooney is such a talented writer, she makes Eileen and the other characters’ angst about their situations so interesting and dynamic. However, interesting and dynamic angst is not the same thing as angst that is actually processed or learned from. There’s a big moment at the end of the novel with all four characters that kinda functions as this major catharsis followed by a denouement, though I didn’t observe any increased self-awareness there either.2. Rooney focuses on the romantic dynamics between Eileen and Simon and Alice and Felix at the expense of more robust character development. While Rooney, again, writes immersive conversations and scenes between these characters and their love interests, the focus on the romantic elements detracted from more nuanced growth. Eileen faces a complicated dynamic with her sister and their parents, while Alice experienced psychiatric hospitalization and continues to face mental health issues. Instead of developing these aspects of Eileen and Alice, Rooney throws them into situations with Simon and Felix over and over with no reprieve. Even when Eileen and Alice finally reunite in person, Simon and Felix are present and take up space that could have been spent fleshing out the women’s friendship. The ending of the novel thus felt cheapened given the lack of actual growth on any of the characters’ behalf.3. Okay, what the heck purpose did Felix serve in this novel? Felix is literally an awful, emotionally volatile man and there’s no accountability for his actions nor a basic recognition of his garbage behaviors? He watches pornography that’s degrading to women, is outright mean to Alice on multiple occasions, is cruel to Eileen about her friendship with Alice, tries to take advantage of Simon when Simon experiences a moment of emotional fragility, and avoids communicating with his brother like any basic human decent being would after their mom dies. The worst part about all of this is that the novel doesn’t even reprimand Felix for these behaviors nor does it explore the root of his actions in an even halfhearted-way, it just lets Felix act horrible and end up relatively unscathed. If you read this book and think that the way Felix treats people is in any way okay, please read about healthy relationship behaviors because I promise that you do not deserve to be treated like how Felix treats essentially everyone in this novel.Despite all these complaints, there’s a small chance I may read Rooney’s next novel anyway just because of the quality of her writing. The novel poses an interesting overarching thematic question of whether it’s okay to focus on friendships and relationships when the world is collapsing, however, I wish that the characters in this novel were actually better developed to allow for a more robust exploration of that question. I’ll end this  by saying that there are several books written by women of color about women of color who actually grow and heal in messy yet beautiful ways, and it’s oppressive that these books don’t receive as high ratings or as many ratings/s as Sally Rooney’s books. You can find examples on my Goodreads shelf, though I’ll recommend a few here: You Exist Too Much by Zaina Arafat, A World Between by Emily Hashimoto, and When We Were Infinite by Kelly Loy Gilbert....more",Notes are private!,4,2191,1,"Sep 07, 2021","Sep 11, 2021","Aug 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56597885-beautiful-world-where-are-you

She has varied life experiences such as working as a voice actor and going to law school which added a sense of novelty to these essays. This book’s main premise, about the lip service or shallow efforts people invest in actually addressing serious issues such as systemic racism, merits thought and attention in this age of convenient social media announcements and questionable commitments to tangible change toward justice.Other components of this collection did not work for me as much. I felt that the integration of Isen’s personal life and her analysis of texts, media, and current events did not ever feel fully smooth or effective. Some parts of certain essays felt tangential to me – like in her essay about white women/feminism she moves from Taylor Swift to Ellen DeGeneres to Lana Del Ray, all white women who deserve critical analysis/some critique, yet I’d rather she go in-depth about one or two of these women and make a more thought-provoking argument as opposed to provide a more surface-level analysis/summary of each. Finally, I wanted these essays to draw stronger main points and conclusions. Isen does a great job of highlighting how certain practices are problematic, and at the same time I wanted more tangible recommendations for change, or bolder takeaways even if those takeaways were not change-oriented. I’m not saying the topics she writes about have easy or simple solutions, and still I think firmer solutions or insights would have made these essays more memorable.

House of Sticks reminded me of Phuc Tran’s Sigh, Gone, though Tran’s story is unique and she owns it with her distinct, unsentimental, yet captivating voice. In House of Sticks, she writes about immigrating to Queens, New York with her three older brothers and her parents, her father having served as a former lieutenant in the South Vietnamese army and then almost a decade as a prisoner of war. Her entire family sews ties and cummerbunds on their living room floor to pay for food, rent, and other living necessities. As Tran gets older, she is forced to navigate the clash between her unfamiliar school environment and her parents’ Buddhist faith and their impoverished circumstances. Tensions rise as Tran struggles to see and her father forbids her from getting classes, labeling her diagnosis of poor vision as a government conspiracy. In this memoir, we witness Tran navigate creating her own self-concept amidst cultural mismatches, intergenerational trauma, and mental health concerns that stem from a complicated childhood.One of the elements I most appreciated about House of Sticks includes how Trans honors the complexity of her family dynamic. While her father behaves in ways that many would consider abusive or at the very least extremely hurtful, Tran acknowledges both the impact of his actions as well as how his trauma from the American War in Vietnam affects his parenting style and how he tries to show concern for her and her siblings. I feel like this level of nuance shows how much internal work Tran has done on herself to write with compassion both for herself and for her father. She also weaves in scenes related to gender roles and burgeoning feminist thinking in relation to her mom, as well as feelings of both camaraderie and slight abandonment with her brothers. Also, two of her brothers Long and Phuc, have left s of her book on Goodreads (you can find them on the first page of s) and they’re the cutest and most wholesome things ever. I enjoyed the sheer realness of Tran’s story as well. A lot of people stereotype Asian Americans as economically and educationally successful and upwardly mobile, and while Tran and her siblings achieve these forms of success to a degree, Tran also writes about their family’s setbacks and her struggle with mental health. Given the quality of her writing, I found Tran a trustworthy, self-aware, and relatable narrator who I rooted for throughout this memoir. By the end of the book I felt deeply invested in her wellbeing as well as the wellbeing of her family. I’m still curious about Tran’s experience graduating from Columbia and embarking on a writing career, how her mother and father are faring and if they’re still operating their nail salon, and her brothers’ careers, hairstyles, and overall journeys as well. I think my curiosity highlights Tran’s ability to render her story in a unique and specific way while making it flow smoothly for her readers.Overall, would highly recommend this memoir to everyone, especially those interested in coming-of-age stories. I had to put the book down a few times because some of Tran’s anecdotes reminded me of my own family in poignant ways, and I’m grateful to Tran for putting House of Sticks into the world so I and other Vietnamese/Vietnamese American folks can reflect on our shared and different experiences. Yay for 2021 ending on a high note with a memoir like this one!...more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Dec 20, 2021","Dec 24, 2021","Aug 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55710553-house-of-sticks

I loved the way Suleika Jaouad wrote about her journey with leukemia though of course I wish she and others never suffered so much. She details her experience with vivid detail and self-awareness, so that readers can understand the depth of both her medical trauma as well as her own emotional processing. Jaouad packs so much insight into this memoir: the power of relationships even when life feels unbearable, using writing to gain a sense of control amidst uncontrollable pain, the thin line between wellness and illness, and much more. In particular, I appreciated her reflection about her relationship with Will. I feel like it takes guts to so openly acknowledge when you messed up in a relationship; my sense is that that openness usually comes after someone has really reckoned and sat with the impact of their actions. I googled and saw that Jaouad was considered cured of her cancer though she relapsed in July 2022.

I enjoyed this short story collection focusing on Indians living both abroad in the United States and England as well as in India, featuring a diverse array of perspectives and narrative frames. I feel like Jenny Bhatt’s stories excelled the most when they centered on a well-developed character with a consistent voice. I most loved “Life Spring,” a story about a woman operating her own bakery after a divorce, who fights to overcome both sexism in her business ventures as well as her own broken heart. I also enjoyed “Neeru’s New World,” about a maid in India who risks experiencing sexual assault her workplace, “Pros and Cons,”’ which highlights yoga instructors and their and their students’ inner desires, and “Time and Opportunity,” about a shopkeeper whose complicity in discrimination backfires against him. With each of these stories, especially “Life Spring,” I felt intimately equated with the protagonists’ even after only a few scenes, and I felt connected in their struggles to advocate for their own desires amidst the forces of sexism, classism, and casteism. A few other stories I considered more “make a point” stories. With these stories, they made strong and compelling points about social injustices such as casteism or gender discrimination, though I did not connect with the characters as much. Some of these stories either felt too short or the writing device came across as more prominent than the characters’ inner and outer lives.

In Why Fish Don’t Exist, Lulu Miller writes about the life of David Starr Jordan, a taxonomist who she developed an obsessive interest with after a difficult time in her personal life. Unfortunately I found it difficult to immerse myself in this book because I found Miller’s writing style vague and melodramatic. To me, it gave the vibe of “this writing is intended to elicit big emotions from you” instead of letting the quality or concision of her writing do that for her. I also didn’t find her writing about David Starr Jordan fascinating at all. All the facts about him felt heavy-handed and uninteresting to me, and the message she intended to communicate through sharing about his life came across as too simplistic. I wish Miller had included more in-depth self-reflection in this book; for example, she writes early on about cheating on her romantic partner, yet I didn’t get a solid sense of why that happened, her internal landscape surrounding that choice aside from emotions of guilt, or what drew her to David Starr Jordan in the first place, aside from that he also experienced what could be called a tragedy.Anyway, to avoid being too much of a Negative Nigel I also wanted to share some memoirs I loved and would recommend instead of this one in honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Month!

The novel follows a young woman named Remi who loses her sister Leah in a car accident. Akemi Dawn Bowman portrays Remi’s grief in a realistic and uncompromising way, ranging from her lashing out at close loved ones, distrusting newer social connections, and over time starting to heal. Remi’s messiness mirrored the messiness of grief. Toward the end of the novel I found myself getting a little emotional about the growth Remi exhibits in relation to understanding her feelings of anger and sadness.I also appreciated how Bowman portrayed a piece of Remi’s journey in understanding her aromanticism. Remi’s initial confusion about her romantic and sexual desires, or lack thereof, felt authentic. I enjoyed her friendship with Kai a lot, as I felt that Bowman infused their relationship with a playful yet deep energy which showed the power of friendship overall, in an amatonormative society and YA book industry that prioritizes romance.I only give this book three stars because I felt like the writing distracted me from the novel’s beautiful themes. Not like I could have done any better, and at the same time the writing came across to me as trying really hard to make a point – like, oh, here’s the scene where Remi experiences a memory about Leah’s more amiable nature, or oh, here’s a moment when Remi finds solace in music. The use of adverbs (e.g., when Remi says things “curtly”) and the dialogue, which felt occasionally exaggerated to me, made it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in the story. Still, I’d recommend the novel to those who find its premise interesting, given its raw portrayal of grief with an aromantic main character....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Oct 16, 2021","Oct 19, 2021","Jul 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35716237-summer-bird-blue

I liked her honest depiction of the struggles these girls go through, such as how they are taught to prioritize romantic love, how they experience gross sexualization and fetishization at a young age, and how they fight between assimilating to Americanness while wanting to resist whiteness and maintain their own cultural identity. Love War Stories centers on the intergenerational transmission of love and romance, as well as how the focus on that form of desire often disrupts girls’ and women’s lives.I feel like I often give three-star ratings to short story collections, especially when I enjoy the concept yet do not find the majority of the stories that emotionally affecting. That’s how I felt with Love War Stories; I appreciated the themes though I didn’t find myself deeply drawn into the characters’ lives. Rodríguez’s writing flows well though, and I finished this book in about a day....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Oct 15, 2021","Oct 16, 2021","Jul 30, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37716187-love-war-stories

In terms of what I appreciated about Seven Days in June, I overall likedI loved the first 100 or so pages of this book and found the rest of it okay. In terms of what I appreciated about Seven Days in June, I overall liked its campiness, humor, and pop culture references – especially in the first 100 pages I laughed to myself and aloud at some of the witty one-liners. Tia Williams writes about important topics in a sensitive way, such as a main character who deals with chronic pain as well as contends with an industry that wants to whiten her characters for marketability. As one of my bffs Bri often says, it’s important for Black fiction and media to exist that isn’t just about Black people suffering from enslavement, police brutality, and other racist societal horrors. In Seven Days in June, Williams accomplishes this through writing a fun romance featuring two Black authors who pull apart and come together, despite some personal baggage and difficult extenuating circumstances.I give this book three stars mainly because I found the romance between the main characters, Eva and Shane, a bit exaggerated and lacking real emotional depth. While Williams’ writing felt tight while still funny in the first 100 pages of the book, I felt that the purple prose got turned up a lot when Shane came into the picture. The intensity of their emotions for one another and their communication style came across as forced to me. I’m unsure how much of that forcedness is a product of the book’s genre clashing with my personal preference.Overall an okay book!

Jesse Thistle writes abAn immediate and important memoir from a Métis man who experienced homelessness and addiction after his parents abandoned him. Jesse Thistle writes about how even though he and his brothers eventually went on to live with his grandparents, their shelter and care did not prevent his later suffering. He ends the memoir on a note of hope about how he reclaimed his Indigenous heritage and set himself on the path to healing and success.I loved the brutal vulnerability Thistle imbues in this memoir. He writes in great, vivid detail about his struggle with homelessness and his substance use disorder. At the same time, in a showing and not telling way, he portrays how intergenerational trauma, toxic masculinity, corporal punishment, and other oppressive forces contributed to the individual choices he made that exacerbated his physical and mental anguish. His journey to recovery at the end of the book felt both empowering and realistic, with little false sentimentality.I appreciate Thistle’s voice given the stigma surrounding homelessness and addiction. I hope that we can all take action to treat those suffering with compassion and to address the structural issues (e.g., anti-Indigenous racism, patriarchal gendered socialization of boys and men) that contribute to these dilemmas....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Oct 12, 2021","Oct 15, 2021","Jul 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43822761-from-the-ashes

While Ashley Ford provides an impactful outI found this memoir a courageous exploration of family trauma as well as the pain of growing up as a girl. While Ashley Ford provides an impactful outline of her feelings about her incarcerated father, she portrays with even greater depth and complexity her relationship with her mother, who often hurt and mistreated Ford during her childhood. Ford writes too about the unprompted, vile sexualization and sexual assault she experienced growing up, as well as the kindness of certain teachers and adults (e.g., her grandmother) who offered her some reprieve from the darker aspects of her youth. I loved the courage Ford displays by writing about her once-tumultuous relationship with her mother. I feel like we often glorify parenthood and child-parent relationships when a lot of parents hurt their kids. Thus, I applaud Ford for her sharing – with compelling scenes and dialogue – her experience with her mother as well as how her relationship with her mother developed over time. Ford’s writing about how adults and peers sexualized her without her consent felt painful and important to read about; I felt sad and angry on behalf of the young girl who wanted to trust people, only to face exploitation and fear in her relationships. I am glad that it appears Ford has cultivated a strong support network who loves her for who she is. Though I enjoyed this memoir, I wanted more reflection and synthesis from it. I felt like Ford wrote a lot about what happened to her growing up, yet I desired more information about how she processed those events later on, how they affected her future relationships and desires, or how she healed or did not heal from the circumstances she encountered. Perhaps Ford is still in the process of unpacking some of these dynamics which I totally respect.

The novel depicts the many terrors (e.g., torture, killing) that Israeli soldiers have inflicted upon Palestinians, and though it was difficult and at times nauseating to read, I felt appreciative to Susan Abulhawa for capturing these plights so that we as readers are forced to reckon with them (obviously, reading about these topics is not even close to the suffering of actually living them.) I’m also grateful that Abulhawa highlighted the full humanity of our Palestinian protagonists in this novel, their deep love for one another and their homeland as well as the trauma and anguish they’ve faced.This book was published in 2006 and it’s honestly so sickening – like actually makes me want to throw up – that the same horrible violence portrayed in this novel is happening right now.

In Tastes Like War, Grace Cho writes about her mother’s experience with schizophrenia through an in-depth sociocultural lens. One of my favorite parts of this memoir includes how Cho portrays her mother with such love and thoughtfulness. Her writing itself feels vivid and alive through how she captures both poignant and everyday scenes and situations with her mother. She utilizes language to destigmatize both schizophrenia and sex work. The running theme of food gave this memoir an enhanced emotional weight that made me tear up at the end. It’s clear to me that Cho has processed her relationship with her now deceased mother with much psychological acuity and strength.I also loved how Cho details how broader systems of oppression such as US imperialism in Korea contributed to her mother’s schizophrenia. She writes both about the gendered racism against Korean girls and women abroad as well as her and her mother’s experiences of racism and sexism growing up in a predominantly white town in Washington State. With great intelligence she captures how sociocultural factors can influence our individual psyches. I found some relief and satisfaction in how Cho turned to her academic work as well as baking and cooking to cultivate agency in understanding her mother’s life, the trials and tribulations she went through and what brought her joy.This memoir contains so many additional praiseworthy elements: Cho’s coming of age and how she formed empowering friendships with fellow marginalized folks during her undergraduate studies, the sensitivity to which she writes about multiple members of her family, and her seamless integration of historical events with her present day life. One of the best memoirs I have read in a while and one I would highly recommend to everyone. I feel happy to start off 2022 with Tastes Like War and I hope others read and enjoy it too.

The topics range from trying to date a girl before realizing his gayness, recovering from and desiring romantic love, and honoring his complex feelings about previous incidents of bullying and sexual assault. Though the topics may sound heavy, Brammer’s voice strikes the ideal balance of more informal relatability while still providing poignant emotional insight.While I overall enjoyed this essay collection, I most loved the columns/essays in which Brammer detailed a more complete story. He does an excellent job of detailing past situations in his life – working a part-time job at a Mexican restaurant to try to connect with his ethnic heritage, coming out to a romantic flame in a Walmart parking lot, idealizing a potential relationship before realizing its actual quality, and more – with specific details and emotional honesty. When reading several of these essays, I felt like I was observing a younger version of Brammer doing his best amidst a heteronormative and homophobic society. He’s real about his feelings too, even the uncomfortable ones like unreciprocated yearning and not-completely-resolved anguish about merely being alive. His candor and self-awareness highlight the work he’s done on himself before or during writing these essays.Two specific aspects of Brammer’s voice I liked included his humor and his ability to reach acceptance. I laughed out loud more than a handful of times reading Hola Papi. I appreciated though his humor sometimes included self-deprecation, it never felt like he wanted us as readers to reassure him. In terms of acceptance, I felt so impressed by several of the essays in the middle of the collection, like “How to Kiss Your Girlfriend,” “How to be a Real Mexican,” “How to Come Out to Your Boyfriend in a Walmart Parking Lot,” and “How to Fall in and Out of Love” for both the difficulty of the emotions he experienced and how he grew from them. Getting to a place of acceptance isn’t easy and often requires self-work and self-insight, which Brammer demonstrated a lot of in these essays. Again, the specific details he includes such as sensory images and specific emotions and thoughts helped these essays feel real, like stories from his life instead of didactic, rote lessons he’s learned.I give this book four stars instead of five because I wanted a bit deeper introspection from Brammer in a few places throughout the collection. For example, in “How to Lose a Rabbit,” he writes about his harrowing experience of getting bullied in middle school, and toward the end of the essay he mentions that this cruelty affected his self-esteem, though he’s taken steps to address its effects. I wanted more specificity: in what ways did it affect his self-esteem and how did he work through those impacts? Another example: in one of the first few essays, he mentions a reader who asked him if, as a white man, it was problematic that he’s primarily dated Latinx men. Brammer responded with something along the lines of like, we don’t need your affirmative action, you loved them for them and they loved you for you, which, while the first part of that response checks out, the latter part I feel like reflected a lack of deeper interrogation of fetishization, internalized racism and colorism from queer men of color, and more. In general, I wanted more specificity and precision from the last set of the essays in this collection.That said, I still had a great time reading Hola Papi and it’s one of the most well-written essay collections I’ve read in a while. Brammer’s warm, humorous, and reflective voice stands out in a good way. I hope we can continue getting books of similar quality from queer authors of color....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Aug 26, 2021","Aug 27, 2021","Jun 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711622-hola-papi

I liked the honesty in which they portrayed the racism and transphobia they experienced at various parts of their literary career. They write with much candor too about the power of gender-affirming surgery and using resources such as therapy and medication for their mental health. Despite, or in part because of their struggles, they articulate a powerful vision for themselves and their work that seems to rarely falter.I give this book three stars for a couple of reasons. First, I felt extremely confused about Emezi’s relationships throughout the book. While I thought the experimental style worked for writing about their health, literary career, and self-confidence, I wanted to actually understand more clearly about how various of their relationships played out and why certain ruptures or connections occurred. Second, I had conflicting feelings about Emezi’s consistent buying into award culture. While they do reflect a bit about their desire for awards later in the book, I wanted more deconstruction about how awards can function as gate-keeping (e.g., an elite group of folks gets to decide who can prosper) and as a mechanism to ensure only some art and artists can persist in a hyper-competitive market. Overall, an okay memoir that I can see has resonated with many folks....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"May 05, 2022","May 06, 2022","Jun 12, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/56377216-dear-senthuran

She writes with intelligence and controlled passion about how forces such as sexism, racism, and homophobia affect our bodies on both an internal and external level. Despite these strengths, I found this book lacking in focus and therefore I felt myself distanced from it on an emotional level. Laing’s subjects span key figures in psychoanalysis such as Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich, civil rights activists including Nina Simone and Malcolm X, as well as today’s environmental protestors, though the connections between all these groups felt tenuous aside from the broader political themes that affected their lives. I felt a bit more compelled by Laing’s nuggets of self-disclosure throughout the book, and I wondered whether including more of herself would have helped me connect with the book more.

Nancy Wang Yuen details tSuch a well-written work of nonfiction about the racism that Hollywood actors face and what we can do to combat that racism. Nancy Wang Yuen details the many ways racism manifests in Hollywood, including but not limited to: the erasure of stories centered on people of color, how actors of color get pressured into playing stereotypical and demeaning portrayals of people of color, and the sexualization and fetishization of women of color in the industry specifically. I loved how Yuen names racism and does not shy away from labeling it as such. Furthermore, she writes in an accessible way, allowing us to understand and empathize with people of color while still appreciating the rigor of her academic analysis. Though I wasn’t surprised by these actors’ experiences, I did feel so angry at the dehumanizing racism they faced and the cluelessness, apathy, and lack of self-awareness that white people in power demonstrated again and again. These actors want to create quality art and seeing their hopes and ambitions diminished felt so freaking unjust, all the more reason I feel grateful to Yuen for writing this book. I liked too how Yuen writes about the ways in which actors of color resist racism. She also details specific strategies people outside of Hollywood can take to address this issue, like supporting the art of people of color and explicitly calling out racist tropes in media through social media, boycotts, petitions, and other methods. I felt grateful for these sections because we should all take action to support and empower actors of color. We also should interrogate the overwhelming whiteness present in our media instead of passively absorbing it. On a side note, I play tennis somewhat frequently with this queer white man (oops lol if he somehow stumbles upon this ) and at one point he told me about how he’s into fit white guys because that’s the ideal promoted in magazines and such. He literally said he felt like it’s “too late” to change the type of guy he’s attracted to. I felt so annoyed because like, even if that is the ideal promoted in magazines and related media, you can literally take action to address that?? Consume more diverse media?? Interrogate your own Eurocentric and fatphobic desires?? Stop injecting my life with mediocre passivity in the face of white supremacy?? Anyway, I share this somewhat random anecdote to emphasize the importance of Yuen providing tangible actions we can take to fight the issue of racism in Hollywood, as that provides readers with a felt sense of agency and tools to enact agency.This book came out in late 2016 so it may feel a bit dated given some recent prominent examples of films and TV shows centering people of color. However, racism in the industry is still an issue as evidenced by the cast of Kim’s Convenience speaking out about anti-Asian racism they faced. My one primary constructive critique of this book centers on Yuen’s suggestion that white writers should take more initiative to write stories about people of color. While I get the intention of that suggestion, to provide roles for actors of color, I feel like we should advocate more for writers and executives of color to tell those stories and supply those roles for actors of color (see Myriam Gurba's great takedown of American Dirt for the literary version of this take.) Still, I’d recommend this book, and it encourages me to continue prioritizing media centering people of color, produced by people of color....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Jul 30, 2021","Aug 02, 2021","May 22, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29937135-reel-inequality

I found Julia’s character the most compelling part of the novel. I loved how Erika Sánchez wrote her – a teenage MI ended up enjoying this one a lot! I found Julia’s character the most compelling part of the novel. I loved how Erika Sánchez wrote her – a teenage Mexican American girl who’s bold, independent, and a bit judgmental and someone who grows throughout the course of the novel. At the beginning of the novel, we learn that Julia’s older sister died in a car accident and that Julia’s mother always preferred her older sister’s obedience to Julia’s headstrongness. Sánchez’s characterization of Julia remains skillfully consistent throughout the novel, ranging from how the depth of Julia’s emotions and her love of writing as well as how she calls people out like a homophobic church member. At the same time, we see Julia grow into someone who takes care of her mental health, understands her family history more, and feels more set on her path to achieve her dreams. She felt three-dimensional and by the end of the novel I felt myself really rooting for her and her dreams. Also, Sánchez portrayed therapy and taking medication so well in this novel and as both a therapist and a recipient of therapy myself I loved that. We need more portrayals of youth of color benefitting from therapy and help-seeking behaviors.Sánchez also wrote about intergenerational trauma, gender norms, and grief and loss in meaningful and honest ways. I loved growing alongside Julia in her understanding of these topics and how they affect her life. Sánchez portrays these issues in nuanced ways. Instead of Julia receiving a neat ending in relation to her family’s trauma or grief, she develops more self-compassion and self-understanding that empowers her to keep going even without a clean resolution. Sánchez’s rendition of these issues helped the novel feel both lifelike and hopeful, a powerful combination.The book did at times feel a tad overwritten, especially in the first half. I felt in a way that Sánchez tried so hard to depict Julia’s assertive and brash personality that it pulled me out of the novel because I kept thinking about Sánchez’s efforts to characterize Julia instead of just vibing with her character and the book. However, this issue felt much less noticeable to me in the middle of the book and toward the end when I got more immersed in the plot and Julia’s ongoing drama and growth. Overall, I would recommend this novel to those interested in realistic young-adult fiction!...more",Notes are private!,2,84,1,"Jun 19, 2021","Jun 22, 2021","May 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29010395-i-am-not-your-perfect-mexican-daughter

I loved the visceral quality of BA well-written memoir about growing up as a gay Black boy in Ohio and then as a young gay Black man in Pennsylvania. I loved the visceral quality of Brian Broome’s writing especially in the first half of the book – his feelings of longing, shame, and confusion came alive through his use of descriptive yet tight prose. A lot of his story centers on the femmephobic and homophobic abuse and bullying he experienced by members of his family and his peer group. I’m not sure how anyone could read this memoir without walking away with the message that we need to destroy toxic masculinity and white supremacy and embrace our children and one another for who we are.I wanted a couple elements of Broome’s internalized bigotry unpacked more. First, he writes quite a bit about how he found white men particularly attractive. He states this preference several times though I wish he had unpacked it more explicitly – what specific channels did he learn this from, so that we can target those and dismantle them? Later on in the memoir he writes a bit about unlearning this racialized preference, though I wanted to read more about that process, especially because he still comments on certain white men’s pale skin and blue eyes as particularly attractive which made me go uh??? This concern of mine relates to a later scene in which he shares some of his ageist views about older queer men he sees at a bar/club, where an older man calls him out on his ageism. While Broome writes the scene in a way that implies that he recognizes his ageism as problematic, I wanted a more thorough investigation of that internalized oppression. On a note unrelated to the internalized bigotry, I also found the part later in the memoir where he transitioned to writing from the perspective of his mother a bit jarring.Despite some of my criticisms I would still recommend this memoir to those interested in its synopsis! I feel so happy that Broome continues to write and express himself in such poetic ways especially given all the messages he received growing up to be tough, stoic, and unfeeling....more",Notes are private!,0,66,1,"Jul 02, 2022","Jul 04, 2022","May 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53968494-punch-me-up-to-the-gods

I hope that this book helps folks dive deeper into understanding contentious elements of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like the conflation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism, the ability for a group of individuals to both be oppressed and to oppress others, and the disturbing silencing of pro-Palestine views from right-wing conservatives who persist in their bigotry and complicity in ethnic cleansing.

In thiOne of the most intelligent books I have read in a while, I so appreciated Orna Donath’s forward feminist perspective in Regretting Motherhood. In this book, she presents a sociological study she conducted in which she interviewed several women who regretted their decision to become mothers. I loved how, through both analysis of these interviews and analysis of trends in society at large, Donath generates so much spot-on feminist commentary: about how motherhood is glorified for women and seen as their inevitable destination, the many pressures that can push women into motherhood even if they do not want it, and how women in romantic relationships with men often bear the brunt of parenthood’s responsibilities. Donath writes with great rigor and incision about the stigmatization of the regret itself, an emotion that many of us feel about many things, which becomes taboo in relation to motherhood. For example, here’s a quote toward the end of the book that showcases her writing quality:“Thus, if we see motherhood as impervious to regret – even though regret may accompany all types of human relationships and decisions that we make – then we are not taking into account how feeling rules and culturally acceptable ideas about time are used to sustain social orders that are of most benefit to those who already have power in society – at the expense of many others. When people don’t believe that regretting motherhood exists, or when they feel rage about it, what they’re saying is that it is dangerous for society when women look back and evaluate the transition to motherhood as not worthwhile. This should not come as a surprise, because women in general and mothers in particular are required over and over again, under a wide range of circumstances, to put themselves aside, to forget.”I most loved how this book acts as a path forward so that women can live authentic, autonomous lives, whether those lives do not include children or they do. As a more femme queer person myself, I have felt the pressure to “prove” my nurturance by believing and/or stating that I want kids, when in reality there are so many things in this world (e.g., friendships, community members, the world itself, etc.) that would benefit from nurturance outside of or in addition to kids. Donath shows through these interviews that the majority of these women do care for their children and do not begrudge their children as much as the experience of motherhood itself. Through her smart and sensitive writing, Donath eases the stigma surrounding these women’s experiences of regretting motherhood and invites us to adopt a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of how this regret may emerge and what it can tell us about the need to change society’s restrictive views toward motherhood. Another quote from the book that I enjoyed a lot:“If we realize that part of being a subject is to make calculations and weigh one’s options about what is valuable and worthwhile for one’s own life, then we can understand the wider meanings of the social expectations that mothers will not weigh their options and make evaluations regarding their motherhood. In other words, the social reaction to regret as a horrifying rationality demonstrates how mothers are deprived of their right to stay connected to their own understandings and, experiences and the intimate relationships in which they are involved. They cannot even pause for a minute to assess the state of their motherhood and their own lives, because it is too frightening to society – which depends upon mothers as objects who exist for the sake of others –when they do not stay put as such.”Overall, would recommend this book to those interested in feminism, sociology, or related topics. Donath notes that the demands of motherhood are often higher for women marginalized by more than one force of oppression, such as but not limited to racism or poverty. I appreciate her so much for her passion for advocating for women to have access to all the options – all of them, no motherhood or motherhood – that may make their lives worthwhile and fulfilling....more",Notes are private!,0,162,1,"Oct 19, 2021","Oct 22, 2021","May 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32302223-regretting-motherhood

Richard Delgado and Jean SteA thorough yet concise introduction to critical race theory that I would recommend to those interested in its principles. Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic write about the main tenets of critical race theory such as that white supremacy exists and that law and legal structures perpetuate it, as well as that racial justice is achievable by transforming the relationship between law and racial power. Additional themes include the importance of intersectionality, the role of storytelling and counter storytelling in resisting white supremacy, critiques of liberalism and incrementalism as opposed to more radical methods of change, and more. I appreciated how they name critiques of critical race theory and respond to them. I also enjoyed the applications of critical race theory to issues such as environmental racism, poverty and class, and colonialism.At times I wanted the authors to take more of a firm stance about the necessity of critical race theory or to make a more robust application of how it can help fight social inequities. However, I recognize the book came out awhile ago so I think people have applied its principles to fight white supremacy, and perhaps that’s our role of readers to see how we can manifest these ideas into our daily lives and actions. I look forward to continue to applying these ideas in my psychology work!...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"May 06, 2021","May 08, 2021","May 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/344649.Critical_Race_Theory_An_Introduction

Invisible by Daniel Aleman tells the heartbreaking story of Mateo Garcia, a sixteen-year-old who’s world gets shaken when ICE agents arrest his parents one day after he comes home from school. Mateo adopts the responsibility of caring for his younger sister, Sophie, and tries his best to stay afloat with schoolwork and friendships, all while anticipating whether his parents will get deported from the United States. Though Mateo has some support from his uncle Jorge and his wife Amy, as well as his friends Kimmie and Adam, he still must confront the challenge of his parents’ nebulous futures as well as what his own life may look like without them.Aleman does an excellent job of portraying the effects of deportation and the resulting parental separation on Latinx youth. My heart ached and my eyes teared up reading about Mateo and Sophie’s struggles during the whole process. Aleman doesn’t sugarcoat the siblings’ pain which helped Indivisible feel emotionally significant and authentic. He also writes so well about the deep love between Mateo, Sophie, and their parents, giving their relationships real weight in contrast with media representations that often dehumanize undocumented immigrants. I also enjoyed the diversity within Indivisible, in particular how Mateo and Adam are both gay without their sexualities being the main point of the novel, the romance between Kimmie and Darryl, an Asian and a Black side character, and the depth of Mateo and Kimmie’s friendship. My only constructive critique of the novel was relationship between Mateo and Adam. I felt that Aleman introduced such a riveting, painful conflict in terms of Mateo recognizing how Kimmie and Adam are much more privileged than he is due to their and their families’ documented status. However, I felt that the resolution of that conflict, especially in the relationship between Mateo and Adam, came across as a bit simplistic and tied up in the mores of romance. Now more than ever I wonder how many YA authors feel compelled to include a romance in their books just to play the amatonormative market. Still, I enjoyed this strong debut novel and feel hopeful in its ability to evoke empathy in readers in regard to issues of xenophobia and immigration....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"May 26, 2021","May 28, 2021","May 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55425722-indivisible

I think her realness about her family’s conflicts gives her writing about her grief an additional layer of nuance that ups the emotional impact of this memoir overall. At the same time, I liked the clear love she and her mom had for one another, often shared through food, that emerged as a salient theme in Crying in H Mart even with the fights they had. I did walk away from this memoir feeling a tad disappointed. First, I felt like the reliance of the motif of food undercut some of the emotional and relational depth Zauner could have explored further, such as how she processed her grief after her mother died and how it affected her relationship with her father. More specifically, I wanted more self-exploration and interrogation of race. Zauner mentions aspiring toward whiteness in a critical way one or two times in Crying in H Mart, though she doesn’t unpack this sentiment thoroughly. This lack of analysis – especially given the conflictual relationship between her mother and father – felt odd to me, as well as her use of the word “Caucasian” a couple of times instead of white (given that Caucasian is a racist term). One instance I found particularly uncomfortable was when Zauner, a biracial (Korean and white) woman, refers to her white boyfriend as “out of my league” and “objectively more attractive” than herself, which I was like?? What measure of objectivity are we using here?? It reminded me of many instances I’ve observed of Asian Americans idolizing whiteness without a second thought.Overall an alright memoir. If this memoir’s topic sounds interesting to you, I’d definitely recommend Tastes Like War by Grace Cho, which felt even more rigorous and emotionally rich to me....more",Notes are private!,4,179,1,"Apr 21, 2022","Apr 22, 2022","Apr 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54814676-crying-in-h-mart

When I finished part three of To Paradise 30 minutes agoHanya Yanagihara, queen of writing controversial as f*ck books and also of breaking my heart. When I finished part three of To Paradise 30 minutes ago I literally lied down on the floor of my apartment and stared at the ceiling because I felt so, so amazed by this section of the book. While I found the quality of Yanagihara’s prose incredible throughout all the book’s sections, unfortunately other aspects of part one and part two either fell flat or outright offended me. To assign a rating of each section of To Paradise, I’m thinking: part one: 3 stars, part two: 1 star, part three: 5 stars. I’ll give my reaction to each section below followed by overall thoughts on what I’m confident will be a provocative novel for almost all who read it. Part one takes place in 1893 America, New York, in an alternate world where gay and lesbian folks are free to love whomever they want, at least on the surface. We follow a wealthy man from a distinguished family resist a suitor of comparable means for a charming and impoverished music teacher. I found this section entertaining and frustrating. I felt the alternative, gay and lesbian-friendly society fascinating to explore and Yanagihara’s writing mesmerizing. However, the characterization of our protagonist, David, annoyed the heck out of me. While Yanagihara writes so well that I did feel some basic sympathy for him, he overall baffled me with his passivity, lack of agency, and inability to find any self-worth without the love of a romantic partner. My main reaction after finishing this section: “okay that was pleasant but what was the point of this.”Part two takes place in 1993 Manhattan besieged by the AIDS pandemic. I’ll be frank: I hated this section of the novel. I almost never give 1 star ratings to books on Goodreads, however if this section of the novel stood on its own I’d give it 1 star without hesitation. The plot follows a young Hawaiian man in a romantic relationship with a rich older white man, and Yanagihara’s construction of their relationship offended me so much. I’m not Hawaiian, so I definitely want to respect actual queer Hawaiian folks’ perspective on this part of the book, though as a queer Vietnamese American man, I felt that she brought to life the worst stereotypes about queer Asian and Pacific Islander men in this section (e.g., we’re passive and submissive, we’re obsessed with white gay men, etc.) Our protagonist in part two is also named David and he turns his back both on his Hawaiian heritage and his female best friend Eden, an Asian woman, for a rich white man who works at the same office as him, for what?? She also includes fatphobic language and an anti-Black description of a Black character in ways that weren’t addressed at all and felt unnecessary. While this section includes some somewhat intriguing reflections on colonization, these themes did not amount to anything substantial enough to merit the oppressive parts. My main reaction after finishing this section: “well that was awful, at least she gave us A Little Life I guess, there’s no way I’m going to give To Paradise more than 2 stars after this mess.”Part three takes place in 2093 in a world overrun by plagues and governed by totalitarian rule. We witness a renowned scientist’s granddaughter try to navigate life without him, in a society with strict rules about what you can say, think, and feel. This section of To Paradise riveted me, stunned me, and reminded me that Yanagihara is truly the same writer who wrote the tour de force A Little Life. So many amazing elements came together to create magic: this on-the-edge-of-your-seat, I-need-to-turn-the-pages-faster dystopian thriller sense of concern about the granddaughter’s life and wellbeing, the flashbackwards and flashforwards that describe in such rich quality both her life and her grandfather’s life, and the immense love that her grandfather feels for her coupled with his own complicity in oppression and wrongdoing. The epistolary element within this section, in which the grandfather writes to a beloved friend living abroad, worked so freaking well and cemented my love for how Yanagihara cares for and writes about friendship. My main reaction after finishing this section: “I’m going to go lie down on the floor to recover from what just happened to me, also if not for part two I’d give this book four stars as a whole.” As you can tell from this already 740-word long , this book elicited so many strong emotions from me. I’m pretty sure Yanagihara can evoke these feelings from me and other readers in large part because of the sheer quality of her prose. She has this way of making you connect so deeply with characters’ feelings and thoughts, such as through noticing the smallest yet most important details about how they interact or speak with other characters, as well as how they feel about themselves. She possesses at top-notch talent for crafting impeccably precise and impeccable sentences that either entrance you to read more or knock the wind out of you (reading the last pages of part three I actually felt like someone had punched me in the stomach in a great way.) There’s a lot of wild stuff that happens in To Paradise, like a reenvisioning of American history and a future envisioning of the world where we’re struck by plague after plague. At the same time she’s still able to center the narrative on the highs and lows of human emotion and relationships: connection and friendship and sex, disconnection and loneliness and death, and how our pasts and systems of power like class and race inextricably affect us.A lot of books I give 3 stars because I felt that they were fine, like enjoyable though not that riveting or exciting. I give To Paradise 3 stars because I feel so divided by it, like I both loved it and hated it. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the book, though I also wouldn’t not recommend the book. I loved Yanagihara’s A Little Life because of how Yanagihara captured what it’s like to live with PTSD and to experience both negative and positive relationships. I felt like parts one and two of To Paradise portrayed more of the negative aspects of relationships without much for readers to grab onto and root for, like the characters and their relationships either came across as passive or problematic. However, part three of this book highlighted to me the power and force of human yearning and affection, how these elements of our psyche can do both great harm and great good. As I’m processing while writing this  though, I almost wonder if the structure of this novel represents how maybe sometimes it takes multiple generations of life to pass before someone is able to or at least tries to be able to break cycles of pain and/or trauma. I felt Yanagihara’s repetition of character names effective in proving how emotions of loneliness, longing, and connection persist again and again throughout multiple iterations of the human experience. I do feel like part three built on the momentum of parts one and two and provided richer depth into the burgeoning themes of isolation and interconnection.I’m gonna go work out so I can restore my body’s sense of equilibrium after this whop of a novel, lol. I’m so curious to read what others think of this one, especially because I’ve felt so appreciative of folks’ responses to my  of A Little Life. Also, I know Yanagihara has received criticism about writing so much from gay men’s perspectives from someone who is not a gay man. While I generally agree with these critiques, I won’t write more about it here because this  is already so long. However, for an #ownvoices queer male of color perspective, I’d also highly recommend the superb novel Tell Me How to Be by Neel Patel which came out late in 2021!...more",Notes are private!,1,287,1,"Jan 11, 2022","Jan 15, 2022","Apr 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57739876-to-paradise

I apAn interesting book that does a nice job of exploring the financial side of art and how the behaviors of big tech companies disadvantage artists. I appreciated how William Deresiewicz writes with depth about the relationship between art and money, including how folks often do not like associating the two even though they are bound up with one another. He includes several interviews which provide a more human quality to his argument; it felt humbling and real to read about artists from several different genres/mediums (e.g., writers, filmmakers, musicians) talk about their journeys. The book is necessarily bleak in terms of how artists are struggling financially – which I’ve read some articles about how it’s gotten way worse during COVID too, ugh – and how big tech exploits artists while underpaying them. Deresiewicz provides reasonable action steps such as limiting the control that big tech and billionaires have on artists and implementing policies to protect and restore the middle class.I have a couple of constructive critiques I wanted to raise about this book in relation to its interviewing methods and its lack of discussion about race, racism, and related topics. First, while I appreciated the inclusion of interviews, I felt confused about Deresiewicz’s selection method for his interviewees. How did he choose who to reach out to and how did he choose whose narratives would be shared in the final manuscript? While I recall reading the journey of one Black artist, the majority of interviewees appeared to be white, which should have at least been noted as a limitation. I would’ve appreciated a little more discussion on how tech has either expanded access to art for people of color or further marginalized them. Also, at one point Deresiewicz makes the comment that women and people of color were, and “may be” still underrepresented in the arts (I think he was referring to writing/books.) I found this statement egregious in its naivete given that a quick Google search would have revealed several articles, narratives, and statistics about the racism experienced by people of color in the publishing industry, such as this article that focuses on Black folks’ experience. Overall, a good book that I’d recommend for those who are interested in art and how capitalism affects artists’ experiences, as long as you take into account the above caveats. Reading this book helped me feel more secure in my blog and to understand more of what I can do to support artists, which I feel grateful for....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Apr 11, 2021","Apr 19, 2021","Apr 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55410744-the-death-of-the-artist

I appreciated the authoA great book about the role of relationships in psychological healing, with a focus on the therapy relationship in particular. I appreciated the authors’ main focus: that instead of the more androcentric notion that we all need to individualize and achieve professionally, we can grow in mutually empathetic and live-giving relationships. Jean Baker Miller and Irene Stiver write about specific benefits of connection as well as the consequences of disconnection, especially repeated disconnection that may have occurred in one’s family growing up. They write about how therapists can use immediacy within the therapy relationship to address and help the client heal from these disconnections. The main strength of this book centers on its message that our culture should unlearn its misogynistic devaluing of relationships so that we can all reap the benefits of healthy connection.As another er on Goodreads noted, I wish the book had gone more into how we can build a healthy relationship with ourselves. With its publication in 1998 I think it falls a bit into the gender essentialist trope that relationships are solely women’s strength. While I do think being relationally-oriented is beautiful and empowering in our more Western, individually-focused culture, I also feel that ignoring women’s (and more feminine folks, nonbinary folks, and everyone’s really) capacity to be self-sufficient and fulfilled in relationships at the same time may motivate people to settle into mediocre relationships just to be in relationship with someone. I would thus recommend supplementing this book with Jessica Fern’s Polysecure which contains more content about relating with others as well as oneself, as well as Myrna Weissman’s The Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy for more specific problem areas and concepts within interpersonal therapy....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"May 09, 2021","May 15, 2021","Apr 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/684466.The_Healing_Connection

I felt like Anthony Veasna So wrote with great authenticity about how intergenerational trauma affects Cambodian Americans. He shows how additional forces such as capitalism and classism, as well as masculinity and toxic masculinity, draw boundaries around some of his characters’ ambitions and hopes, especially his male characters. At the same time, So portrays the tight-knit connection, support, and collective understanding that Cambodian Americans utilize to uplift one another. Even though they may express love in imperfect ways, their desire to see and to be seen by one another shines through.Roxane Gay used the word “disaffected” in her  of this book which resonated with me. While I think Afterparties acts as a valuable contribution to the literary world, I felt that So’s writing style kept me at a distance from his characters. I cared about their experiences and their struggles against oppression, though I found So’s prose “cool” in a slightly disaffected/indifferent way.Shout out to the story “Human Development” for featuring a Southeast Asian man who explicitly says he does not want his rectum colonized by a white gay! I loved that part. Also appreciated the story for featuring a hot threesome between three queer Southeast Asian men – where else have you seen that in fiction? Unfortunately I found the main character a bit unsufferable/unself-aware. Anyway, Anthony Veasna So passed away too soon.

Dorothy Brown writes with keen intelligence about the insidious racism in the tax system and financial structure of the United States, including but not limited to the lack of value ascribed to homes in Black neighborhoods, how the GI Bill and land grants denied awards to Black Americans, and how marriage benefits are designed to help out white married couples over Black married couples. She also writes about how wealth inequality affects Black Americans’ educational attainment and debt accumulation. She uses in-depth research to back up her points. I suspect what many people may appreciate about The Whiteness of Wealth is Brown’s inclusion of tangible action steps to ameliorate these issues, such as reparations, giving people wealth-based credits if race-based reparations are too radical for folks, and white people owning up to their privilege instead of minimizing or denying it. I learned a lot from this book and would recommend it to those who want to learn more about how financial structures in the United States disadvantage Black Americans.

In The Land of Big Numbers, Te-Ping Chen writes about the lives and relationships of people living in both modern-day China as well as Chinese people living in the United States. She weaves narratives about people’s hopes and dreams, both for their own lives and their relationships with others, amidst larger systems of economic inequity and state control. I most loved the first short story “Lulu,” about two twins who take widely diverging paths, our narrator pursuing a career as a professional gamer whereas his sister becomes a political dissident. My second favorite short story in the collection was “Hotline Girl,” about a woman who works at a government call center and is followed by her violent ex-boyfriend. I felt so connected to the characters in these stories and enjoyed how Chen elicited a lot of emotions from me (e.g., poignancy at how the twins’ relationship develops over time in “Lulu,” nostalgic hope about our protagonist’s safety in “Hotline Girl”) in subtle and unassuming prose. These stories feel grounded both in characters with unique life experiences and personalities as well as in the consequences of broadening globalization both in China and abroad.Other stories I liked included “Field Notes on a Marriage,” “Land of Big Numbers,” and “Gubeikou Spirit.” While I wanted a bit more either voice-wise or plot-wise from the remaining stories, I think Te-Ping Chen is a talented writer and interwove some magical realist elements in some of these stories, which I usually find off-putting or distracting yet worked in this collection....more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,"May 02, 2021","May 06, 2021","Mar 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52782536-land-of-big-numbers

Vincent Bevins does a great job of explaining how the United States contributed to the horrific mass murder of hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia as well as further violence due to anti-communist panic/propaganda in countries such as Brazil, Guatemala, Iraq, and more. It felt saddening and angering to read about how anti-communist sentence has been utilized as a smokescreen to mask U.S. imperialism and how this corruption has impacted so many people globally. I recommend this book for people who want to learn more about the complicity of the U.S. in violence across the world, which we often minimize in our standard education system.I only give this book three stars because the writing felt like a bit of a drag to get through at times. This feeling may stem from a preference mismatch, as I often prefer fiction about interpersonal relationships or memoir over nonfiction that details a lot of historical facts. I just felt a bit bored – even though the contents of the book are anything but boring – and wanted more centering of the personal narratives. Bevins kind of names his white male privilege in being able to write this book, though could have concisely unpacked this further and named tangible action steps to dismantle the system that granted him this privilege....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Aug 15, 2021","Aug 24, 2021","Mar 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53054943-the-jakarta-method

Choi’s first novel Emergency Contact; I love seeing authors grow in this way! In Yolk,4.5 starsI found Yolk an immense improvement over Mary H.K. Choi’s first novel Emergency Contact; I love seeing authors grow in this way! In Yolk, we follow Jayne Baek, a twenty-year-old Korean American woman living in New York with a leech-like deadbeat boyfriend, an illegal housing situation, and an eating disorder that dovetails with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Jayne’s life gets shaken up even more when she learns about her economically and educationally successful older sister June’s uterine cancer diagnosis. June and Jayne launch into one another’s orbit and longstanding conflicts, as well as buried conversations, start to surface for the both of them. I loved how Choi portrayed these two Korean American sisters with such strong and vibrant personalities, flaws and all. I feel like Asian American women are often reduced into being shy, submissive, and academic or exotified in fetishizing sexual ways in US media. However, both Jayne and June come across loud and clear though in nicely distinct ways: Jayne is neurotic and insecure and a bit image-obsessed whereas June is brash, nerdy, and unafraid to trash talk anyone who gets in her way. Both characters have unlikeable qualities that make them human, and at the same time they both grow toward the end of the novel, especially Jayne. I liked the complexity of both their individual characterizations and their relationship with one another, as well as how June’s struggle with uterine cancer mirrored Jayne’s fight with her eating disorder. Also, can we please talk about how freaking swoon worthy Patrick was? As basic as this sounds, I literally felt blessed by Patrick’s presence in this novel. As a gay man/nonbinary person I generally don’t care too much for heterosexual romance, however I found myself totally immersed in all of Jayne and Patrick’s interactions with one another. Their flirting and coyness and chemistry felt palpable, fun, and attractive. It’s so unfortunately rare to discover a male Asian American character like Patrick who’s cool, confident, kind, hot, and communicative, given the way that Asian American men are often ignored and overshadowed by white men. At the same time, Patrick names some of his own insecurities and messy relationship history too so he's not an unrealistically perfect person. Ugh, thank you Mary H.K. Choi for renewing my hope in men for another 48 hours with Patrick’s inclusion in this novel.Beyond Jayne’s relationship with June and her relationship with Patrick, Choi tackles nuanced topics such as Jayne’s mother’s complex relationship with motherhood itself as well as Jayne’s eating disorder. Choi developed both of these storylines in the novel well and I connected a lot to the way Jayne used disordered eating as a way to cultivate control, as someone who used to have an eating disorder myself. I felt that Choi wielded Jayne and June’s mother well as a way to explore the intricacies of Asian/Asian American motherhood, immigration and acculturative stress, and gender in Asian/Korean American families. The way all these different threads came together in the last 10% of the novel or so felt amazing – the ending of Yolk made me go back and forth about whether to round up to five stars for several hours.I have two minor constructive critiques of this novel. First, I slightly wish that Choi had included more of Jayne and June’s backstory from the beginning to the end of the novel, as I felt that she spliced in more of their backstory toward the middle and end. I wish that because at times I felt confused about why Jayne and June disliked each other so much and communicated in such hurtful ways. It seems that other ers appreciated this dynamic, as did I, though I think that inserting some of the flashbacks earlier in the novel would have helped. Second, I wish Choi had dedicated even a couple more sentences to interrogating Jayne’s pre-Patrick dating record with white guys. While I’m so happy Jayne eventually kicked her mediocre, problematic-as-heck white ex to the curb and leveled up with Patrick, Choi mentions multiple times that Jayne’s dating history pre-Patrick included a lot of white men. I feel like Asian Americans assimilating into whiteness/white supremacy through dating white people is an important topic, and while I don’t think Choi needed to dedicate a ton of space to this, a more active deconstruction would have been appreciated.Overall, a fantastic young-adult/new-adult novel I would recommend to fans of realistic fiction overall. Despite her occasionally shallow concerns I found myself relating to Jayne around certain neuroses, especially her feelings toward Patrick, which made me laugh while reading the book. Props to Choi for continuing to grow as a writer and yay 2021 for a superb showing of Asian American YA so far between this book and the splendid When We Were Infinite by Kelly Loy Gilbert....more",Notes are private!,0,124,1,"Jun 26, 2021","Jul 05, 2021","Mar 11, 2021",,,view (with text),/book/show/43562313-yolk

First, I found the writing engaging and the story overall entertaining. I wasn’t bored reading this book and I wanted to know what would happen next for Christie Tate as she navigated her mental health. I also like part of the vibe this book gives off in terms of the importance of vulnerability, going to therapy, and addressing our relational baggage. What I didn’t love was the poor representation of ethics within therapy and group therapy. The lack of confidentiality piece really annoyed me and off the top of my head I can’t imagine a situation where lack of confidentiality as a baseline would be appropriate for any therapeutic encounter. There were a few other instances of things that Dr. Rosen did that made me cringe, like one scene toward the end where he hugs the author and rocks her back and forth. I really don’t want people to think that the therapy portrayed in this book is the norm or what should be expected, even though again I think some of Tate’s takeaways about relationships were meaningful.I also thought the book was intensely heteronormative and amatonormative – and its impact dulled because of that – with little rigorous analysis of its own adherence to societal standards for women and femmes. Tate is obsessed with finding a male romantic partner throughout the book. And, that’s fine because that’s her lived experience, but the lack of self-awareness or commentary from her or anyone else in the book about this was puzzling and unsatisfying to me. Like instead of her being obsessed with men for the whole book let’s dive deeper into how that came to be in the first place?? Reading this made me miss one of my favorite mental health memoirs, Appetites by Caroline Knapp, which contained a lot more self-scrutiny and both intellectual and emotional depth.

My favorite stories in A visceral short story collection that focuses on the interior lives and interpersonal relationships of Black girls and women. My favorite stories in this collection, “Tongues” and “The Hearts of Our Enemies,” combined raw writing with developed character arcs. “Tongues” explores an older sister’s experience of misogyny in her church and broader community and how she tries to avenge herself while maintaining her relationship with her younger brother. “The Hearts of Our Enemies” captured a poignant, caring yet sometimes acerbic mother daughter dynamic and the extent to which a mother will go to protect her child even when their relationship feels strained. The intensity of the prose in these two stories felt well-matched with the ways the characters grew and asserted themselves in the face of male exploitation and misogyny.The other stories in this collection gave powerful first impressions yet did not impress me as much. The remaining stories definitely made strong statements – about childhood sexual abuse and sibling relationships, about the angst and allyship of teenage girls angry at the world, about the drought of emotions that accompany a disappointing marriage, and more. I didn’t feel the same depth in the characters in most of these stories though, which may have more to do with the inherent shortness of short stories themselves more than Dantiel Motiz’s sometimes impressionistic writing style.

In The Mirror Season, Anna-Marie McLemore writes about two young adults who were sexually assaulted at the same party (so big trigger warning for graphic depiction of sexual assault in the book as well as mentions of it in this ). Ciela, our protagonist, recalls the assault whereas Lock, the new boy at her high school, does not. The story follows Ciela as she befriends Lock and forms an intimate relationship with him, all while fighting off continued harassment from their shared rapists as well as feelings of guilt and anxiety from that one awful night. I appreciated McLemore’s emphasis on the importance of consent. I also felt that they did an excellent job of portraying the emotions that accompany a sexual assault: the self-doubt and self-gaslighting, the guilt and shame, the confusion and the sense of there being no control. McLemore includes spot-on commentary about race and colorism (e.g., brown girls get treated much worse than white girls), class, and the power of friendship. The ending of the novel feels hopeful without sugarcoating the pain that follows trauma. I just didn’t love the writing style in this book – it felt a bit heavy at times. A brief example includes when Celia has a conversation with her best friend Jess and McLemore writes “Jess sighs, like she’s summoning her patience.” I feel that McLemore could have just written “Jess sighs” to get the point across. These little additional phrases or descriptors that occurred throughout the book distracted me from the story and its characters.

The authors focus on four different “problem areas” that may affect clients: grief (death of a significant loved one), role dispute (struggle with a friend, family member, coworker, etc.), role transition (a life change like a graduation, divorce, a move, etc.) and interpersonal deficits (lack of attachments, social isolation, loneliness). They explain each of these four areas with great insight and with clear language, and they provide relevant case examples that apply the concepts. The latter half of the book s the research base for interpersonal therapy across different mental health issues (e.g., bulimia, bipolar disorder) as well as in different cultural contexts.My main critique of this book is that all the case examples do not mention race or sexual orientation of the client and how these social identities and related oppressions may affect clients. While I appreciate how the authors talk about culture in the latter half of the book, the lack of integration of intersectionality and multiculturalism in the case examples mitigated my enthusiasm for the book overall. Still, I feel hopeful that feminist and social justice-oriented practitioners can apply these concepts and examine how experiences of oppression, as well as radical joy in the face of oppression, can affect our clients’ interpersonal relationships as well as their relationships with themselves....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Feb 25, 2021","Mar 04, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35259274-the-guide-to-interpersonal-psychotherapy

I loved reading about her passion for working with kids and for taking action to fight the injustice of lead poisoning these children’s water. Her voice comes across as intelligent, clear, and humble yet not self-effacing. She details the steps she took to execute the science and then bring it to the policy level and the public eye. In particular, I appreciated how she named racism and greed as factors that contributed to the Flint Water Crisis in the first place. Her detailing of her own emotional journey through her advocacy process as well as her cultural history added a layer that elevated the book in addition to its more journalistic focus on how she pursued justice for the residents of Flint, Michigan.I think this book acts as a great testament to how we can all strive to contribute to equity and empowering marginalized communities in our daily lives. I primarily give the book four stars instead of five because I felt that Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s family history at the beginning of the book felt oddly integrated with the present-day events involving Flint, though these different parts of the narrative came together more smoothly toward the middle and end of the book. I also noticed a couple of instances in the book that seemed to promote the idealization of thinness, such as when she describes a (white) man as “seriously handsome” in relation to being “angular and chiseled,” as well as when she herself mentions that she took some small amount of enjoyment in losing weight when she experienced stress during her advocacy process.

Drs. Jennifer Lee aAn excellent book that unpacks common perceptions and stereotypes about Asian Americans’ educational success in the United States. Drs. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou use rich survey data and in-depth qualitative interviews with 1.5 and 2nd generation Chinese and Vietnamese adults to explore what sociological and psychological structures influence their academic achievement. I loved this book because it dispels the unnuanced assumption that Asian Americans are successful just because our culture values hard work. Drs. Lee and Zhou show how immigrant parents’ “success frame” influences their children’s achievement, in combination with Asian community resources such as college prep courses and tutoring, conversations with coethnic peers, and teachers and guidance counselors who stereotype Asian students as model minorities in the United States. The authors highlight the various negative consequences of the stereotype of Asian Americans as successful and hardworking, ranging from poor mental health in those who do not meet the success frame as well as Asian Americans being blocked from more senior leadership positions (i.e., the “bamboo ceiling.”)I further appreciated how the authors humanize immigrant Chinese and Vietnamese parents. Instead of falling into stereotypes about Asian parents being “tiger parents,” this book emphasizes how a lot of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant parents push their kids to achieve as an attempt to prevent their children from experiencing anti-Asian racism. They even write about how Asian parents who brag about their kids – often to their kids’ detriments – do so to compensate for the loss of status they experienced when they immigrated from their country of origin. Really, it’s just nice to read a complex yet accessibly written book that centers Asian Americans’ experiences given how we’re so often reduced to one-dimensional caricatures within the United States.There’s so much more I want to read and research and think about after having read this book too. I’m curious to know more about the mental health of 1.5 and 2nd generation Chinese and Vietnamese folks who pursue these “prestigious” careers and if they’re happy. I’m wondering about how much of this upward assimilation is really just buying into white supremacy and if we should really focus on disrupting exploitative economic practices and systems instead of gaining mobility within them. I’m also going to take a lot of time to reflect on how my own upbringing with the success frame has influenced my drive for excellence in my career as well as how in the past I’ve been attracted to men who went to prestigious universities even though these men simultaneously did not have their emotional and internal lives together at all. I don’t blame the authors for keeping their book more focused on their specific research questions because including too much more would have reduced the precision of their analysis. Would highly recommend to those who want to learn more about Asian Americans’ achievement, especially Asians who grew up with a pressure to succeed and who want to unpack that experience more....more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,"Apr 03, 2021","Apr 09, 2021","Feb 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25994599-the-asian-american-achievement-paradox

While Open Water contains important themes related to BlacI wanted to like this one but could just not get past the extremely dramatic writing style. While Open Water contains important themes related to Blackness, masculinity, and the possibilities of two young Black artists falling in love, Caleb Azumah Nelson’s writing felt over the top to me and distracted me from getting to know the characters, who felt more like character sketches by the end of the book, especially the female lead. Here are some examples of passages that pulled me out of the narrative:“The woman’s face splits open with genuine, kind amusement and, as it does so, there’s a hand on your elbow. You’re being pulled away; you’re needed. The dance floor has cleared a little and there is a silence filled with all that is yet to come.” Several phrases perturbed me here: what does her face splitting open mean? Also, the notion of “filled with all that is yet to come” felt more like telling than showing, like I would have preferred more details about the dance floor itself or what about the atmosphere of the environment made it seem so ominous and foreboding, as opposed to being told that there is more to come.“She hands you a mug and signals to her sofa. You both sit on opposite ends, knees pushed towards your chests, careful not to breach the border of the bisecting cushion; except you both know something has opened, like pressing a teabag and gazing into the cup to find the leaves swarming through boiling water.” I’m honestly just confused about what this simile is supposed to convey, emotionally or otherwise? I feel like instead of delving into the abstract Nelson could have grounded us more in the present moment, like say more about the posture of the characters or how they interacted with each other to convey the tension between them, instead of taking us far away into a simile about teabags and boiling water.I appreciate the subjectivity of appraising art so perhaps others will enjoy this writing style even though it did not work for me at all. Again, the novel contains important themes related to race and masculinity. The second person narrative and the purple prose curtailed my positive feelings about the book as a whole though....more",Notes are private!,5,478,1,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 11, 2021","Feb 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53414230-open-water

AmberSo appreciated this book in which sisters Amber Ruffin and Lacey Lamar write about Lacey’s many experiences of racism living in Omaha, Nebraska. Amber and Lacey are both funny and real; I laughed aloud a few times reading this book and felt anger and sadness on Lacey’s behalf at the depth of anti-Black racism she experienced, from teachers, coworkers, neighbors, and more. I enjoyed reading about the sisters’ bond with one another as well as how their mother took an active role in combatting some of the racism they experienced growing up, though of course the racism should just not have happened at all. I also felt grateful for some of the instances Lacey shared in which she interrupted or took an active role in speaking out against interpersonal anti-Asian racism. The stories in this book may not feel surprising to folks, however I think they’re important to read so we can honor Lacey’s experiences while continuing to ask ourselves what we can do to prevent racism from occurring at all.

As someone who is monogamous (and begrudgingly attracted to men), works with poly clients, and has a few close friendships, I felt like I could trust this book’s wisdom without any heteronormative, monogamy-centric brainwashing. Jessica Fern draws upon her experience as someone who is polyamorous, as well as through her therapy experience with polyamorous clients, to deliver a book I honestly think we could all benefit from reading. If you are someone interested in relationships I would highly recommend Polysecure.Fern first starts by providing an overview of attachment theory and how trauma affects our relationships. She does a great job of conveying the science surrounding attachment theory while still making the content readable and relatable, such as by avoiding unnecessary jargon. I felt like I could see my own relational patterns reflected in her descriptions, and I think she writes so well about how our past experiences can influence us to pull away or grasp firmly onto people we have relationships with, without judging people for their trauma or their general relational tendencies. After describing attachment theory and how it relates to trauma, Fern writes about consensual nonmonogamy and how it relates to our attachment styles. I so enjoyed this section because I feel like Fern destigmatizes consensual nonmonogamy and writes about it in such a clear, accessible way. I feel like whether you are polyamorous, monogamous, neither or a combination of both, you could benefit from this book just to deepen your own understanding of how nonmonogamous relationships work, in particular if you are unfamiliar or still hold onto some stigma. Even though I identify as monogamous romantically (though idk if I’ll ever find a man I want to date, lol) I do have three closest friends I care about a lot, friends who I care about just as much as and probably more than I would any male romantic partner, and this book helped me reflect on my secure attachments with them as well as past attachments that were not as healthy. I most loved how Fern dedicates space to discussing the importance of developing a secure attachment with ourselves. She writes about having a healthy relationship with oneself in a way that emphasizes how we can act as our own warm shelters to weather the storms of life, without framing this self-love in a trite or formulaic way. Fern offers specific strategies and actions we can take to tune into ourselves and enhance our relationships with ourselves, just as she provides tangible steps to strengthen the quality of our relationships with others. Overall, would highly recommend this one! I am glad she acknowledges the role of various forms of systemic oppression on relationships too. Yay for deconstructing monogamy and creating a society where healthy consensual relationships of all kinds thrive....more",Notes are private!,0,298,1,"Jan 16, 2021","Jan 21, 2021","Dec 30, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52569124-polysecure

As noted by other ers, Black Appreciated this short story collection that delves into the interior and exterior lives of Black women and girls. As noted by other ers, Black women so often only are allowed to exist as caregivers or as saviors. In The Secret Lives of Church Ladies, Deesha Philyaw melts down these stereotypes and shows Black women in the midst of navigating their needs, desires, and passions, all while grappling with the double standards of the church.My two favorite short stories included ""Peach Cobbler"" and ""How to Make Love to a Physicist."" The former involves a young girl whose mother is having an affair with their church's preacher, and how she must decide how much to accept or reject her mother's example. The latter includes a woman slowly turning toward romantic love even after having been hurt in the past. I liked how both stories highlighted the ways in which our histories influence our relationships, as well as our agency to change course even when it feels hard.Most of the other stories I felt more distance from, either because of the story's length or a more detached writing style.

The Office of Historical CorrI wanted to enjoy this one so much more especially because I liked Danielle Evans’ first short story collection so much! The Office of Historical Corrections contains so many stories with intriguing premises: a famous male artist who makes a performance out of apologizing to all the women he’s harmed, a white woman who wears a Confederate bikini and receives backlash once photos of her get posted online, and a Black scholar who uncovers complicated truths about an old friend while working at a federal agency committed to correcting historical inaccuracies. However, I struggled to really feel much when reading these stories, beyond a general appreciation of Evans’ writing style and ideas. I think my lack of enjoyment of this collection stems from feeling disconnected from the characters. While reading these stories, I felt that I experienced these characters’ emotions and thoughts from a careful distance. For example, quite a few characters lose loved ones throughout the collection – it seems that Evans likes using unexpected death as a plot device – yet oddly enough the characters’ grief felt muted to me, or just written in a way that didn’t resonate. Further, many of these stories, if not all of them, revolve around race, with “Boys Go to Jupiter” and “The Office of Historical Corrections” addressing race and racism in particularly striking ways. Yet I felt removed from the characters in these stories. When reading “Boys Go to Jupiter,” I was like, okay I understand this story shows how this white woman can both have suffered loss in her life and still be complicit in horrifying racism, and that doesn’t feel that compelling to me? And while I think I recognize the emotions “The Office of Historical Corrections” may have been supposed to elicit within me, the nonlinear/erratic formation of its plot threw me off from immersing myself in the main character’s journey.Overall, if you are a fan of short stories that touch on issues related to relationships and race, I’d tentatively recommend this book or at least the first few stories, though I wouldn’t immediately highly recommend The Office of Historical Corrections. I definitely want to read more short story collections from authors of color!...more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,"Jan 23, 2021","Jan 28, 2021","Dec 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51777605-the-office-of-historical-corrections

This memoir stands out in several ways, such as how Guerrero investigates her father’s history with such detail and dogged determination. Through her uncovering of her family’s past, she shares with us her father’s journey into the United States through Mexico and the traumas he inherited from his family and then she inherited from him. Guerrero shows us in vivid detail how patriarchy and misogyny rammed into her grandmother’s life and how that then affected her father, as well as how racism and xenophobia short-circuited some of her father’s early ambitions. Another theme that emerges throughout the memoir includes the blurring of reality and dissociation. Though Guerrero’s mother informally diagnoses Guerrero’s father with schizophrenia, Guerrero herself questions this diagnosis and explores whether her father’s paranoia does stem from being mind-controlled by the CIA or from being a shaman. With admirable honesty Guerrero also writes about how her own risk-seeking behavior that sends her hurtling toward near-death encounters stems from her fraught yet powerful connection with her father.I give this book four stars because I’m biased and wanted more reflection about how her relationship with her father ended up later on in her life. I think the nonlinearity of the memoir tracks with the fiercely loving yet fiercely uneven relationship Guerrero had with her father, and she often shows how her relationship with her father affected her through scenes. Still, at the end of the memoir she includes a family therapy session between herself, her father, and her sister and I wanted to stay in that moment of healing or growth longer, to further understand if the intergenerational family trauma could be mended and how. I probably wanted that content because I’m hope-oriented and also it’s with my profession, so I respect how Guerrero has produced a compelling book nevertheless....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Feb 19, 2021","Feb 25, 2021","Dec 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36794530-crux

I appreciated how Detransition, Baby depicted transA novel with lots of heart that centers three women navigating queer relationships and parenthood. I appreciated how Detransition, Baby depicted trans women’s lives in such a three-dimensional way, including moments of transphobic othering and violence as well as experiences of connection, longing, and fulfillment. I felt that Torrey Peters cared about these characters and didn’t write this novel to educate cis readers. The most satisfying part of this the book for me centered on how Peters portrays the potential of queer family and parenthood outside of the heteronormative nuclear family. It’s redeeming and much-too-long-awaited to see a model of parenthood outside of two folks in a romantic relationship raising children. The plot in Detransition, Baby moves at a fast pace and will keep readers entertained with many dramatic sequences.Similarly to what Roxane Gay wrote in her , I found certain sections of the book a tad overwritten. I’m not saying that the characters’ emotions or experiences were blown out of proportion, more so sometimes the way Peters described them pulled me out of the narrative due to the prose feeling a bit forced. For example, after one character betrays another character interpersonally, the betrayed character compares her experience of betrayal to being waterboarded and tortured. While the character has every right to feel that way or make that comparison, just the way those paragraphs were written felt very obvious and ostentatious to me. Also, I do think that toward the middle half of the novel Peters prioritized plot over character development. For example, Reese has a habit of engaging in self-destructive relationships with married and problematic men. While Peters writes about this habit in an authentic way without glorifying it, I felt that the underlying issues motivating that behavior were never fully realized or addressed, perhaps because it was difficult to fit that exploration in with the portrayal of triadic queer parenting.Overall, a strong debut novel that is unfortunately one of first more popular novels that centers trans women. Hoping this momentum continues and that trans women of color authors get their chance to shine too!...more",Notes are private!,0,172,1,"Apr 26, 2021","May 02, 2021","Dec 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48890225-detransition-baby

Over the next 26 years, we see how HuonA powerful novel about a young mother who leaves Vietnam with her two sons and arrives in New Orleans in 1979. Over the next 26 years, we see how Huong and her two sons, Tuan and Binh/Ben, cope with the challenges of acculturation, racism, and connection/disconnection with one another. I loved how this novel challenged the model minority myth and showed all three characters as real people instead of Asian stereotypes, such as how Tuan joins a local Vietnamese gang whereas Binh experiments with other guys, with neither brother turning into an academic math-oriented whiz kid. Tuan and Binh’s narratives felt like skillful portrayals of how masculinity and sexual orientation interact with race for 1.5 and 2nd generation Vietnamese Americans. I felt my heart most moved by Huong’s sections and how much she loved her sons despite her difficulty in raising them. Eric Nguyen’s immersive writing humanized these characters in their search for belonging and love amidst sacrifice and struggle.I agree with other ers who wish that the book was longer so that we could explore these characters more. I felt a lot of empathy and care for Huong and Tuan, though ironically, I felt less attached to Binh even though I’m also a 2nd generation queer Vietnamese man. I wanted more space for him to grow into his own person and I’m unsure if the trip he takes toward the end of the novel helped develop his character in a meaningful way. Still, I’d recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a beautifully-told family saga, as it reminded me of a combination of Ocean Vuong’s more lyrical On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous with the groundedness of Celeste Ng’s Little Fires Everywhere. A few miscellaneous elements of the novel I also enjoyed included the presence of Vietnamese sprinkled in throughout the prose, the romantic pairing of a Haitian woman and Vietnamese man (yay for some representation of interracial couples that aren’t Asian/white), and the characters’ complex feelings toward communism and Catholicism....more",Notes are private!,2,89,1,"May 16, 2021","May 19, 2021","Nov 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55120657-things-we-lost-to-the-water

As someone who grew up with a narcissistic mother and has encountered narcissistic people in acadeFive stars for the actual content about narcissism. As someone who grew up with a narcissistic mother and has encountered narcissistic people in academia, reading the beginning and middle sections of this book felt so comforting. I appreciate Sandy Hotchkiss for putting into words the dynamics I observed in these narcissistic folks: the complete lack of empathy disguised in abundant charisma, the narcissist’s internal world of shame and how they project that onto people, and the blatant disregard of boundaries because the narcissist only views the world as serving to benefit them. Hotchkiss describes how narcissism may present in parents, coworkers, romantic partners, and children, and I imagine others who have dealt with narcissists may feel relieved to know they are not alone and that these people’s harmful behaviors can be identified and addressed. In addition to Hotchkiss’s general description of narcissists, I like how she traced the roots of narcissism to children’s early attachment with parents. It felt fascinating and sad to see how parents or caregivers who are not attuned with their child or who do not set healthy boundaries can contribute to the development of narcissism. Hotchkiss provide specific vignettes throughout her book that help illustrate her points, which makes the psychological and interpersonal phenomena she describes more tangible. I also loved how she gives targeted, implementable action strategies to handle narcissistic people, including establishing firm boundaries, distancing oneself from the narcissist, intentionally cultivating reciprocal relationships, and more.The only reason I deduct two stars is because Hotchkiss’s discussion of sociocultural risk factors for narcissism felt pretty icky and off base. For example, she states that millennials’ ability to speak up to their elders is symbolic of narcissism. She then states that people who push back against gun manufacturing and tobacco companies are projecting their need to be powerful against authority figures. Not gonna lie, when I read those parts I was like what the heck are you talking about?? Like, I recognize that perhaps there’s some truth in the notion that people who speak up more about social injustices may be more rebellious in general, and at the same time it feels really misguided to falsely equate narcissistic tendencies with people who use their voices to protest gun violence, racism and sexism and other oppressions, and tobacco. She also ignores how actually oppressive forces, like toxic masculinity and the power differentials created by white supremacy and capitalism, may contribute to narcissistic tendencies. Basically, I would recommend this book to those who want to learn more about narcissism or to feel validated about the narcissistic people they’ve encountered in their own lives.

In Shuggie Bain, Douglas Stuart writes a bleak yet realistic novel Appreciated the content of this novel even though I found its delivery lackluster. In Shuggie Bain, Douglas Stuart writes a bleak yet realistic novel about a mother with a substance use disorder and her three children who love or leave her. Stuart focuses most on the youngest child, Shuggie, a more feminine boy who feels devoted to caring for his mother through her addiction to alcohol even as she continues to spiral out of control. Throughout the novel we see Shuggie do his best to parent his mother even as she proves incapable of returning his love in a way that would heal or restore him.I liked how Stuart portrays the dark themes of class and poverty as well as having a parent with a mental illness in Shuggie Bain. These topics are so often stigmatized and I felt that Stuart wrote about them in a realistic way without glorifying or trivializing the characters’ struggles. He also does an effective job of highlighting the harmful nature of toxic masculinity in relation to Shuggie’s femininity as well as how cruel men furthered Agnes’s suffering (whew, the men in this novel were pretty garbage similar to many of the men I’ve encountered in my life). I found the writing style of this novel a major letdown compared to its content. The writing felt dull, repetitive, and devoid of the intense emotion I would have expected from a set of characters undergoing such tumultuous life circumstances. I felt like the prose stayed so much on the situational level in terms of describing event after event, without ever really getting into the characters’ more nuanced emotions or their interior psychological processes. For example, Shuggie’s attachment to Agnes exemplified a heartbreaking situation of a child trying to tend to an ill parent. However, while I understood their relationship as heartbreaking on an intellectual level, the writing felt flat to me and lacking in terms of Shuggie’s internal world, which reduced the emotional connection I felt to him and to the characters overall.Would potentially recommend this novel for its content and themes though not really for its writing style.

I appreciatA thoughtful, intelligent, and observant essay collection that centers on Jerald Walker’s experiences as a Black man in the United States. I appreciated Walker’s honesty about both his struggles and triumphs, such as encountering stereotypes about Black men as aggressive and sexual predators as well as witnessing his Black sons face racist comments from their peers. I enjoyed how he grounds his essays in specific scenes, such as a white female professor falsely accusing him of sexual misconduct because he spoke assertively at a faculty meeting. These scenes made the essays entertaining and visceral instead of vague and abstract. At several points I felt that Walker included intriguing, unexpected, and powerful commentaries on issues related to race, such as the importance of not writing about Black people in pathologizing/stereotyping ways as well as how sexual violence occurs across various privileged and marginalized communities.As a professor who grew up in Chicago’s South Side, Walker’s approaches his own life and societal issues with nuance and fresh writing. Each essay in this collection feels on the briefer side yet still communicates important points. There was one instant where Walker writes about having the thought that he should go to a tanning bed so that he can make himself more advantaged for a faculty job; while Walker recognizes this thought as problematic, I wish he had explored his light-skinned privilege a bit more in that essay. Overall though I’d recommend this collection to those who like essay collections and reflecting on issues of race and racism.

I loved how Brittany Barnett shared her own story about her mom’s incarceration and how that experience, intertwined with an assignment she conducted in law school, motivated her to fight so tirelessly for Black folx who had their lives unjustly cut short by these draconian life sentences. Barnett centers her clients’ life experiences and humanizes their struggles as well as emphasizes their creativity, intelligence, and compassion. While she does not center herself in these stories, I still found myself moved by her dedication to the cause and her focus on making a difference with her skills as a lawyer.

Cam & Beau follows two best friends and roommates: Cam, the over-analytical theory-driven grad student, and Beau, the more spontaneous photographer afflicted by cancer. The novel’s main conflict rests on Cam’s undisclosed romantic feelings for Beau. Though the book started off slow for me, I will say that about the 40% mark I got pretty invested in this messy slow burn romance. I feel like Maria Cichosz did a good job of keeping Cam in character as someone who thinks instead of acts, which helped his conflicted feelings for Beau elongate over time.At times Cam’s romantic obsession with Beau felt like both too much and not enough, though. Reading Cichosz’s thoughts on the book, I get that the intention was to share how romance can function as a drug. Yet I wanted more growth and awareness from these characters. By the end of the novel I don’t think either Cam or Beau really grew in their love for themselves or in their ability to communicate, aside from more forthrightness about how they feel about one another. Both side characters, Cliff their dealer and Stacey their friend, felt underdeveloped and like they only served to heighten the relationship between Cam and Beau. I also wonder if including more scenes from Cam and Beau’s past would have helped further define their relationship, such as scenes that may have shown more thoroughly why they feel the way they do for one another.You can check this one out if you want a “omg I’m so into him but he’s my best friend and idk if I want to tell him my feelings lest our friendship be ruined” type of book with lots of drugs.

Throughout Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self, DaniellThe first two short stories in this collection literally had me making noises on my couch. Throughout Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self, Danielle Evans shares the pains, intimacies, and moments of (dis)connection that make adolescence and young adulthood so rife with feeling. In the first story, “Virgins,” I literally laughed so hard at the dialogue, before experiencing a quiet yet profound sadness at the ways in which the young female narrator comes to understand the many degrees of danger for girls just trying to exist in the world. I appreciated how, throughout this collection, Evans focuses on the interior lives of Black girls, some of whom are biracial, without making their entire narratives solely about their race.When I read the second story, “Snakes,” I’m pretty sure I actually screamed out loud at the ending (idk if I’m a mediocre book er for relying on descriptions of me ejecting noise from my mouth to pump up the hype, but whatever.) “Snakes” follows a young biracial nine-year-old, Tara, who’s dropped off at her white grandmother’s house by her parents for an entire summer – Tara’s mother fell out of touch with Tara’s grandmother a while ago and, in Tara’s view, offers Tara’s summer visit as a “peace offering” of sorts. This freaking short story had everything: a vulnerable, perceptive, and consistent narrator, complicated yet understandable parental dynamics transmitted across generations, subtle and effectively-placed commentary on race, omg-this-is-so-good level foreshadowing, and an ending that almost got me as shaken as when I hear the bridge of BlackPink’s song “Lovesick Girls.” I feel like short stories that can win me over almost impress me more than novels given the shorter page length eliciting a commensurate amount of emotional payoff. “Snakes” accomplished that feat and I please recommend you read the collection just so we can fanhuman the freak out about it afterward.The rest of the stories felt more in the 3-3.5 range for me, perhaps because of how much I absolutely loved “Snakes” and enjoyed “Virgins.” Evans embodies each story with nuanced takes on the insecurities that accompany coming of age and the ruptures and repairs that can occur within family relationships. While these later stories felt interesting, none of them felt as definitive as the first two stories. I walked away from each one thinking something along the lines of like, “well that was interesting angst” and “lol well I hope X character figures their life out at some point.” I don’t feel like I wanted more resolution as much as I wanted each of the later stories to make more of an impact. Recommended for those interested in short stories. Evans’s writing reminded me of Caucasia by Danzy Senna, one of my favorite books I read this year, as well as the amazing short story I read during my undergraduate education (weird af that my undergrad days were over three years ago now, lol), “Brownies” by ZZ Packer, whose full collection Drinking Coffee Elsewhere I still want to read.

I’m giving this book two stars – instead of one – because I want to acknowledge the representation it provides for Muslim Americans. Ayad Akhtar does touch on the racism faced by Muslim Americans after 9/11 and there’s some interesting commentary about the main character’s relationship with his father.However, wow, the internalized racism in this book. Let me just start by sharing this disturbing quote about how the Pakistani American main character is only into white women (I’ve texted a screenshot of this passage to a few of my friends of color already out of outrage and disgust):“And yet as my darkish body ripened, my disgust for white bodies was now squared by desire. My wet dreams were only white; I longed for white faces brightened by the sight of my darker one, imagined white breasts and thighs, white fingers on my thickened brown-red penis – all of which, of course, reveals a socialization into the politics of race touching the very core of my being.”I’m just… wow. Not only is the main character only into white women, but he then proceeds to have the most toxic relationship with a fellow South Asian woman. The main character dates this South Asian woman, he contracts syphilis from her, and then she leaves him for a white man who she also has a toxic relationship with. What is the point?? Like if you’re going to portray an Asian character with internalized racism, whatever I guess, but please actually address it instead of just having him submerged in the depths of white supremacist longing for all of eternity?? Why??? On the second to last page of the book, the main character watches a pornographic video of a South Asian man receiving fellatio from a white woman. Like… why was that even necessary. Akhtar inserts whiteness and South Asians’ psychosexual relationship with whiteness so often in this book when he really could have either 1) done it in a way where the character grows or 2) just not included all the nasty unaddressed internalized racism and focused on the main character’s dynamic with his father and other people instead. Also, on a side note, even apart from the rampant internalized racism, I found the narration overly intellectualized and emotionally distant.Anyway, I’m going to go on a jog now because this book was just so repugnant to me and I want to regulate my emotions before I get some work done. Though these novels are super different (i.e., much better) in tone and style to this book, for some non-toxic Asian American representation, I’d recommend Yolk by Mary Choi, Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou, or Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows by Balli Kaur Jaswal (not Asian American, but still so much better)....more",Notes are private!,12,55,1,"Sep 30, 2023","Oct 05, 2023","Oct 30, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358133-homeland-elegies

While more people have gained awareness about the racist awfulness of mass incarceration due to books like Michelle Alexander’s The New Jim Crow and films like 13th, I feel like contemporary society in the United States has not named the damage brought on by the popular reforms discussed in this book. Maya Schenwar and Victoria Law write about a variety of “alternatives to incarceration” – including electronic monitoring, school police, drug courts, and more – and how these alternatives still tie people to the state, limit their ability to heal and thrive, and disproportionately negatively affect Black, brown, Indigenous, and low-income communities. I feel like Schenwar and Law do a great job of discussing with depth and detail the harmful effects of prison-adjacent measures such as community policing and probation. This book highlights tools of the state many of us may not think about. For example, I had not really thought in-depth about how sex offender registries may actually do more damage than good before I read this book. I also appreciated how Schenwar and Law propose ideas for how to better heal society than prisons and prison-adjacent reforms, such as restorative justice practices and trying to eliminate the systemic oppressive forces that create health disparities in the first place, like white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism.Would recommend to those interested in social justice and who want to think about further steps in relation to eliminating mass incarceration.

Wilson does a nice job of then discussing how ACT principles apply to the therapy relationship and how they can help us stay with our clients more without getting caught up in our feelings or thoughts that take us out of the relationship or away from where are clients are actually at.I do wish Kelly Wilson had acknowledged how mindfulness stems from Buddhism and Eastern philosophy.

Reading Black Sun reminded me a lot of my experience reading The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin. While I recognize the quality of the world-building, this type of epic fantasy rarely appeals to me if the characters are not compelling and well-developed.I appreciated the novel’s world-building in that it is inspired by the pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas. I also enjoyed the inclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals, in particular characters who are a third gender and use xe/xir pronouns. This representation felt sensitive and smoothly incorporated without drawing undue attention to itself for the sake of it.I just couldn’t connect with the characters in Black Sun. We follow three main storylines with different characters in varying levels of precarity and danger. Unfortunately I didn’t feel much suspense in any of their situations and these characters’ internal worlds did not draw me in. I felt like a solid amount happened plot-wise yet these characters’ relationships and inner feelings and emotions were not developed as much as I would’ve liked.

Mychal Denzel Smith’s tone is disillusioned, which feels appropriate given the many issues he writes about with passion and conviction – the grotesqueness of prisons, the pervasiveness of rape culture, the injustices perpetuated by police, and more. Toward the end he admits that the election of Donald Trump, though only a symptom of the United States’ alignment with white supremacy, contributed to his struggle with depression. At the same time, Smith shows through this work that through acknowledging how bad things really are, we may then take action to make them better, even if at times we still feel hopeless.Because I read, research, and organize around a lot of the topics in this book, I did not feel like I learned much new information. I still enjoyed reading this book because of the way Smith integrates these subjects of social justice and connects them to his own perspective, like how he observes gentrification and the proliferation of policing in New York City. At times I wanted a bit more focus or depth because each section tends to cover a range of topics in fluid ways.

Lan writes with great honesty and clarity about the pains of assimilating to the United States, such as the racism she experienced as a child when a teacher fudged her grade and bullied her to prevent her from graduating at the top of her class. Harlan offers a narrative that both builds upon and counters her mother’s story, such as by describing with vivid detail the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder her mother experienced, though Lan does not disclose those things about herself. Together they describe the push and pull of a mother-daughter relationship filled with lots of angst and also lots of love. While the joint narrative format might seem uncouth, it enrichens both of their individual perspectives and adds a fresh energy to the book overall.Even though at times I felt a lack of clear direction from the overarching narrative in this memoir, I would still recommend it to those interested in reading about mother-daughter relationships as well as immigrant stories. As Lan names in Family in Six Tones, we need more books about Vietnam from people who are actually Vietnamese, so I’m glad she and Harlan have shared their journeys with us. I most enjoyed reading about the pains that accompany assimilation as well as the descriptions about how Vietnamese culture and parenting differs from the American style. While people often demonize Asian culture and parenting I feel that these writers portrayed it with honesty while not pathologizing it or portraying it as superior in an othering way.

Academia is not just a space where passionate intellectuals have free-roaming opportunities to advance knowledge and share wisdom with students. Though I think more people are aware of the corporatization of academia now, Tuchman’s 2008 book offers specific insights into how it has taken place at one large state school. She writes about the proliferation of administrators and the power they wield to generate money above all else, the pressure on faculty to pursue grants and publications that will serve as revenue streams, and how auditing and accountability manifest as mechanisms of control over professors’ autonomy. Tuchman’s prose is direct, and I like how she offers intelligent and honest critiques about how neoliberalism continues to infiltrate and permeate higher education. Though I appreciated Tuchman’s naming of corporatization and how it affects university faculty, by the end of this book I wondered, where do we go from here? I think naming the problem is oftentimes the first step to generating solutions, though I wanted some brainstorming about how we can resist or organize against the corporatization of academia. I also feel like the book could have benefitted from a more nuanced take on the accountability of professors. While I see how professors having freedom to say and do what they want is important to ensure the safety of expression of ideas that may be controversial, I am also aware of quite a few faculty who abuse, neglect, and/or generally mistreat their students. How can we hold those faculty accountable for their actions (e.g., student evaluations that are analyzed with a critical lens?) while still promoting faculty autonomy? Finally, I wanted more of a discussion of how faculty members with marginalized identities can navigate this system, given the racism, heterosexism, sexism, and other forms of oppression that operate within academia (e.g., Presumed Incompetent II offers excellent narratives from women of color in academia).Overall, I would recommend this book to those who want to learn about the corporatization of the university through an in-depth look at how that has manifested at one state school in particular. I would also recommend supplementing the book with perspectives of faculty of color and those engaged in campus activism and organizing. Yay to speaking truth to power (lol hopefully I don’t get roasted for saying that when I’m on the academic job market in a few years or when I apply for tenure in several more years)!...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Oct 22, 2020","Oct 25, 2020","Sep 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6923039-wannabe-u

Erika Lee shows how anti-immigrant prejudice and discrimination manifested against Catholic immigrants, then Chinese immigrants, then Italian, Jewish, and Eastern European immigrants, then Mexicans living in the United States, then Japanese Americans, and now Muslim Americans. As you can see just from that sentence, the United States has a long and abhorrent history of xenophobia, oftentimes against people who were United States citizens too (e.g., the deportation of Mexicans during the Great Depression and the forcing of Japanese Americans into internment camps). Lee’s writing is straightforward and she reveals a history that we should all be aware of as we take action to fight xenophobia.There is a lot of history packed into this book so prepare for fact after fact if you read this one.

Ruby Hamad takes this premise and runs it thA great book about how white women weaponize their tears to harm women of color and avoid accountability. Ruby Hamad takes this premise and runs it through history and the present, discussing the damage white woman have enacted onto people of color (e.g., white women being complicit in and cruel to enslaved people, Hilary Clinton wreaking havoc upon Palestine and in the Middle East, white women calling the police on Black people going about their day to day, etc.) She discusses a wide range of topics such as the unique and awful stereotypes faced by different women of color. I appreciated Hamad’s confident tone and how she doesn’t hold back in her arguments and analysis. I particularly enjoyed how she wrote about how the United States and western countries in general have a frustrating habit of viewing women of color in the East as “needing saving” by white men, when white male soldiers have inflicted so much horrendous pain onto women of color abroad. I thought she did a great job of highlighting how the demonization of men of color in comparison to white men also harms women of color and racial justice movements overall.While I think this book may not offer too many new insights to people who are already well-read on white fragility and white women’s tears, I still am glad this book exists especially for white women, white people in general, and people of color who are aligned with white supremacy to educate themselves. I had a white woman weaponize her emotionality when I called her in (super gently, too!) about a racial justice issue and it sucks. So it’s nice that people are talking about this and it’s kind of Hamad to outline how white women can choose to stop perpetuating racist violence, too....more",Notes are private!,7,103,1,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 14, 2024","Aug 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53260224-white-tears-brown-scars

Her writing feels both thoughtful and easy to follow. She addresses a range of topics, from racism and the unjust power of white men in politics to the anti-Blackness of American football. Despite these positive aspects of the book, I found her first book So You Want to Talk About Race more precise. In Mediocre, I felt that she sometimes stretched certain ideas to fit her argument while ignoring deeper nuances within them. I largely agree with her central thesis about white men’s mediocrity, though that doesn’t excuse selective reporting of the facts (this  does an excellent job of driving home this point with how Oluo wrote about Bernie Sanders). I also thought that Oluo ignored critical evidence about how people of color can also perpetuate actions that foster anti-Blackness and social inequity (such as Kamala Harris’s track record as a prosecutor). Oluo mentions this point about people of color conforming to white male norms and behaviors, though doesn’t elaborate much on it. Overall an alright read. Oluo’s sincerity and passion in relation to social justice feels clear to me when I read her writing, and it sucks that she and many others have been the target of hate and vitriol for tackling these issues. At the same time I’m not sure folks will walk away with too many new insights from this book unless you’re pretty new to discussions of race, racism, and whiteness....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Apr 29, 2022","May 03, 2022","Aug 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53056522-mediocre

I liked This Book Betrays My Brother though I did not love it. The novel takes place in South Africa and follows Naledi, a thirteen-year-old girl whose older brother Basi is glorified both in their family and in their broader community. Naledi does not mind how much people love her brother, as she also feels a great deal of affection for him. We witness Naledi’s coming of age, such as her growing interest in dating, until she herself sees her brother commit a horrifying act that challenges everything she thought she knew about him.I liked the themes of patriarchy and gender in this book. Molope shows how in this South African community, boys are often valorized and given a pass just because they are boys. She highlights how women, such as Basi’s mother, are complicit in this patriarchal notion that boys and men should not be held accountable for their actions, that by virtue of their gender they are automatically decent. Living in the United States, I feel that this patriarchal notion extends across various cultures. I appreciate reading a young adult novel that takes place outside of the United States, too.My two main critiques of this novel concern our protagonist’s passivity and the book’s plotting. While I don’t think a character has to be super agentic all of the time for a book to work, our main character, Naledi, is an observer for most of the book. She doesn’t really do much aside talk to a few friends and start dating this one guy. The spotlight is on Basi, which makes sense given the book’s premise, though I wish we could have seen more from Naledi. Furthermore, a lot of the book’s plot builds up to one central event in which Naledi witnesses her brother committing a horrible act. There’s not a lot of space in the novel for after that event. We don’t get much room to see Naledi’s coping process, how her worldview and relationships shift afterward, etc. While Molope draws a compelling overall message about patriarchy, gender, and violence, I would have liked to see more of that develop through Naledi’s perspective and characterization.Overall, a good novel but would definitely recommend Such a Lonely, Lovely Road first. Molope published this novel several years before Such a Lonely, Lovely Road so it’s nice to see her development as a writer and I’m looking forward to reading more books by her in the future!

Such a Lonely, Lovely Road follows Kabelo Mosala, a young Black man living in South Africa whose parents aspire for him to go to medical school and then marry a woman. A few weeks before heading to medical school, however, Kabelo forms an intense connection with Sediba, a childhood friend Kabelo had always avoided, despite his interest in Sediba’s uniqueness. Their relationship confirms Kabelo’s queer sexual orientation, which he struggles to hide from his parent sand his community. We follow Kabelo throughout his life as he tries to make sense of and fully inhabit his relationship with Sediba, a relationship that brings him joy in a society that disparages same-sex love. Okay y’all, I have to say that I literally screamed in my apartment while reading this book because of how invested I felt in Kabelo and Sediba’s relationship. Kagiso Lesego Molope writes with such straightforward poignancy and captured their bond as well as Kabelo’s emotional experience with well-paced scenes and sharp dialogue. The curiosity and tension between Kabelo and Sediba leading up to their first kiss? I screamed. When Kabelo and Sediba reconnect after their first period of spending several years apart? I screamed. Later on in the book when the angst between them gets real and intersects with Kabelo’s emotions of loneliness and grief and confusion about he wants in life? I screamed while lying on my couch and blasting BlackPink’s “Don’t Know What to Do,” making sure to hydrate to replenish the fluids in my body even as Molope’s beautiful writing drained my soul and lifted it into the literary heavens. The romance between Kabelo and Sediba takes up most of the novel, and a lot of people know I’m not a huge fan of romance-centric stories. However, Molope constructs the connection between Kabelo and Sediba with such tender care, I had no choice but to pause my cynicism toward romance and fanboy. I also loved Kabelo’s character. Molope did such a fantastic job writing compelling scenes and dialogue while giving us perspective into Kabelo’s emotions, like what made him happy and what fueled his worries and insecurities. I think literally all of the characters in this novel, ranging from Sediba as a more central character to Kabelo’s parents as more on the periphery, received such distinct and consistent characterization. I feel like one sign of a truly talented writer is a writer who can make you empathize and care for a character while simultaneously acknowledging that character’s limitations and flaws. That’s how I felt about Kabelo – even when I wanted him to process his emotions about his parents or Sediba with more clarity, even when I wanted him to explore his past loneliness instead of avoiding it, I felt so compelled to root for him and to show compassion for him and his struggles.Goodreads friends, I ask you to please read this novel so I have people to scream and freak about it with. I so appreciate Molope’s voice and this deep, stirring portrayal of love between two Black men from South Africa. As a queer Asian American I recognize I am definitely removed from these characters’ experiences and at the same time it’s so rejuvenating to witness a queer love story outside of whiteness and a more western context in general. On a more political level some of my takeaways from this book include that we should all take action to eradicate homophobia, dismantle heteronormativity, and end patriarchy so queer folks everywhere can be happy and men can experience the full range of their emotions. Those are my takeaways and Molope doesn’t really directly say any of that in her novel. Instead, she creates a beautiful love story, one that centers a relationship with struggles yet an ultimately healthy and restorative relationship nonetheless. As someone who hasn’t given a book five stars in about two months, as someone who hasn’t had a crush on a guy for awhile (aside from an odd maybe crush on a straight guy which you can read about on my blog, lol), and as someone who values empathy and compassion and connection and novels that promote those things, I’m so grateful for Such A Lonely, Lovely Road....more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Aug 07, 2020","Aug 09, 2020","Aug 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39213488-such-a-lonely-lovely-road

Helen Zia writes about so many important events, including the murder of Vincent Chin in 1982, tensions and hostility between Korean Americans and Black Americans preceding and during the 1992 Los Angeles uprising, the racist erasure of Asian Americans in media and how white people used yellowface to portray Asian Americans such as in Miss Saigon (a problematic play in and of itself), and much more. I appreciated how she interwove her own life story and her role in these social justice movements throughout the book, especially in the first half and in the touching closing featuring her father. Her writing felt intelligent and thorough, while remaining accessible and conversational enough to make for a fun and not onerous reading experience.I would definitely recommend this book for my fellow Asian Americans. While those who are familiar with Asian American history (e.g., through coursework or self-education on the topic) may not get too much new information, I still think it’s worthwhile to witness these pivotal events from a queer Asian American woman who lived through them herself. I myself definitely did not learn about any of these historical events pretty much until undergrad and beyond, through taking a couple of Asian American studies courses in undergrad and engaging in my own research about Asian American psychology. I feel like we need books like these to understand our history and to continue fighting for racial justice – for example, reading this book reminded me of the political origins of the term “Asian American” itself. Overall, a wonderful primer for Asian American history and a great launching point for additional investigation for more specific topics within Asian American studies....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jun 19, 2022","Jun 25, 2022","Jul 31, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126006.Asian_American_Dreams

The novel follows Ashley Bennett, a privileged Black teenager going to high school in Los AngI enjoyed this book so much, especially its latter half! The novel follows Ashley Bennett, a privileged Black teenager going to high school in Los Angeles, California with a predominantly white friend group. At first glance, it appears that Ashley’s most pressing problems center on going to prom and figuring out what to wear for the occasion. However, the 1992 Los Angeles uprising begins to escalate after the acquittal of four police offers who beat an unarmed Black man, Rodney King, with excessive force. The chaotic energy in the town dovetails with Ashley’s more nuanced issues, such as her sister’s engagement in more direct action and protests much to her parents’ chagrin, mental health issues within her family, and Ashley’s own collusion in anti-Blackness. Throughout the novel we see Ashley grow even as she struggles and makes mistakes in her journey.As you may sense from the above paragraph, a lot goes on in this novel, and for the first half I felt unsure whether Christina Reed would tie it all together in a satisfying way. However, the middle and end of this novel felt tighter and more enjoyable to read than the first 40% or so, perhaps because Ashley started to hang out with her white friend group less, most of whom perpetuated racism or at least did nothing to actively resist it. I loved seeing Ashley’s coming of age as she grew into her own person, how she developed confidence in her racial identity and her own voice. The novel takes on a lot, like what it means to exist as a wealthy Black teenager, the complexity of Black parents’ choices to shield their kids from racism and if they can even ever do so, the tribulations of associating with problematic white friends, and more. Reed manages to address all of these topics in a meaningful way though without minimizing their nuances. I got a bit teary-eyed in the final scenes between Ashley and her sister Jo, as well as Ashley and her caretaker Lucia. Also, if I were several years younger, I would have been all over Lashawn (I’m embracing that even though I started my Goodreads account as a teen, I am now in my mid to late 20s, wow!) We love this positive representation of teen boys of color! Overall, while I found the writing a little clunky for the first 30-40% of the novel and the focus on Ashley’s white friends draining, I consider this a powerful novel that I would recommend to those interested in young-adult fiction. I’m happy that in 2021 I’ve read several novels so far with three-dimensional female teens of color with distinct voices and meaningful stories, including When We Were Infinite by Kelly Loy Gilbert, Yolk by Mary Choi, and I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erica Sanchez.

David Graeber focuses Bullshit Jobs: A Theory on the origins and implications of bullshit jobs, or jobs that do not serve any real purpose in society. He does an excellent job describing how these jobs perpetuate capitalism by keeping people employed for the sake of keeping people employed, as well as how these jobs negatively affect people’s psychological well-being. Graeber draws thoughtful and relevant connections between bullshit jobs and related topics such as the vilification of poor people, how women often are delegated to low-paying and unfulfilling jobs compared to men, and the necessity of a universal basic income. Though I feel that this book names an important trend in society (i.e., the existence of bullshit jobs) that we often skirt around, the points in the book got a bit repetitive. I wonder if tying everything back to the core point of bullshit jobs limited the book in some ways. I would’ve loved for Graeber to explore with more depth some of the topics he raised such as the misplaced ire of the white working class and how the structures that maintain bullshit jobs affect Black, Indigenous, and people of color. At the same time, I recognize that exploring those topics may have stretched the book a bit thin. Overall, I would recommend this book for those who want to think critically about the work we do and how and why we do it – I appreciate delving into the social construction of work as opposed to assuming that work is meaningful and/or life-fulfilling just because it is work....more",Notes are private!,0,105,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Jul 29, 2020","Jul 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs

A World Between has that same slice of life relatability mixed with dialogue that feels both everyday and addictive, made mesmerizing due to the strength of our two protagonists, Eleanor Suzuki and Leena Shah. In 2004, Eleanor and Leena meet in college, in an elevator, in an exchange that involves Leena studying for an exam and Eleanor entranced by Leena’s presence. This encounter sets the stage for an intense, passionate romance: Eleanor more the enthused pursuer and Leena returning her affection, steadfast and rational. They encounter each other again in the streets of San Francisco in 2010, and they cross paths once more in 2017, after gay marriage’s legalization and amidst 45’s presidency. As a 25-year-old myself, I so loved how this novel captured these two women from their tempestuous early 20s to their 30s, how they fall into and out of each other’s orbit, how they mature in both messy and triumphant ways. I loved the relationship between Eleanor and Leena because Emily Hashimoto developed them both as full, three-dimensional characters in and of themselves. I’m going to reference Normal People again, not to put down Normal People but just because I find the similarities between these two novels striking. Both novels feature intense, somewhat all-consuming romantic bonds between two people that feel magnetizing to read. However, Eleanor and Leena felt more fully-developed as individual characters in addition to their romance, whereas Connell and Marianne struck me as flatter on their own and that their romance carried their story man than they did.When I write that Eleanor and Leena both feel developed, I mean that in the sense that they each have goals for their lives beyond one another, as well as separate growth trajectories as characters even if their relationship with each other influences those trajectories. Eleanor is a biracial woman who comes out relatively early in life, is a bit obsessed with romantic love, and wants to make a difference in the lives of marginalized people (e.g., queer folx, girls and women, those at the intersections of those identities). Leena is a South Asian woman who wants to help people through medicine and public health, who is afraid of coming out because of her family, and who leans away from romance with women because it stirs up wild, intense feelings within her. These queer women of color felt developed with such care and intelligence, with distinct voices and personalities, whose characterizations are in no way in service to the male gaze or to be digestible to heterosexual readers. I so appreciated how Hashimoto incorporated their racial identities, sexual orientations, and more in a way that elevated them as people I grew fond of, not just to make A Point (you will, thankfully, not find the bury your gays tropes here either.)I felt intoxicated by Eleanor and Leena’s relationship and all the drama within it to the point where this book would have gotten a 4-star rating with ease. What really made me fall in love with A World Between is how Hashimoto shows how they both grow as people. Their growth felt so painfully human, full of missteps and hesitations, regrettable starts and frustrating stops. At times I wanted to say to Eleanor, “omg, you really need to learn how to love yourself without a romantic relationship with a woman.” At other times I wanted to tell Leena, “omg, your refusal to confront and accept your sexual orientation is actively hurting Eleanor to the point where I’m screaming on my couch in my living room waiting for you to own your gayness as much as I and she do.” This journey is what makes the payoff toward the end of the novel all the more fulfilling, when both characters finally grow and change in small yet oh-so-significant ways. By the end of this book, I trusted Hashimoto with my heart, fully, because I could see how much love and tenderness she invested in these characters. Definitely one of my top 2020 reads and top fiction novels ever! On a personal note, A World Between is another one of those right book, right time reads for me. As a gay man of color in my mid-20s, there’s a lot I don’t share in common with Eleanor and Leena, though their journeys did make me feel wistful for the romance I have yet to encounter in my life. Yet, I feel grateful to Hashimoto for gently reminding me of a powerful truth, that regardless of which guys I thirst for and which guys thirst for me, there’s one thing that will always fill my cup up first: my love and acceptance of myself....more",Notes are private!,0,164,1,"Oct 11, 2020","Oct 13, 2020","Jul 18, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53703632-a-world-between

It revolves around Priya, a woman from Trinidad, who’s dating Alex, a white woman. When Priya’s friend Prakash, an Indian Ugandan, comes to visit them, Alex gets really jealous, while Priya becomes on edge and defensive. The book concludes with Prakash’s visit and the emotional chaos it elicits.To me, this book came across as being angsty for the sake of being angsty. There’s a lot of Alex being jealous of Prakash and suspicious of Priya, and then a lot of Priya trying to soothe and react to Alex’s jealousy. Which I suppose is an understandable dynamic, though it’s played out for hundreds of pages in a repetitive way. The novel feels claustrophobic, which I suspect is intentional, though it was also annoying because the characters didn’t feel fully realized or three-dimensional by the end of the novel. I was also annoyed by Alex as a character and Priya’s affection for Alex. Alex makes a comment that is racially insensitive (at best) and a direct racial microaggression (at worst), Priya calls her out on it, then Priya apologizes to Alex when Alex basically says “well I live in this house so I can say what I want” and I was like?? Like I understand that there are queer white people and queer white women who enact racism, though I didn’t find the way it was written about in this book compelling or in service of a greater point. Also, the way this book ended and Priya liking/wanting Alex in general despite Alex’s lack of work on her own white fragility and whiteness… mess. If I’m being generous I could assume that the author was intentionally highlighting how people of color sometimes settle for white people out of unresolved internal issues related to their race. Anyway, I wouldn’t recommend this novel and hope people can read other more fulfilling books!...more",Notes are private!,3,33,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Jan 26, 2024","Jul 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50862067-polar-vortex

The 25 essays in this book discuss people’s lived experiences with mental illness and the mental health industrial complex with candor and self-insight. I appreciate how these authors avoid platitudes or trite narratives; there’s no simple “I went to therapy and everything got better right away” or “I learned to love myself and then my mental health improved.” Rather, these writers share their painful yet hopeful journeys that contain stigmatized topics such as involuntary hospitalizations, electroconvulsive shock therapy, suicidality, and more. While society may be a little less judgmental toward select mental health topics such as anxiety and depression, we still have a lot of work to do toward destigmatization so I am so grateful to these writers for baring vulnerable parts of themselves onto the page. In terms of quality of writing, I felt that many if not all of these writers had enough distance from and self-reflection about their essay topics to create compelling and enjoyable narratives. As a survivor of PTSD and anorexia who still occasionally goes through rough patches these writers’ courage felt healing and empowering to read.I also loved the frank ways these writers challenged psychiatry and even therapy. The collection as a whole does not take an anti-psychiatry or anti-therapy stance; the essayists recognize that medication can be extremely helpful as can therapy. However, they point out several important injustices in the mental health industrial complex such as pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists that profit off of dispensing medication instead of offering more compassionate and client-centered care. The writers point out alternatives and supplements to therapy too, such as peer support and mutual aid. The writers’ diverse social identities spanning race, sexual orientation, and ability status strengthen this collection and lend credence to its critiques of white supremacy, homophobia, and hegemonic capitalism, structures that negatively impact people’s mental health.

I’ll start with my constructive critique first which is that I found the first half pretty shaky in terms of writing quality. While the writing wasn’t necessarily bad in the first half, it didn’t wow me and felt rather basic or simplistic.The second half of Big Friendship won me over a lot more. Here, Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman delve into more complex elements of friendship. They write about navigating communication issues in friendships, racial dynamics in friendships, and steps to take when a friendship has faced a serious rupture. As they discuss, friendship rarely receives this type of attention in the media – a lot of times people just expect friends to be there for you though at the same time normalize not investing as much energy into friendships as we do into romantic or familial bonds. In Big Friendship though, they commit more deeply to putting friendship at the center and dedicating the book to friendship, full stop. Not the perfect book (I also wanted a more radical view of friendship like within the context of relationship anarchy), but one I still see value in. Makes me grateful to two of my closest friends who are relatively active on Goodreads, my bff of a decade Bri and my new Philly bestiana Ari!...more",Notes are private!,7,46,1,"Feb 20, 2024","Feb 22, 2024","Jul 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52766000-big-friendship

Alice Oseman does a fantastic job of showing our main character Georgia’s messy yet beautiful journey from frustration to confusion to self-acceptance regarding her aro ace identity. I liked reading about the multiple layers that complicated her path to self-love regarding her identities: the pressure the media and society in general exerts to force all of us into romantic and/or sexual relationships, the way some of Georgia’s friends tried to push her into romantic and/or physical relationships with people, and just the lack of representation surrounding aro and ace identities. Oseman highlights how as an amatonormative society we glorify romantic relationships above all other forms of relationships. I most enjoyed the privileging of friendship in this novel and how much the friendships mattered, even above the romantic relationships. In particular, one scene with Georgia and Rooney with flowers toward the end of the book filled me with lots of joy.I will say that I felt like the book’s aro ace representation carried it for me. For most of the novel I leaned toward a three-star rating because the characters came across as kinda flimsy to me in terms of their characterization. For some reason I struggled to connect with the characters, perhaps because I felt that they lacked compelling backstories that made me want to invest in them more (Rooney later on in the novel is revealed to have some interesting backstory with an old friend named Beth, but that doesn’t receive much development.) The novel felt so grounded in the present moment, which isn’t necessarily bad, yet the combination of that focus on the here and now and Oseman’s sometimes obvious writing (e.g., using dialogue clearly for the purpose of explaining certain identities) made it difficult to fully feel entrenched in Loveless. Would recommend for those searching for aro ace representation or want to learn more! Reading this novel even helped me realize that I am indeed not aromantic (which in some ways feels unfortunate to me because I’m attracted to men, though of course I recognize the unique stigmatization of aro people in society too).

I appreciated reading this book as someone within academia, given that I have observed faculty of color who will enact the same white supremacist, patriarchal ways of treating their students – instead of only advocating for more representation, we should go beyond that to dismantle the origins of injustice in the first place.Some great points in these essays include: the importance of dismantling Eurocentrism and racism, advocating for Indigenous ways of knowing and transferring knowledge such as storytelling, and combatting how the West has accumulated power through devaluing scholarship from the East. I feel like perhaps several of us kinda take the university for granted and do not question its origins, its purpose, and if it should function the way it does.

I appreciated the nonproblematic representation in The Weight of the Stars, ranging from the Black lesbian romance to the polyamorous parental relationship to the prominent Sikh character. Reading the author’s note, I liked how K. Ancrum cared for characters and how they represented people confronting their issues and overcoming their problems through love, knowing their worth, and connection.I unfortunately just did not like the writing or the character development in The Weight of the Stars at all. For the first 120 pages, I felt so confused by the plot – why is this group of characters throwing rocks at Alexandria? Then, why would Alexandria’s father allow one of the characters who threw rocks at her daughter into his household so easily, as well as into his daughter’s room? Also, why and how did Alexandria and Ryann become friends after that incident? Beyond the first 120 pages, a lot of the main plot events occurred through telling and not showing, which manifested in long bits of dialogue that explained backstory as well as the current ongoing conflicts. Finally, I felt that Ryann and Alexandria’s characters were lacking in complexity. As another character put it, they both have an angry surface, a nice core, and yet I didn’t feel or see the emotional nuances of their connection with one another, their grief processes, or their evolution throughout the story. Ancrum’s book The Wicker King looks similarly enticing from its description yet I’m unsure whether to read it after my experience with this novel. Any thoughts on that quandary are appreciated.

Cho Nam-Joo shows how patriarchy pervades every facet ofAppreciated this novel’s thorough portrayal of the entrenched sexism in South Korean society. Cho Nam-Joo shows how patriarchy pervades every facet of South Korean life: the ways parents and teachers devalue girls and idolize boys, how employers discriminate against women both in the application process and on the job, and how women’s careers both outside of the household and within the household are limited and not given their actual monetary value. Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 felt like a mixture of “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and The Vegetarian by Han Kang, especially because of how the author shows how Kim Jiyoung’s mental health is affected by the sexism she encounters in accumulating doses throughout her life. If anything, this book reinforces how structures of oppression – in this case, patriarchy – burrow into people’s hearts and souls, such that anyone who cares about mental health should also care about dismantling societal injustices too.I give this book three stars just because I felt distant from the characters and their emotions and relationships. I feel like this novel did an excellent job of portraying sexism and its consequences, though I wanted more depth from various characters and relationships. I am not implying that the characters felt unrealistic – the complete obliviousness and complicity of so many men in this novel felt so apt and well-described – rather I wanted more insight about the main character’s relationships with her siblings or if those relationships disappeared after the main character had her first child. Or the author could have allocated more time spent to the main character’s feelings surrounding grief and loss of the opportunities she could have had if not for sexism. Perhaps these aspects of the novel were lost in the translation of the novel though. Thus I would still recommend Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 for those interested in learning more about sexism and patriarchy in South Korea....more",Notes are private!,0,147,1,"Nov 12, 2020","Nov 14, 2020","Jun 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46041199-kim-jiyoung-born-1982

When she’s at her peak, I love Dolly Alderton’s writing – she has a warm, distinct, and smart voice, with the right amount of humor thrown in. This book felt like a coming-of-age memoir about Dolly’s relationships both with people around her and herself. I really liked how she shared the hard-won wisdom she acquired through experiences such as experiencing her best friend get engaged, some tumultuous relationships with men, and navigating therapy and her own self-development. There were quite a few emotional moments that hit me hard, like when she wrote about her fear of her friendship with Farly changing due to Farly’s romantic relationship developing, or her missing the oodles of time she had in her late teens and her twenties. I think the combination of Alderton’s self-aware honesty and the quality of her writing is what makes her emotional disclosure feel so rewarding to me as a reader. And, as a 28-year-old who’s had similar experiences to her – though with a lot of different social identities, lol – I found much of her perspective relatable. What I cherish about this book the most is that even though romantic love is discussed quite a bit, it’s clear that Alderton genuinely prioritizes her relationships with her friends and with herself, which is also how I live my life.I give this book four stars instead of five because it could have been more streamlined. There were several sections especially in the first half that I thought could’ve been cut, that seemed extraneous or like filler. Still, the non-filler parts of this book won me over for sure....more",Notes are private!,6,68,1,"Feb 22, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Jun 23, 2020",,,view (with text),/book/show/34427921-everything-i-know-about-love

I liked his centering of queer Black love between two enslaved men in his debut novel The Prophets. I also enjoyed the complexity he imbued within his female characters. So often in m/m-centered stories women are underdeveloped or used as props in the male characters’ self-growth. However, I sensed a lot of Jones Jr. layered themes of race, gender, and sexuality throughout The Prophets.The execution of the novel on a stylistic level decreased my enjoyment. Sometimes the prose felt a bit overwrought, like the descriptions sometimes veered toward abstraction instead of staying grounded in the moment. I also think the back and forth between multiple characters, while effective in showcasing different points of views, made it more difficult to fully connect with the story.

When We Were InfiniteMy favorite fiction book of 2021 so far by far, and one of those books that make me feel grateful for my ability to read at all. When We Were Infinite follows Beth Claire, a high schooler in California who belongs with her close circle of friends, Sunny Chen, Grace Nakamura, Brandon Lin, and Jason Tsou. Beth’s relationship with her parents isn’t great, but she’s found love and connection in her friend group who’ve supported her even if sometimes she questions how much she fits in. This friend group’s bond is tested when Beth and Brandon witness a cruel act of violence in Jason’s home. Beth and her friend group do their best to support Jason afterward, but that doesn’t stop Jason from making a decision that fractures their group even further. Beth is forced to reckon with how much of herself she’s willing to give to Jason and her friends, even if giving means sacrificing what might be best for herself.I loved so many things about When We Were Infinite so it feels difficult knowing where to start. I guess I’ll begin by writing that I loved Beth’s realness as our main character and how much depth Kelly Loy Gilbert gives her. Beth has so many likable qualities like her compassion for her friends, her talent and passion for music and playing the violin, and her desire for connection. At the same time, Gilbert gives her realistic flaws, like her desperation for her friends to want her and support her and never leave her. What amazes me about Gilbert’s writing is how she so thoroughly and deeply characterizes Beth and shows how her shortcomings stem from her relationship with her absent father. Gilbert portrays Beth’s relationship with her father through vivid, well-written flashbacks and then launches us into the present with how those scenes affect Beth’s psyche now. Throughout the novel I felt like I was right there with Beth when things went badly for her in her childhood and when she wanted to compensate for those events through her current friendships. Just like how she made me care about the characters in her fantastic novel Picture Us in The Light, Kelly Loy Gilbert led me to care so freaking much about Beth in When We Were Infinite. When she struggled, I felt so much for her, and when she grew toward the end of the novel, I wanted to stand up and cheer (i.e., blast Blackpink loudly in her honor).I also adored the tight-knit East Asian friend circle in this book. Beth and Jason receive the most character development and it would have been understandably difficult to give everyone as much depth with the limited number of pages. However, Gilbert makes every character distinct enough, like Grace with her cheeriness, Sunny’s exploration of her queerness, and Brandon and his affability. I loved experiencing the power of friendship in these pages, how even though Beth’s father was absent, she still found healthy and beautiful connection in her friends. Even when the heteronormative nuclear family fails, we still can cultivate love with our friends. At the same time, Gilbert portrays how friendships can falter too. She shows how Beth, Grace, Brandon, and Sunny don’t know how to best support Jason nor to do they really have the adequate resources to do so when Jason goes through a painful family situation. She highlights how Beth projects her fears about abandonment onto her friends in her most insecure moments. However, throughout the novel Gilbert instills hope about the power of friendship, such as through scenes with Beth even just having meaningful yet authentic-feeling conversations with her friends (Beth and Sunny’s friendship is one of my favorites I’ve ever read, btw). I texted my two best friends and told them how much I love them after I finished this book last night because it got me that deep into my feels. Finally, just as in Picture Us in the Light, Gilbert intertwines so many meaningful and moving themes within Beth’s narrative without the story ever feeling bloated or overextended. For example, Gilbert writes about intergenerational trauma and how that affects Beth’s mother as well as Beth’s relationship with her mother. Their relationship stood out to me as one of the most poignant parts of the book given how Gilbert humanizes both characters while making clear their love for one another. When We Were Infinite also includes realistic depictions of mental health (e.g., panic attacks and anxiety, suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt, so trigger warning for that) and help-seeking through therapy. And of course, I loved the East Asian representation in this book, how Gilbert includes content like anti-Asian racial microaggressions while still centering the resiliency and beauty of Beth’s friend group. Ugh, I’m so in love with this book and Kelly Loy Gilbert as a writer. Superb writing, superb protagonist, superb everything. As someone who’s dealt with trauma due to having an absent father and as someone who had a close-knit friend circle in high school with other femmes of color with various family/mental health issues, this book made me feel nostalgic for my past while also happy about my current journey as a mental health provider. It would be a disservice to try to boil down the magic of this novel into one thing, and at the same time as I close out this  I’m again struck by the sheer empathy Gilbert pours into this novel: Beth’s empathy for her friends, our empathy for Beth, and finally Beth leaning into empathy for herself. I feel like this compassion both for others and ourselves is something we can all learn from....more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Mar 11, 2021","Mar 14, 2021","Jun 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892106-when-we-were-infinite

In terms Liked this book for its blunt discussion of racism and caste discrimination, though at times its analysis felt rather simple or superficial. In terms of positives, I appreciate Caste for its international perspective. A lot of books on race write about race within the context one country, whereas Isabel Wilkerson compares and contrasts the United States, India, and Nazi Germany. Wilkerson does a great job too of showing how many anti-Black racist events within the United States occurred not too long ago. In part because of the myth of a post-racial society, we often believe that things like slavery and segregation occurred way back when, when in reality those racist events happened relatively recently and still manifest today through mass incarceration and voter suppression. I appreciated Wilkerson’s more provocative or deeper insights, such as how a lot of people in lower castes will try to assimilate and desire proximity to upper castes (yikes), as well as how these issues of caste extend into arenas ranging from disenfranchisement in academia to nastiness in interpersonal interactions.Sometimes I wanted more from this book’s structure and its recommendations about challenging the caste system. The book’s thesis and argument style feels a bit simplistic in that early on Wilkerson establishes the idea of castes. Then, she describes several racist events, and at the end of each description she comments about how the event exemplifies the presence and maintenance of castes. I desired more innovative, less repetitive writing that delved deeper into the systemic, international mechanisms that perpetuate castes. Goodreads er Chetana raises issue with the simplicity of Wilkerson’s international analysis in her , which I agree with. The solutions and action steps toward the end of the book felt pretty surface-level too. While radical empathy and recognizing each other’s humanity is great, I’m additionally interested in specific, systemic, actionable ways we can dismantle white supremacy and caste discrimination. I do think it’s important that the racist events Wilkerson describes in this book are acknowledged, though I’m not sure those more familiar with racism will learn much from reading Caste, aside from some of the introductory international analysis. I’d be curious for writers to include more about how Asian and Latinx individuals fit into the American caste system as well as how intersectionality plays into it. In terms of books about racism and anti-racism, I’d still recommend Sister Outsider by Audre Lorde, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race by Reni Eddo-Longe, and So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo....more",Notes are private!,-1,335,1,"Aug 14, 2020","Aug 18, 2020","Jun 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51152447-caste

The novel follows an unnamed eighteen-year-old pregnant pizza girl, who feels suffocated by the care of her supportive mother and doting boyfriend and haunted by the death of her alcoholic father. Early in the novel she meets Jenny, a stay-at-home mother who orders pizza with pickles on it. Our protagonist develops an obsession with Jenny and wants everything to do with her. This infatuation spirals into some very unfortunate events that speak to our protagonist’s complicated and damaged heart.I so appreciated how Jean Kyoung Frazier showed her protagonist’s more nuanced and uncomfortable emotions. The protagonist of Pizza Girl feels frustrated and annoyed with her mother and boyfriend even though they do their best to care for her. She cannot quite let go of how her father failed her and drinks alcohol, even while pregnant, to cope. Instead of delving into the root issues of what looks like perinatal depression, she develops a fantasy surrounding a stay-at-home mother she delivers a pizza to. Frazier constructs our protagonist in a way that her struggles feel so earnest and even relatable, though her experiences are quite unique – her longing for a different life, her inability to shake her past, and her questioning of herself and her place in the world all resonated.I give this book three stars because I feel positively toward it though I felt it could have been further fleshed out. For example, Frazier does an excellent job portraying the ennui in our protagonist’s relationship with her boyfriend, but the development and/or unpacking of that relationship feels like it got cut short, like there is more we could have seen. I also wanted to know more about our protagonist and her mother’s relationship with whiteness and white supremacy; early in the book the protagonist reflects on her mother’s preoccupation with “Americanness,” which I read as code for whiteness, and I wanted to understand how that influenced their lives. I liked how Frazier wrote the protagonist’s journey with mourning her dad though, her poignant, nonlinear, and unwieldy journey of grief for a man who should have treated her and her mother so much better.In some ways I hesitate to recommend this novel because it feels like a snapshot of something greater, yet I do think it may appeal to those who want a quick yet interesting read, especially those who find the synopsis intriguing. I feel curious about what Frazier will write next after this unconventional debut....more",Notes are private!,1,243,1,"Jun 09, 2020","Jun 11, 2020","Jun 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44088751-pizza-girl

At the heart of You Exist Too Much lies addiction: addI enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would given its lower star rating on Goodreads. At the heart of You Exist Too Much lies addiction: addiction to love, romantic love, specifically romantic love that involves unavailable older women, false idealizations of potential partners, and rejecting healthy intimacy. Though other ers may have found the writing style jarring, I found it psychologically compelling for Zaina Arafat to use flashbacks to demonstrate how difficult incidents from our protagonist’s past affect her relational issues in the present. I appreciated how Arafat wrote from the perspective of a bisexual Palestinian American woman who makes mistakes and has deep emotions. Our protagonist’s mother receives a nuanced characterization and humanization that does not excuse her mistreatment of our protagonist. What I most loved about this novel is its unflinching portrayal of addiction. Arafat shows in punchy sentences the root causes of our protagonist’s love addiction, such as being caught in between two cultures, her mother’s unpredictable rages and withdrawals, and to an extent society’s glorification of romantic love. A few passes took my breath away, both in how they reminded me of my clinical work with people with substance use and codependency issues, as well as my own recovery from an eating disorder. Arafat captures the nitty gritty parts of the recovery process, ranging from those solitary, unsexy moments when you have to make the right decision even though it hurts while you’re sitting all alone in your quiet apartment, to the relapses and slow yet steady gains when you heal in the right direction for you. I felt connected to our protagonist’s pursuit of a more healthful relational life, her struggles and hard-won victories along the way.My only critique of this novel: I felt that the protagonist’s relationship with (view spoiler)[Anouk (hide spoiler)] at the end of the novel moved way too fast. I wanted a more slowed down, detailed showing of how our protagonist (view spoiler)[worked through her issues with relational intimacy to the point where she and Anouk could trust one another in a healthy way. While I get that the protagonist moved past Matias and Tara which exemplified her growth, I felt like the author skimmed past the more interesting parts of the protagonist’s relationship with Anouk (hide spoiler)]. Despite this pacing issue, I would still recommend this novel to those interested in the idea of love addiction and who want to develop empathy for a protagonist who is flawed, while still trying her best to be better....more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,Sep 2021,"Sep 04, 2021","Jun 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41720140-you-exist-too-much

As a gay Asian American (gender-flexible) man I feel like I loved this book so freaking much and have so much gratitude to Neel Patel for writing it. As a gay Asian American (gender-flexible) man I feel like I have waited forever for a book that centers a queer man of color that isn’t solely about that character’s queer trauma or his unhealthy relationship with another man, often a white man. Patel accomplished that and more with this amazing debut novel.Tell Me How to Be follows an Indian American family with roots in a predominantly white Midwestern town. Akash Amin, an R&B songwriter living in Los Angeles, has since moved away from his hometown, yet he still feels a lot of shame about his gayness and how he ended things with the first boy he ever loved back home. Akash’s mother, Renu, also feels shame about a secret relationship she hid from her entire family, especially now as the one-year anniversary of her husband’s death approaches. When Renu decides to move back to London, Akash and his older brother Bijal return to their childhood home to help her pack her things, and in the process Renu and Akash confront the painful, unresolved dynamics of their past so that hopefully, they can move forward.For the first 50 to 100 pages of this book I honestly wasn’t sure whether I’d give it more than three stars. The transitions between Akash and Renu’s perspectives felt a bit too quick, and a couple of times Patel’s writing struck me as a bit tell-y instead of show-y. However, I found myself completely immersed and impressed with the novel when it transitioned into Part II; I read the remainder of the book in one night, awestruck. Here are the main three things I loved about Tell Me How to Be that have made it one of my favorite novels ever:1. Patel writes beautifully about how our pasts influence our present behaviors, especially within our relationships. For the first 100 pages of the book or so we witness Akash struggle with a substance use disorder while messing up a bunch of his relationships, while Renu acts somewhat coldly to various people around her, especially Akash. In Part II, Patel does an excellent job of showing how Akash’s childhood experiences of bullying and othering due to his queerness affect his subsequent feelings of shame and disconnection. Similarly, Patel highlights how Renu’s strong will yet gendered difficulty to cultivate agency cut her off from her ideal life, so she then displaces her feelings of anger and frustration onto her family members. The characters in this novel make human mistakes and we witness enough of their backstory to understand why and cultivate empathy. Also, as someone who *loves* a good slow burn romance between queer men of color, I basically died and then was resurrected and then died again with the whole section on Akash and Parth. Like I’m literally writing this  from another world while listening to “I Can’t Stop Me” by Twice because the book resonated with me so much.2. Patel portrays the effects of racism, classism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression against and within the Indian American community while also showing how his characters resist these damaging forces, all with nuance and from a character-driven perspective. While I initially eye-rolled at the inclusion of Jacob, Akash’s white boyfriend at the beginning of the book, I grew to appreciate both the explicit and subtler ways Patel interweaved issues of racism and other oppressions throughout Tell Me How to Be: Akash’s first love Parth’s initial cruelty toward his own parents for speaking accented English, the way Renu judged Parth’s parents because they owned a motel and lacked class status, how Bijal made a comment or two toward Akash in their childhood years about how Akash better not be gay, etc. At the same time, Patel illustrates how his characters resist oppression, such as Akash’s relationship with Jaden, a queer Black man, as well as through Renu’s refusal to render herself as a submissive Indian American woman in a sea of whiteness (there’s one scene with Renu and her book club that literally made me scream in a good way; if you read the book you’ll know which one I’m referring to.) 3. There’s hope and healing in this novel! Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of pain and loss, hurtful miscommunication, and racism. At the same time, the ending of Tell Me How to Be points to how these characters can reckon with their pasts and take steps toward forgiving themselves to let go of their shame, as well as practice more compassionate communication and actually actively listen to one another. I loved this aspect of the novel especially in relation to Akash’s character, because I feel like so many narratives surrounding queer men only detail queer pain and at times even glorify unhealthy relationships. While I’ve enjoyed queer young adult books centering teens and young adults of color such as Picture Us in the Light by Kelly Loy Gilbert and Gives Light by Rose Christo, Tell Me How to Be stands out as one of the first to focus both on an adult queer man of color’s pain and his steps toward healing.Overall I recommend this book to everyone. Again, I’m so grateful to Neel Patel for writing it. As someone who can sometimes feel hopeless about the state of white supremacy in the world as well as queer men of color’s socioemotional development, I’m feeling hopeful after reading this novel. This hopefulness warms me and reminds me of why I always come back to reading....more",Notes are private!,1,186,1,"Dec 16, 2021","Dec 18, 2021","Jun 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49247150-tell-me-how-to-be

I most loved The Groom Will Keep His Name for Matt Ortile’s honest, intelligent writing about the colonization of the Philippines and how that colonization manifests in his own life, as well as the steps he takes to resist it. He writes about colonization, tokenization, and fetishization in a way that educates the reader without taking us out of his overall narrative, the sign of a talented essay writer who can blend the political and the personal. I also appreciated the small yet specific details he included throughout the collection, like how he would buy and eat a pie for one while going about his single life in New York as well as how he played a Harry Potter RPG online while visiting his dad in the Philippines earlier in his life. Ortile also describes his sexual and romantic life in explicit detail which I found entertaining, especially as a fellow gay Asian American man. I’m definitely not into interacting with men as much as Ortile because I generally find men a waste of my time, so it’s nice to live vicariously through his escapades so I know what that path would’ve felt like if I had taken it. My only constructive critique of The Groom Will Keep His Name is that I wanted just a bit deeper self-analysis and exploration at times. The Goodreads description of this book says that Ortile “brings us on his journey toward radical self-love” and I wanted more of that radical self-love, tbh! For example, I feel that Ortile does a nice job of naming patterns of white supremacy in his dating life, such as how he dated a lot of white men and glorified them in large part due to their whiteness. While reading these sections though, I kept asking: what next? I wanted him to go deeper, to share more about actively fighting and resisting whiteness, to name how amatonormavitiy may have made him position his self-worth in the context of romance in the first place, etc. At one point he writes about wanting a man to rescue him. While he challenges that notion and describes how his immigration experience may have contributed to that wanting, I still felt that he could have written more about really loving himself beyond his romantic relationship to a man, even if he does desire one in his life.Overall, I did enjoy this essay collection. I recognize I may be going tough on Ortile because I’m also a gay Asian American man and have certain ideas about how we should mobilize to dismantle white supremacy and patriarchy in the queer community. At the same time, Ortile accomplishes so much with this collection, like actively talking about race and resistance and keeping his last name, mentioning going to therapy, and presenting an unfiltered perspective into his emotional life. I hope he continues to grow and to flourish, and here’s to more reading and celebrating more queer writers of color in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Aug 31, 2020","Sep 05, 2020","Jun 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52595434-the-groom-will-keep-his-name

Killing the Black Body covers several topics related to Black women’s health, including the forced sterilization of Black women amidst the birth control movement, the racist criminalization of Black women using drugs, the stigmatization of Black women on welfare, and the extent to which reproductive technologies favor wealthy white parents over Black people in need of services. I learned a lot from this book, especially in relation to how reproductive justice has often focused on the needs of middle class and more affluent white women at the cost of Black women’s wellbeing. Dorothy Roberts intertwines legal, race, and gender analysis to address these issues and shows these injustices’ roots in history, all the way back to the enslavement of Black women and their lack of reproductive agency then. She offers solutions that emphasize expanding the definition of liberty as well as the government’s role in advancing both social and individual justice.I would recommend this book to anyone and especially those in the fields of healthcare, social work, and similar settings where we think we are doing “good” when in reality we may be perpetuating misogynoir and classism. Though published in the 1990s this book’s topics are still relevant to today.

Desmond Cole writes with passion about anti-Black police violence in Canada as well as the rA powerful book about fighting white supremacy in Canada. Desmond Cole writes with passion about anti-Black police violence in Canada as well as the racism and xenophobia directed toward Indigenous folx and immigrants. His analysis is incisive and delves deep into the impacts of colonization, as evidenced by this quote:“White supremacy is a hierarchy, with whiteness at the top. Indigenous peoples of the Americas, whose lands have been colonized by white settlers, occupy a low place on this hierarchy – white supremacy is trying to replace them. But Black people, whom British and French colonists brought to this land in chains four centuries ago, are the bottom of the ladder. We are the scapegoats. Whiteness is constantly defined and reproduced through anti-blackness.”I appreciated how Cole dispels the myth that Canada is a post-racial paradise as well as the false belief that police brutality only occurs in the United States. Furthermore, I loved how he shared his many courageous moments of speaking truth to power, such as how he explicitly named the Toronto Star’s silencing of his activist efforts and his writing about racism. I feel like challenging people and institutions with power so openly takes a lot of guts, and Cole does not shy away from doing so. Though The Skin We’re In includes a lot of brutal content about Canada’s racism and xenophobia, Cole structures the book in a way to give us hope that through direct action and advocacy, we can disrupt systems of oppression and change the lives of marginalized people for the better....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Nov 29, 2020","Dec 04, 2020","May 30, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50870424-the-skin-we-re-in

I most appreciated Sejal Shah’s guileless yet intelligent writing style. Though she touches on potentially weighty topics such as race, representation, and human connection and loss, her somewhat informal voice helped the collection feel intimate and personal. Some themes that stood out to me included how different it felt to grow up in the United States before Indian American representation in media started to flourish, as well as Shah’s dedication to writing even after facing difficult career setbacks.Though the brevity of these essays made the collection a quick read, I felt that Shah could have gone into more depth in several sections to more thoroughly flesh out certain ideas or personal insights (e.g., what losing a certain friend of hers meant to her). I also found the first essay, “Skin,” pretty offensive, as it draws generalizing comparisons between Black, Indian, and white boys (e.g., that Indian boys are shorter than white boys and therefore less attractive, that Black boys are always “trying to cop a feel.”) I get that she wrote the essay in 1999 and I know I’ve written things over a decade ago that I don’t believe or endorse now, however, I wish she had added a postscript – like she did for a different essay in the collection – or touched on how her ideas from “Skin” have changed in a different essay....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Dec 24, 2021","Dec 26, 2021","May 29, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53106817-this-is-one-way-to-dance

I wish every graduate program would make this book required reading, both for faculty and for graduate students. The women in these essays write about so many pressing and pertinent topics, such as how higher education brands itself as caring about “diversity” and “inclusion” while perpetuating racism and sexism against its own members, the importance of not becoming the institution and embodying its oppressive norms, and the psychological and physical toll of experiencing gendered racism on a daily basis as a woman of color in academia. I loved the rawness of these narratives and how the editors included perspectives that span different racial/ethnic groups, gender identities, and class statuses The women in this essay collection provide tangible strategies to combat racism and sexism, ranging from individual-level solutions like self-affirmation to more systems-oriented approaches like challenging the administration to rally around supporting women of color and eradicating racism and implicit bias.I appreciate the courage of these women for sharing their stories, especially because academia often thrives on oppressed people staying silent so that these injustices can continue. I feel more empowered to serve as an ally and to use my male and cis privilege to support women of color, as well as more aware of challenges I may face as a queer Asian American who at this point wants to pursue a career within academia.

I appreciate Jessica Jung for giving us an insider look into the K-pop industry. As a huge BlackPink stan – oSuch an entertaining, drama-filled book! I appreciate Jessica Jung for giving us an insider look into the K-pop industry. As a huge BlackPink stan – or at least a stan of their music and artistry – as well as someone who consumed K-Pop throughout middle and high school, I liked having the curtain pulled back to show some of the industry’s not-so-great and downright toxic elements. In Shine, Jung writes about Rachel, a Korean American teen who has trained at DB Entertainment for six years, waiting for her chance to debut. Rachel’s life heats up when she encounters Jason Lee, a K-pop star and DB’s golden boy. Rachel encounters drama with Jason, with her fellow trainees, with the public and with her company’s execs as she works her hardest so that she has a chance to debut and to shine.I most liked how Shine outright exposes and names several problematic parts of the K-Pop industry. Jung does an excellent job pointing out the sexism in the industry and how K-pop male idols are often glorified whereas female idols are mercilessly critiqued. These portions of the book reminded me of the toxic ways in which Sulli from f(x) was treated by netizens, as well as how companies such as YG treat female idols like 2NE1 (e.g., calling them ugly) as well as many other incidents in the industry. Jung also names the complete lack of control trainees and idols actually have in their lives, especially female trainees and idols. These portions of the book made me reflect on capitalism and the extent to which a company can “own” an individual, thus eliminating their free will all under the pretense of wanting the best for them. Despite these positive aspects of Shine, I wanted to feel more of a connection to Rachel, our protagonist. Her romance with Jason took up a lot of the plot, and I would have preferred to spend more of those pages learning about her internal motivations for pursuing K-pop as well as her internal reactions to all the toxicity she experienced. I also felt sad that her friendship with Akari got so sidelined in comparison to her relationship with Jason. Finally, while the book names and calls out sexism pretty well, it does portray some scenes with disordered eating behaviors and calorie counting in which I’m not sure those behaviors are explicitly called out. Furthermore, Jason is portrayed as especially attractive because he’s half Asian and half white, which I think is a function of white supremacy – that multiracial people who are half white in particular are more attractive or especially attractive compared to monoracial Asians or Asian Americans.Still, this book gives me a lot to chew on. The relationship between Mina and Rachel made me think a lot about Jimin from AOA bullying Mina for ten years. Like, K-pop idols are put in a competitive, cutthroat environment with each other for over half a decade and it feels odd to me to assume that somehow those who debut were magically best friends the whole time. Like, I’m not denying that there probably are genuine and loving friendships and community there, but hopefully companies are taking measures to promote that camaraderie. I further hope that somehow the public starts calling for more larger-sized, not-so-light-skinned idols. This book also made me think about the mental health of trainees and K-pop idols and how I hope the industry is taking efforts to promote mental wellbeing and giving their idols more agency. Mainly I hope Jisoo, Rosé, Jennie and Lisa are okay and thriving and not just putting up a happy front because YG tells them too! Stan their songs “As If It’s Your Last,” “How You Like That,” and “Lovesick Girls” (and also continue to think critically about the K-pop industry while you do so)....more",Notes are private!,0,81,1,"Oct 07, 2020","Oct 11, 2020","May 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50855956-shine

Beyond the importance of featuring both a queer Asian man and a queer Black man, BryaI so loved the representation of queer men of color in Memorial. Beyond the importance of featuring both a queer Asian man and a queer Black man, Bryan Washington imbues these characters with depth. Mike is a fat Japanese American chef who has a lot of sex instead of confronting his internal issues. Benson is a Black, HIV positive day care teacher who is more on the timid side though he too also bottles up how his family trauma affects him. Washington highlights their racialized experiences (e.g., microaggressions they receive from white men) and portrays Mike’s experience with fatness and Benson’s experience with HIV with sensitivity and care. For example, he writes one scene in which Mike and Benson have sex for one of the first times and Mike tells Benson they can turn the lights off if he wants, which made me feel so sad, even though Benson responds in a considerate way. I also enjoyed how this novel finally centers an interracial relationship that does not involve a white gay man. I would love to read more books about queer Asian, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous folx dating one another and the nuances of that experience.I further appreciated the sharp characterizations of both Mike and Benson in relation to how their families affect their psychological health. When reading Memorial, the phrase “queer men of color are allowed to be messed up because of their families too.” Through compact yet affective dialogue, Washington shows how Mike and Benson’s painful relationships with their families – especially their fathers – negatively impacts their own communication patterns and how they feel about themselves and others. There are funny scenes that involve Benson and Mike’s mother, Mitsuko, yet a heartfelt and well-written feeling of sadness and loss pervades Memorial even in its more relaxed moments.Despite these positive features, I give Memorial three stars because Benson and Mike’s relationship is so, so dysfunctional and not really a pleasure to read. I feel like my rating shows how ratings of anything are subjective as heck – like Washington definitely does a five-star job of portraying three-dimensional, emotionally-damaged queer men of color. Yet, my three-star rating comes more from my own feelings about the book, which I recognize stem from my biases and individual preferences. For most of the book, it appears as if Benson and Mike pretty much just dislike one another and project their unresolved traumas onto one another. For example, there are a few sections of dialogue in which Mike will begin to speak and Benson will immediately cut him off with something along the lines of like “please stop fucking with me, Mike” or something along those lines. Again, these unhealthy relationship dynamics make sense given Mike and Benson’s internal issues which neither of them has taken intentional steps to resolve. Still, I wanted more growth from either character, like more healing or even self-awareness about their patterns and what they need to do to shed some of their inner damage. I sense that readers who feel more okay with observing these patterns of behavior without much growth will like this book more than I did.Overall, I look forward to reading more of Washington’s writing and I did enjoy Memorial more than Lot mostly because these characters had more room to breathe and show their varied dimensions. My fav m/m romance book of 2020 is still Such a Lonely, Lovely Road by Kagiso Lesego Molope though I would still encourage people who are interested in Memorial to give it a try....more",Notes are private!,0,358,0,not set,not set,"May 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48902303-memorial

While her debut novel Homegoing followed seven generations, in Transcendent Kingdom 4.5 starsUgh yes Yaa Gyasi has the range and I love that for her! While her debut novel Homegoing followed seven generations, in Transcendent Kingdom we delve deep into one immigrant Ghanaian family living in Alabama, in the United States. The story focuses on Gifty, a fifth-year doctoral candidate in neuroscience at Stanford whose brother died of a heroin overdose after sustaining a knee injury playing high school basketball. Soon after, Gifty’s mother tries to die by suicide, before settling into a severe depression. We follow Gifty as she tries to figure out what to do when her mother comes back to live with her in California after a long stay in Ghana. Gyasi uses flashbacks to give us a closer look into Gifty’s past experiences with her family and how they have affected her in the present.I so appreciated how Gyasi tackles so many freaking important topics yet somehow managed to do them all justice: science, religion and faith, addiction, racism, grief, and more. All of these topics bled into each other in such beautiful and painful ways and elevated my investment in the novel. I will highlight two of the most standout features of this novel that motivated me to round up to five stars. First, I felt that Gyasi did a fantastic job exploring the tension between religion and science from within Gifty’s perspective. Even as an agnostic atheist, my heart clenched reading some of the passages about Gifty’s relationship with faith and how much it both meant to her and let her down sometimes. Her wrestling with religion felt so nuanced and so grounded within her own life unique experiences; Gyasi highlights how faith and science can co-exist in a way that honors people of color’s worldviews while also acknowledging the benefits and applications of science.I also loved, loved, loved how Gyasi portrayed how Gifty’s grief and trauma affected her intimate relationships. The way she used flashbacks to show how Gifty shut herself off from Anne and Raymond because she had not processed at all her brother’s death – wow, truly an insert chef’s kiss meme/emoji level of skill. I think I literally sighed in pleasure (yes, I derive that much enjoyment from characters’ emotional healing/growth processes) reading Gifty’s gradual and powerful opening up to her friend Katherine and her lab mate Han. There was one scene in particular where Gifty speaks to Han and within that same scene flashes back to an earlier interaction with Raymond and my goodness, I had to put my Nook down for a second just to let myself fully appreciate Gyasi’s quality of writing. The only reason I lean toward 4.5 stars is because for the beginning and some of the middle of the book I felt a bit of a distance from Gifty. Yes, I think the distance makes sense given that, especially in the beginning of the book, Gifty puts distance between herself and everyone. However, I felt remember feeling similarly reading Gyasi’s Homegoing. At times I almost felt like I was reading a more intellectual script of a character than actually feeling immersed in the character’s lived experience, like a sense of “ah, so in this passage Gyasi is showing Gifty coming to terms with how she shouldn’t have judged her brother’s addiction or “ah, this passage depicts how Gifty always recognized her second-place spot next to her brother.” However, I do think this worked out more in Gyasi’s favor with this novel given Gifty’s coping strategy of distancing herself and compartmentalizing. Toward the latter half of the novel I felt much more pulled into her life and her emotional experience.Overall, another amazing novel by Yaa Gyasi and I’m looking forward to reading what she writes next. I didn’t touch on these components as much in this , but I also felt impressed by how she depicted the role of racism in making the Black men in Gifty’s life so insecure and damaged. I’m teaching a course (my first course as instructor of record, wowow) that’s gonna focus on addiction starting next week and thus also appreciated how Gyasi wrote about the feelings of stigma and shame that accompany having a loved one with a substance use disorder. Ugh, again, such a great book and would totally recommend to those who enjoy fiction at all....more",Notes are private!,0,149,1,"Dec 25, 2020","Dec 28, 2020","May 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49531757-transcendent-kingdom

Anyway, I think Layla Saad writes with great intelligence and eloquence about topics such as white fragility, white exceptionalism, and white silence, as well as anti-Blackness and how people can hold themselves accountable to engaging in anti-white supremacist action. She includes interesting prompts for self-reflection and tangible action steps throughout the book. Would definitely recommend for folks who aren’t as familiar with antiracism topics or folks who want a refresher.As a bit of an aside, a topic I hope gets explored more in future books in this area includes the way that people of color can perpetuate racism and discrimination against our own. Not just between different groups like anti-Blackness in the Asian community (which is definitely prevalent), but also how people of color who are “successful” in predominantly white spaces can turn against younger outspoken people of color. When I read about white fragility and also how white people can get defensive when called out/in, I definitely thought of instances I’ve observed when people of color have perpetuated those same dynamics of fragility and defensiveness against members of their own group.

A Burning follows Jivan, a Muslim girl who is accused of executing a terrorist attack based on a Facebook comment she made. Her fate ends up resting in the hands of PT Sir, a self-serving gym teacher who tries to climb the ranks of a ring-wing political party, and Lovely, a hopeful outcast whose acting and singing ambitions imbue the novel with some sense of warmth. The story spirals at a quick pace after the initial accusation against Jivan, as we are left to see whether justice will prevail or if Jivan will suffer due to inequities beyond her individual control.I think The Burning makes an excellent political statement. Through PT Sir and Lovely’s perspectives, we see how people betray their own values and basic human compassion to advance their own livelihoods and careers. Though this book is set in India, the themes of class inequity political corruption apply in many other settings too. As Caroline Tew states eloquently in her  (which contains spoilers for the plot) Megha Majumdar does an excellent job of showing how marginalized groups will betray one another to advance and gain power in an overall discriminatory system. As someone who lives in the United States, this theme reminded me a lot of Asian Americans who try to gain power and appeal to whiteness instead of showing solidarity with other marginalized racial/ethnic groups, affluent white women who prioritize class advancement and individual empowerment over solidarity with women of color and women of lower socioeconomic status, etc.The only reason I give the novel a lower rating of 3.5 stars is because of my subjective enjoyment of it. The Burning does a 5-star job of relaying its political message, without a doubt. While I felt sad and angry for Jivan, I didn’t really connect with the characters overall, in part because I perceived them as vehicles for Majumdar’s overall political statement. Other ers have described the novel as hopeless which perhaps it is, though I think for some people hope really is a privilege and we with more power have to actively create the conditions where hope may shine through. Overall, while I didn’t connect much with the characters – which I generally prioritize in my book ratings – I have huge respect for Majumdar’s mission with this novel and I am glad it’s getting its fair share of publicity....more",Notes are private!,1,146,1,"Dec 29, 2020",Jan 2021,"May 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51792100-a-burning

Angela Chen writes in an understandable and intelligent way about the nuanced and non-homogenous forms of asexuality, focusing on how we live in a society that glorifies sexual desire as default. I loved the many clear examples she provided of society’s over-fixation on sex and its treatment of sexual attraction as the norm. She includes a variety of ace voices that span intersections related to religion, sexual orientation, race, and more. Chen keeps this book interesting by writing about how asexuality intertwines with so many pressing societal topics, such as masculine gender roles, the rise of feminism and how being into kink or polyamory is often automatically (mis)equated with radical politics, and the importance of including ace folx in disability spaces and disabled folx in ace spaces. As someone who identifies as a relational anarchist, I loved the sections on the over-valuing of romance and amatonormativity. Here is a quote from that section:“The ubiquity of romantic subplots, even in books that aren’t romance novels, suggest that only stories with romance can involve big emotions and that romance is automatically more interesting than almost all the other stands of human experience. What if books focused more on the emotions that are generated from friendship, ambition, family, work? What if that intensity were just as elevated?”Overall I would highly recommend this book to those who want to learn more about asexuality. I will say that I am not asexual and I’ve been intrigued reading many five-star and highly positive s of this book from ace folx on Goodreads, as well as seeing a few one-star and more negative s of this book. So perhaps tune into that discourse too. One small yet important thing I didn’t love includes how toward the beginning of the book, there were a few times when Chen alluded to “attractive” people in society, and from my recollection those couple of times focused almost exclusively on white celebrities (and even if that had been because of something a friend or someone in real life said, that could have been pointed out). When the author mentions her romantic partner Noah, she refers to him as a straight white male who went to private school and took/takes vacations in France, yet didn’t really analyze that privilege or how it’s made him more able to act as a support system. I didn’t get the point of raising those dominant identities without critically interrogating them given how she does a nice job of doing that throughout the rest of the book. Anyway, I’ll end the  with another fabulous quote regarding amatonormativity:“Offering legal and social benefits only to the romantically attached suggests that the mere presence of romantic feeling elevates the care and deserves special protections, even though friendship and other forms of care, which can come with less obligation, can include more love, more feely given. Therefore, the legal and social privileges of marriage should be extended to all mutually consenting adults who wish for them.”...more",Notes are private!,0,148,1,"Oct 25, 2020","Oct 30, 2020","May 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52128695-ace

I so enjoyed this real and tender coming of age story of a gay Latino teen growing up in the Bronx. Charles Rice-Gonzalez captured the distinct vibe of the Bronx; I sensed his care for this community in the vibrant way he portrayed it. I loved reading about how our protagonist, Chulito, contends with so many forces – cultural norms surrounding masculinity, economic prospects, the physical safety of him and those he cares about – in relation to his sexual orientation. I feel like Chulito pays homage to this beautiful Latinx community instead of trying to appeal to white mainstream young adult fiction norms, though I think people of all races would benefit from reading the novel.I also appreciated Chulito’s relationship with Carlos. Their romance felt sweet, with some angst that did not turn toxic. I’m so here for healthy romances and friendships between queer people of color, especially when toxic relationships are so often glorified in queer literature. I thought the foundation of Chulito and Carlos’s relationship made sense (e.g., their shared connection to Hunts Point) and I liked how Rice-Gonzalez layered some romantic tension throughout the story without sacrificing the overall healthiness of their love for one another. Rice-Gonzalez wrote the more sensual scenes in the novel well, too, capturing Chulito’s specific stage of development in relation to his sexuality. While I found some of the phrasing awkward (e.g., “His auditory nerves twitched and his eyelids lifted slowly to reveal…”) which pulled me out of the narrative sometimes, I still enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to fans of queer fiction and realistic young adult fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Jan 10, 2022","Jan 17, 2022","May 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7756473-chulito

InSo appreciated this funny, vulnerable essay collection from Michael Arceneaux that centers on what it feels like to have immense student loan debt. In a wry, relatable tone, Arceneaux writes about the impact of debt on several facets of his life, ranging from his decision to seek or not seek medical care, his potential regret about choosing an artistic path or a more financially lucrative one, and his relationships with others and himself. Arceneaux frames this reflection on debt from the perspective of his salient social identities, such as his Blackness and queerness.I loved the candor and courage Arceneaux displayed by writing so openly about his student loan debt in I Don’t Want to Die Poor. Money is often such a taboo or stigmatized topic to discuss, which sucks because a lot of us live in capitalism and money thus governs a lot of what we do and how we operate in the world. Arceneaux names the shame that accompanies talking about money and does it anyway, which I found so helpful given how so many millennials and young folk in the United States are afflicted with massive debt. Though this topic may sound like a downer, because it is, Arceneaux writes in such a fun, conversational tone – while still maintaining the intelligence of his arguments – that the collection felt like a breeze to get through. I also appreciated the many references to Black and queer culture. Through these references, I felt like Arceneaux exhibited an ability to present himself fully on the page, without trying to make himself too palatable or understandable to white and straight readers.There were a few moments where I wanted just a bit more emotional depth from Arceneaux. He reaches these moments of depth in a few places, like when he writes about his mother or toward the end when he writes with raw honesty about investing in joy even with debt. The wry tone, while I think true to his character, obscured for me some of the emotional heights the essay could have reached. Though I recognize that tone may just be Arceneaux’s style and personality, which he does present well throughout the collection. Overall, would recommend to those interested in books written by queer BIPOC, especially if you’re looking for something that manages to address a heavy topic without feeling too heavy altogether. I wish Arceneaux the best and look forward to reading more of his work. Also, he mentions how a negative experience with a white male therapist discouraged him from seeking therapy again – if he or anyone else is reading this and is in a similar boat, please do keep trying to find a therapist who understands oppression of intersectionality! And inquire about sliding scale. Just my two cents as someone in the mental health field. ...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Jul 16, 2020","Jul 19, 2020","May 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49663570-i-don-t-want-to-die-poor

Linda Tuhiwai Smith writes with firm strength and intelligence about the history of imperialism and colonization and how indigenous communities have been exploited by researchers for a long time. She makes several well-reasoned points about the importance of actually giving research back to communities, as well as how the intention of the researcher doesn’t really matter when considering the impact of research on communities. She provides hope too such as by highlighting examples of indigenous scholarship and how indigenous researchers have formed deep bonds with their communities.As someone in academia considering an academic career long-term, I definitely want to internalize this book’s messages and act on them. From what I’ve observed and experienced, so much of academia is built on gatekeeping, ego-building (e.g., getting pubs for the sake of lengthening one’s CV and the system rewarding that), and competition and prestige, instead of centering actual community members.

Hunt tackles several important issues at the intersection of race and gender such as raising a Black son amidst the ongoing threat of police brutality, colorism in the beauty industry, and the high mortality rate of Black mothers. One unique aspect of this collection includes Hunt’s perspective as an American expat living in the United Kingdom. She writes about race and Blackness while navigating two different cultures that both have histories that involve anti-Black racism. I also appreciated Hunt’s earnest belief in herself and her own voice throughout the collection. She honors the challenges she and other Black women have gone through, while still expressing her beliefs and truths in a confident and self-assured way.I felt curious about the potential incorporation of more intersectionality in a few of these essays. For example, Hunt praises Barack Obama and Kamala Harris as Black politicians, though I wondered if she could have at the same time acknowledged Obama’s complicity in drone strikes that killed many civilians abroad as well as Harris’s past actions that have harmed sex workers. Hunt also writes about the nuances of how advancement in prestige does not protect Black folks from racism, and I felt that she could have used this sentiment as a launchpad into discussing Black capitalism and her views on it.

For those unfamiliar, MarshaI consider this memoir such a courageous accomplishment from a well-known clinician scientist in the field of Psychology. For those unfamiliar, Marsha Linehan pioneered Dialectical Behavior Therapy, a treatment designed to help those with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as well as suicidality, which has been applied to various other mental illnesses like substance use and disordered eating. In Building a Life Worth Living, she shares about her own experience with BPD and suicidality and thus fights the stigma that runs rampant in academic psychology against those with mental health issues. I felt so moved by her spiritual healing process and her dedication to helping others suffering from severe mental illness. I also appreciated her honesty about her academic experiences, such as the bias she faced from psychoanalytic folks as well as the sexism she fought during her journey to develop DBT.Part of me wanted her to take a bit of a stronger anti-stigma stance, though perhaps she already did her part by sharing her experience. I intend the commentary in this paragraph less as a critique of this memoir than as a general statement: you shouldn’t have to be a tenured professor at the end of your career (not to mention that she’s white) to be able to be open about your experiences with mental illness. As someone who’s faced mental health issues and is a scientist and a clinician, I’m thankful to Marsha for her sharing, because she shows that struggling with mental health doesn’t make you unfit for research or practice – rather, it can enhance your empathy and your understanding of what you study, especially if you’re self-aware and work through your issues. I hope that the field practices enhanced compassion and eliminates stigma for those who faced or face mental illness, and not just for successful white scholars either.Back to the memoir, I noticed a strong single-mindedness in relation to DBT which I think may help explain some other ers’ more lukewarm feelings. I personally did not mind how much Marsha tied everything back to DBT because I love DBT and find it so helpful both for myself and my clinical work. However, I think other aspects of this memoir could have benefitted from even a bit more development, instead of focusing on DBT so intensely. For example, when she writes about some of her stressors in early childhood, I recognized several gendered components such as desiring thinness and pressure to have a male romantic partner, yet these sociocultural factors did not receive much additional thought or attention. Another example includes when Marsha tells one of her students to not mention their experience with mental illness in an application, which unfortunately makes sense within the stigma-ridden academic system we exist in. However, I wish she had taken a step back and commented on this interaction further. From a behavioral perspective I can see why Marsha dedicates so much to DBT given the immense positive reinforcement she’s received from its development overall, and at the same time I wanted a bit more development from other areas (e.g., social justice issues) as well. Recommended for those who are interested in mental health, emotion regulation/dysregulation, and/or clinical science! For those who are looking for more of a traditional memoir, just come in ready to learn a lot about DBT itself....more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,"Sep 17, 2021","Sep 22, 2021","May 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43495368-building-a-life-worth-living

I come from the field of Psychology and grew up in a relatively wealthy area and family, so while I’ve grown to endorse things like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, I struggled to really understand the specific definitions of terms like neoliberalism, socialism, democratic socialism, etc. Why You Should Be a Socialist is a friendly and intelligent primer on these topics, such that Nathan Robinson writes in a welcoming way while still making passionate and convincing arguments for socialism. He writes about envisioning a more socialist world in which the class people are born into would not have such a bearing on their lives, medical care is provided to all regardless of people's ability to pay, and workers are no longer taken advantage of and abused by their bosses. He incorporates the concept of intersectionality and how class intersects with race so that his book does not just appeal to poor white people.Though I still have a lot to learn about labor justice, after reading this book I do identify as a democratic socialist. As at least one other Goodreads er noted, perhaps there is more Robinson could have included about proletariat revolutions, as well as voices of people of color, trans people, immigrants, and more who have been affected by capitalist accumulation and exploitation.

I found The Address Book a fascinating examination of the power This is gonna be a mediocre  because I did a mediocre job of reading this book. I found The Address Book a fascinating examination of the power of addresses and how they shape our lives. Like most if not everything, even possessing an address relates to how much privilege and power you have in society. Deirdre Mask makes this point in many different ways through her discussions of so many different historical and cultural contexts related to addresses. For example, her writing about how an address is very often necessary to even apply for a job or a medical appointment reinforced the importance of having an address and how much it sucks that an address can be difficult for so many people to attain. I say that I did a mediocre job reading this book because I felt like very little of the information actually stuck in my brain. I think my three-star rating stems more from a mismatch between me and the book than a flaw in the book. I prefer nonfiction that really delves into one central topic and comes back to that topic even if it approaches it from different angles. I felt like Mask went over so many different examples from so many different sectors of society and periods in history that I got lost. I would recommend this one for those who are interested in urban planning, how geography and poverty intersect, and related topics, but if you’re more of a general nonfiction reader, I’d be more cautious about trying this book out....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Jun 22, 2020","Jun 26, 2020","May 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046690-the-address-book

In Patron Saints of Nothing, we follow Jay Reguero, a college senior who feels ready to coast for the rest of his spring semester before heading to University of Michigan in the fall. Jay gets shaken up though when he learns that his cousin Jun, who he was close to but had fallen out of touch with, was murdered as part of President Duterte’s war on drugs. Instead of spending his spring break playing video games, Jay decides to travel to the Philippines to figure out what actually happened to his cousin. There, he confronts hard truths both about his cousin and about his own complacency in the issues that contributed to his cousin’s passing.I enjoyed witnessing Jay’s journey to connect with his Filipinx roots and Filipinx political issues. Randy Ribay does a solid job of showing Jay’s emotional progression throughout this process, including his shame toward his own ignorance, his guilt about how he fell out of touch with Jun, and his eventual empowerment and efficacy when he reclaims more of his Filipinx identity. Though I cannot speak to the Filipinx experience, as a second generation Vietnamese American born in the United States I have also felt the guilt of not being in touch enough with my Vietnamese heritage and the state of political affairs in Vietnam, and I’ve also felt the personal satisfaction that comes from reconnecting with that part of myself. I appreciated how Ribay portrays some of the complexity of President Duterte’s war on drugs, as well as some of the issues that accompany non-Filipinx individuals (like white individuals) or even Filipinx Americans weighing in on issues affecting the Philippines. Ribay’s prose flows well, though I felt like it was missing the extra “wow” factor to nudge this novel to a five-star rating. I’d recommend this book to anyone interested without a doubt, though I’m not sure how much I’ll remember it in the long term aside from its compelling exploration of reclaiming your identity.

I loved the buildup and initial stages of the relationship between Ludwik, our protagonist, and Janusz, his romantic flame. Tomasz Jedrowski’s writing felt both economical and lush; he sets each scene with concise and vivid detail to the point where every glance, exchange of dialogue, and touch between the two lovers made me want to burst into flames, in a positive way. Unlike in other gay novels where the writing felt lacking to me (e.g., Call Me By Your Name) or the romance only consists of poor communication and sex, I felt a genuine level of connection and heat when reading about Ludwik and Janusz’s bond. I also enjoyed the sociopolitical commentary and how the two find themselves on opposite ideological sides within homophobic 1980s communist Poland, which raised the stakes throughout the novel.The main reason I give this novel four stars instead of five is that it does fall into certain tropes, like Janusz being this beautiful athletic white man and a woman intruding into the relationship between Ludwik and Janusz (which I suppose makes sense given heteronormativity). The novel is short, so perhaps Ludwik and Janusz’s relationship could have been developed more, though perhaps the concision of the novel lends it strength as well. I liked the ending, how it spoke to Ludwik’s growth as a character and left us with some sense of hope, despite the deep sadness of his situation....more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"Feb 23, 2023","Feb 24, 2023","Apr 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49977811-swimming-in-the-dark

The Subtweet follows Neela Devaki and Rukmini, two South Asian musicians who are brought together when Rukmini’s cover of Neela’s song “Every Song” goes viral. The two differ in personality yet form a close friendship despite Neela’s more reclusive tendencies and Rukmini’s extroversion. However, when Rukmini starts to accumulate more success as an artist, Neela posts a subtweet that catapults the direction of their friendship into difficult and public terrain.I loved how Vivek Shraya dissects popular notions of social justice and racial progress in The Subtweet. Without taking us out of the story itself, she examines nuanced questions like: is it possible for an artist of color to make it “big” in the industry without pandering or selling out to white people? Can an artist of color achieve success without performative allyship from white people, and is popularity within a white-dominant society even worth it? How can artists of color support one another in a system designated to pit them against each other? Watching Neela and Rukmini live these questions in The Subtweet feels like opening one’s eyes to the racism and white supremacy of the music industry, an industry that often promotes an image of progressivism and liberalism despite its problems related to inequity and injustice.I also liked the novel’s focus on friendship and the power of friendship between brown women. There is pretty much no romance in this book and almost no men, which feels refreshing in an amatonormative and heteronormative society. If anything, I wanted even more depth in Neela and Rukmini’s friendship prior to the subtweet. While I believed in their bond, I feel like fleshing it out more would have enhanced the emotional resonance of the story in the wake of the events following Neela’s subtweet. Still, I would recommend this novel to those interested in the music industry, performative allyship and questions related to race in the creative arts, and friendship between women of color....more",Notes are private!,0,68,1,"Feb 17, 2021","Feb 19, 2021","Apr 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51633827-the-subtweet

He writes about how in 1975, during the fall of Saigon, he immigrates to America with his family to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, a small town where the Tran clan struggles to fit in. There, with the help of literature like The Iliad, The Scarlet Letter, and The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Tran navigates trying to create himself amidst feelings of isolation, stresses from immigration, and disconnect from his parents. Though the book may appeal to Vietnamese and Asian Americans especially, I sense that anyone who resonates with themes related to finding yourself, family, and healing through art will enjoy it.I felt so struck by and appreciative of Tran’s honesty in Sigh, Gone. While a lot of memoirs are honest in that their authors disclose what happened in their lives, I found Tran’s writing and perspective so unpretentious and so open, both capturing his younger self’s youthful innocence while viewing this past with gentle yet hard-earned wisdom. I loved reading about his initial desire to fit in with his friend group and using the punk scene to do so, how he received warmth and caring from a lot of his teachers (though not all of them, because at least one was outright racist), and how he connected with books to make sense of himself, his world, and his next steps in life. Even though certain experiences didn’t resonate with my own – like how he tried to fit in and eventually did fit in with other guys, lol at my gay femme adolescence – Tran’s earnest portrayal of his childhood and teen years won me over nonetheless. He does a lot of showing and not telling and the many descriptive scenes in the memoir made it all seem so real.I also loved how he wrote about his relationship with his parents. Fellow Asians, Asian Americans, and Viet folks please comment what you thought of these sections of the book because I felt such a kindship with Tran when reading these parts. As someone with a complicated and estranged relationship with my own parents, I so enjoyed how Tran portrays his parents in such a nuanced way and avoids shallow stereotypes about Asian immigrant parents. He writes about their sometimes failed, sometimes successful attempts to connect with him and his brother, the racism they experienced (omg I felt my blood literally boil when he wrote about his father’s coworkers’ racist taunts, UGH), as well as his father’s violence toward him. There were many times where I had to put the book down because of how much his insights resonated with my own experience. I feel like Tran’s depiction of his parents feels even more powerful given his own implicit acceptance of these complications – the ways they did sacrifice and show love toward him and the ways they didn’t understand him, both as a consequence of immigrating and assimilating to a new culture as well as his father’s brutality.On a personal note, I feel deeply grateful to Tran for writing this book because it helps me feel more connected to my Vietnamese heritage and more understanding of my parents’ experience. There are a lot of differences in my life and Tran’s, such that I was born in the United States and grew up in the early 2000’s whereas he grew up in the 1980’s or so. Reading this book made me appreciate how I had more access to Asian media growing up, like anime (e.g., Naruto) and K-Pop, as well as how I grew up in an area where my high school was 40% Asian, so I was lucky not to have felt ostracized much because of being Asian/Vietnamese. However, I totally vibed with using art to escape and to find myself, just in a gayer way (whereas he got into punk in high school I got into Lady Gaga, whereas he got into literature I got into YA especially queer YA). Even writing this  I feel emotional, I’m gonna go jog to “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink right after posting this. Five stars for sure, one of my favorite memoirs ever and I’m so looking forward to reading more Vietnamese and Asian American writers! There were moments where my social justice/academic psychologist in-training brain said, hm, I wish he’d dive a little deeper into interrogating whether being American is something to aspire toward. Especially with the anti-Asian hate that’s getting more publicity, I don’t think Asians should have to assimilate to be like, not attacked (Tran doesn’t necessarily say we should assimilate, just something I’m reflecting on.) He does name and process the racism he experiences which I felt glad about. I’ll end on the note that it’s so nice to read such a self-aware memoir from an Asian American man, as Asian American men are so often stereotyped as not having rich interior worlds, which of course is untrue....more",Notes are private!,2,262,1,"Mar 27, 2021","Mar 30, 2021","Apr 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046838-sigh-gone

I believe these women. I don't have much more to say so for a more eloquent and thorough statement please see Sahlea's statement.Original Review: Okay, I’m surprised that my Goodreads hive mind (that’s ya’ll, ya’ll are the best) hadn’t alerted me to this book iconic book earlier. Steel Crow Saga is a super queer Asian-inspired young-adult fantasy novel that blends elements of Avatar: The Last Airbender and Pokémon. That description sets the bar high and Paul Krueger delivers. In his sophomore book, he writes from the perspectives of four characters whose respective nations are representative of China, Japan, the Philippines, and Korea. Some are rogues and some are royals, each with distinct voices and desires, such as to avenge fallen family members who died in war or to secure the throne of their country. These characters’ paths crisscross until they all unite against one common enemy who possesses the power to tear all of their worlds asunder.I love how this book addresses dark and heavy topics while still feeling so compulsively readable, which did remind me of what it felt like to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender. Krueger shows the effects of imperialism from the vantage points of both the colonizer and the colonized, ranging from the privilege that comes with systemic power to the psychological trauma that accompanies seeing your loved ones slaughtered. His characters though almost bounce off the page with their charismatic personalities and their witty, funny dialogue and distinct characteristics. Our four main characters, Xiulan, Lee, Tala, and Jimuro each have well-written personal motivations as well as unique perspectives, which helps keep the stakes high and the plot moving. After reading this book for only a little while I felt this sense of trust with Krueger, that he knew these characters well, that he cared about them, and that he put forth every effort possible for us to connect with them as well – which paid off, such that I did tear up during the final fight scene in the novel.The only constructive critique I have toward this book is that the development of Tala and Jimuro’s relationship felt a bit rushed or forced. Though I love how their last interaction in the novel allows for more breathing room and more time to heal, which felt much more authentic, I think the quickness of their relationship forming when they first met – especially given the extent to which they could or should have opposed one another – took me out of the narrative a bit. Overall, highly recommended for those who want a young adult fantasy with lots of LGBT representation, including a f/f couple, a couple of bisexual characters (though one could be pansexual, I’m not entirely sure), and a trans major, though not main character. I hope this novel gets the attention that white queer stories do (yep that’s me being petty) because it deserves it. Thank you to my bff Natasha for recommending Steel Crow Saga and Goodreads friends please send me any and all queer POC books you’d recommend or want me to read and ....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Apr 21, 2020","Apr 25, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43264755-steel-crow-saga

How Much of These Hills Almost certain that my rating stems more from a mismatch between me and the novel than any flaw imbedded in the novel itself. How Much of These Hills is Gold uses the framework of historical adventure fiction to follow a Chinese American family during the American gold rush, specifically two siblings who recognize their own power amidst the colonial project that is the United States’ expansion westward. C Pam Zhang incorporates magical realism and a nonlinear timeline to explore how siblings Lucy and Sam come to understand the complexity of their family, their identity as immigrants, and their struggle to survive amidst ongoing hardship related to race and gender oppression. Zhang’s debut novel explores themes of xenophobia, othering, and the challenge and reward of coming to understand your ancestry and thereby yourself.I will be blunt and say that I did not get this book at all. Zhang’s use of jumpy flashbacks and flashforwards, her staccato and frenetic writing style, and the elements of magical realism made it hard for me to ever connect with the two main characters. Like, I think I got some of the broader themes of the novel though I felt lost for the most part. My sense is that others who enjoy magical realism and Wild West narratives may appreciate this one a lot more than me; I tend to prefer realistic fiction with strong, more straightforwardly-presented characters like those within Frances Cha’s 2020 debut novel If I Had Your Face.

Allegedly follows Mary E. AddSuch a thrilling novel that shows the injustices within the American penal system, especially for Black and Brown youth. Allegedly follows Mary E. Addison, who was served six years in jail for allegedly murdering a white baby at the age of nine. After those six years, she was placed in a group home with mean “caretakers” and several other girls who don’t seem to have each other’s backs. Mary’s life shifts once again when she gets pregnant, with the child of her coworker Ted who she met at her assignment at a nursing home. Now with a baby on the way, Mary feels more fire to set the record straight and prove that she did not commit murder at the age of nine. But to fight for her case and for the life of her baby she will have to uncover a lot of her past secrets, both about her mom who abandoned her to her fate and about herself.A really sad and sometimes disturbing novel, its grittiness reminded me of the young Asian girl in Nami Mun’s Miles from Nowhere, especially with the focus on a young black girl wronged by a system and now unjustly forced to pay the price. Tiffany Jackson does an excellent job of showing all the barriers Mary faces in her quest to improve her life. For example, even taking the SAT, which was such a non-issue for a privileged person as myself, is extremely difficult for Mary given her lack of an ID and her lack of baseline supportive adults in her life. Allegedly highlights a legal system that exploits the developmental vulnerabilities of children and maintains their suffering instead of helping them heal and grow. I most loved Mary’s persistence in the face of these obstacles and her determination to create a better life for herself and her child.Similar to many others, such as my bff Bri, I felt disappointed by the ending of this book because it portrayed Mary in a way that reduced the complexity of her character and her quest for something different in her life. As Bri wrote perhaps this is Jackson’s way of portraying how we can become the system that abused us, but the ending did feel a little reductionist to me. Furthermore, I wish the other characters in this novel received more characterization and complexity, such as the other girls that Mary lived with. I think it would have been interesting from a relational standpoint to see Mary’s trust or lack thereof with these girls beyond the many conflicts they had with one another, especially if they all received some additional character development.Overall, recommended to those searching for a suspenseful and engaging young adult contemporary. There’s strength and there’s sadness throughout the novel, a solid debut from who appears to be a pretty prolific author....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"May 24, 2020","May 27, 2020","Apr 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30037870-allegedly

She writes about how growing up, she envisSo appreciated Meredith Talusan’s vulnerability about her experience as a transgender woman in this memoir. She writes about how growing up, she envisioned herself as a woman, however she did not transition until later on in life when her desire grew more pronounced. I found the developmental component of her story compelling, how we could see different moments throughout her childhood and early adult life in which she signaled her womanhood both internally and externally (e.g., as a child seeing herself in female celebrities’ narratives, in college performing art in which she identified herself as a woman). Talusan also names her privilege as albino Filipinx person, such that the lightness of her skin afforded her many opportunities both within the gay male community and to pass as a woman.My main critique of this book is that while Talusan names her white-passing privilege, she does not really thoroughly criticize white supremacy (which gives her this privilege) nor does she unpack some of the centering of the cis male gaze that occurs throughout this memoir. For example, at one point she writes about traveling to the Philippines and buying sex from a Filipinx man who refers to himself as “boy” after her childhood crush rejects her. While I do not want to criticize sex work or sex workers, I felt that the way Talusan wrote about this exchange, specifically some of her self-pity, came across as extremely problematic. Like, I get that she feels a sense of grief over having loss part of her Filipinx heritage due to immigrating to the United States, however in that exchange with the sex worker I wished she had really confronted how systems of imperialism, colonization, and white supremacy afforded her the ability to travel back to the Philippines and buy sex and then just leave back to her privileged life in the first place.Similarly, I feel that the white male gaze is centered a lot throughout this book. Talusan writes about the privilege she inherits by engaging in a long-term relationship with a wealthy white professor, then she writes about how her attraction to a different white man in part motivated her transition into womanhood. Additionally, she names how she “betrayed” another female friend of hers by trying to talk this second white man out of his ongoing romantic relationship with her friend so that Talusan can be with him instead. I’m not judging Talusan for having these experiences because like, that’s what she experienced and in memoir you write about your experiences. However, she never actually explores or critiques or interrogates this centering of the male gaze, nor her participation in the privileged gay white male community, beyond naming that these guys are white and privileged. Like at one point when she writes about traveling back to the Philippines, she names that all the guys she had dated up to that point were white, but doesn’t actually describe how that’s messed up or the steps she’s going to take to actively dismantle this centering of white men.I feel conflicted between four and three stars for this book. Going into this  I was aiming for four stars but then after writing these past two paragraphs I’m like, hm, this was pretty problematic in parts. Other ers were definitely harsher than me and I generally agree with their points even if my tone is gentler, like Lily’s  and Max’s . However, I still think it’s super courageous (even though it shouldn’t have to be) for Talusan to so openly write about her experience as a trans woman, so I’ll go with four and call it a day....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 08, 2021","Mar 11, 2021","Mar 30, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48635850-fairest

At the offset of The Perfect World of Miwako Sumida, we learn that Miwako has died by suicide while staying at a remote mountainside village away from her current university. The novel follows three characters across three sections: Ryusei, a fellow university student who held unrequited romantic feelings for her, Chie, a close friend of Miwako’s who knew more about her past, and Fumi, Ryusei’s older sister, who took on Miwako as an art apprentice at her studio. With thoughtful layering across these three characters’ perspectives, we begin to learn about the tragedy that besmirched Miwako’s life, as well the connections that gave her some reprieve despite her suffering.I so enjoyed the smooth, flowing quality of Clarissa Goenawan’s prose. Reading this novel felt so calming, like sinking into a slice of life anime. This easy-to-read writing intertwined well with the more mysterious elements surrounding Miwako’s character and what contributed to her death. Goenawan’s writing felt both smart and simple, attuned to her characters’ present lives and emotions. In some ways her writing reminded me of Haruki Murakami’s. At the same time, I felt a similar distance from Goenawan’s characters as I did when I read Murakami’s characters way back in middle school or early high school. I liked her characters and wanted to know more about them, yet for some reason I found it hard to really connect with them, to really care about them and their experiences. I think I wanted more interiority from her characters, especially surrounding their grief over Miwako’s passing. For example, it felt like a lot of the novel built up toward revealing the tragic event that contributed to Miwako’s eventual death by suicide. Yet the fact that the novel put so much of its weight and suspense on the eventual reveal came across as cheap to me. I would have loved more time to sit with these characters and to understand how they felt interacting with Miwako before her death, as well as a more in-depth look at their processing of grief afterward. The novel poses some interesting, heartbreaking themes related to assault, remembrance, and if we can ever really get over the wounds from our pasts – yet the story did not ascend to the heights of its emotional potential, because it hinged more on revealing the tragedy than it did the characters’ nuanced internal processes.Overall, a book I’d tentatively recommend for those who wouldn’t mind or might enjoy a quick read with some suspense. I’m curious how this book is received across different culture, especially in regard to its writing style and characterization. I'm also wondering how others perceive its trans representation (Fumi, one of the main characters, is trans), which I reacted positively to for its subtlety....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Apr 26, 2020","Apr 30, 2020","Mar 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52777764-the-perfect-world-of-miwako-sumida

Karla Cornejo Villavicencio names early on iSuch an honest and important book that centers the lives of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Karla Cornejo Villavicencio names early on in The Undocumented Americans how we often tend to focus on the miracle successes of DREAMers or the wretched trauma that occurs at the border, ignoring the humanity of undocumented Americans living in our presence every day. With great awareness of her own positionality, she travels to New York to meet undocumented workers who participated in the Ground Zero cleanup after 9/11, to Flint, Michigan where she connects with those who struggle without clean water, and more. She displays the wide range of emotions experienced by undocumented Americans in the face of constant threat of deportation, the trauma and aftereffects they go through after forceful separation from their families, as well as their perseverance and the love that connects them to those they care about. The specific moments she shares – like a father who could not access chemotherapy for his cancer due to his undocumented status, then loses his ability to chew food before passing away, or a kid whose classmates say “I hope your mom gets sent back to Mexico too” after his dad gets deported – really pulled at my heartstrings. Overall, I’d highly recommend this book, especially for those like me who need to be humbled by and reminded of our privilege so we can be better allies and advocates for undocumented folk. Villavicencio is unflinching, determined, and persuasive in her pursuit for justice and humanity for her undocumented community. I loved the rawness of her anger and willingness to name wrongdoing as wrongdoing. While I found it a little difficult to follow her own story interspersed among all the other narratives, I still felt moved by the complex emotional space she holds for her own family’s journey, and therefore her own. Grateful that she committed to writing this book even amidst the difficult conversations and the pain she went through along the way....more",Notes are private!,0,153,1,"Apr 11, 2020","Apr 14, 2020","Mar 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880092-the-undocumented-americans

About ten years later, Desiree returns to their small, southern Black community whereas Stella has created a life for herself passing as a white woman, a life in which no one knows her true racial identity. Though the sisters have not talked for ages since Stella ran away from Desiree after they both moved to New Orleans together, their paths and choices to either own their racial identity or run away from it affect their lives and the lives of their daughters for years to come.I so loved the characters and the writing of The Vanishing Half. Brit Bennett has a talent for writing three-dimensional characters who you grow attached to, flaws and mistakes and all, as well as tight and effective scenes that add depth to her characters and their life dilemmas. She shows the effects of intergenerational trauma and anti-Black racism, colorism, grief, separation, and more so well. I ached for these characters and especially loved Desiree’s relationship with her dark-skinned daughter Jude, as well as Jude’s relationship with her boyfriend Reese – a scene toward the end of the novel between Desiree and Jude brought literal tears to my eyes, the first time a novel has done that for a while. I also appreciated Bennett’s smart rendering of Desiree and Stella’s daughters and how their daughters take after the other’s twin sister, while both bear the weight of their mother’s decisions, Kennedy (Stella’s daughter) perhaps more so than Jude. While there are so fascinating and terrifying ways whiteness and white supremacy manifest in this novel, Stella’s characterization in particular felt so rich with nuance in relation to race. Bennett did an amazing job of showing how a horrifying anti-Black event, (view spoiler)[witnessing the lynching of her father (hide spoiler)] affected Stella and drove her to pass as white and even perpetuate anti-Black racism as a white-passing woman. While Stella’s perpetuation of anti-Black racism is of course inexcusable, Bennett masterfully highlights the tole of racial trauma and internalized racism on the human psyche and the many ways Black people may hide or minimize their true selves to survive in white supremacy. Stella’s character reminded me a lot of Asian Americans in the United States try to align themselves with whiteness to get ahead, such as by prioritizing accumulating wealth over racial solidarity and justice, identifying primarily with white culture and lifestyle, and preferring the company and companionship, romantic or otherwise, of white people over Asian Americans and BIPOC in general. I recognize it is important not to conflate the light-skinned Black experience and the Asian American experience in the United States, and I want to make the overall point that Bennett really made me think about these issues through Stella’s character, which I’m grateful for. I’d recommend this novel to anyone interested in fiction about family, love, regrets and mistakes and how they shape our present and future, race and more. I went back and forth between rounding down to four stars or rounding up to five stars, and to be honest I’m still going back and forth but I want to post this  so it’s four for now. I’d be curious to hear more about what readers think of Stella, especially dark-skinned Black readers. While I found her character compelling I do wonder about being asked to sympathize or empathize with a light-skinned character, like if she’s held accountable for her colorism beyond her individual suffering or if that’s even necessary, even though she did witness a horrible anti-Black event in her childhood. I went ahead and bought Bennett’s debut The Mothers and I’m excited to read it soon!...more",Notes are private!,0,133,1,"Jun 15, 2020","Jun 19, 2020","Mar 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

We learn at the beginning of the novel that Vivek has died, so the rest oLoved the representation and overall messages within The Death of Vivek Oji. We learn at the beginning of the novel that Vivek has died, so the rest of the book details both what led to Vivek’s death and the aftermath. The two characters who elicited the most emotion for me included Osita, Vivek’s high-spirited yet reserved cousin, and Kavita, Vivek’s overprotective yet ultimately understanding mother. By the end of The Death of Vivek Oji, we witness the effects of family secrets and how non-acceptance of people who differ from us – even when that difference does nothing to damage ourselves or society – may hurt those we love the most. I really appreciated this novel’s setting in south-Eastern Nigeria and the lgbtq themes throughout. Akwaeke Emezi does a fantastic job of establishing the sense of community, both the values of the different families in this Nigerian town and the interpersonal dynamics such as gossip about other families’ personal business. I can’t get too into the lgbtq themes without spoiling the novel, though I will say the most heart-wrenching scenes for me included the bond between Osita and Vivek, as well as Kavita’s development by the end of the novel. I give this book three stars because I feel like the inclusion of so many character perspectives weakened its overall emotional resonance. I would’ve loved if we followed just Osita and Kavita so we could have gotten more scenes with them interacting with Vivek throughout Vivek’s life, which I feel like would’ve made me even more invested in their relationships. While I recognize the importance of this story on a social justice level, I think the wide spread of perspectives in a pretty succinct novel made it hard for me to care on a deeper level. Still, I’d recommend it to those who are interested in its synopsis. I’m also still looking forward to reading more of Akwaeke Emezi’s work as I already have their book Pet!...more",Notes are private!,0,104,1,"Aug 28, 2020","Aug 30, 2020","Mar 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48595550-the-death-of-vivek-oji

Within my training program, CBT often gets a reputation for being cold and detached, which stands in contrast with the warm and welcoming tone Seth Gillihan uses in this book. With easy to understand writing, he writes about how to set reasonable goals and how to be kind to yourself when you do not meet them, how to become aware of and change negative thought patterns, and how to work through procrastination and anxiety, and more. He describes so many simple yet effective strategies, like figuring out what is rewarding to you and using that as an incentive to get less rewarding things done, or breaking large and daunting tasks into more manageable components so you can get them done. I found the chapters on identifying and changing core beliefs and being kind to oneself most powerful. Even the font, layout, and spacing of this book’s text is soothing, so props to the team who designed the book’s aesthetic too.My main constructive critique of this book is how when mindfulness is mentioned, it is not traced back to its Eastern roots. In the United States, mindfulness, yoga, etc. are often appropriated without paying homage to how these practices originated Buddhism. This article delves into the importance of naming this, which I feel like is perhaps even more relevant right now with the Coronavirus-fueled racism running amok.Overall, recommended for those who want an easy-to-read book with plenty of practical, clear strategies to manage depression and anxiety. Yay, mental health....more",Notes are private!,1,61,1,Apr 2020,"Apr 04, 2020","Feb 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39888485-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-made-simple

Mikki Kendall does a great job of connecting feminism to topics such as the housing crisis, hunger, black women’s maternal health, and more, which often are ignored in a movement that centers cis, heterosexual white women. She dives deep into social issues like gun violence and poverty, thus providing us with a solid understanding of these issues, while always drawing connections to how women – especially women of color – are almost always disproportionately affected by social inequities and injustices. She interweaves anecdotes from her personal life that help illustrate the gravity of these issues in a more focused emotional lens, as opposed to solely drawing from systemic analysis or theory and statistics. I’m not sure how much mileage you would get from this collection if you’re already pretty well-versed in intersectional feminism, though I still found the essay an enjoyable read and I’d definitely recommend it to people who think mostly of white women when feminism comes to mind. I noticed a pattern in which some essays would veer off into a more unfocused exploration of many topics by the middle before being wrapped back up into the original thesis by the end, which felt a little clumsy. However, I recognize that so many of these issues intersect and sprawl into one another. Yay for expanding the extent to which feminism also takes into account race, socioeconomic status, and additional vectors of identity....more",Notes are private!,-1,408,1,"May 06, 2020","May 08, 2020","Feb 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36687229-hood-feminism

I found the artwork believable and effective in conveying the characters’ emotions, and the will they or won’t they was entertaining. I read this book because some of my research students recommended it to me; I can perhaps see why people find comfort in it, as it portrays gay/bi/queer characters in a pretty relaxed and non-super-traumatic way.Not sure if it’s just me though I also found the book a bit simplistic (which is maybe the point?). With other graphic novels I’ve read (most recently Hungry Ghost, though I also loved Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Me from a few years ago), the authors can fit in multiple complex storylines, whereas with this book it felt almost entirely focused on just the characters’ romantic plot. Maybe I’m also accustomed to the gay young-adult novels of my own youth that had (in my opinion) richer plots and characterizations, such as Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, Gives Light, and Picture Us in the Light. Maybe the future books in the series build the complexity.

I feel like a lot of body positivity and anti-fatphobia movementA thorough and accessible book about how fatphobia originated from anti-Black racism. I feel like a lot of body positivity and anti-fatphobia movements in the United States focus on the experiences of white women, so I appreciate Sabrina Strings for providing such a robust analysis of fatphobia’s anti-Black underpinnings that integrates historical, textual, and scientific investigation. Strings highlights how even though people at one point in history perceived fat women as attractive, later on people in power started to associate beauty with slim white femininity. This uplift of white women’s appeal and parallel disparaging of Black women’s bodies continued into the scientific and medicinal realms, such that scientists perpetuated racist ideologies surrounding weight that further stigmatized both fatness and Blackness.I liked that String made such rigorous academic work accessible to a broader audience through the quality of her writing. While reading Fearing the Black Body, I thought a lot about how wild it feels that people with power – those who choose actresses/actors, those who create science, those who even choose which books they want to publicize on their Goodreads profiles – really have so much influence in maintaining or disrupting anti-Blackness and anti-fatness. I am reflecting on how I want to continue approaching my reading, research, and clinical work from a critical perspective that takes into account a lot of the forces String exposes in this book. While I feel like incorporating her research and commentary with more contemporary issues related to fatphobia and anti-Blackness would have been even more compelling, I recognize that she may not have done so because of disciplinary boundaries or wanting readers to draw those connections ourselves.

I loved Jacob Tobia’s voice in Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story. I appreciated their progressive political views, their honesty about their childhood, adolescence, and college years as a gender nonconforming person, and their humor. They take a critical perspective on social justice issues related to queerness and gender, like when they point out that “the closet” can be a problematic metaphor because it puts the onus on the queer person to come out as opposed to on the homophobic society that relegates queerness to a position of otherness in the first place. Their writing about their childhood, teen, and college years felt real and without pretense, like how they write about how they relied on external validation to compensate for their nonbinary gender not being affirmed, or an experience at Duke where they were forced into an awful gender binary exercise. Finally, their humor resonated with me a lot. Like, when they wrote about when they met Barack Obama and they tried to focus on the shortcomings of his policies (e.g., drone warfare, not slowing deportations) yet they instead focused on how hot he was – that felt so relatable and I laugh out loud every time I reread that passage.There were a couple of instances that I felt a little confused or uncertain about Tobia’s understanding of their racial identity. They touch on having family members who are Arab and being mistaken for white, yet I think they also benefit from white-passing privilege which they did not touch on a lot. At one point they talk about making a joke about reconstruction as a drag queen and exhibiting some self-awareness about the problematic nature of that joke, yet they then describe the joke as a dig at racism. I think I wanted a bit more ownership or exploration of their racial privilege or racial positionality overall, especially given their developed and thoughtful commentary on gender identity and sexual orientation.A fabulous memoir written from a funny, non-pretentious trans perspective. Tobia’s confidence is admirable especially given how society strives to marginalize trans people. Their voice glows in this memoir as I’m sure their iconic heels do too....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Feb 09, 2020","Feb 14, 2020","Feb 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40984365-sissy

In An Excess Male, Maggie Shen King envisions a China where due to the One Child Policy, near 40 million men struggle to find wives and women can take multiple husbands. We follow one family where Hann, a gay man, and XX, his disabled brother, are both married to May-ling, who wants to take a third husband, Wei-guo. We follow the fallout that ensues when various members of this arrangement try to resist the oppression enforced upon them by their dictatorial government. I will start by saying I liked the messages about the heteronormative nuclear family and the pressures related to childbearing in this novel. Are we useful if we aren’t contributing to a nuclear family in some form? Shen King interrogates this question well and explores the consequences of straying from what society expects of us. That said, I found the characters pretty weakly-drawn in this novel. I felt like they each experienced some form of marginalization, though beyond that lacked richer nuance or depth. An Excess Male also contains an action side plot where I read it and was like… I don’t understand what the point of this is. Also, why was one of the more femme/ostentatious gay men one of the most villainous characters??

I so loved the main character’s voice, as well as everything else about Caucasia. The story folIt is an injustice that this book is not more popular. I so loved the main character’s voice, as well as everything else about Caucasia. The story follows Birdie Lee, a young girl living in 1970s with her white mother, a fiery activist who does her best to renounce her Boston Blue Blood background, her black father, an intellectual who is fervently obsessed about theories of race and racism, and her sister, Cole, who shares her biracial identity as well as a secret language the two of them concocted together. Birdie passes as white while Cole is recognizably black, yet the two possess an unconditional love for one another and an understanding of their parents’ dysfunctional marriage. When their parents split the sisters are then separated, with Cole and their father moving to Brazil while Birdie and their mother run away where no one can find them. As Birdie navigates growing up biracial in a white world without Cole, she comes to understand what she must do to recover the parts of herself that she lost when her sister left. In searching for the missing parts of her family and her identity, Birdie learns to reclaim herself.I absolutely fell in love with Birdie’s voice in a way I have not felt for another character in a long time. Danzy Senna captures her charming innocence, her poignant observations about the world, her struggle for self-discovery, and so much more with such understated yet beautiful writing. By the middle of the book I would often mark passages with just “OMG, I’m SO emo about Birdie’s love for Cole” and “Birdie’s emotion of wanting to fit in, WHEW.” Caucasia contains a lot of important commentary about race and family, yet Birdie’s voice forms the emotional core that really made me feel so darn dedicated to the book. I cared so much about her, because Senna writes her voice in such a believable and raw way, that when she suffered, I felt like I suffered or that I wanted to protect her. When she felt joy or relief, I felt that too, or at least some strong sense of like, thank goodness, I just want the best for this character perhaps even more than I want the best for myself. The strong themes of family and race took this book to even more soaring heights. I loved the earnest emotions Senna managed to capture regarding growing up as biracial, such as the shame of not belonging or fitting in cleanly with one racial group, or the yearning to reclaim a part of your identity that you felt has been stolen from you. Through Birdie’s struggle and persistent desire to own and honor her blackness, Senna shifts the predominant narrative of glorifying whiteness and that whiteness equals ideal. Birdie and Cole’s parents felt so fleshed out and important too. Senna captures a myriad of intricate yet deeply felt emotional dynamics between the four of them: their father favoring Cole because of her black skin and the effect that has on Birdie, the way their mother is unable to style Cole’s hair and how she refuses to own up to it and how that affects their relationship moving forward, the way that both their mother and father love revolutionary politics yet have clear limitations in the way they love or do not love their own children. Several scenes in this novel between these characters, and even in moments of Birdie’s quiet self-reflection, literally made me pause because I felt dizzy in the best possible way about the poignancy of emotions Senna captures: their yearning for love and connection and forgiveness and understanding, across racial boundaries and borders. I loved this book a lot and would highly recommend it to everyone. I hesitated to pick it up because the word Caucasian is racist, but through her characters’ struggles Senna shows the ways in which the social construction of race and as well as the realities of racism can tear us apart from one another. I will cherish Birdie Lee’s voice and character for a long time. Her coming of age, though fictional, felt so real, so visceral in its search for true identity, that I will wonder about her and wish the best for her for years to come....more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Mar 28, 2020","Mar 31, 2020","Jan 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33795.Caucasia

Raven Leilani’s tone in this novel is wry and sharp. She’s unafraid of showing the messiness and pain in her protagonist’s life, whether that pain comes from racism and sexism or family dynamics gone awry. I struggled to connect with Edie, our main character, I think because of Leilani’s writing style. The writing in Luster felt jagged to me, with lots of sentences that flowed for a long time followed by short and static sentences. There’s a discursiveness to the prose that others have described as “dreamlike,” though this stream-of-consciousness distanced me from the narrator even during her more emotional moments.

We Used to be Friends validated my heartbMy favorite fiction book of 2020 so far, thank goodness for the year of novels that focus on friendship! We Used to be Friends validated my heartbreak over the close friendships I lost in 2019, and When You Were Everything both validated that heartbreak and pushed me to believe in the power of opening my heart again despite past friendship pains. I feel grateful to Ashley Woodfolk for writing such a nuanced and realistic portrayal of friendship. As someone who has had quite a few intense friendships that either still exist today or have ended, I often feel unseen because fiction, including YA, focuses so much on romance. This book, however, gives voice to the type of close relationship that has both sustained me and hurt me throughout my life: best friendship.The novel follows Cleo Imani Baker and Layla Hassan, two best friends who met at age 12 and have prioritized each other over everything ever since. Their friendship starts to shift when Layla begins to spend more time with the “Chorus Girls,” who make an explicit point not to include Cleo in their friend group. Cleo’s initial hurt at Layla valuing her new friends over their friendship triggers a painful cycle of name-calling, misunderstandings, and betrayals that sends their friendship lurching toward the end. Afterward, Cleo is left to pick up the pieces of her broken heart, all while dealing with her parents’ separation too. While a new friend and a potential romantic flame show interest in Cleo, she has to decide whether to trust them with her heart, especially after Layla bruised and battered it in the fallout of their friendship.I loved this book for its complex and relatable portrayal of friendship. Almost everything Cleo experienced, I’ve experienced. Seeing a best friend deprioritize you for someone else yet not having the language to describe it in the moment? Yep. Hurting your friend after your friend hurt you in a way you’re unproud of, yet felt cathartic at the time? Been there. Seeing someone you care about change to the point where you no longer really know or love them, and taking a long time to accept that? So me in 2019 and even now. Through the dissolution of Cleo and Layla’s friendship, Woodfolk creates a narrative that feels so, so validating for me and I’m hoping for others who have lost a best friend or a close friend who they loved. With accessible and clear writing, she highlights how much losing a friend can hurt, especially a friend who you trusted with everything.At the same time, Woodfolk shares the healing process in When You Were Everything. I loved seeing Cleo learn to trust Sydney, another girl she befriends. Woodfolk shows how it takes Cleo time to trust Sydney after Layla broke her heart, and even though it takes time, Cleo learns to open up again and share herself, her joys and her pains. Watching Cleo’s healing process gave me hope for my own healing process and motivated me to celebrate the close friendships I do have right now, despite some of my past ones that have burned me. Woodfolk includes some additional subtle yet brilliant insights throughout the novel too, such as how sometimes you just have to go through your pain instead of trying to erase it, as well as how sometimes you idealize someone and have to learn to see them for who they really are, instead of who you want them to be.Overall, a fantastic novel I’d recommend for all fans of young-adult fiction. While the book’s pacing felt a little slow for the first 50-100 pages, it does pick up, especially for me when I started to get invested in Cleo’s various relationships and her healing process. While there is a romantic relationship in this novel, it never overtakes the importance of friendship, thank goodness. I’m loving all these novels on friendship so please continue to send any friendship-related book recommendations my way. Props for the inclusion of an almost entirely, if not actually entirely cast of characters of color as well as queer representation too. In her author’s note, Woodfolk shares how she wanted to write this book in part because of the close friendships she’s lost in her life – so I’m grateful for her vulnerability and for her creation of this friendship-focused, beautiful, sad, and hopeful piece of art....more",Notes are private!,0,129,1,"Mar 15, 2020","Mar 17, 2020","Jan 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45144784-when-you-were-everything

Janet Mock writes with candor about growing up in a dysfunctional yet loving family, her pain and then acceptance about her gender identity, and the difficult yet powerful steps she took to claim her true identity. I liked that Mock writes about the hard, complicated emotions present within her experience, such as the ways her family both let her down and tried to care for her, as well as her nuanced feelings related to engaging in sex work. She acknowledges her privileges like attainment an advanced degree. I hope we get more narratives like these so that Mock does not feel the weight or burden of being one of the only well-known “happy” trans women.I have a couple critiques of this memoir which Jessie articulate well in her . I found Mock’s focus on her romantic relationship a bit stifling, especially in contrast to the depths of insight and emotion she acquired through other parts of her life journey. While I get that a lot of women and more feminine people are socialized to value a man’s romantic love, I wish that she had named that more on a meta level than describing more of the surface of her relationship with Aaron. I also wish she had named more of the systemic factors that might affect someone’s decision to accept money from someone else to complete their transition (e.g., white supremacy, capitalism, etc.) While I totally respect and honor her perspective on how she worked and paid for her own gender-affirming surgery, my sense is that another person who may accept money from someone else to pay for a gender-affirming surgery isn’t any less valid in their gender identity. Overall, recommended reading for those interested in the perspective of a Black and indigenous trans woman who reflects on some pretty intense life events with honesty and a quiet yet firm belief in herself....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Sep 26, 2020","Oct 03, 2020","Jan 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18144031-redefining-realness

I most appreciated the vividness and vulnerability in which he wrote about his parents. When describing how he witnessed his father’s deportation at 15, he honors the nuance of both the act of deportation itself as an injustice as well as his wanting distance from his father’s mistreatment of his mother. Hernandez Castillo’s writing about his mother felt perhaps the most gut-wrenching in Children of the Land. He has invested so much into his relationship with her and to read about how much suffering she – and by proxy, he – have gone through because of the United States’ cruelty toward immigrants is painful. Painful, and important.All of that said, I give this book three stars because I feel that Hernandez Castillo may not have gotten much distance from the events he describes in this book. His introspection and self-reflection feel muddled and unclear, which makes sense given the trauma he and his family have gone through. My bias is that I tend to prefer memoirs with a bit more emotional depth – for example, I wondered about Hernandez Castillo’s relationship with his parents have affected his relationships with others and his overall sense of self. In the memoir he mentions starting his path toward sobriety as well as taking an antidepressant, so I feel hopeful for his journey and am curious if he will have even more to say with the continual passing of time.

I went through a gradual yet intense friendship breakup over the latter half of 2019 and We Used to Be Friends5 stars because right book, right time. I went through a gradual yet intense friendship breakup over the latter half of 2019 and We Used to Be Friends got me in all of my feels, like every single one of them. Amy Spalding’s novel follows James and Kat, childhood besties about to start their senior year of high school. They both have life stuff going on: James broke up with her boyfriend and her parents are separating, Kat is dating a girl for the first time and is adjusting to her dad looking for romantic love too, and both are applying to college and waiting to hear back. What I love about this book is that unlike in most stories, James’s and Kat’s other relationships take a backseat to their friendship, which acts as the center of this story. In sections that move both forward and backward in time, we see how their friendship falls apart over the course of a year, the care they both gave and then lost. I’m super emotional both because of my friendship breakup in late 2019 and because friendships have been both the most beautiful relationships in my life and my most devastating breakups, so I’m just gonna write this  in list form, what I loved and how it relates to my late 2019 friendship breakup. Yay for a book  that combines both a  of a book and over-disclosure of the er’s personal life memoir! I so appreciate how We Used to Be Friends captures: 1) how friendship can mean so much to someone. At their friendship’s strongest, James and Kat were always there for each other, they texted each other every hour, they told each other everything and they understood one another even with just a look, a glance. There’s an energy to a close or best friendship that is so undervalued, when you find a close or best friend who you feel excited every time you talk or text with them, who you know will consistently have your back. Spalding captures this dynamic even in small phrases, like when James is texting Kat and she thinks to herself, “I realize as I see the three dots on her end how relieved I am that her impending response is almost immediate.” This dynamic reminded me of my of my friendship with the friend I broke up with during our first year of friendship a few years ago, when we would have these text conversations that flowed with energy and vibrancy and how much I enjoyed that. Even though I have another friend who I feel that way about now, I still miss and cherish the time I had with my ex-friend where we once had that same intensity of connection.2) how the rules of friendship can be hard to figure out. Spalding shows this difficulty in a flashback scene of James meeting up with Kat and Quinn, Kat’s new girlfriend, at a diner. James thinks to herself “… it seems like Quinn is suddenly my best friend’s new best friend. Am I immature for how much dread that possibility fills me with? I know that a best friend isn’t the sort of relationship where you make explicit promises and set expectations, the way you do with a boyfriend.” I related so much to this thought process, because I experienced it too. When my ex-friend started dating her boyfriend, and even before she started dating him, she had a template to follow: find him on a dating app, date him, tell her friends about him, invite him to events with family, post about him on social media, get engaged to him, etc. Yet, for our friendship – a friendship in which I encouraged her to go to therapy for the first time, in which she supported me through my adjustment to graduate school – there was no template, no milestones to achieve. And even though we tried to set expectations, in the end they collapsed, especially in contrast to the resources our society invests in romance. Spalding shows, through James and Kat’s friendship, how friendships would benefit from more thorough communication, expectation-setting, and friendship therapy. 3) how romance is prioritized over friendship. Spalding’s portrayal of this twisted my gut so hard. She shows how, when Kat and Quinn started dating, how that shifted Kat and James’s friendship. It’s not like Kat never asked James to hang out or that she wasn’t there for James, and yet, their dynamic still shifted. I felt so grateful for how Spalding captures James’s disappointment, even the subtle things, like how Kat would want to hang out with Quinn more or obsess about Quinn more to the expense of Kat’s zest in her friendship with James. In the scene where James meets up with Kat and Quinn at the diner, she thinks to herself that “it’s like life sets up boyfriends to be the most important thing in a girl’s life.” While this thought process and the progression of Kat and Quinn’s relationship aligns with the idea of amatonormativity and the patriarchal prioritization of romance overall, I am glad that Spalding highlights how this devaluing of friendship can play out even in nuanced ways. Similar to what happened with me and my ex-friend, it’s not that she just ghosted me or only wanted to talk and hang out with her boyfriend. Yet, her prioritization of him had an effect, and I think we both lacked the language and/or the sheer tenacity to address it. 4) how sometimes things just don’t work out, and it hurts so freaking much, and you survive it. I appreciated how neither James nor Kat were abusive to one another necessarily, rather, a lot of small things built up over time and their friendship didn’t last. Kat could have been a better listener, James could have been more open with her feelings, both could have communicated in more nuanced and emotionally intelligent ways. One of the conversations they had at the end of the book – their last conversation – broke my heart, because it reminded me so much of heated conversations I got into with my ex-friend, when you’ve both been hurt and both of your hurt just spirals into something unsalvageable. And yet, Spalding shows, through the flashbacks of this story in particular, the genuine, deep love James and Kat shared with one another, that that love was real even if it did not last. All of these dynamics reminded me of my own friendship with this ex-friend. Maybe I could have been more understanding of who she was all along, maybe she could have been less defensive, maybe we both could have done things differently. And yet, at least for me, our friendship felt like, in the words of one of my current best friends Bri, a whole world – a world of connection and meaning and beauty incomparable to romantic love and its state-sanctioned popularity. I feel like we so often do not put enough effort into our friendships and a large part of that stems from the lack of media representations of deep, fulfilling friendships. Is We Used to Be Friends one of the most well-written books I’ve read? Honestly, I’m not sure I’d say so, as the prose is relatively straightforward and the characters’ lives feel a bit contained. In some ways I feel like if not for my own experiences with friendship and friendship breakups, I’d give the novel four stars. And yet, this book does such a tender and thoughtful job of portraying a close friendship and its disintegration that I’m confident it will resonate with others who’ve been through what I and others have been through, the breakup of a close or best friendship. After all, I think the best books are the ones that help us feel less alone and more connected in our suffering and our grief. This book accomplishes that in major ways for me, because even though I write about friendship on my blog all the time, it’s so meaningful to see an experience similar to mine portrayed in fiction. Thanks to Amy Spalding for her words and I’d love more books that center friendship in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,155,1,"Jan 18, 2020","Jan 20, 2020","Jan 18, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43908961-we-used-to-be-friends

The Lost Girls of Camp Forevermore follows five girls who get stranded during a summer camp trip and must fend for their own safety. Kim Fu intersperses this in-the-present suspenseful fight for survival with flashbackwards and flashforwards into each of these girls’ lives. I thought that two of the five girls’ stories (i.e., Dina’s and Siobhan’s) were interesting and compelling. In these stories, Fu did a nice job of showing the effects of trauma on how these girls’ development throughout life, how it affected their self-esteem, career choices, intimate relationships, and more. Unfortunately, for the most part though I felt that these snapshots into the girls’ lives were lacking in depth. Similarly, I thought that the portion about their time on the island felt stilted. I think if the writing had bit tighter in both sections they may have blended well into a more compelling overall novel.

Aaron Chan writes with such rawness and realness about the queer Asian experience, in particular about the sexual racism against Asians in the queer community, as well as the meaninglessness that often pervades gay male relationships. I appreciated how he bears his heart in This City is a Minefield; there’s some content that feels fresh, that he could take more time to work through, and his decision to share those emotions felt courageous to me, instead of only sharing fully processed experiences and perspectives. The first and final essays also contained a strong sense of place. I felt like I could come to see or imagine Vancouver even though I had never been, so kudos to Chan for bringing life to the city in that way.My main constructive critique of this book centers on its focus on romance. As anyone who reads my blog knows, I am pretty critical of romance because of its heteronormative and oftentimes patriarchal nature, so I recognize this critique stems from a personal preference (which I suppose most critiques do). I don’t think I minded that Chan focuses a ton of his essay collection on romance so much as I wanted more critical reflection on that centering of romance. Chan writes a lot about how he fixates on winning past lovers back, how he was born into being a romantic, how he wonders whether he will be single or “alone” for the rest of his life, etc. While I appreciate his vulnerability in sharing those sentiments, I kept thinking to myself: why? I wanted a deeper exploration, like what within yourself compels you to try to win people back who shown no emotional availability or interest? What societal messages have you internalized to make it so that you care so much about romance? How do you feel about yourself outside of romance, and what makes it so that you could or could not love yourself fully and wholeheartedly without a romantic partner eventually by your side? I feel like this type of more thorough exploration would have helped me feel more compelled by the oftentimes romance-focused essays in this collection. For example, Chan writes about gay men’s obsession with working out, yet I wanted him to explore that more as well as his own obsession with romance.Overall, I would recommend this collection in part because we need more representation of queer authors of color and Chan’s perspective is honest in its emotions. Among other things, I’m glad he named racism and femmephobia in the queer community as well as his struggle to make it as an artist. Curious to read what others think of this one and thank you Aaron Chan for sharing your voice....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Apr 04, 2020","Apr 09, 2020","Jan 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49001526-this-city-is-a-minefield

Written by three of the organizers of the international women’s strike, Feminism for the 99% draws from women’s mobilizing efforts in countries such as Mexico, Spain, Brazil, and more to expand feminism to dismantle economic, environmental, and racist injustice. I loved this book for its bold and uncompromising call for moving beyond a form of feminism that serves white and/or wealthy women. Here’s a quote from the beginning of the book that addresses the problem with liberal feminism, a common form of feminism within contemporary society:“Centered in the global North among the professional-managerial stratum, [liberal feminism] is focused on ‘leaning-in’ and ‘cracking the glass ceiling.’ Dedicated to enabling a smattering of privileged women to climb the corporate ladder and the ranks of the military, it propounds a market-centered view of equality that dovetails perfectly with the prevailing corporate enthusiasm for ‘diversity.’ Although it condemns ‘discrimination’ and advocates ‘freedom of choice,’ liberal feminism steadfastly refuses to address the socioeconomic constraints that make freedom and empowerment impossible for the large majority of women. Its real aim is not equality, but meritocracy. Rather than seeking to abolish social hierarchy, it aims to ‘diversify’ it, ‘empowering’ ‘talented’ women to rise to the top. In treating women simply as an ‘underrepresented group,’ its proponents seek to ensure that a few privileged souls can attain positions and pay on a par with the men of their own class. By definition, the principal beneficiaries are those who already possess considerable social, cultural, and economic advantages. Everyone else remains stuck in the basement.”I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, intelligent, and fiery takedown of capitalist exploitation and the importance of ensuring that feminism transcends replicating oppressive class and race dynamics. It’s short, so the authors don’t really provide deep or thorough methods for putting these ideals into practice, and at the same time I figure we can read more books or read up on organizing and policy to help us enact their vision. Furthermore, I did wonder if the authors’ language is accessible to all those who they may be trying to reach. At the same time, I feel that this book works as a call to action to those of us with more privilege (whether that be class, education, and/or race privilege) to both use our privilege and to step aside for those who have been marginalized again and again through capitalism. Ideally, we’d fight for a world where social and economic hierarchies are completely dismantled. I’ll end this  with a quote I appreciated from the authors’ section on how feminism must be anti-racist and anti-imperialist:“The effects of this global pyramid scheme are gendered as well. Today, millions of black and migrant women are employed as caregivers and domestic workers. Often undocumented and far from their families, they are simultaneously exploited and expropriated – forced to work precariously and on the cheap, deprived of rights, and subject to abuses of every stripe. Forged by global care chains, their oppression enables better conditions for more privileged women, who avoid (some) domestic work and pursue demanding professions. How ironic, then, that some of these privileged women invoke women’s rights in support of political campaigns to jail black men as rapists, to persecute migrants and Muslims, and to require that black and Muslim women assimilate to dominant culture!”...more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Jan 16, 2020","Jan 17, 2020","Jan 03, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40667455-feminism-for-the-99

Such a Fun Age explores their relationship and Alix’s attempts to get closer to Emira, often to prove her own care for and allyship with black people. Kiley Reid’s prose is clear and entertaining, always grounded in fast-paced, smartly-written scenes with believable dialogue. In some ways this novel felt like a more witty, specific version of Celeste Ng’s Little Fires Everywhere, with both books containing commentary about privilege and white women who seek to do good without awareness of their own biases and shortcomings.I loved how Alix Chamberlain embodies the white savior complex . Reid does a fantastic job showing how she tries to psychologically justify all her attempts to prove herself as a “good white person” even when she hurts people. Without a framework of racial and economic justice (Alix could have very much benefited from reading White Fragility or Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race), she thinks that hiring a black babysitter and treating her decently puts her on some moral high ground. Reid highlights how Alix surrounds herself with other wealthy women – including a wealthy black woman – who back her up and affirm all her decisions, even when they’re problematic af. I found it both amusing and annoying, the palpable relief Alix felt when she could tell herself that she’s one of the ”good” white people, because her internal processes exemplify how people with privilege will often take the easy way out in terms of short-term fixes without deeply interrogating their racism, sexism, transphobia, classism, etc. I appreciated so many other aspects of Such a Fun Age as well. While I cringed so hard at Kelley every time he showed up – and laughed so, so hard in the scene when (view spoiler)[Alix confronts him and literally can’t get over how she’s still so into him she can barely breathe, lolol (hide spoiler)] - I felt grateful for the sensitive, empowering way Reid concludes Emira’s relationship with him. Zara and Emira’s friendship made my heart feel warm and acted as perhaps the most genuine, truly compassionate relationship in the entire book. I enjoyed Emira’s character in general, how Reid draws her as someone who’s not like, this black woman set on changing the whole world, she’s trying to get a job with benefits and figure out what a solid adulthood looks like to her. This characterization may appeal in particular to my fellow millennial/gen Z readers who reject notions of upward mobility and meritocracy within the United States.Overall, a great book I would recommend to fans of adult fiction and who have a propensity for books that address race and class, though people who do not have a propensity for those topics should read this book too. Reading this reminded me of how much I've grown (several years ago I liked books like The Help and Gone With the Wind which is honestly so mortifying to think about because of how problematic and white savioury those books are, yikes) and how much growing I have to do. It makes sense that Reid bookends the book with a salute to Rachel Sherman’s Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence, a nonfiction read that complements this novel well. Curious to see what Reid writes next!...more",Notes are private!,0,127,1,"Jan 05, 2020","Jan 10, 2020","Jan 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43923951-such-a-fun-age

Mona Eltahawy takes a bold approach and demands that women access their anger, desire for attention, bodily autonomy, and more to destroy the patriarchy, no kiddy gloves necessary. She draws upon contemporary media and political examples from within the United States, as well as references powerful feminist movements occurring across the world. I appreciated how Eltahawy always asked more of feminism than what its most basic definition entails, for example, this quote about what power for women may mean:""What does being powerful mean? It must be more than doing what men do or being what men can be. I don’t want to be something simply because a man can be that thing. Men are not my yardstick. If men themselves are not free of the ravages of racism, capitalism, and other forms of oppression, it is not enough to say I want to be equal to them. Equal to the ways they themselves are victimized by patriarchy? No thanks! I want to be free. As long as patriarchy remains unchallenged, men will continue to be the default and the standard against which everything is measured.”I feel grateful and energized by how Eltahawy maintained a bold, forceful tone throughout this book. Her anger radiates, which makes sense given how she writes about angering topics such as abuse and sexual violence against women, institutional sexism, and more. Her analysis includes an intersectional framework that takes into account the unique experiences of LGBTQIA+ women and women of color. She integrates her commentary about global feminist phenomena with her personal experience of victimization and activism, merging the personal and the political. There were some moments in the book where I felt that bogged down by her transitions or lack thereof between her personal stories and her broader political commentary, such that I felt those moments dry or wanting of a bit more finesse. Still, I’d highly recommend this book to those who want to challenge themselves and confront the patriarchy with rage and ferocity, to those who can handle their feminism with some heat. I’ll end this  with one more quote that dismisses civility in the face of racism:“Racism is not civil. Racism is not polite. And yet here were all those people lined up to insist that we be civil when talking about Trump and his supporters. Those people lined up to insist on civility were, of course, white. For white Americans who have no experience of racism, it is a concept, a theory, an idea to be debated, and not a lived reality to be endured or survived. Fuck that.”...more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,"Feb 22, 2020","Feb 28, 2020","Dec 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43427042-the-seven-necessary-sins-for-women-and-girls

In The Privileged Poor, Anthony Abraham Jack shares the experiences of disadvantaged students attSo happy to start off 2020 with this fantastic book. In The Privileged Poor, Anthony Abraham Jack shares the experiences of disadvantaged students attending an elite private university (referred to as “Renowned” throughout the book). He writes about the privileged poor, low-income students who had the privilege of attending private elite high schools prior to enrolling at Renowned, and the doubly disadvantaged, low-income students who did not attend prestigious preparatory schools before coming to Renowned. While the privileged poor have some advantages compared to the doubly disadvantaged in terms of understanding cultural norms like connecting to faculty, both of these types of students suffer from classist policies – like closing cafeterias over spring break – in relation to upper income students. Jack provides both individual and systemic-level solutions and strategies for advocacy which made reading this book all the more worthwhile, to learn about these students’ struggles and to have an avenue to prevent and address them.I most loved this book for the ways that Jack gave voice to the experiences of these disadvantaged students. I felt so sad and frustrated when he provided a quote from a Latino student who shared his experience cleaning a wealthy white student’s bathroom and how that reminded the student of watching his mom get berated by the child of a wealthy white employee. I have more expertise in psychological research than sociological research, though from my perspective, this book acts as an amazing example of the power of well-written qualitative research – it captures the participants’ unique lived experiences, these experiences are analyzed and described eloquently and intelligently, and the overarching narrative elicits empathy and (hopefully) action from readers. Bravo to Jack for naming class and addressing it head on, given that in our country socioeconomic status is something we are often so reticent to openly talk about. I also want to address a critique/idea I’ve read in reaction to this book. Some people say, well, if poor students are so turned off by flagrant displays of wealth at elite institutions, why don’t they just go somewhere else, like a state school or community college? I want to gently encourage all of us to practice some empathy, as well as to acknowledge there’s not a finite economy of compassion we can provide for the people around us. For example, I was accepted to an Ivy League university and instead chose to attend a medium-sized liberal arts college, because I knew I wanted an environment that felt more nurturing and intimate. At the same time, I don’t blame others who go to Ivy League universities for the adversities they face there. Ideally, they wouldn’t encounter microaggressions and discrimination and feelings of being unwelcome. Ideally they’d have a positive and warm experience, an experience that invites challenge and growth yes, and one that is filled with support too. You can call me an idealist or unrealistic for wanting that for all students but I don’t really care because I think everyone should be nurtured and treated well. I feel this way especially for poor students of color who are often taught from a young age that the path to success in this country includes a degree from a fancy institution. While that idea both has merit because of systemic issues and also is not always true, I feel it important to acknowledge how these students’ experiences can so sharply contrast with their expectations. We should strive to mitigate some of that disparity, especially as a country that is so obsessed with meritocracy and the myth of the American dream.Anyway, I’ll get off my soapbox and just say I’m grateful for Jack for writing this book, especially as someone who’s highly considering a career in academia. I had the privilege of attending a pretty great public high school and then a relatively well-known liberal arts college for undergrad, and in both settings I had the privilege of connecting with warm, intelligent, supportive mentors. Reading this book motivates me to be that mentor for students from disadvantaged backgrounds as well as to engage in systems-level advocacy that will reduce barriers to inclusion and equity. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in higher education and/or social justice....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Jan 03, 2020","Jan 05, 2020","Dec 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42422452-the-privileged-poor

The case examples in this book are rich and intriguing without losing therapeutic realism; I felt compelled by each example and the analysis about each example felt intelligent and understandable. Finally, I loved the section on therapy ending and how that stirs up relational dynamics. This section on therapeutic endings felt like one of the most thorough and compelling I have ever read, and it made me reflect on and process more deeply when I had to say goodbye to my beloved therapist who I saw throughout my undergraduate years.A couple small constructive critiques: the book begins with a summation and analysis of the research support for brief dynamic interpersonal therapy and related therapies, which may drag for readers who are not that interested in research studies. While examining the research support for a certain type of treatment is important, I wonder if there’s a way to make research more exciting. Also, I wish the book delved more into how oppression and intersectionality influence relational functioning. While the book acknowledges the role of culture, it did not go deep at all into the influence of systemic power and privilege (see this article for the importance of therapists being trained and knowledgeable about those things). I hope that therapists and others who read this book educate themselves and acknowledge how racism, homophobia, sexism, and additional forces of oppression can affect relational functioning, as well as understand ways we can harness clients’ strengths to intervene....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Mar 17, 2020","Mar 22, 2020","Dec 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13003286-brief-dynamic-interpersonal-therapy

For the firsI liked this book even though I don’t think it was as groundbreaking or tightly argued as her books The Will to Change or All About Love. For the first 70% of Communion, I felt that bell hooks made several strong and interesting points about women, gender, and relationships: that women are taught to search for love in romantic relationships, that women are also capable of perpetuating sexism and patriarchy, and that men who may advocate for racial justice or even gender equality may still enact sexism in contexts such as sexual relationships. I agree with other ers who state that hooks generalizes her points a bit much at times. While I didn’t mind that rhetorical technique when she used it either more accurately or more sparingly in her other books, in Communion it stood out to me more in a negative way, perhaps because I also found that her points blurred together and were a little discursive within chapters at times.The highlight of this book for me was hooks’ chapter on romantic friendships. This chapter spoke to me as someone who values my closest friendships way more than any man I’ve been into romantically or any man I will be into romantically. Here’s a passage from that chapter that I resonated with a lot:“Romantic friendships are a threat to patriarchy and heterosexism because they fundamentally challenge the assumption that being sexual with someone is essential to all meaningful, lasting, intimate bonds. In reality, many people in marriages and longtime partnerships are not sexual; behind closed doors their relationships may be similar to, if not the same as, romantic friendships. Many single heterosexual women spend their time in relationships with men in which they feel unloved and unfulfilled, only to experience a moment of critical awakening in midlife, when they begin to do the work of self-love. And the outcome of that work is often the recognition that they would rather be alone than remain in unsatisfying partnerships. Or many of us are not able to meet men with whom we want to make committed partnerships. Finding a man to be with is a lot easier than finding a man who can be a loving partner.”I’m so glad that, in my opinion, there’s more discourse about elevating friendship in society now, from explicitly naming the oppressive force of amatonormativity to openly discussing relationship anarchy. Throughout Communion and especially in the chapter on romantic friendships, hooks highlights her ability to question the status quo about relationships and to think outside of the box to procure long and lasting love. I’ll end this  with one more passage from that chapter I enjoyed:“In Barbara De Angelis’s insightful self-help book Are You the One for Me? she lists traits we should look for in a partner. They are ‘commitment to personal growth, emotional openness, integrity, maturity and responsibility, high self-esteem, and a positive attitude toward life.’ In my conversations and interviews, it was rare for any female to admit that we had found even one or two of these qualities in male romantic partners. Most of us had found these qualities present in lifelong committed friendships, particularly romantic friendships. It cannot be stated strongly enough that patriarchal culture, and patriarchal domination of the psyches of men, encourage most men not to develop these traits. No wonder that heterosexual women who do possess these traits, who are ready to be in mature, healthy love relationships, usually feel they cannot find loving male partners.”...more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,"Feb 11, 2023","Feb 14, 2023","Dec 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32886.Communion

Jemisin writes about a fantasy world in which when a city reaches a certain population or status, it receives a “soul” as embodied in a human form. Thus, we follow five humans who each personify a borough of New York City: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island. We learn early on that they face a dangerous enemy bent on destroying their city – both each individual borough and all of their respective inhabitants. While it looks like the boroughs may band together to defeat this enemy, there remains some uncertainty about who feels an allegiance with who, as well as what it may take to vanquish their common threat.This novel felt like great entertainment. I do not read much fantasy, yet my transition into N.K. Jemisin’s world felt easy and smooth thanks to her clear and accessible writing style. Each of the different characters contained distinct and memorable voices, which helped keep each section from bleeding into one another. I loved all the little social justice and diversity bits in this book, like Bronca calling in Brooklyn about her homophobia in her former music career, Bronca fending off entitled white men who feel that they are being discriminated against for being white men, and Manhattan’s crush on the beating heart of the city (another dude) and Bronca and Veneza’s undefined yet loving relationship. I honestly had no clue about New York’s different boroughs and I feel like I have a solid grasp of each after reading this book. Also, Staten Island was honestly such a Karen, I could not with her, though I really liked the others.In some ways The City We Became felt more like an action movie or TV show than a book. The characters as a whole felt rather underdeveloped. The book follows a pretty standard formula of introducing us to each character, providing us with enough backstory to get us acquainted with them, and then having them encounter the main enemy before they realize they have to join with the other boroughs. I lacked investment in the characters and in the book overall because we did not get much emotional insight or perspective into each character’s lives, like their hopes, dreams, and relationships outside of their main plot of fighting the big bad enemy. By the time I finished the novel, I felt like I had just started to get to know each character.Overall, a solid book I’d recommend to those wanting something more on the lighter side as well as those who care about New York. N.K. Jemisin is forward about how this book is a love letter to New York City and that comes across well. I appreciated the commentary on gentrification as well as the focus on the resilience of New York City and its inhabitants.

I appSuch a necessary essay collection in a society that still glorifies having children, even with the existence of many other paths to fulfillment. I appreciated these writers, mostly women, who shared about their diverse range of reasons for remaining childless – deriving meaning from other worthwhile life pursuits, not feeling a parental instinct, having had negative experiences related to parenting on the receiving end of it, and more. I liked the theme of how most if not all of these writers did cultivate rich, content lives without kids, as well as how the stigma surrounding not having kids felt worse than the experience of not having kids itself. As a more femme person leaning toward not having kids, I felt more connected and less alone while reading this collection. A couple standout essays included Kate Christensen’s “A Thousand Other Things” and Sigrid Nunez’s “The Most Important Thing.” While some of the authors’ voices started to blend together, I’d give most of the essays in this collection somewhere between a 3.5-to-4.5-star rating.However, Lionel Shriver’s essay was absolutely atrocious and racist. I’m dismayed that the editor included the essay or at least did not prompt Shriver to actually self-reflect and own up to her racism. Shriver writes about how she feels sad that she won’t be able to pass down her European genes and she mourns how white people won’t be the majority in the United States in a couple of decades. She neglects to acknowledge the genocide against Native Americans that European Americans executed in the first place to establish their majority in this country, nor does she take into account the forced sterilization of Black women that has occurred in the United States. What’s worse is that she writes about her “grief” in a smug and superior tone, as if she’s admitting to something particularly poignant that other people just don’t have the courage to share. News flash, being contrarian and racist doesn’t equate to emotional or intellectual depth.

I would without doubt recommend Undoing Border Imperialism to those who want to elevate their views pertaining to immigration justice beyond the liberal notion of immigration reform. Harsha Walia grasps this issue at the root and delves deep into the importance of dismantling both borders and imperialism from existing at all. Here is a quote that I feel like summarizes main concepts within Undoing Border Imperialism:“Border imperialism encapsulates four overlapping and concurrent structurings: first, the mass displacement of impoverished and colonized communities resulting from asymmetrical relations of global power, and the simultaneous securitization of the border against those migrants whom capitalism and empire have displaced; second, the criminalization of migration with severe punishment and discipline of those deemed ‘alien’ or ‘illegal’; third, the entrenchment of a racialized hierarchy of citizenship by arbitrating who legitimately constitutes the nation-state; and fourth, the state-mediated exploitation of migrant labor, akin to conditions of slavery and servitude, by capitalist interests. While borders are understood as lines demarcating territory, an analysis of border imperialism interrogates the modes and networks of governance that determine how bodies will be included within the nation-state, and how territory will be controlled within and in conjunction with the dictates of global empire and transnational capitalism.”Walia includes so many compelling ideas grounded within an intersectional framework, including: the racialization of immigrants and immigrants of color, the weaponization of femininity against male immigrants of color, the recruitment of poor Black, Indigenous, People of Color into the military to further perpetuate imperialism, and more. The format of this book exemplifies its commitment to decolonization, too. Walia incorporates the narratives and the wisdom of various activists and on-the-ground movement organizers, highlighting the necessity of collective action and community care.

The Stars and the Blackness Between Them carries a whole freaking lot of what the world needs right now: tenderness, radical love, and a centering of marginalized voices rife with nuance and feeling. The novel follows two black teens from different backgrounds: Mabel, who lives in Minneapolis and worries about her ex Terrell and a mystery illness that has affected her all summer, and Audre, who lives in Trinidad but gets sent to America after her mother catches her with her girlfriend. Audre and Mabel’s connection sparks a level of understanding and magic that enthralls them both, though Mabel’s illness tests their resilience, especially as issues of incarceration and displacement loom over them as well. I appreciated Junauda Petrus’s novel because it feels like she cares so much about her characters.

The book details various women’s experiences of sexual assault and harassment by Weinstein, though it focuses more so on the journalists, lawyers, media executives, and others who contributed to silencing those women and protecting Weinstein from facing consequences for his actions. I felt dismayed knowing the overwhelming complicity of so many people who knew about Weinstein’s sexual assault of these women. Farrow’s detailed account shows how much money (e.g., capitalism) and patriarchy serve to protect powerful men, as well as how even those who do not identify as men can collude in protecting predators. I liked this book though I wish Farrow had provided more of a summarizing analysis or reflection on the events that occurred throughout his experience with this story. I understand that Farrow operates from a journalistic perspective, though the writing still felt dry and I wanted broader implications, which I think are called for when discussing powerful white men and sexual assault. What were Farrow’s more long-lasting or deeper emotional revelations related to his experience with this story, especially in regard to how he at one point silenced his own sister who reported sexual assault? How do broader systems of patriarchy, capitalism, and whiteness act to allow predators to attack and then silence their victims? These are a couple of the questions I wished Farrow had dedicated more time to addressing. Still, I’d recommend Catch and Kill for those interested in the more journalistic component of the Weinstein story....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Feb 28, 2020","Mar 02, 2020","Dec 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53011908-catch-and-kill

Not much happens in this story plot-wise, which gives space for Bea and Lou’s quiet and caring interactions to take center stage. Their friendship felt like the softly shining center of Are You Listening?, how they learn to trust one another despite their painful pasts and their stress on the trip. At its strongest, Are You Listening? serves as a poignant exemplar of the power of sharing your heart with another person, no matter how shameful or scary that sharing may feel. The artwork adds an element of eeriness and beauty to the story. By the end of the book I found myself wanting more: a little more depth in Bea and Lou’s friendship, a little more backstory, a little more processing of their experiences. Yet I so appreciate Are You Listening? for what it does offer, and I applaud Tillie Walden’s sensitive handling of a plotline related to sexual assault.

Steph Cha fictionalizes a real-life event: inA taut novel that explores Korean and Black racial tensions that arose amidst the LA race riots of 1992. Steph Cha fictionalizes a real-life event: in 1991, Soon Ja Du, a Korean female convenience store owner, shot and killed Latasha Harlins (in the novel: Ava Matthews), a 15-year-old African American girl. While Du was tried and convicted of voluntary manslaughter she received no jail time. In Your House Will Pay, Cha writes about the aftermath of this event in the present day, from the perspectives of the families of the victim and the perpetrator. These families find their fates intertwined once more when another act of violence occurs, which sets the stage for both further injustice and a chance of hard-won understanding.I appreciated the complexity in which Cha writes about race relations between Asian and Black communities within Your House Will Pay. She avoids easy or pat resolutions to ongoing and nuanced issues. I like how Cha portrays the Korean American characters’ honest emotional responses, both the older daughter of the shooter’s political fieriness as well as the shooter and her younger daughter’s reprehensible collusion in anti-blackness. Cha does a nice job of subtly yet assertively pointing the finger at the police, showing how conflicts between Asian and Black communities serve to uphold white supremacy and the police state. The novel reads like a thriller and I always felt compelled to flip further whenever I picked up the book. I wanted some more interiority from the characters, especially toward the end of the book, more of a sense of their growth and understanding and emotional journey and resolution or lack thereof. Still, I would recommend this book especially to my fellow Asian Americans and others who are ignorant of the LA race riots or race relations between Black and Asians within the United States broadly. I recognize that this novel may be hard to read given its in-detail descriptions of violence, anti-blackness, police acting in unhelpful and racist ways, etc. especially for those who already experience those stressors in daily life. Thanks to Steph Cha for writing this, and fellow Asians, let’s address our community’s anti-blackness and band together with other racially marginalized groups to fight white supremacy!...more",Notes are private!,0,73,1,"Dec 09, 2019","Dec 14, 2019","Dec 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43615778-your-house-will-pay

I appreciate some of what it portrays, the struggles of WaThough it pains me to write it, this book and I just did not fit well together much at all. I appreciate some of what it portrays, the struggles of Wallace, a gay black biochemistry graduate student living in the Midwest. Brandon Taylor does an excellent job of showing the anger and then learned helplessness Wallace experiences due to overt and subtle racism throughout the book. Wallace’s sadness – from his trauma with his family, from the racism he encounters, from feeling invisible and isolated in his small town – cuts deep and feels real. Though also a major frustration of mine with this novel, I can somehow respect how much Taylor commits to rendering Wallace’s sadness and helplessness, given the enormous weight of the world he lives in.My first extreme disappointment with Real Life stems from how I feel like a lot of the problematic and oppressive things within the novel are not addressed in a way that really calls them out. For example, when Wallace first meets Roman, a character who is extremely cruel, he thinks to himself “Roman is very handsome – so blond that Wallace thinks he cannot be naturally so. But his eyelashes are blond, his eyebrows are blond, and his beard is mostly a white-yellow…” and I just thought to myself, this is so much internalized racism, this glorification of blondness and this association between whiteness and beauty. Yet this internalized racism was never really addressed or dealt with in a way that a reader would later think, oh okay, that was internalized racism, blondness and whiteness doesn’t actually equal beauty. Another example of this lack of addressing problematic and oppressive things includes Wallace’s relationship romantic with Miller. Throughout the book though especially toward the end, Miller treats Wallace pretty poorly, culminating in a scene that reads very much like a (view spoiler)[direct sexual assault, when Miller forcefully penetrates Wallace (hide spoiler)]. Yet this violence, as well as Miller’s complicity in the racism of his fellow white friends toward Wallace, is never explicitly dealt with so much as portrayed, before Wallace resumes his relationship with Miller again and again. When I reflect on their relationship further, it reminded me of a lot of gay male romances that I feel like are written with beautiful language, yet ultimately are really unhealthy and emotionally and/or physically unsatisfying or abusive.And this lack of growth gets to the core of my main frustration with this novel: Wallace never really gets better. I think this may reflect a fundamental subjectivity about what makes a novel “good.” Because I can see how some would say, well, sometimes you encounter tons of racism and you engage in unhealthy and borderline abusive relationships and you stick with a group of actively and passively racist white people, and that’s that. But for me, when I read books, I do value some sign of character development, some sign of healing or empowerment. I’m not saying I expected Wallace to like, renounce all the racism he encounters and become super self-loving and move cleanly and neatly toward a better career trajectory. Again, I get that sometimes life is shitty and people cope in ways that are self-condemning. Yet, one of the things I value in fiction – and I’m not necessarily saying anyone else has to value this – is the ability to render the world as different than it actually is, oftentimes through characters who are able to slowly yet surely work toward things like fighting internalized racism, letting go of unhealthy relationships, loving themselves. I frankly didn’t see much if any of that from Wallace, which was a bummer.Overall, not the book for me, though others on this site have enjoyed it so I think it’s fair to read their s too. I definitely have experienced and witnessed racism from within the gay community, though I’m also a non-black queer person of color, so I recognize I may not be the book’s intended audience anyway. I did care about Wallace, though I always felt frustrated with the lack of movement in the novel, even when layers of trauma were uncovered and grievances in relationships occurred and occurred....more",Notes are private!,1,388,1,"May 08, 2020","May 11, 2020","Dec 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46263943-real-life

I appreciated Sonya Renee TaylA solid introductory text about body positivity and its relations to social justice, oppression, and radical self-love. I appreciated Sonya Renee Taylor highlighting the role of capitalism, racism, and transphobia in promoting body shame. So many books and research articles about body image focus on cisgender, heterosexual white women’s experiences and often neglect the role of systems of oppression in making people dislike their bodies. Taylor draws several arguments about how various social inequities and injustices lead us to disdain nonnormative (e.g., nonwhite, nonthin or nonmuscular, etc.) bodies, as well as how we can cultivate radical self-love to view and treat our bodies better. She makes astute points about how professionalism promotes white supremacist and oppressive norms, how children’s bodies are not public property, and how color blindness blocks us from seeing each other and ourselves as who we truly are.I refer to The Body Is Not an Apology because I feel like there’s so much room for more writing about each of the topics Taylor presents in this book. While I loved pretty much all the ideas she raised, I wanted more depth about each of them, more intellectual richness and nuanced emotional exploration. For example, in one section she writes about how children’s bodies should not be treated as public property and then transitions right into the perils of color blindness, and I felt confused about how that transition happened, even though I appreciated both topics. Recommended to those who are interested in body image and want a quick foray into how social justice concepts and topics relate to body image. I so stand with Taylor’s message that we do not need to apologize for our bodies, no matter what they look like....more",Notes are private!,0,172,1,"Jul 08, 2020","Jul 10, 2020","Dec 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34956885-the-body-is-not-an-apology

While I appreciate learning about and bearing witness to people’s pain, I also felt that this collection ignored this marginalized group’s potential for strength and racial solidarity.

I also noticed a few casual moments of unaddressed anti-Blackness throughout these stories, like East Indian children preferring white dolls over Black dolls and marrying white people but not Black people, which felt iffy to me.I know I’ve left several three-star s in a row and I am hoping to shake this trend soon!

If I Had Your Face follows four women living in Seoul, Korea: Kyuri, a beautiful woman who’s received a lot of plastic surgery and works in a competitive “room salon,” Miho, a talented artist in a precarious romantic relationship with a rich and handsome boyfriend, Ara, a hairstylist who is obsessed with a male K-Pop idol (throwback to me in middle and early high school, tbh) and supports her best friend after a painful plastic surgery procedure, and Wonna, a woman with a troubled past trying to conceive a baby in a brutal economy. The four women navigate messy relationships, dangerous men, and their own harrowing pasts, as their friendships with one another provide some relief in a society geared toward keeping women down.I finished this book in about a day because I felt so addicted and compelled by the drama in these characters’ lives. Frances Cha has a talent for writing short yet punchy scenes that keep the plot flowing while still containing raw and believable emotion. As someone who grew up consuming K-Pop (I obsessed about Key from SHINee in middle school and early high school, now I’m obsessed with BlackPink and have a minor crush on Seungyoon from Winner), I felt fascinated and immersed in the Korean culture and lifestyle Cha portrays in If I Had Your Face. Most importantly, Cha displays the patriarchal and capitalist attitudes and behaviors that subjugate women in Korean society, such as the sexist emphasis on appearance and attaining plastic surgery, the ageist way older Korean women are viewed, the lack of economic power possessed by women which leaves them vulnerable to tempestuous and sometimes threatening men, and more. While I loved the drama from an entertainment perspective I also felt keenly aware of Cha’s excellent work giving voice to these four women with varying levels of “beauty” and a common lower socioeconomic class, navigating some pretty awful and humiliating situations.At the same time, Cha displays the resilience and fortitude of these four women in the face of trauma and sexism. I appreciated how she shows the negative consequences of the oppression they face (e.g., internalized negativity toward their body image, sometimes perpetuating aggression toward fellow women) while also portraying the creative and unique ways they resist patriarchy and capitalism. I cherished the scenes that showed the emotional intimacy between the four women as well as how Cha wrote about their individual ambitions and talents, like Miho’s penchant for art and Kyuri’s desire to climb toward a more hospitable job and overall lifestyle. Most iconically, these women struggle and grow and support one another throughout the book with no male romantic interest “saving” any of them or taking up too much of the spotlight – in fact, most of the male romantic interests are minor or major antagonists that the women manage to overthrow and/or let go of, which I liked a lot. While there’s a budding romantic relationship toward the end of the novel, the four women’s bonds with one another provide the most salvation and hope throughout the story.While I would highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in Korean culture and want a deeper look at the sexism that underlies popular phenomena like K-Pop, I can also see why some people have given this book 3-star s as opposed to enjoying it more. Instead of going really deep into any one character’s development, the novel focuses more on the present-day obstacles faced by each woman, even though there is background that helps us understand each character. Furthermore, Wonna’s perspective doesn’t really merge with the other characters’ until the end, which I didn’t mind but I can see how that would give the novel a slight feeling of jaggedness or incompleteness. Thus, if you approach the novel expecting less of a really thorough dive into one or two individuals’ perspectives and more as a slice of life story of four women navigating their present day with some content from the past, I think you may enjoy the book more. It’s definitely making me think more deeply about Korean society and how I consume related content (like, ugh, I’m still gonna stan BlackPink for their bops even though now I’m sad that Jisoo’s gorgeous visual and their super thin bodies almost definitely contribute to problematic beauty standards in Korea, sigh).

I have to say the title novella blew my mind; I felt so emotional about it I Hunger consists of one novella (titled “Hunger”) and five short stories. I have to say the title novella blew my mind; I felt so emotional about it I literally wrote an entire blog post so I could process all my feelings. Lan Samantha Chang writes like a dream; instead of reading words on a page, I felt myself with these characters, the colors and scents and spaces of their homes, all the ways they love, lose, and lie to one another. I would give at least 10 stars to the title novella. Though “Hunger” comes out to just a little more than 100 pages, it packs a similar if not even more powerful punch than full-length novels. It follows a woman who marries a passionate, temperamental musician whose suffering seeps into and poisons the lives of their two daughters. Every word felt so necessary and meaningful yet effortlessly placed, every detail about each character felt organic to the characters’ development while keen about the human psyche. As an Asian American myself, I loved how Chang captured the raw emotional complexity that accompanies an immigrant parent’s desperate love for their child when their own self-worth has been compromised, as well as when children of immigrants push their parents away in rebellion or stay with them in solidarity for their solitude.Of the short stories, “The Eve of the Spirit Festival” came to closest to taking my breath away in the same way that “Hunger” did, followed by “The Unknowing.” Again, Chang’s writing is simply superb, and I feel amazed by her ability to write about fraught parent and child dynamics while capturing all the love and nuance accompanying the Chinese immigration and assimilation process. I feel so grateful for Chang because in the process of processing my feelings about the novella and stories within this collection, I reflected a lot on my parents and their own experiences. While I don’t want to go too into it in this , I’m not really in touch with my parents, and while I feel good about that, Chang brought me a deeper empathy and understanding of the narrative of my own life as the son of immigrants, even though I’m Vietnamese and not Chinese. Through reading this novella and story collection, I saw my own life and my own choices more clearly, which I consider one of the greatest gifts of reading fiction. Recommended to fans of Celeste Ng and Min Jin Lee, though Chang’s stories center more on nuanced emotions and quiet interpersonal dynamics than a sense of adventure or exciting mystery. I skimmed some s and appreciated this  for noting that it does seem a bit stereotypical that so many of the children in this book go on to get PhDs from prestigious universities; thus, I’d also highly recommend Jenny Zhang’s iconic, subversive collection Sour Heart to accompany Hunger. Thank you also to Andrew for prompting me again to read Hunger, a book that consumed in the best possible way....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Nov 21, 2019","Nov 23, 2019","Nov 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6996514-hunger

In Some of Us Are Very Hungry Now, Andre Perry tackles race, music, love, art, sexLove the honesty and unresolved questions in this essay collection. In Some of Us Are Very Hungry Now, Andre Perry tackles race, music, love, art, sexuality, and so much more as a black writer living in Iowa City. I most appreciated the unflinching vulnerability in this collection. Perry writes about his experiences of people exotifying/fetishizing him as a black man, how elite spaces, institutions, and people who tout their progressive values often perpetuated microaggressions and overt racism against him and others, and the falling apart of romantic relationships and the coming together of artistic community. He lets us into the messiness of the coping process – his loneliness, uncertainty, his alcohol use and one-time sexual encounters – which made me feel closer to him and admirable of his process. I wanted more from certain essays, which may just be a me thing. For example, in the first essay of the collection, Perry writes about the n-word and the f-word and the overlaps and distinctions between anti-black racism and homophobia. While I appreciated the feeling of discomfort elicited by seeing the words on the page, I wanted more of a tangible takeaway or reflection pertaining to the overt use of the f-word in particular (though that might be a reaction I have as a gay man). In another essay Perry writes so beautifully and candidly about the dissolution of a romantic relationship he had with a woman named “Miranda,” an essay that reminded me of a crush I once really longed for, lol. Yet by the end of the essay, while I did feel really compelled by the narrative arc overall, I felt confused and wanted more – so what happened with you and Miranda? What insight did you gain about yourself through this experience? What actually made you stay in this relationship even when you at least subconsciously knew it should have ended a while ago?Who knows, it’s likely that me wanting more speaks to how much I already felt drawn in by Perry’s writing and voice.

Grace Lee Boggs’s The Next American Revolution feels full of wisdom and at the same time accessible even to those still searching to define what activism means to them. I loved so many of the points Boggs includes in this book, including the focus on community and connection over capitalistic desires for wealth and individual satisfaction, the solidarity between Asian and Black communities, and the importance of moving beyond elected officials and/or the state to evoke major change. Boggs reiterates the point that we are the revolution we desire. This emphasis on our own revolutionary potential feels hopeful amidst the constant news of racism, xenophobia, sexism, transphobia, and capitalist exploitation that pervades contemporary society.Recommended to those who want a radical perspective on long-term activism and how we can envision what revolution will entail. While I agree with some other ers who state that they wanted more concrete strategies to create change, I hear Boggs’s point that those strategies will be based in the context of the current movement and era. I also feel like this book may serve as a powerful impetus to begin learning about specific strategies to enact change, like organizing and advocacy and dismantling internalized systems of oppression and such.

While those who have read many books on race or are in the field of Psychology like myself might not walk away with too much new content, it’s empowering to see someone like Tatum address racism in such a direct way when so many of us are scared to talk about the topic for fear of being “divisive” or hurting people’s feelings. She provides several tangible action steps for how to develop your children’s pride in their racial identity as well as ways to actively participate in the fight against racism overall....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Apr 19, 2021","Apr 26, 2021","Nov 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16280.Why_Are_All_The_Black_Kids_Sitting_Together_in_the_Cafeteria_

For most of this novel we follow Toby FleWow this book, such an entertaining foray into the messy lives of rich white people living in New York City! For most of this novel we follow Toby Fleishman, a divorced doctor with two kids whose ex-wife Rachel has disappeared, leaving him with childcare responsibilities beyond his capacity. As the story progresses, we learn more about Toby’s grievances against his wife, witness his inability flourish in his post-marriage state, and recognize that maybe Toby’s narrative about Rachel isn’t all that it seems.So yeah, this book = highly entertaining. Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s writing is both smooth and vivid, so reading this novel felt like having a gossip session except you witness all the gossip firsthand, like you’re next to Toby as his life is unraveling and you get to marvel at all the mess. Brodesser-Akner did a great job of “showing, not telling” the messiness of marriage and having kids, especially for women who are trapped in gender roles and the intersection of sexism and classism. I imagine this book brings to life the recent research that suggests unmarried women without kids are the happiest demographic – reading this novel, you’re like, oh yeah that makes a lot of sense! The characters are developed enough that I can see a book club delving deep into this one too.I have two main constructive critiques of this book. First, I didn’t love having Toby the main person we follow. I can see why Brodesser-Akner made this choice, like so we can see how a heterosexual white man thinks he’s the victim all the time when really he’s aggressive and projects all his issues onto other people. However, I found Rachel such an interesting, nuanced character who went through a lot. I wish we had seen more of her instead of spending so much time with Toby. Building on that point, I think this book falls into the “I’m going to show how all of these characters are messy and have unresolved issues and can’t communicate well but I’m not going to show them actually growing or addressing their issues in any way” camp. Kind of like Sally Rooney’s novels but with an older cast. I feel compelled to give this book three stars because again, so entertaining, even if I had a few major qualms with it....more",Notes are private!,2,52,1,Feb 2023,"Feb 04, 2023","Nov 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880602-fleishman-is-in-trouble

As a second generation Vietnamese American living in the UnitedI loved this book for its earnest and thoughtful rendering of Vietnam and its history. As a second generation Vietnamese American living in the United States, I did not get to learn much about my Vietnamese ancestry in the American education system. The few stories and narratives I was exposed to were often from a white or western perspective, either about a white man’s perspective of the war or an account written by a white person, often both. I want to learn more about my heritage so I am grateful for Nguyen Phan Que Mai for all the effort she put into penning this novel (and shout out to Algonquin Books for providing me with an ARC). The book includes two timelines, one that follows a young woman named Tran Dieu Lan during the French and Japanese occupations of Vietnam in the mid-twentieth century, and another that follows Dieu Lan’s granddaughter during the Vietnamese War later on in the twentieth century. Several powerful themes emerge throughout The Mountains Sing, including the horrors of war, the often lasting though sometimes tenuous bonds of family, and the transmission of family history through intergenerational narrative. Similar to Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko, the resilience of women in the face of mass destruction stood out as prominent and powerful throughout this family saga. I learned a lot about Vietnam that I somewhat embarrassingly did not know, including the land reform that led to the brutal executions of several landowners. Que Mai puts a human perspective onto these historical events so we can empathize and care about those affected.My only constructive critique is that the perspectives of Tran Dieu Lan and her granddaughter often felt interchangeable in terms of voice and tone, which sometimes made differentiating between the two or distinctly caring about the two difficult. Still, I’d recommend this book for those interested in learning more about Vietnam’s history and I hope that we can get more narratives about Asia and Vietnam from actual Asian and Vietnamese authors....more",Notes are private!,0,186,1,"Mar 03, 2020","Mar 07, 2020","Nov 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49631287-the-mountains-sing

I learned a lot from this novel without feelingAn impressive, polyphonic novel narrated by 12 mostly women, mostly black characters living in the UK. I learned a lot from this novel without feeling like Bernardine Evaristo tried at all to lecture me. The voices in this collection encompass diversity across social identities, across sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, and more. The characters also range in their emotional status, as some embody a cynical and disillusioned perspective whereas others carry a more yearning fire for change within their own lives and/or within the world overall.I most loved this book for the way it portrays the complexity of life and how Evaristo collapsed time both within and across each individual story. For example, in one affecting story she shares how a woman named Dominique starts a relationship with a radical lesbian who lives in a separatist commune, only later on to realize that this lesbian partner is emotionally abusive, manipulative, and controlling. In this story Evaristo portrayed the narrator’s descent into this abusive relationship so well: the initial love, the diminishment of her agency within her relationship, then her struggle and eventual success to break free and how her life looks like afterward. I felt so connected to Dominique’s story. Evaristo’s portrayal of how her life changes over time gave me hope for what may manifest in my life and the lives of other people I know who are currently in unsatisfying or outright awful situations. I also appreciated the messiness and unresolvedness within certain narratives, such as Bummi’s, in which she engages in a romantic relationship with a woman for a period of life but then ends the relationship in a rather cutting and cruel way. Evaristo shows how her life progresses beyond this relationship and how Bummi never really apologizes or resolves this one relationship in her life, which feels authentic to real life, how we engage in loving romantic and platonic relationships that influence us deeply yet do not wrap up neatly at all, as we do our best to move on and move forward. I only give it four stars instead of five because the book felt a little long to me and toward the end the length of the book eclipsed my capacity to recognize the interlocking connections between different narratives. I would still recommend this book though, especially to those looking for contemporary fiction set in the UK centering voices that are underrepresented in the literature. While the unconventional writing style took me aback initially, I got used to it and appreciated Evaristo’s commitment to her prose style and her ability to still communicate compelling and emotionally affective stories while letting go of traditional grammatical structures.

She portrays the beloved community of LGBT individuals in the South as well as the fight for queer rights in these conservative states. I appreciated Allen’s warm and vulnerable narration and her disclosure of her own story of coming out, both to others and herself, as a transgender woman. She does a nice job of both sharing her story as well as including quotes and perspectives from others who reside in the South. I also felt grateful for how she names her whiteness and the privileges that come with that, as well as the importance of intersectionality, topics that I often feel get ignored in the queer community.Though I would generally recommend this book, I think I also wanted more of an analysis or even personal perspective on the difficulties of being queer in the South? I understand that Allen tries to dispel the narrow-minded narrative that the South is an awful place for LGBT people, I get that – and yet, from other narratives I’ve read and from LGBT people I know, the South can indeed be an alienating place for queer folk and queer youth especially. After finishing this book I’m still left curious about those experiences as well as what motivates queer youth to migrate to cities (like how P.E. Moskowitz writes that it is often white LGBT folk who contribute to gentrification in cities in their book How to Kill a City). Overall, I’d recommend this book to those interested in narratives of queer people in the South and for those searching for a book written from a trans reporter’s perspective....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Jan 26, 2020","Jan 30, 2020","Oct 31, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40274696-real-queer-america

In spare vignettes, Carmen Maria Machado documents the beginning, middle, and end of hSuch a powerful memoir about a horrifying abusive relationship. In spare vignettes, Carmen Maria Machado documents the beginning, middle, and end of her relationship with an ex-girlfriend who threatened, humiliated, and tried to control her. I’m a sucker for short chapters and Machado writes them well here, describing the terror and confusion she felt at the hands of her ex-girlfriend with concise and exacting detail. With courageous honesty, she shares both the desire she felt for her ex-girlfriend at the beginning of their relationship and her want to feel wanted, as well as the gaslighting she experienced and the difficulty she encountered in seeing the truth of her relationship even when her ex hurt her. As someone who grew up with an emotionally abusive mother, I related viscerally to some of the sentiments Machado shares, like when she wishes that she had a bruise or a physical indication that her ex had abused her even though she knows that wishing for that is awful in its own way.I appreciated Machado’s commentary on the minimization of abuse in queer relationships in relation to the overall lack of representation of queer relationships, especially lesbian relationships. Though I know relationships between two women and two men are in some ways incomparable, it made me think about how we often turn away from critically examining queer relationships just because we’re often grateful for the representation at all – like Call Me By Your Name, which includes its own emotionally unsatisfying/obsessive relationship (which I recognize is different from the relationship Machado describes in this memoir), or the oftentimes toxic relationship between Brian and Justin in Queer as Folk. Machado does a great job centering women’s romantic relationships with one another in In the Dream House without glorifying or fetishizing them. At times I felt pulled out of the narrative when Machado included some of the more experimental chapters, the ones that strayed from describing her relationship with her ex-girlfriend and her own life. At the same time I recognize that these chapters could have served to represent how the mind often deals with trauma, through taking oneself out of the event and dissociating into alternative narratives. I think a part of me wanted a little more from this memoir – such as her healing process after the relationship aside from her developing a romantic relationship with Val – though I totally respect Machado’s decision to include whatever she wanted to and did not want to in this memoir.

The story opens with sixteen-year-old Melody’s coming of age ceremony in her grandparents’ Brooklyn brownstone, where we overhear a tense conversation between her and her mother, Iris. The novel then shifts with each chapter into a different character’s perspective, moving backward and forward in time as we see the choices Melody’s parents and grandparents made that got them to Melody’s present-day ceremony. Though she does not write in a linear fashion here, Jacqueline Woodson pushes Red at the Bone through the powerful way she captures her character’s emotions and their love for one another.Red at the Bone feels very vignette-y. Because of this vignette-y style, the concise chapters and the brevity of the book overall (e.g., 196 pages), I could see how in another author’s hands the novel would have felt gimmicky or underdeveloped. However, because of Woodson’s talented writing – she’s so good at writing scenes with descriptions and dialogue where you feel like you’re literally there too – the novel feels more like several beautiful snapshots of a family’s life pulled together, spanning three generations. There were quite a few moments where I felt my heart in my throat: the scenes where Aubrey shows his deep love for his daughter Melody, the moment when Aubrey realizes that he’s losing Iris or that he’s already lost her, the support CathyMarie, Aubrey’s mother, extends to Iris during her isolating pregnancy. By grounding this novel in such well-written, structurally concise yet emotionally lush scenes, Woodson shows us instead of tells us about how both societal forces and how we react to them shape our lives and the lives of those who come after us.I probably would’ve given this book five stars if it had been a bit longer and we had gotten to know some of the characters with more depth. However, I still so appreciated it, and I found Iris’s pull toward independence and Aubrey’s pull toward fatherhood particularly moving.

In Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence, Rachel Sherman interviews a bunch of super rich people living in NeWow, I learned a lot from this book. In Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence, Rachel Sherman interviews a bunch of super rich people living in New York City about their wealth and how they experience it. She draws a lot of intelligent, astute observations from the interviews. At the same time, her writing feels readable and accessible to a general audience, such that I always felt entertained and never bogged down by jargon or unnecessarily complex words. Some observations from her interviews include how rich people will try to enact a lot of individualistic and internal behaviors and attitudes to alleviate their guilt about their privilege, how they often try to lump themselves into the middle class when they are indeed not part of the middle class, and how they make upward or downward comparisons which affects how they talk about money. Here’s a quote about the upward or downward comparisons I found fascinating:“Because privilege is always relative, [interviewees’] orientations had a lot to do with which kinds of other people they compared themselves to. People like Ursula, whom I call ‘upward-oriented,’ downplayed their advantages by comparing themselves to others in a similar position or to those who had more. In fact, they were more likely to locate themselves, implicitly and sometimes explicitly, ‘in the middle.’ They tended to recognize privilege only indirectly, using euphemisms such as ‘lucky’ or ‘fortunate.’ They talked less about money unless I asked them directly about it, and they expressed fewer conflicted feelings about privilege per se… ‘downward-oriented’ people, like Keith and Karen, on the other hand, were more likely to describe themselves as privileged and to talk about people with less. They also talked more frankly about money and described struggling with feelings of discomfort about their advantages.”I appreciated so many of the insights Sherman garners from these interviews. One theme that stood out to me includes how a decent amount of the participants felt so uncomfortable explicitly naming their wealth privilege, even though they all pretty much knew they had it. As Sherman touches on, this theme reminded me so much of white privilege and how white people hesitate to name their privilege because they often feel that having privilege implies they have not worked hard – an untrue sentiment. Sherman does a fantastic job of capturing the extent to which participants in this book would try to legitimize and justify their wealth in response to the guilt they feel instead of focusing on structures and systems that enabled their wealth. I also loved how she captured the gender dynamic in which wealthy men were more likely to try to control their wives’ income, whereas when women earned more than men women did not exert as much control, which reflects both a sexist gender dynamic as well as a conflict between the couple that takes their attention away again from broader systems that perpetuate economic inequity. As someone with a good amount of inherited wealth reading this book made me reflect more on my own privilege and how I can confront and use it. For example, a small part of me is tempted to write – but my parents are immigrants and they worked hard and sacrificed, or I’m definitely not as wealthy as the people in this book – but instead I will acknowledge my inherited wealth for what it is instead of trying to use upward-comparison or legitimizing logic to minimize it. I do wish Sherman shared about her own class background and other relevant social identities; I’m not sure what the norms are in sociological research, but in qualitative psychological research it’s often the norm for researchers to state their own identities so we can understand how those identities may have affected the interviews. I’m also curious for if Sherman has more specific recommendations for how wealthy people can use their class privilege to deconstruct the systems that perpetuate it, in addition to what she alludes to in the book.Overall, highly recommended for those interested in an intelligent and well-written examination of the affluent and class privilege. I’ll end this  with a quote from a later section of the book about a broader takeaway from Sherman’s research findings:“However, I think the larger political task highlighted by these findings has less to do with prescribing how wealthy people should act and more to do with deconstructing this logic of legitimate privilege, which focuses on individual actions and measures behavior feeling, not distribution, with a moral yardstick. What would happen if we stopped distinguishing between individual good and bad rich people and engaged questions about a more egalitarian distribution of material and experiential resources? What would it mean, for example, to say that we should be critical of the fact that J. K. Rowling is a billionaire – regardless of how she came by her fortune, how she spends it, or whether she gives it away – just on the basis of the idea that such wealth is inseparable from extreme inequality, which is both pernicious to society and itself immoral?”...more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Dec 22, 2019","Dec 25, 2019","Oct 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34427004-uneasy-street

As I develop as a therapist, I am starting to honor how much emphasis I place on interpersonal relatioOne of the best therapy books I have ever read. As I develop as a therapist, I am starting to honor how much emphasis I place on interpersonal relationships and interpersonal psychotherapy theory in my work. At the same time, I recognize that a lot of past writing about interpersonal psychotherapy has promoted problematic ideals of ignored the importance of culture and social justice issues (e.g., Irvin Yalom’s work). I love Relational-Cultural Therapy because it both honors the power of relationships in our lives and our clients’ lives. Judith Jordan writes with great intelligence about how emphasizing the power of relationships defies traditionally Western and masculine values of independence and self-ambition. Here’s a couple of paragraphs that captures this (I know it’s a long passage to include in a  but I feel that it’s important info to disseminate):”The illusion of separation and the celebration of autonomy are part of the denial or denigration of our basic need to participate in growth-fostering relationships. Western culture valorizes these disconnected individualistic qualities. In such a culture, people with privilege can falsely appear more self-sufficient, more mature, more worthy of the privilege. But evidence increasingly suggests that people need to contribute to the growth of others and experience others’ willingness to engage in mutually beneficial interactions. To address these needs effectively, therapists need to ask: How has psychology been complicit in building cultural values that embrace separation and independence? How have psychology and clinical practice been shaped by, but also created and sustained, a culture of disconnection? How has psychology helped to sustain a culture of privilege and prejudice?These questions themselves contribute to the possibility of achieving social justice and dispel the illusion of the objectivity and neutrality of any theoretical position. In addressing them, RCT acknowledges its value biases: the belief that the capacity to build good connection is an essential human skill; the belief that it is valuable, even essential, for our global well-being that human beings develop relational skills and honor our basic need for connection; the belief that people have an essential need to connect with others; the belief that if these core yearnings for connection are supported by the larger context and people learn how to relate in growth-fostering ways with one another, people will experience an increasing sense of well-being at a personal and collective level.”Relational-Cultural Therapy also does an excellent job of addressing the therapeutic relationship as a mechanism for change. It acknowledges the power that we have as therapists and how we should strive to use that power to create a safe, compassionate space so that clients can experience a healing and authentic relationship. Even in my early development as a therapist, I have seen practitioners and theories that assume that the therapist is always right, that any difficulty of the client to trust the therapist is an indication of the client’s neuroses, etc. This approach has always felt so demeaning and distancing to me. Relational-Cultural Therapy, instead of minimizing clients’ emotions or assuming therapists’ superiority, posits that therapists should open themselves up to their own shortcomings for the sake of facilitating a growth-fostering relationship with the client. I feel so much better about this approach as it more explicitly addresses power within the therapy dyad. A quote about how Relational-Cultural Therapy approaches the therapy relationship that I appreciated:”Therapists must be careful not to force or push connection with clients, however. Instead, we should slowly, deliberately provide experiences of safe connection and of reworking empathic failures. Therapists must demonstrate to clients that the well-being of the relationship and the client is more important than certainty, being right, or maintaining our own self-images as ‘good, empathic therapists.’ Thus, we work actively with disconnections and relational failures. We apologize when we are wrong. We work with our own defensiveness when under attack, not assuming automatically that the entire problem is in the client (e.g., not turning to ‘projective identification’ to explain our own reactions in therapy). We are open to examining our own limitations, as well as the ways our own disconnections injure or affect others. Working with mutual empathy, the therapist allows clients to see their impact on her or him – that they matter to her or him.” I also like how Relational-Cultural Therapy explicitly recognizes how oppression contributes to difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Jordan names racism, heterosexism, and homophobia as factors that therapists must be cognizant of in how they affect clients’ capacity for connection as well as their overall wellbeing. While I have met many therapists and psychologists who do pay attention to how social injustice affects clients’ mental health, I have met many others who ignore this important point. Thus, I feel glad that Relational-Cultural Therapy seeks to understand how issues of oppression and privilege play out in clients’ lives and in the therapeutic relationship. While I appreciate this emphasis on social injustice and mental health, I feel that this theme is where the book could have benefited from more development as well. The book could have incorporated more specific ways that clients can navigate whether to trust therapists’ knowledge of social justice, as well as more case examples of power dynamics related to social identities playing out in therapy (e.g., if a therapist is working with a client with more privilege than the therapist). Still, I appreciated Jordan’s inclusion of this theme overall and would highly recommend this book to therapists and those interested in mental health who are looking for a very readable, relationally-oriented psychotherapy book that takes into account issues of power, privilege, and social justice. I will end this  with a quote related to therapists’ responsibility to address social injustice:”Relational-Cultural Therapy holds that therapists, as self-defined change agents, have a responsibility to pursue questions about social change as well as personal change. Context is essential to an understanding of suffering and what is called pathology, and thus the need for change in the social milieus within which we function must be addressed. Therapists have a special responsibility to question the part that the larger culture plays in creating disconnections and other suffering that bring people to treatment. They also have a responsibility to facilitate the well-being of the greatest number of people possible.”...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Sep 28, 2019","Oct 03, 2019","Sep 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7056930-relational-cultural-therapy

Recommended for those searching for an Asian inspired urban fantasy. I felt impressed by the world-building in this book in particular, featuring warring mafia clans and a cool jade magic system that Fonda Lee wrote about in a detailed yet understandable way. Also, because I’m me, I found the themes of gender and patriarchy and toxic masculinity so interesting in Jade City. Lee wrote compelling female characters and I felt so intrigued by how she positions them in a society that so values brutality and violence, how these characters navigate that world and either try to resist it or become consumed by it. I also felt drawn to Anden’s character, a queer protagonist who it seems like Lee may develop more in the sequel to this book.While the characters felt distinct from one another, I found myself struggling to connect with them on an emotional level. They have their internal struggles, whether that’s cockiness, or not being loved by a certain family member, or wanting a life outside of the one they’ve been assigned, but I wanted even more depth from their internal struggles and/or their relationships with one another. I’m in the process of deciding whether I should give the sequel a go, and while I’m leaning to no I’d be open to hearing the opinions of people who would recommend the next installment....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Dec 19, 2019","Dec 22, 2019","Sep 23, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43587154-jade-city

I felt most I appreciated this book and felt disappointed by it too, so if you want a non-controversial  scroll over to something else for now. I felt most grateful for Ibram Kendi’s argument that you either are racist or antiracist and there’s no real in between – that by passively being “non racist,” you collude in racism by allowing racist policy and ideology to persist. He applies this argument to several pertinent issues such as the racist nature of standardized testing, police brutality, intersectionality and racism against Black women and Black queer folk, and more. I liked his vulnerability in sharing about his personal life and how it connects to the concepts raised throughout the book.I felt most disappointed by Kendi’s claim that you can practice racism against white people. For example, in the section of the book where he addresses colorism, he writes that “I hardly realized my own racist hypocrisy: I was turning the color hierarchy upside down, but the color hierarchy remained. Dark people degraded and alienated Light people with names: light bright, high yellow, redbone.” Kendi essentially equates dark-skinned people’s jokes about light-skinned people to racism, which ignores the difference between prejudice and racism and how someone making jokes about a light-skinned person does not carry the same repercussions at all as opposed to the entrenched colorism against dark-skinned people that permeates society. He also dedicates a whole chapter titled “White” that argues that stereotyping white people is colluding in anti-Black racism which seemed like such a flawed argument, as my friend Bri tweets about here and writer Melanie Curry dispels in this succinct article about reverse racism, which is not a thing. He goes on to write that people who make arguments similar to those of Curry disregard Black people's power, which I found a lackluster thought process. Yes, Black people and people of color can accumulate power and use it in racist ways against fellow Black people and people of color, but this presence of power still exists within a system of white supremacy, so you can both possess power and be marginalized within the greater landscape of white supremacist racism. While I feel glad that this book’s rise in popularity will prompt people to take more explicit action against racism, I feel somewhat distressed that people may equate prejudice against white people to racism against Black people and people of color. As Goodreads user Raphael Nelson writes in his , How to Be an Antiracist does appear to have a white audience in mind in certain sections (e.g., the “White” chapter) and does not explore the deeper reasons why Black people and people of color may have prejudice against white people. For those interested in more reading on this topic, I’d highly recommend Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, Sister Outsider by Audre Lorde, and White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo. Again, I feel grateful for a lot of Kendi’s insights, such as his thoughts on internalized racism and its effects, though I’d definitely hesitate to recommend this book on its own, even though that opinion will most likely provoke some reactions....more",Notes are private!,1,721,1,"Jun 07, 2020","Jun 09, 2020","Sep 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist

An absolutely stunning memoir, one of the best I have ever read. In Know My Name, Chanel Miller reclaims her identity after the press descriStunning. An absolutely stunning memoir, one of the best I have ever read. In Know My Name, Chanel Miller reclaims her identity after the press described her as “unconscious intoxicated woman” in the aftermath of when rapist Brock Turner assaulted her. I remember feeling inspired, impressed, and in awe of Miller’s victim impact statement as Emily Doe when it came out in 2016. Miller brings that same level of strength and eloquence to this memoir.When I read my favorite memoirists, I get this feeling of familiarity, this sense of okay, I know who this person is, I can really see them. That’s how I felt throughout reading Know My Name. Miller takes back her power – after having been reduced to an unconscious victim – by writing beautifully and vulnerably about herself and her life, both before and after the assault. She includes so many heartwarming details that paint a picture of a woman who’s a loving sister, a witty artist and creator, as well as a person who has insecurities like all of us do. When I read details about her family, like how she caught her younger sister’s vomit in her hands to take care of her as a child or how she would listen to her dad sing along to music while cooking, I felt this immense sense of gratitude and closeness, like I wanted to thank her for making us remember that victims of trauma and assault are more than just what happened to them. Miller does a thorough job of detailing the impact of her trial itself, too, like how her sister had to continuously rearrange her school and work schedule because of court dates that kept getting delayed, and how Miller drained her bank account to cover expenses such as buying appropriate clothing for court.Miller’s writing itself is superb. The way she details the moments after she woke up in the hospital, how she describes her panic attacks and emotional outbursts in private and when she testified in court, her narration of the painstaking climb to heal and recover herself in a world with so many people who sought to discredit her – I felt like I was right there with her. Her prose is incisive and gets to the point without embellishment, and yet, she still captures the full emotional rollercoaster of her lived experience. I cried several times reading this memoir, both because of the anguish her rapist and the patriarchal legal system put her through, as well as because of how inspired and moved I felt by Miller’s self-awareness, her fortitude, and her courage in sharing her story. She’s put in hundreds and thousands of hours into processing this trauma and it shows in her insightfulness. I highlighted so many quotes from this book so it feels hard to choose just a couple to show in this , but here’s one I loved, in which Miller describes her response after receiving kind letters from people who read her victim impact statement:""For the past year I had been raking through comments looking for signs of support. I dug through opinion pieces in local newspapers searching for someone to stand up for me. I locked myself in my car in parking lots crying into hotlines, convinced I was losing my mind. All year the loneliness had followed me, in the stairwell at work, in Philly, in the wooden witness stand, where I looked out at a near-empty audience. Yet all along there had been eyes watching me, rooting for me, from their own bedrooms, cars, stairwells, and apartments, all of us shielded inside our pain, our fear, our anonymity. I was surrounded by survivors, I was part of a we. They had never been tricked into seeing me as a minor character, a mute body; I was the leader on the front line fighting, with an entire infantry behind me. They had been waiting for me to find justice. This victory would be celebrated quietly in rooms in towns in states I had never been to. For so long, I’d imagined myself wandering across a dry, empty plain. This card was the puddle. The realization that just below the surface, more water led to streams to rivers to oceans. That this was only the beginning. I was not alone. They had found me.”Miller gets political in this memoir too, which is unsurprising given how intertwined her individual experience is to the political realities surrounding sexual assault and misogyny in the United States. She calls out the legal system for its awful treatment of survivors, she gently yet firmly describes Stanford’s complicity and refusal to take action on behalf of survivors, and she acknowledges her own Asian American identity that often got erased when the media described her as Emily Doe. Again, Miller’s skill as a memoirist shows, as she incorporates commentary about these broader systemic injustices while still sticking close to her truth and her own story. As the feminist rallying cry goes, the personal is political, and Miller writes with precision and power about how the political landscape surrounding sexual violence affected her, as well as how she herself altered the political landscape through her own perseverance and courage. Overall, I recommend this memoir to literally every human on this planet. Again, I cried several times, mostly in reaction to Miller’s profound pain, perseverance, and power. While Miller does not go into the details of her assault, some parts of this book may be triggering for those with similar trauma and assault-related experiences. Though I was not sexually assaulted, I found Miller’s voice and experiences a healing salve in my own journey with PTSD. I can only hope that this book goes down as a classic. Thank you to Chanel Miller for your voice and your courage. I’ll end the  with the last passage in the memoir, a testament to Miller’s beautiful heart:“I survived because I remained soft, because I listened, because I wrote. Because I huddled close to my truth, protected it like a tiny flame in a terrible storm. Hold up your head when the tears come, when you are mocked, insulted, questioned, threatened, when they tell you you are nothing, when your body is reduced to openings. The journey will be longer than you imagined, trauma will find you again and again. Do not become the ones who hurt you. Stay tender with your power. Never fight to injure, fight to uplift. Fight because you know that in this life, you deserve safety, joy, and freedom. Fight because it is your life. Not anyone else’s. I did it, I am here.

In Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning, CaThis book blew me the heck away, definitely one of the top five essay collections I have ever read. In Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning, Cathy Park Hong delves into Asian American identity through the lens of history, psychology, and her own lived experience as a Korean American daughter of immigrants. This collection feels so necessary because Asian Americans receive such one-dimensional characterization in the United States: we’re math whizzes, we have wild tiger parents, we’re crazy rich, or now, we’re the ones who started Coronavirus. Hong eviscerates these reductionist stereotypes and explores Asian American complexity by sharing our history rife with colonization, the intergenerational trauma faced by our parents and passed down to us, and the ways in which we either resist whiteness or get subsumed by it. The most powerful part of this collection revolves around Hong’s capacity to connect the historical to the personal, such as this reflection on United Airline’s brutal treatment of David Dao Duy Anh, a Vietnamese American passenger:“In 1975, Saigon had fallen. His home was no longer his home. Dao was forced to flee as a refugee, and he and his wife raised their family of five kids in Kentucky, a new home that… had its own share of absurd hardships. Dao was caught trafficking prescription drugs for sex and lost his medical license, after which he earned his income as a poker player. While I agree with his defenders that his rap sheet is irrelevant to the United Airlines incident, it’s relevant to me, since it helps us see Dao in a more complex, realistic light. Dao is not a criminal nor is he some industrious automaton who could escape the devastation of his homeland and, through a miraculous arc of resilience, become an upstanding doctor whose kids are also doctors. For many immigrants, if you move here with trauma, you’re going to do what it takes to get by. You cheat. You beat your wife. You gamble. You’re a survivor and, like most survivors, you’re a god-awful parent. Watching Dao, I thought of my father watching his own father being dragged out of his own home. I thought of Asians throughout history being dragged against their will, driven or chased out of their native homes, out of their adopted homes, out of their native country, out of their adopted country: ejected, evicted, exiled.”Though some of Hong’s commentary and analyses may tread familiar ground for those already immersed in Asian American issues, I felt that she injected new depth to the conversation about Asian Americans in the United States. For example, I saw the publishing industry more clearly through Hong’s analysis of Jhumpa Lahiri’s work and how Lahiri’s preeminence in the literary sphere has forced the Asian American narrative to assimilate to a standard, comforting trope for the white gaze. Toward the end of the book, Hong drops – in the middle of a stunning self-analysis – a piercing truth about how Koreans’ fixation with double eyelid surgery stems from Dr. Ralph Millard, an American surgeon who tested the surgery on Korean sex workers to make them more appealing to GIs during the Korean War. As a somewhat big K-Pop fan (love me some Itzy and BlackPink) I have always found the Korean obsession with plastic surgery odd and superficial; Hong’s ability to link that obsession back to colonization and the imperialism of whiteness helped me see the truth, just like how many truths about Asian American identity and history have been erased or hidden from our view.The personal components of this essay collection shine as well. Hong’s background as a poet comes as no surprise given how the scenes from her personal life felt so well-written, like you could imagine yourself experiencing her past with her. I literally cringed when she described a moment from her childhood when she watched a group of white kids make fun of her grandmother’s English, kick her onto the ground, and then laugh at her – it reminded me of my own grandmother and I just pulsated with hurt and anger reading that scene. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I felt such a sense of pride and camaraderie when Hong detailed her intense, magnetic friendship during her undergraduate years with Erin and Helen, two other Asian women artists, and how their friendship with one another both hurt at times while also pushed them all to a place of artistic self-confidence that transcended white male expectations. Hong invests her whole heart and mind into Minor Feelings, which shows through the major connections she makes between Asian Americans’ political placement in the United States and her personal experience as an artist, daughter, friend, and more. Here’s another passage that stood out to me, about Asian Americans needing to reckon with whiteness:“I have to address whiteness because Asian Americans have yet to truly reckon with where we stand in the capitalist white supremacist hierarchy of this country. We are so far from reckoning with it that some Asians think that race has no bearing on their lives, that it doesn’t’ “come up,” which is as misguided as white people saying the same thing about themselves, not only because of discrimination we have faced but because of the entitlements we’ve been granted due to our racial identity. These Asians are my cousins; my ex-boyfriend; these Asians are myself, cocooned in Brooklyn, caught unawares on a nice warm day, thinking I don’t have to be affected by race; I only choose to think about it. I could live only for myself, for my immediate family, following the expectations of my parents, whose survivor instincts align with this country’s neoliberal ethos, which is to get ahead at the expense of anyone else while burying the shame that binds us. To varying degrees, all Asians who have grown up in the United States know intimately the same I have described; have felt its oily flame.”Overall, I would highly recommend this book to everyone, though it may resonate most personally with East Asians who are 1.5 or 2nd generation living in the United States. I reflected a lot on my own parents and Asian American identity while reading Minor Feelings, and I feel more motivated to honor my parents’ complex experiences despite the difficulties in our relationship. I also feel, as I’ve shared about in several of my recent blog posts, more determined to dismantle white supremacy through being a loud and proud Vietnamese American who protests racism even when it makes white people uncomfortable. Hong acknowledges that this collection does not encompass the enormity or entirety of the Asian American experience, which I agree with. I hope this book can act as another launching point for further reflection and activism that includes and centers South Asians, queer Asian Americans, and more. For now, I feel grateful for this book’s existence and hope that it gains great traction in 2020 and beyond....more",Notes are private!,0,403,1,"Mar 14, 2020","Mar 14, 2020","Aug 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52845775-minor-feelings

Activist P.E. Moskowitz explores the gentrification of urban neighborhoods across the country with chapI loved this book and learned so much from it. Activist P.E. Moskowitz explores the gentrification of urban neighborhoods across the country with chapters dedicated to New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco, and New York. They write about the people of color, particularly black and Latinx folks who can no longer afford to live in cities and their displacement, as well as about the root causes of gentrification and what contributes to it. As someone with an embarrassingly limited knowledge of gentrification – I knew the basic premise of rich, white people flooding cities and displacing poor people, especially people of color – I felt like I learned so much from this book while still appreciating its accessible writing and smart flow between ideas and concepts. I learned so much about use and exchange values and how urban land is used to enhance wealth, how suburbanization and gentrification relate to disadvantage poor people and radical community-building (e.g., omg as someone who grew up in a suburb, I now see how isolating and awful they are, ugh), and how neoliberalism itself maintains gentrification. I won’t go into all of these ideas in this , so check out Gabriella’s  if you want more depth as she writes about these topics with depth well. Here’s one quote I’ll pull that describes the definition of gentrification:“Gentrification, at its deepest level, is really about reorienting the purpose of cities away from being spaces that provide for the poor and middle classes and toward being spaces that generate capital for the rich. The trend isn’t limited to cities: for decades conservatives in the US government have been working to deregulate industry and defund our safety nets, to turn the United States from a welfare state based on the vision of John Maynard Keynes… into a neoliberal, corporate-friendly oligarchy concerned only with increasing the share of wealth owned by the upper class.”I appreciate this book even more because Moskowitz describes their emotional experience with gentrification and they provide tangible strategies to fight gentrification. I felt emotional reading their experience watching their own city of New York and the people they love within it fade away and get displaced by the rich. While describing this, they also acknowledged their own positionality as a white person and a gentrifier coming from a family of gentrifiers. Toward the end of the book they provide several strategies I found useful, such as fighting to raise the minimum wage, expanding and protecting public lands, regulating housing, and more. While I felt sad and defeated reading the descriptions of gentrification in this book, Moskowitz supplies us with strategies to fight this phenomenon that may elicit more feelings of empowerment, especially if we take action.Overall, highly recommended to those like me who had not known that much about gentrification. As Moskowitz writes about, I hope that housing justice and access become topics that are more heavily discussed in the political sphere and social justice spheres broadly....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Jan 10, 2020","Jan 14, 2020","Aug 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30652247-how-to-kill-a-city

The novel follows Jess, a butch lesbian, as she progresses through her teen years to her adulthood. The first-person narration puts us right up and close with Jess, so we see her find herself and her identity as a teen, to when she falls in love with her first femme, to when she works in factories and starts to unionize. I had to finish this book on deadline to discuss it with one of my feminist book clubs, but even without that deadline I would have speeded through given how immersive Jess’s perspective felt after 75 pages or so.I liked this book because of how honest, painful, and raw it felt. There are a lot of graphic scenes in Stone Butch Blues, including sexual assault and physical beatings, so be warned. However, I appreciated this content because Leslie Feinberg writes those scenes in such a way that honors the true homophobia, heterosexism, and transphobia that queer and trans people experienced (and still experience) in the United States. Feinberg approaches the brutality of the queer experience with refreshing truthfulness, as well as the solidarity and resilience of queer and trans people. From a writing perspective, I loved the dialogue in this novel – it showcased Jess and her relationships to the many butches and femmes she found community and conflict with throughout her life so well. The characters felt alive and distinct and I enjoyed that so much. I did not even feel that bothered by the many, many romantic relationships Jess went through, given how Feinberg still emphasized the importance of queer community overall as well as had a little section where Jess read books and worked on herself without a romantic partner, too.This book reinvigorates me to fight for queer liberation in any way I can. Feinberg does an excellent job showing how Jess’s experience of sexual assault and trauma affects her relationships, and as someone in the mental health field I feel a renewed inspiration to provide compassionate and gender-affirming care for those who have faced similar experiences of marginalization. Through this book, Feinberg also touches on racism in the queer community, the rise of trans-exclusionary radical feminism, and other divisive topics that still play out today. When I finished Stone Butch Blues, I felt so grateful for Leslie Feinberg and other activists who have made my life as a queer person so much easier than it would have been than if I had lived several decades ago.

As I read more about capitalism, I find it such an injustice that I did not learn more about it in high school or even college (though I recognize my own upper middle-class background shielded me from having to learn about it from life experience directly.) Silvia Federici references Marx and Foucault while also filling in the gender-related gaps in their arguments. Namely, she conveys how the intersection of capitalism and sexism dismantled solidarity between workers through the subjugation of women to men. She draws parallels to slavery as well as other historic injustices and events to further cement her case.I think I can recognize the intelligence of this work, though the more academic writing style dulled it a bit for me, which is totally a subjective preference thing (as all ratings are, I suppose) as opposed to a quality thing. I’m glad to have learned more about the origins of capitalism and found her commentary on how capitalism separates workers from their bodies quite apt and insightful. It’s wild that as much as we touch on the witch hunts, we don’t learn about them in this particular feminist lens, though the anti-feminist underpinnings of the witch hunts become almost impossible to unsee once you see them.

The novel follows two alternating timelines within the same Palestinian-Arab family: Isra, when she first leaves Palestine to marry into Adam’s family and live in the United States, and eighteen-year-old Deya, who lives in Brooklyn and learned at a young age that her mother Isra and her father Adam both died in a car accident. Deya begins to question this narrative about her parents when she receives a secret note from a mysterious yet familiar-looking woman, which leads Deya to also interrogate all she knows about her place in the world as a young woman, expected to marry a man and raise his children, who wants to go to college and yet is forbidden to do so. I felt enamored with how Etaf Rum writes about gender in A Woman is No Man. She portrays more explicit forms of patriarchy for sure, such as how Isra and other women are relentlessly pressured into only existing to support their husbands and raise their husband’s children. Rum also displays more nuanced manifestations of patriarchy, such as how Fareeda, Isra’s step-mother and Deya’s grandmother, internalizes this sexism and perpetuates it to disempower all of the other women in her life. I appreciated how Rum portrayed the deleterious effects of toxic masculinity too, how the pressure inflicted upon Adam contributed to his horrifying abuse of Isra. While I agree with other ers that sometimes Rum’s writing felt a bit repetitive or stilted, such as the initial conversations between Deya and the mysterious woman in her life, the characters’ emotions still felt genuine. I also liked how Rum included details about how Zionism – which the United States is complicit in through providing billions of dollars to Israel in military aid – generated the intergenerational trauma that affects Fareeda, Isra, and other members of their family.Despite this book’s vivid and brutal depiction of domestic abuse and stifling gender roles, I felt great hope when reading about how certain female characters did their best to fight back against their circumstances and reclaim their lives. I loved reading about Isra, Sarah, and Deya and how these women supported one another’s dreams even when other women tried to tear them down. Rum’s emphasis on the theme of books, knowledge, and education as empowerment both materially and psychologically resonated with me and made me feel once again grateful for the ability to access social justice and feminist texts. The pacing of this book enhanced my reading experience of it too. Rum inserts just the right amount of suspense into the alternating timelines between Isra and Deya to keep us on our toes. I liked how she set scenes and how she wrote about characters’ internal suffering, such as how she humanized Fareeda despite her cruelty toward Isra. Overall an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone interested in fiction about gender and family. I think I read this one at the right time for me because I’ve been feeling pretty hopeless about how white supremacy, amatonormativity, and patriarchy have been affecting my own life, and Rum reminded me of the power I wield in my own individual choices even when it feels like these systems of oppression are so entrenched (of course I recognize the difference between my privileged circumstances and those of the characters in this novel.) Yay for novels that feel both bleak and hopeful, that feature characters with strong voices doing their best to survive and care for others even in awful conditions....more",Notes are private!,1,118,1,"Jun 08, 2021","Jun 12, 2021","Aug 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34313931-a-woman-is-no-man

Instead of providing hA thoughtful, steadying book about the importance of doing nothing in a capitalist culture that always encourages productivity. Instead of providing hard and fast strategies to disengage from work and social media, Jenny Odell offers more of a smart, flowing reflection on the importance of separating ourselves from feeling like we have to work, feeling like we have to broadcast our lives on social media 24/7. She makes lots of astute observations about the monetization of time and the value of our attention, as well as the privilege that comes with the capacity to disconnect from our jobs and from forums like Facebook. She channels her energy into bioregionalism and encourages us to attune ourselves to our direct physical environments. Reading this book felt like going on a serene walk with a smart yet unpretentious friend. Odell’s ideas, while calmly expressed, carry great implications for redirecting our focus into our relationships and our environment instead of performing busyness and subsuming our identities in our productivity. At times I wanted just a bit more oomph, like a more directive stance on how we can actually fuel a shift to more often do nothing, either on the individual level or the societal level.

I most enjoyed this book’s profound honesty, like Ikpi’s initial refusal to accept her diagnosis when she learned about it, how she just could not fathom having to take medication for Bipolar II for the rest of her life. As someone in the mental health field and as someone who has experienced mental illness, I found her sharing so raw and real. While everyone has a unique experience with mental health and mental illness, I suspect that many who have grappled with Bipolar disorder in particular will find some solace and solidarity in I’m Telling the Truth, but I’m Lying. I also appreciate her sharing her journey as a Nigerian American woman, given that the face of mental health in the United States is still so often a white one. There’s a lot of stigma surrounding mental illness in the United States, a stigma that is often heightened for people of color. This book is not a tale of triumph over mental illness, rather, Ikpi gives an honest account into the highs and the lows and how she found some peace within a life turned upside down. Her story serves as a great reminder about how we should always strive for compassion in a society that ridicules and does not put in the effort to understand those with neurodivergence or mental illness.

Aaron Hamburger’s incorporation of the protagonist’s Jewish identity also added an element of cultural complexity to the story. However, I found the rest of the book lacking. The dialogue felt stiff and the characters one-dimensional. The story focuses a lot on the protagonist, Ari, and his relationship with his friend Justin. Yet I never really understood the purpose of Ari’s relationship with Justin. By the end of the book I struggled to understand the relationship’s utility: did Ari grow from it at all? Were we supposed to take anything away from the relationship other than to avoid relationships with people who may be unable to commit because of their own uncertainty surrounding their sexual orientation? I also found the storyline that took place in the “present” unsatisfying, as the story did not delve much into Ari’s deeper emotions surrounding M – his ex-partner- and M’s betrayal and what it would feel like to see Justin again.

I loved Le Ly Hayslip’sA powerful memoir about a Vietnamese American woman who lived through the Vietnam War as a young Vietnamese girl in the 1960s. I loved Le Ly Hayslip’s honest, visceral descriptions of what it felt like living in Vietnam as well as the horrible impacts of war. She shares her raw, unfiltered perspective on watching family, friends, and community members get incarcerated and/or killed, living in a state of constant distrust and uncertainty about her safety and the safety of those she cares about, and experiencing torture and multiple instances of sexual assault in her early adolescence. Amidst this personal account of the Vietnam War she shares some conversations and reflections about the motivations of different forces within the war (e.g., the Viet Cong compared to the Republican Army in the south) as well as an overarching desire for peace.I feel so grateful that Le Ly Hayslip wrote this memoir and shared her experience living through the Vietnam War. As a Vietnamese American whose parents immigrated to the United States, reading this memoir helps me feel closer to my heritage and my parents’ experience. I wish that accounts like these were incorporated more often into the education system in the United States, as opposed to predominantly reading books by white men and/or from white men’s perspectives. Hayslip writes with a lot of candor about what she went through, and I feel like her narrative is invaluable as a result. Some themes that stood out to me include the sheer atrocity of war and how it damaged so many people’s lives in Vietnam, as well as the colonization – especially the sexual colonization – enacted by soldiers from the United States and how proximity to these mostly white soldiers carried power, which sucks and made me despise white supremacy once again. Totally recommend to those interested in learning about the Vietnam War from a woman who actually lived through it. At times I felt like the narrative was a bit slow during the beginning, especially the first part of her journey back to Vietnam as an adult. I also took some issue with some victim-blaming language against sex workers later on in the memoir, how Hayslip expressed a sentiment that sex workers who “chose” sex work are to blame for not making better choices, which felt like such an awful thing to express given the environmental conditions (e.g., white supremacy, imperialism) that may have necessitated sex work. Despite these small constructive critiques I still enjoyed this book a lot and possess renewed anti-war and anti-imperialism sentiment after reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Aug 03, 2020","Jul 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5729.When_Heaven_and_Earth_Changed_Places

The main highlights of this book include what to say and what not to say to those in the grieving process. Megan Devine writes well about how because we often feel uncomfortable around other people’s pain, we are quick to make well-intentioned yet unhelpful and hurtful statements like “[insert loved one] is in a better place” or “at least you had them for as long as you did.” Devine draws upon her own experience of grief and her work with clients and community members to emphasize how instead of trying to reduce or end the painful emotions related to grief, we can work to honor and make space for those emotions instead. She also offers practical suggestions related to coping with stress and anxiety that may stem from grief.I give this book four instead of five stars for two reasons. I will say that I so appreciate Devine’s vulnerability and her psychological insight in this book. For example, she writes about how while people can come to cultivate meaning from painful events in their lives, no one should try to force them into that process before they feel ready – an insight that feels relevant to a painful event in my life right now. However, there were some passages where I almost felt like Devine’s writing came across as imprecise. For example, this paragraph:“Our rampant avoidance of feeling-with-each-other requires us to distance ourselves from environmental devastation, from human suffering, from child abuse and sex trafficking, from global wars, from hate crimes of all kinds. When we do see suffering, we throw ourselves into outrage, rather than collapse into grief. Activist and author Joanna Macy speaks of the unrecognized, and unwelcome, pain in the hearts of most activists. It’s as if we are afraid the full force of our sadness would render us mute, powerless, and unable to go on. That unacknowledged pain results in burnout, disconnection, and a distinct lack of empathy for others who hold seemingly opposing views.”When I read this paragraph I was like wait what just happened? I felt like a lot of generalizations were made in this paragraph without any real substantiation. Like yes, I imagine some people who avoid their feelings also avoid reflecting on topics like global wars and child abuse, however, I also know a ton of people – and can point to research – that shows how some people who are most in touch with their feelings commit themselves to fighting these types of injustices because they’ve found deep meaning through processing their pain. Furthermore, she states that unacknowledged pain results in a distinct lack of empathy for people with opposing views. While this relationship between lack of empathy and tolerating opposing views may be true sometimes, I also think that’s a huge and unmerited generalization. For example, I consider myself a pretty empathetic person (like, I’m a therapist, though I recognize not all therapists are empathetic, I think most of us are, but anyway) and I really do not tolerate views that promote white supremacy, homophobia, misogyny, imperialism, etc. I do not tolerate those views because I detest oppression and love social justice, not because I lack empathy. So some of these more throwaway phrases or paragraphs bothered me a little bit, though not enough that I’d avoid recommending this book to people who may enjoy it or benefit from reading it. I also wondered if Devine could have dedicated more space to exploring or naming how other cultures process grief. While she names that the Western world kinda sucks at it, she does not highlight any alternatives. For example, I’m aware that Native culture integrates grief into their daily existence in much more healthful, unrepressed ways. Still, I’m glad that Devine’s book may shift or expand how we talk about grief, to promote more compassion and emotional awareness....more",Notes are private!,1,105,1,"Jan 21, 2021","Jan 23, 2021","Jul 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34303824-it-s-ok-that-you-re-not-ok

Yoshino, a gay first generation Japanese American man and law professor, writes about the pressure for marginalized groups in the United States to cover – the pressure for gay people to act straight, for people of color to act white, for women to act like men, etc. He approaches this both from a legal perspective and from his own life, sharing his personal experiences with struggling to accept his sexuality and come out. There’s a level of conviction in his writing, backed up by his vulnerability in revealing his own journey, that shows how much he genuinely cares about supporting marginalized people and advocating for social justice. Reading the first part of this book made me feel both grateful and angry as a fellow gay Asian American. I felt grateful because I feel like I grew up in quite a different era than Yoshino, even just a couple decades apart (I was born the year before he graduated from law school.) Growing up, I had access to a decent amount of queer narratives, iconic young-adult books like Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and What They Always Tell Us or The Mortal Instruments series, that centered or featured queer characters. These narratives, combined with a general movement toward accepting queer people among peers my age, made it so I actually did not struggle much at all to accept myself, which differed a lot from Yoshino’s journey. Reading his experience made me feel so grateful for all the artists, activists, and others who fought and are fighting for systemic, legal, and relational change for the queer community. I also felt angry because Yoshino writes about the literal torture and abuse (e.g., electroshock therapy, conversion therapy) as well as legal discrimination that queer people have experienced throughout time, which is just awful. I think there needs to be more integration of queer history into common curriculums so we can continue to remember our past and fight to prevent a similar past from occurring again.I give this book four stars instead of five because some of his conclusions rubbed me the wrong away. I recognize that this book was published in 2006 so a lot has changed since then and Yoshino’s ideas may have changed as well. Mainly, I felt annoyed when he criticized identity politics as well as when he wrote that increased “rationality” is what will help us create a more equitable legal system. Instead of falling back on these rather centrist arguments, he could have further strengthened his suggested solutions by writing about how we can dismantle the broader and deeper systems (e.g., patriarchy, white supremacy) that create and maintain the need to cover in the first place. I would have loved if Yoshino, with his unique blend of immense legal knowledge and a strong command of language, wrote more about how law may stem from and may counteract the root sources of these systems of oppression.I also feel like he could have used a more intersectional framework when writing this book, which again I recognize is a framework that has gained traction more so now than in 2006. He writes about gays being forced to be straight and women being forced to act like men for example, but what about the unique pressures for gay Asian Americans, or for women of color? I know from my lived experience that gay Asian Americans experience a lot of racism from within the gay community, and at least touching on that would have deepened the analysis in this book. Overall a good read I would recommend to those interested in law and social justice and memoir.

I love how Morrison names startling and pernicious topics that influence our present society in God Help the Child, such as the privilege and glorification of whiteness as well as the horrors of child abuse and molestation. Despite its brevity, this book feels intense, as it contains so many deep emotions and fraught tensions between characters and their desires for love, peace, and acceptance. Yet, the book never feels overwrought, perhaps because of Morrison’s skilled writing style and her ability to make every word mean something. Some of the questions I am still contending with upon finishing this novel: what can we do to fight the glorification and power of white skin and whiteness in general, especially after we name it as Morrison has done in this book? Can we really protect our children from evil or do we have to make peace with the possibility that they may very well be harmed in a racist, sexist, world that is oppressive in too many ways to count? What does it mean to love a child, and can we love a child completely, or are our children bound to spend their lives unpacking the damage we have dealt to them, even with our best intentions?A great book I would recommend to Morrison fans and those who appreciate books that name race and also make you think through difficult, deep questions. I echo some of the critiques of God Help the Child that the characters lacked some interiority, at times I felt that they all represented a theme or idea which distanced me from truly connecting. I actually found Booker and his relationship with his brother Adam one of the most emotionally compelling components of the story.

Michelle Oberman travels both outside (e.g., El Salvador) and inside (e.g., Oklahoma) the United States to attain a deeper understanding of how the legal system intersects with abortion. She references a few detailed stories of women who have accessed abortion only to face prosecution. I most appreciated how Oberman makes the point that, regardless of legality, restricting abortion will predominantly affect poor women’s access to abortion, whereas wealthy and wealthier women will still have the resources to secure abortions. I’m excited to discuss this with one of my feminist book clubs because I had some mixed feelings about Oberman’s persistent message of working across the political aisle on the issue of abortion. On one hand I see and honor her choice to try to get pro-choice and pro-life to work with one another. Case in point, she refuses to call “pro-life” anything other than “pro-life” for the sake of respecting what they want to be called, even though I lean toward “anti-abortion” or “anti-choice”. Despite her call for unity or just conversation between the two camps though, I felt unsure about how collaboration or listening between these groups would actually take place or lead to tangible benefit? She mentions several times that those in the pro-choice and pro-life camps should work together or just hear each other out, but I still feel unclear about how that process would actually happen and what the desired outcomes are, given that even if they may share some values deep down, they want very different things. Still, a good book I’d recommend to those interested in the topic of law and/or abortion.

WhiReally enjoyed this short, biting thriller about Korede, a Nigerian nurse whose younger sister, Ayoola, has killed three of her former boyfriends. While Korede has always vouched for her sister, her solidarity is put to the test when Ayoola forms a romantic relationship with Tade, a kind and attractive doctor who Korede herself has crushed on for a while. How far is Korede willing to go to protect her very beautiful, very lethal sister?Oyinkan Braithwaite’s writing style fit the plot and the content of her story so well. My Sister, the Serial Killer contains short chapters that move the narrative along in a way that made me always want to keep reading. From the details of the murders themselves, to Korede’s feelings of protectiveness and jealousy toward her sister, as well as Korede and Ayoola’s difficult childhood – Braithwaite shows and not tells and fills every page with descriptive, captivating, to-the-point language. By doing so she keeps this novel within the thriller/horror genre while still incorporating deep themes related to gender and oppression.Braithwaite’s inclusion of themes related to patriarchy and misogyny furthered my enjoyment of My Sister, the Serial Killer. She incorporates these more political messages through well-written scenes so we do not get taken out of the novel. For example, she writes a scene in which a male police officer abuses his power after pulling Korede over while driving, and she comments on the dehumanizing effects of the male gaze through multiple men’s reactions to Ayoola’s physical attractiveness. Though Braithwaite maintains a lighter tone in this novel, the story relays several nuanced questions about the power men hold in society and to what extent can we punish women for reacting to that power, the effects of domestic violence and abuse on people’s psyches, and the moral implications of protecting someone who’s been harmed even if they harm other people who are in some capacity innocent. Recommended for those who want a short yet satisfying thriller with dark humor and feminist themes.

In his young-adult debut, Mark Oshiro writes about a group of predominantly queer teens of color experiencing police brutality and systemic discrimination at their local high school. He writes about their pain, solidarity, and resilience in the face of blatant racism and disadvantage. Our main character, Moss, suffers from some form of anxiety in large part due to the murder of his father years ago. I can imagine this novel triggering people who have experienced police brutality or know those who have experienced police brutality, or I can see it feeling cathartic given how Oshiro highlights the usefulness of rage in response to racism, even if those who uphold systemic oppression view that anger as inappropriate. Oshiro holds nothing back and describes the violence inflicted by the police with unflinching honesty. While I loved the message of this book, the writing fell short for me. I appreciated the diverse representation, but all the characters aside from Moss did not feel multi-dimensional enough. The dialogue felt clunky and the plot all blurred together. While in some ways this plot mirrors how racism occurs in real life – you may not have much time to process emotions if you are consistently trying to protect yourself and those you care about with no time for breaks – I wish Oshiro had slowed down the storyline a bit to provide more room for the deeper emotions (e.g., grief) to emerge so we could connect more with the characters. I think this book could elicit complex conversation surrounding anger as a gift. I so appreciated Oshiro showing how Moss’s anger as a black queer teen helps launch change and enact justice. At the same time I see some ers stating that Moss’s anger came across as misogynistic toward certain characters. While I could potentially see that, I also see how Esperanza, Moss’s friend who he directs some of his anger too, acted privileged and ignorant toward the racism Moss and others experienced. Thus, I’m overall grateful for Oshiro for writing a book that promotes thinking, feeling, and dialogue about these topics, even though the writing in this novel left me desiring something more....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Feb 08, 2020","Feb 21, 2020","Jun 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36142487-anger-is-a-gift

I liked how Searching for Sylvie Lee captures the cost of immigration. The sections about what Sylvie’s parents, especially her mother, sacrificed and how that affected their relationship with Sylvie felt heart wrenching and true. The emotions of grief, longing, and mystery all resonated too, perhaps because Jean Kwok drew from her own experience of grief as indicated in her author’s note at the end of the book.I wanted more from the book though, especially in terms of emotional resonance. The book had so much going on – the dynamic between sisters Amy and Sylvie, Sylvie’s fraught relationship with Jim, the family dynamics between Helena and Sylvie and Amy and everyone else, etc. While I liked that Kwok tried to take on so much, I felt that the emotional core of each conflict or relationship in the book needed more development. I dislike writing this but by the end of the book I struggled to care or connect with any of the characters or what happened to them because I did not develop that emotional attachment while reading the earlier sections of the book. I am unsure what specifically would have helped, maybe focusing on a couple of the conflicts or relationships instead of trying to capture so many, or maybe providing even more flashbacks that showed the hearts of these characters.I loved Kwok’s Girl in Translation when I read it about over a decade ago or so, so I hope she continues to write.

I liked when Ted Chiang wrote stories about innovative concepts – if there were a technology that could allow us to perfectly recall all our memories (“Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling”), if we could raise AI software as if they were digital pets or almost like our own children (“Life Cycle of Software Objects”) – and merged them with some aspects of human relationships. I loved the last story in this book, “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom,” because I feel that Chiang pulled off that combination in such a superb way. In the story, humans can purchase “prisms” that allow us to talk to our alternate reality selves, if only for a brief period of time. Chiang intertwines this intriguing concept with deep commentary about what it means to be a “good” person and if our attempts to be kind, decent people really matter. He imbeds this commentary in the complex lives of specific characters, including Nat, a woman who has struggled with substance use and is now helping out a con artist, and Dana, a therapist who once made a mistake in a friendship several years ago. I grew attached to these characters and the ending of the story filled my heart with warm feelings. I actually finished the story on a day where I felt a little sad, and the story helped me remember to be kind to myself and my efforts to be a compassionate and caring person. I did not resonate with several of the other stories in this collection though. I found them to be too cognitive or intellectualized for my taste. They felt more like thought experiments than stories that focused on characters’ developments, emotions, or relationships with one another. My lack of enthusiasm may stem from how I tend to prefer more interpersonally-focused fiction as opposed to science-fiction or speculative fiction. Again though, there were a few stories, especially “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom” that merged the speculative fiction style with characters’ emotional development....more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,"Mar 06, 2021","Mar 08, 2021","Jun 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41709682-exhalation

I feel privileged having grown up as a gay man in the 21st century without much awareness of the AIDS epidemic, so reading Close to the Knives provided much needed context for the violence and stigma queer people experienced at the hands of the state. I most appreciated David Wojnarowicz’s boldness and honesty; he's unafraid to directly criticize the state and the government for not protecting its LGBTQ+ members. He writes about the emotional and physical toll of losing his own health to a preventable illness as well as the grief that accompanies seeing his friends pass away. He also celebrates the joy and resiliencies of the queer community in the face of oppression, our capacity for connection even when those in power try to put us down. I give this book four stars because to be honest at times I didn’t really comprehend what was happening? I appreciate the Wojnarowicz’s experimental, visceral writing style, though at certain points of the book, especially in the beginning when he wrote about his sexual relationship, I felt disconnected from his narrative because I struggled to comprehend what was happening, or I felt that certain areas – especially his sexual relationships – came across as a bit overwritten.

Skim follows Skim, a girl in high school who practices witchcraft and thinks a lot about life and death. She’s sad a lot, perhaps depressed, and that’s where Mariko and Jillian Tamaki draw strength in this graphic novel – the way they capture this sadness with intimacy, poignancy, and subtlety. I know I had an emo phase as a preteen and had lots of angsty moments throughout my teen years (and I still have those moments, lol) and this book helped bring me back to those emotions. Jillian Tamaki illustrates this angst well, with sweeping yet detailed black and white drawings that show how lonely Skim feels in her life. The Tamaki sisters incorporate a range of important themes, like sexuality, suicide, and isolation with a fine touch, while focusing in on Skim’s heart and how these themes affect her, both immensely and tangentially.Despite enjoying the subtlety of the novel, I wanted a stronger plot as well as more of a progression of Skim’s character leading toward the story’s end. The story felt fragmented to me, and while on one hand I can see the appeal of that fragmentation – it’s very slice of life, a bare and uninterrupted look into an angsty teen’s life – I found it difficult to stay engaged in the story or invested in the characters with not much happening. Toward the end of the book, I felt unsure about if Skim had grown, or what changes had manifested within herself or her life or anywhere. Again, perhaps this more meandering plot was the point of the book, but I wanted more character growth or clear meaning. A unique graphic novel I’d recommend to those searching for a slice of authentic teen angst. Mariko Tamaki later wrote Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me, one of my absolute favorite books and graphic novels of all time, so perhaps that represents growth as a writer (or just my mediocre taste preventing me from liking Skim all that much).

I love that hooks’s writing always takes mainstream feminist thinking and elevates it. She encourages usAnother iconic feminist text from bell hooks. I love that hooks’s writing always takes mainstream feminist thinking and elevates it. She encourages us to deeply consider how racism and classism intersect with sexism to further marginalize women of color and poor women. She argues that we should conceptualize feminism as a radical, revolutionary movement as opposed to an individual lifestyle. Her writing, while intelligent and replete with critical analysis, remains accessible and close to the human lived experience. For example, here is a quote about how she interrogates why feminism is not just about equality with men, even though we often market it that way:”Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined women’s liberation as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status. Concurrently, they know that many males in their social groups are exploited and oppressed. Knowing that men in their groups do not have social, political, and economic power, they would not deem it liberatory to share their social status… from the very onset of the women’s liberation movement, [women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white] were suspicious of feminism precisely because they recognized the limitations inherent in its definition. They recognized the possibility that feminism defined as social equality with men might easily become a movement that would primarily affect the social standing of white women in middle and upper class groups while affecting only in a very marginal way the social status of working class and poor women.”I would highly recommend this text to everyone, especially those who are interested in feminism who hold dominant identities (e.g., white, middle to upper middle class, etc.) hooks’s writing challenged me to think about my own complicity, both as a man and as someone who comes from a higher socioeconomic status. When she wrote about how writing about feminism is often too secluded and filled with academic jargon to be understandable, accessible, or even helpful at all for poor women and women who have not had access to education, I was forced to confront my own privilege of attending somewhat elite schools and universities throughout my life and my own complicity in classism. Even in sections where I disagreed with her – I felt that she could have done a better job discussing how heteronormative lifestyles do in fact perpetuate patriarchy, for example the wedding industrial complex – I still appreciated her thought process and her passion. I will end this  by integrating a few passages from an early section of the book, about feminism and its more revolutionary roots:”The willingness to see feminism as a lifestyle choice rather than a political commitment reflects the class nature of the movement. It is not surprising that the vast majority of women who equate feminism with alternative lifestyle are from middle class backgrounds, unmarried, college-educated, often students who are without many of the social and economic responsibilities that working class and poor women who are laborers, parents, homemakers, and wives confront daily… Often emphasis on identity and lifestyle is appealing because it creates a false sense that one is engaged in praxis. However, praxis within any political movement that aims to have a radical transformative impact on society cannot be solely focused on creating spaces wherein would-be-radicals experience safety and support. Feminist movement to end sexist oppression actively engages participants in revolutionary struggle. Struggle is rarely safe or pleasurable.”...more",Notes are private!,0,83,1,"Jul 28, 2019",Aug 2019,"Jun 02, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51378.Feminist_Theory

The book begins with the explosion of an experimental medical treatment device called the Miracle Submarine, an explosion that leaves two people dead and several more injured. We follow the three-member Yoo family: Young and Pak who immigrated from Korea to ensure a better life for their daughter Mary, only to encounter devastation and loss after their move. We also track with Elizabeth, the single mom of an autistic child who dies in the explosion, and see into the hearts and minds of a group of mothers who wish the best for their children with mixed results. The case peels back layer after layer of these characters and their relationships, so that we can see how much they sacrifice and love and hurt one another beneath the secrets they keep, the secrets that come bubbling up to the surface in the courtroom. I most loved how Angie Kim both established such a thrilling pace of plot with Miracle Creek and a strong emotional core within her cast of characters. The way she ended each chapter, the slow-burn suspense of who lit the fire, and the overall quality of her writing all made me want to keep flipping pages, up until I finished the book in two days. With the thrilling speed of the plot, Kim still manages to slow down and let us savor the moments of emotional intensity and intimacy between these characters. I felt most connected to how she wrote about the Yoo family and how immigration affected them so much, how Young had to work all the time and sacrifice her relationship with her daughter, how Mary received racist taunts that made her want to travel back to Korea, how Pak’s lack of English-speaking ability emasculated him, and much more. The tenderness, conflict, and estrangement between Young and Mary served as the emotional backbone of this book for me, as their connection felt so nuanced and engaging and bound by cultural constraints. I also found the subplot about the group of mothers of autistic children important and well-written, in particular the parts when Kim showed the complexity of these mothers’ deep, all-consuming affection for their kids. Parent-child relationships span several emotional notes and Kim captures a lot of them in Miracle Creek.One small yet significant part of the book that bothered me: the way Kim wrote about the fetishization and exotification of Asian American women. I loved that she included the grossness of it and the character at hand’s emotional reaction to the racism she experiences. Yet, Kim’s commentary on the issue read very much like a “why is it that an attraction to Asian American women is perceived as fetishization, when people are attracted to blondes and that’s not a problem,” which I felt grossly over-simplified the issue. I wish Kim’s commentary on fetishization and exotification included how, due to the power of whiteness in white supremacy, people of color are othered (see bell hooks’ iconic book Black Looks) so that a preference for blondes and a preference for Asians is indeed very different, as well as how so many people of color are socialized to idealize whiteness and are taught to want to date white people above fellow people of color. Because the book follows so many different topics (e.g., immigration, autism, family, etc.) Kim did not have space to go into every topic in-depth – like an awful sexual assault that occurs – which may leave some readers disappointed. Overall, though, one of the strongest thrillers I have ever read and one that, unlike many other thrillers, includes themes of diversity and race that strengthened the novel as a whole. I tipped between 4 and 5 stars for this and landed on 5, in large part because of Young Yoo’s growth and development as a character. One scene between her and Mary made me cry at the end of the book, in a great way. I cannot wait to read more people’s reactions to this novel as well as Kim’s future work....more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Jun 07, 2019","Jun 09, 2019","May 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40121959-miracle-creek
