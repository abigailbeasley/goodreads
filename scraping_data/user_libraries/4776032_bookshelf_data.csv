To a careful ear, silence sounded like a knife in the dark.This earns a 4 star r4 stars = Fantastic and easy to recommend.True silence was unnatural. To a careful ear, silence sounded like a knife in the dark.This earns a 4 star rating from me, but I am giving it 5 to help offset all the assholes that gave it a low rating before it was even released. I cannot imagine how disheartening that must be for an author, to see you already have such a low average rating, before anyone has even had a chance to read your work. “I do this, and I own you to the middle of your bones…I ask you for a thumb? You run to find a boning knife. You have a sweet dream late at night, you wrap it in a bow and bring it right to me.”So unlike the last novella Rothfuss released, this one was lovely, and a great way to scratch the itch if you also miss being in his world. If you read the author’s  for this book, he gives a link to a post on his blog. There he explains that he never felt Auri’s novella was publishable and how it came to be. It is worth a read if you are a fan of his series but were disappointed in The Slow Regard of Silent Things.  Names are fine…But if you know what something’s called, it’s hard to keep wondering what it is. It is a charming tale about Bast and his interactions with the community during a typical day, and could be enjoyed as a stand alone if you have not yet read any of the novels in this series. I enjoyed watching some of the children become more clever after learning from their previous interactions and deals made with Bast. I already liked his character from The Kingkiller Chronicle novels, but this novella and its beautiful illustrations will make you love him even more. His roguish way of helping others and his sense of humor are rather endearing.All that glittered wasn’t gilt, and sometimes it was worth a little work so that you seemed to be the thing you truly were. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: Bast almost made it out the back door of the Waystone Inn.Favorite Quote: They wrapped themselves in fears and wept at being blind. ...more",Notes are private!,6,15,1,"Nov 16, 2023","Nov 17, 2023","Nov 14, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/157265081-the-narrow-road-between-desires

And there were many for which I had to read between the lines 4 stars = Fantastic and easy to recommend.There were so many stories that I could tell. And there were many for which I had to read between the lines to extract what was too painful, brutal, private, or treasured to relate directly. These were the things past telling.This was a thoroughly enjoyable, well written historical novel that starts with an elderly woman, over 100 years old, reflecting back on her life. A difficult life where the world tried to beat her down in as many ways as it could, but her fierceness and strength kept her moving forward down the next unexpected road. It never take long for a lie to travel. The truth, with its layers and colors, take its time. From being stolen from her family in Africa and sold into slavery while prepubescent, to working alongside a pirate in the Caribbean, to being a slave under a few different masters in the colonies while risking her life to assist runaway slaves, the story moves along at a quick pace. It is rich both in plot and character growth and development as you are with the heroine from the time she is a child until she is a centenarian. There is an abundance of quotable prose and it gradually transforms as the polyglot main character’s grasp on languages evolves as she ages.  Was only with him long enough to miss him for the rest of my life.A few relationships are covered over the decades, but the one man she married was a touching romance that will break the reader’s heart. The ending is happy and also brought a couple of tears to my eyes. I really enjoyed this one and recommend it to anyone else that likes historical fiction or well written stories in general. This was the first book I have read by the author, but I will be seeking out more of her books. Then I go to hell. If you there, no heaven can hold me.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: I sit in the sun.Favorite Quote: History is what’s left after the lies are taken out....more",Notes are private!,2,13,1,"Nov 19, 2023","Nov 22, 2023","Nov 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58392927-things-past-telling

We dig until we find it.America is unique from other countries in that we take capitalism to a perverse dystopian level, milking our citizens for money in every facet of their life. Profits come before safety, civility, quality of life, and our health. Why would our food be any different?In the end, that is what this book is about. It will show how the makers of processed foods have chosen, time and again, to double down on their efforts to dominate the American diet, gambling that consumers won’t figure them out. It will show how they push ahead, despite their own misgivings. And it will hold them accountable for the social costs that keep climbing even as some of their own say, “Enough already.”This is not a diet book. It does not tell you what you should or should not be eating, and there are no suggested meal plans or tips to lose weight. What it does is pull the curtain back on the food industry to show how the corporations that feed America have knowingly made our food addictive while being less filling, at the expense of our health. Unfathomable amounts of money have been spent on research to scientifically calculate what hooks people the most, and no regard is given for the health outcomes of consuming the garbage that is processed food. When it comes to pathogens in the meat industry, ignorance is financial bliss.The government looks the other way while pocketing money from big dairy, big beef and other lobbyist groups. At the time this book was published, $2 billion dollars of taxpayer money was given to the beef industry each year in the form of subsidies and promoting campaigns to increase our consumption of unhealthy red meat, while a piddly $6.5 million was spent each year on the USDA nutrition center to nudge us the other way. Gee, I wonder why over 75% of Americans are overweight and do not understand basic nutritional concepts.  I couldn’t resist drawing an analogy to the realm of narcotics. If sugar is the methamphetamine of processed food ingredients, with its high-speed, blunt assault on our brains, then fat is the opiate, a smooth operator whose effects are less obvious but no less powerful.It is also disgusting how the class divide operates in this country. It is far more expensive to eat healthy, fresh organic whole foods than it is to eat processed chemicals posing as food that is peddled to the poor and working class. It is no coincidence that the wealthy owners of junk food and fast food companies do not eat the filth they work so hard to sell to consumers. But America sure is eating it up. If you care about your health or would like to see how exploitive and harmful capitalism can be when grossly unregulated, this book is still a timely and relevant read ten years after its publication. There is a huge economic issue involved in the obesity problem. It falls most heavily on those who have the fewest resources and probably the least understanding or knowledge of what they are doing.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Minneapolis was having a blustery spring evening on April 8, 1999, when a long line of town cars and taxis pulled up to the office complex on South 6th Street and discharged their well-dressed passengers.Favorite Quote: We’re hooked on inexpensive food, just like we’re hooked on cheap energy....more",Notes are private!,8,20,1,"Oct 29, 2023","Nov 24, 2023","Oct 18, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35141435-salt-sugar-fat

A story about resilience and resistance in the face of a world that would strip you of power. A story about a young mestiza woman’s battle of wills with a house and all it represents, a house haunted by both the supernatural and its colonial history.I was looking for my annual-ish Autumn creepy read and this scratched the itch after being let down by Bradbury. This novel seamlessly crosses genres, being part historical fiction as it takes place after the Mexican War of Independence in the 1820’s, part slow burn romance, and of course somewhat spooky, but not so scary that a weenie like me could not enjoy it.Our relationship was founded on one thing, and one thing only. My world was a dark, windowless room, and he was a door.After her father’s death, the heroine marries a wealthy landowner to secure her and her mother’s financial security. Things are not what they seem though at the hacienda and she seeks help through a local clergy man, Andrés, who also happens to be a witch. His dichotomous character was the most interesting and I wish the novel had been written solely from his viewpoint, or maybe the author will write another one about him and his unique childhood.  “I find it odd that a witch would become a priest,” I said flatly. This answer surprised a bark of laughter from him, its texture low and throaty. “Is there any vocation more natural for a man who hears devils?”There was more religious talk than I desired, though that is to be expected when one of the main characters is a priest and there is an exorcism to be had. The content is not preachy however, and actually infuses some cynical side eye toward religion, which was appreciated. I did not trust the clergy, not so long as men like my husband could buy them and their services.The story moves along at a steady, moderate pace and does not wrap up everything in a neat little bow at the end (bonus points awarded). It was a fun read that fit the season and I would read something else by the author, but I predict I will not remember much about this one in a year or two. It felt so right it had to be sinful.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: The low sweep of the southern horizon was a perfect line, unmarred by even the smudge of horses tossing their heads in the distance.Favorite Quote: Colonialism carved the landscapes of our homes with ghosts.

Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.It is true what people say, the young have the ability, but lack the wisdom, and2 stars = Meh. Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.It is true what people say, the young have the ability, but lack the wisdom, and the old have the wisdom, but lack the ability.In my quest to become more familiar with Portuguese culture, I decided to read a book by José Saramago, one of the most popular novelists in Portugal and a Nobel prize winner. I was told this novel was a good place to start, and was drawn to the dystopian theme centered around the dangers of unfettered capitalism and the slave-like cage it encloses around workers. The author at times has an incredible way with words - prose that makes you stop and ponder it for its brilliance and beauty before moving on in the story. But that is really the only positive thing I have to say.... the best way of killing a rose is to force it open when it is still only the promise of a bud.While some readers will not mind, I detested the format of the novel which did not include quotation marks or even new lines for new speakers, and only a miniscule number of paragraph breaks in the entire book. Mostly, it was 10-15 page chapters that consisted of one long unbroken paragraph, primarily in a stream of consciousness format. Paragraphs are chapter length, and sentences are paragraph length. It was utterly painful to read despite the interspersed lovely prose, as evidenced by the four months it took to complete this 320 page novel. For example, here is ONE sentence pulled from one of the paragraph chapters:If simplicity really is a virtue, no idea could be more virtuous than this, as you will soon see, Sir, Cipriano Algor would say to the head of the buying department, I’ve been pondering what you said about having two weeks to remove the stock taking up space in the warehouse, it didn’t occur to me at the time, probably because of my excitement when I saw that there was a slight hope that I might be allowed to continue as a supplier to the Center, but then I started thinking about it and thinking about it, and I realized that it’s difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill two obligations at once, that is, to remove the crockery and make the dolls, yes, I know you haven’t yet put in a firm order for them, but just supposing that you did, it occurred to me, purely as a precaution, to suggest an alternative that would leave me free during the first week to get on with making the dolls, I would then remove half of the crockery in the second week, go back to the dolls during the third week, and remove the remaining crockery during the fourth week, I know, I know, you don’t have to tell me, I’m not pretending that there isn’t another option which would be to start with the crockery the first week and then alternately, in sequence, dolls, crockery, dolls, but I think, in this particular case, one should take into account the psychological factor, everyone knows how different the state of mind the creator is from that of the destroyer, of someone who destroys, and if I could start making the dolls, that is start with creation, especially in the excellent frame of mind in which I find myself now, I would face with renewed courage the hard task of having to destroy the fruits of my own labor, because having no one to sell them to or, worse still, not even being able to give them away, is tantamount to destroying them.I also learned that I could not possibly care less about pottery or learning how pottery is made. I hope I never read a book about a potter or pottery ever again as this one provided more than enough fodder on this mind numbing subject for a lifetime. There are some things that are only said once and never again and you hear those words in your head until the last days of your life.While this one was unfortunately a dud for me, because of his talented way of putting words together, I would read another Saramago novel so long as it was in audio format to avoid the atrocious formatting, and if the plot never came close to discussing pottery at all, whatsoever.... time is a master of ceremonies who always ends up putting us in our rightful place, we advance, stop, and retreat according to his orders, our mistake lies in imagining that we can catch him out.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: The man driving the truck is called Cipriano Algor, he is a potter by profession and is sixty-four years old, although he certainly does not look his age.Favorite Quote: They say that time heals all wounds, but we never live long enough to test that theory....more",Notes are private!,4,9,1,"Nov 24, 2023","Mar 05, 2024","Sep 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36511961-the-cave

One of the best books I've read this year.History is written by the victors, but it is made by the rebellious.This book 5 stars = Utterly incredible. One of the best books I've read this year.History is written by the victors, but it is made by the rebellious.This book contains the information that your Social Studies and History textbooks intentionally omitted. While they still teach American children lies about Christopher Columbus discovering America, this book tells you about the actual first non-indigenous people that came to America’s shores. Forget the lies you were told about “state’s rights”, this book teaches you the real reason the Civil War was fought, as well as how the Revolutionary War was in large part due to protecting the practice of slavery.Slavery existed in Africa before white people showed up, but human beings were not commodified or chattel. In pre-colonial Africa, enslaved people had legal rights, their status was not passed down to their children, and they did not serve as a major labor force. In fact, most of the previous iterations of human bondage around the world offered a path to freedom. To be fair, it is much easier to refer to America’s unique institution as “slavery” than it is to call it the “perpetual, race-based, constitutional, human trafficking enterprise that legally reduces human beings to chattel through the means of violence or the threat thereof.”I could go on all day with examples, but you should just read the book to learn more about how our country was founded to how the GOP’s overt bigotry and fear mongering with imaginary threats continues to be effective today. And according to Trump, America is the greatest country on earth, despite what the numbers say. We are a beacon of freedom and liberty even though we rank first in the world’s prison population. We are the smartest nation in the world, despite ranking fourteenth in education and second in ignorance. We believe in equality and tolerance, despite ranking number one on the list of the most racist countries in the world. It is amazing and a great compliment to the author’s writing, that while discussing such vile and incomprehensible parts of history, he somehow makes you laugh. He manages to keep heavy topics light, even as your heart breaks and your temper flares. I found the inclusion of random childhood and family stories along with his digressions about food and music to be welcomed breaks that allowed your mind to consolidate and digest what you just took in. From its inception, America was always a pyramid scheme where the wealthy benefited from the labor of the poor.Perhaps because my spouse and I are in the process of emigrating out of the USA, or perhaps because like a privileged fool I did not pay attention to politics until several years ago when I was shocked to see the brazen bigotry and corruption that had always been there, this book really hit home. I highly recommend it to all Americans as well as everyone else. Whiteness is not a social construct, nor is it as eternal or as confident as it seems. Whiteness is fleeting. It is a ghost; a shadow of an imaginary thing. It is the result of an insecurity that not only justifies man’s inhumanity to man, it reinforces the subconscious doubt in one’s own inferiority. Superiority does not require subjugation. A superior human being has no need.You cannot fight oppression and discrimination, if you do not stay informed and vigilantly pay attention. In America, we must educate ourselves on our factual history, because you are not taught it in school nor any other inconvenient truths. Give me the painful truth every time, as I have no use for comfortable lies. Like its history, this nation is a mirage. Its greatness is a figment of a collective white imagination that envisions a bright, shining star where there is only a dumpster fire. America is a con artist. It is a counterfeit farce of a white country convinced of its own supremacy. It is a boot on every Black throat and noose on every negro neck. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: I remember when I discovered America.Favorite Quote: The lesson of Reconstruction is us. That we exist and breathe and love and sing and laugh and are still here is not a miracle or a revelation. It is a simple, unignorable fact that we cannot be extinguished. All the evil that the world has ever had to offer has been lobbed in our direction. They enslaved. They brainwashed. They lynched us separately and massacred us by the hundreds. They enslaved us by the boatload and sold our families in pieces. They mined our muscles and our minds for their profit and built an empire from it. And when we did the same without their help, they set it on fire.	This is America - a floor slick with blood.	But that is not who we are....more",Notes are private!,10,28,1,"Oct 05, 2023","Oct 10, 2023","Sep 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55959466-black-af-history

Translated from Danish, it is a short book with over a hundred quick chapters that are only 1/2 - 2 pages each. Each chapter is an employee’s statement to whomever the unnamed human resources or psychologist type person is that is conducting the interviews.You’d probably say it was a small world, but not if you had to clean it.The story takes place on a spaceship that belongs to a corporation of an unclear industry or service, though it has a high priority on maximizing productivity. In that way, it is generic like every other corporation. The employees onboard are a mixture of humans and humanoids that were “born” on the ship, in something kind of like the pods that grew the avatars in the movie, Avatar. The humanoids are very human-like though they are programmable and their memories (consciousness?) can be regenerated into a new body if needed. Most of the humans are struggling with adapting to their new life and no longer being on Earth.Every day, my hands yearn to dig deep into soil so that I might lower myself into its certainty, and the earth receive my death and make me its own.The statements seem disjointed at first, but eventually themes emerge about how the employees are responding to objects that were taken from a planet they recently visited. The objects in some ways are inanimate like rocks, but in other ways seem to convey emotions and can affect the environment of the room. It also soon becomes clear that a crisis is unfolding onboard the ship with a wide range of opinions and thoughts from the staff regarding the cause and how to handle it.The fragrance in the room has will and intention. It’s the smell of something old and decomposing, something musty. It’s as if the smell wishes to initiate the same process in me: that I become a branch to break off, rot and be gone.The ephemeral book flies by quickly but leaves you with more unsettling questions than answers, the main one being, what exactly is the core essence that makes someone human? Philosophically, where is the line drawn between AI and humanity when human organics and DNA are included? This would be a thoughtful selection for a book club as it is rich with discussion topics, despite its short length. I would also recommend it to anyone that is in the mood for a unique book, unlike any other they have read before. Thoughts of this story will linger with me for a longer time than it took to read it.I know without a doubt that I’m real. I may have been made, but now I’m making myself.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: It’s not hard to clean them.Favorite Quote: I too am marked by now obliterated words I should have said, whose meaning I no longer recognize....more",Notes are private!,6,19,1,"Oct 10, 2023","Oct 11, 2023","Sep 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58470819-the-employees

I picked this up as part of a monthly read selection with one of my GR groups. What I enjoyed was how vastly different the world is to ours. The concept of an intergalactic marketplace where all kinds of humanoid species can gather to exchange ideas and trade was interesting. I appreciated the originality of the heroine being disabled by blindness as well as her sapphic relationship.What I did not enjoy was the limitations of the story length and a dearth of quotable prose. There is no broad introduction as the reader is dropped into the world with lots of new vocabulary being thrown out that has not been explained. Because of this it took a little while for me to get engaged and I initially feared I would not like this story. Around 15% in, things hit the fan and a mystery starts. From that point on I was fully engaged and enjoyed the story, but the ending is very abrupt with no fallout closure, follow-up or epilogue. Kind of like a Scooby-Doo episode, the villain is revealed and that’s the end. I would not hesitate to read more works from this author or from within this world, but would seek out a longer novel next time instead of another novella. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: Azulea could smell grilled meat from Tamir’s stall in the souq abutting the Archive.Favorite Quote: Murder.

While that was definitely a theme, it is mostly a running narrative of a teenager that becomes pregnant and struggles to find herself and independence while simultaneously being in great need of her mother’s assistance.  I feel as though I have fallen in a hole and can’t get back out. People - teachers, friends, doctors - have peered at me from above the hole, but their arms are not long enough to haul me up. They wave and think they are helping but all they are doing is blocking out the light.The book trudges along at a slower pace but the author has a talented writing style. The blurb on the back states this novel can feel tense and claustrophobic which is exactly how it made me feel, and I cannot honestly say I enjoyed that. I never considered DNF’ing and wanted to see how it ended for the family, but it is definitely an emotionally exhausting read. Your Grand Mar and I - we have been like two puzzles that someone dropped on the floor. We didn’t know which bits belonged where. We were too frantic putting ourselves back together again that we just grabbed at pieces of each other. We were hasty, pressing our sharp corners down whether they fitted or not.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Ever since your Grand Par left, your Grand Mar and I share the double bed.Favorite Quote: I don’t go back searching for the Once that started this Upon a Time....more",Notes are private!,2,11,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Aug 23, 2023","Jul 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55882832-one-hundred-days

One of the best books I've read this year.There is an America that some people never see. It’s not just the ignorance, i5 stars = Utterly incredible. One of the best books I've read this year.There is an America that some people never see. It’s not just the ignorance, it’s the hardness. Some people grow up hard, and all that hardness makes them mean. They’re people who, if they see you slip on ice, what’s the first thing they’re going to do? They’re going to laugh. They may eventually help you, or they may not - but first they’re going to laugh.I absolutely loved this book and want to be friends with the author. Do not let the pink chick-lit cover fool you, I think this is a book that would appeal to all rational people that appreciate a satirical examination of the modern dating world and America’s current division and traitor problem. I laughed and laughed, because what else can we do and not go crazy? I will never be able to truly know another person. The most intimate relationship of my life would be my relationship with me - which was wildly unappealing. This is why people believe in gods, so we can have intimate relationships with them instead of ourselves.It is character driven instead of plot, and the group of main characters are well fleshed out and show growth throughout the novel that spans a couple of years. It is sprinkled with interesting reflections on humanity and our current state of affairs, while keeping a tone of cynical hilarity as the heroine tries to figure out life and how to survive. Highly recommended to everyone, though sadly the people that would benefit the most will refuse to read it, as is usually the case with them. I will miss reading about these characters and look forward to checking out what the author does next.How can our corporeal cages betray us like that? How is it that Time is allowed to write, without our permission, on our faces and bodies like that, in all caps, for everyone to see?-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Two months after the war began, I found myself single - abandoned. Favorite Quote: Racism is the problem that gives birth to every other problem: capitalism, war, environmental destruction, you name it. Every time you decide that it’s all right to treat one group of people more terribly than you treat another group of people, that’s racism - and once we have decided to live with it, we can justify going to war, or doing capitalism, or tolerating climate change....more",Notes are private!,2,10,1,"Jul 23, 2023","Aug 02, 2023","Jul 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60784674-hestia-strikes-a-match

They all let me down in the end.It is usually difficult for me to select my next book to read, perhaps because I am a digital book hoarder which can lead to analysis paralysis. I tend to be a mood reader, but even with an idea of what genre I am looking for, in this instance a mystery or thriller, there are still so many choices that it’s difficult to settle on one. Recently, I started narrowing it down to around 5 books that fit the mood I am looking for, and then I read the first page of each. Typically one of them will be difficult to put down, as was the case with this one. How do you read these first two paragraphs and not want to continue?? 	‘Put me out with the bins,’ he said, regularly. ‘When I die, put me out with the bins. I’ll be dead, so I won’t know any different. You’ll be crying your eyes out,’ and he would laugh and I’d laugh too because we both knew that I wouldn’t be crying my eyes out. I never cry.When the time came, on Wednesday 29th November 2017, I followed his instructions. He was small and frail and eighty-two years old by then, so it was easy to get him into one large garden waste bag.So with my selection made, I settled in and thought this one is going to be funny in a dark and dry sense of humor kind of way. And it is quite funny at times, but it also gets extremely dark rather quickly, and in my case unexpectedly, and then proceeds to run you through the whole gamut of emotions. It is a compelling, steady paced, grim psychological drama. It’s twisted, fascinating, and disturbing all at the same time. Much like a train wreck, it was hard to look away and hard to put it down. The writing itself was disappointingly light on quotable prose, but when the words are all put together, a captivating story emerges.No animals were harmed and no one seemed to have an eating disorder, but it is safe to consider all other content warnings applicable. This book is an excellent reminder that some seemingly normal, polite people are actually monsters. Those that have been hurt, will often go on to hurt others.I love books written from the perspective of someone that is neurodivergent, foreign, from a different time, or in general just has a different take on life. The heroine here is “socially deficient”, and some ers find her to be unlikeable. I disagree with that sentiment, but can understand how she is a polarizing figure. I really empathized with Sally and wanted to see her thrive. ‘It’s not good to be racist, Caroline,’ I said.‘You don’t understand a lot of things, Sally, and this is one of them.’‘I understand racism.’‘Stop calling me a racist.’‘Stop being one.’The themes incorporated are diverse and varied, including the effects of isolation, the requirement of love for humans to flourish, nature vs nurture, control and manipulation. If you are looking for your next psychological thriller to read and do not mind darkness in your stories, this is one I can easily recommend.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: ‘Put me out with the bins,’ he said, regularly. Favorite Quote:I hung up shortly after we had done the goodbye thing that annoys me: 'Goodbye,' 'Bye,' 'Goodbye,' 'See you later,' 'Yes, goodbye,' 'Bye, then.'

This is a delightful combination that I had never enjoyed the pleasure of reading about before.

She was ready, maybe even eager, to cut someone.Thank you to Sara and her lovely , which brought this novel and author to my attention. I deeply appreciated the positive messages it portrays, from setting boundaries with toxic family members to fully embracing your sexuality, and the importance of loving and accepting yourself for who you are. It was a very satisfying summer read with the right balance of heavier topics included, without ever coming across as preachy.

A lot of them said they wish that they’d taken more risks.

The 1980s were a decade of neglect, and I haven’t felt freedom or terror like it since.I probably would have enjoyed this memoir more if I had not recently finished the powerful one by Viola Davis. This one paled in comparison, but the author’s special relationship with her badass grandmother made it worth finishing and was the only source of humor I found in a book everyone else calls hilarious. Otherwise, there wasn’t much to make it stand out from dozens of other memoirs where the authors shared similar circumstances when they were young. Not a bad read, just one that I feel like I have already read several times with no unique distinctions.

I have, however, heard her curse so intensely I swear she was making some of them up on the spot, watched her obsess over horror movies with an academic intensity, and listened to her frequent lectures about the reasons every woman should not only carry a knife at all times but also fully be prepared to use it: “A man wants to put his hands on you?

Not only did I walk away feeling like I had read a complete story, but I was impressed with how many provocative discussion points Maugham fit into so few pages. It is rich in ambiance and symbolism and remains relevant today, over a century after it was written. Most of all, I appreciated how he contrasted stereotypical self-righteous and hypocritical Christian behaviors against reason and logic. In addition, his critique of colonialism shows how both Christianity and colonialism are forces used to exploit and oppress others. Rain makes for an excellent reminder of how vitally crucial it is to resist these dangerous forces to prevent the destruction of traditional cultures and people’s lives.The ending in particular was deliciously satisfying and reminiscent of a theme from The Painted Veil, “The dog it was that died.” This story would be an excellent cautionary tale selection for an open-minded book club. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: It was nearly bed-time and when they awoke next morning land would be in sight.Favorite Quote: After many years of married life he learned that it was more conducive to peace to leave his wife with the last word....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 17, 2023","Jul 19, 2023","Jul 05, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18794066-rain

Given how easily accessible facts are, I have really struggled for the last few years to understand how there can be so many gullible Americans falling prey to the daily overt lies and shenanigans told by the current fascist Republican party. I turned to this book hoping for an explanation from the author, who is a self described professor of experimental social psychology that studies bullshit and bullshitting for a living. Did it help? Kind of.What I found to be the most helpful was his techniques on how to push back when faced with someone regurgitating ridiculous delusions that they believe to be true, or do not even care about the validity because they want it to be true. He also explains the personality types that are most likely to be bullshitters, and the types of people most likely to fall for bullshit. Some tips are discussed about how to detect bullshit and ways to strengthen your critical thinking skills, which is the best antidote to bullshit. I also enjoyed how the author touched on how the rampant bullshit in America affects our culture and even our national security, such as the increased deaths and disabling we incurred due to so many believing the Russian and Republican lies to downplay Covid-19. But on the other hand, the book is a little dry despite its edgy subject matter, more shallow of a discussion than I was expecting, and somewhat repetitive.Do I now understand how tens of millions of my fellow countrymen are blind to the incessant, glaringly obvious, contradicting lies spewed by their preferred political party on a daily basis and their idolatry of a demented traitor in makeup, high heels, and a stinky diaper, the most documented liar that has ever lived, whom they laughably view as their alpha macho man savior? No, I do not and I doubt I ever will. Perhaps I need to find some solid nonfiction on cults and the misguided folks that are drawn to them instead.The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what’s true.

I’ve heard some of my friends say, “We were poor, too, but I just didn’t know it until I got older.” We were poor and we knew it.Before reading this book, the only thing I knew about Viola Davis was that she was a highly talented actress whose work I enjoyed. That’s it. Now I see her as the person she is, who happens to work as an actress. She lays her history bare, revealing the horrors she endured to become who she is today.I knew my life would be a fight, and I realized this: I had it in me.Intermixed with her biographical and career details, are segments that are thought-provoking, and read as though you are enjoying some real talk with a girlfriend over wine. Her words about her father’s funeral for instance, brought tears to my eyes as it so closely matched my own experience at my grandfather’s funeral. My dad, who only had a fifth-grade education, didn’t make it into history books except mine, had a turned-out homegoing. Everyone came to his funeral. We had a police escort to the grave site with I don’t know how many police cars and officers in full regalia, usually designated for dignitaries. That’s how much my dad meant to them. We had lived in the city since 1965. At funerals, no matter how much you think you know someone, you see a whole part of their life at the end. People sharing memories, stories that you never heard. I’m sure there were memories that would’ve surprised him because how many people make themselves vulnerable enough to share how you touched them? That’s something that you cannot always see when they’re alive.While I could not relate to every theme she writes about, such as wanting to break into acting, desiring children, and the importance of her religion, she had my full attention from the opening paragraph and did not let go. Reading about a little scared girl running for her life, that metamorphosed into an incredibly strong and beautiful woman that loves and accepts herself while creating the life she deserves, brought me great joy and inspiration. I listened to this memoir on audiobook which is narrated by the author herself. This format is highly recommended, as is the book itself.The purpose of life is to live it.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: “Cocksucker motherfucker” was my favorite expression and at eight years old, I used it defiantly.Favorite Quote: For a whole generation of Black people we were the dream.

But occasionally, you can be remarkably bright creatures.From the very first page, the reader is introduced to Marcellus the octopus, and you know instantly you will love this dude. You also know right away that he will likely die before the book ends which almost made me pass on reading this altogether. I do not mind sad books so long as the sadness does not involve the death of a beloved animal character. It is often too heartbreaking to be enjoyable and I typically will pass on reading such books. I am thrilled I made an exception for this one, and was impressed with how the author deftly handles everything at the end in such a way that you are not gutted, and may even smile. If you have similar preferences, I encourage you to make an exception as well because clever Marcellus is worth it. Nothing was something. What might lie on the other side of life?This book is told through the perspective of three different narrators - Marcellus, the endearing curmudgeon of a Giant Pacific Octopus, Tova, the elderly widow with an impressively fierce spirit, and Cameron, a man child at 30 yo that can’t seem to get it together. Discovering how they were all linked together was beautifully done and all three perspectives were interesting, though of course Marcellus stole the show. It is a story about how digging into your past can lead to the discovery of new possibilities, the importance of close friendships, and explores coping with loss, grief and disappointment. On top of this, Marcellus provides an insightful outsider’s perspective on human nature with interesting ruminations sprinkled throughout. There is a light mystery that is fairly easy to piece together early on, but is enjoyable to watch unfold regardless. How delicate those wounds were back then, how little it took to nudge the scabs out of place and start the bleeding anew.There are several endearing and memorable characters, including the Pacific Northwest, which the author brings to life with her atmospheric, vivid descriptions. I fell in love with Marcellus, but the inevitable heartache surprisingly came from nostalgia and missing my favorite corner of the world. There is no more mesmerizing place on Earth than the PNW in the summertime. Ah, to be a human, for whom bliss can be achieved by mere ignorance! Here, in the kingdom of animals, ignorance is dangerous.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Darkness suits me. Favorite Quote: It seems to be a hallmark of the human species: abysmal communication skills. Not that any other species are much better, mind you, but even a herring can tell which way the school it belongs to is turning and follow accordingly.

This is the first storyglot book Susana Morais has published for total beginners (A0), which was a nice confidence boost for me compared to another book of hers I had first tried that was for advanced beginners (A2). However, you can easily grow with this book and depending on how you use it, even intermediate B1-B2 students could find it useful. Considering that this is written at an elementary vocab level, I was extremely impressed with how she managed to create such an interesting story. I would do an extra chapter just to find out what was going to happen next. There was humor, plot twists, a mystery and lots of adventure.I also really enjoy the format as it teaches you in various ways. The beginning of the book has the story in Portuguese with the English translation right below. She gives you a website where you can play the audio of her narration performance, and each chapter includes mini lessons to explain grammar and exercises to practice. At the end of the book is the story just in Portuguese with no translation, as well as the solutions for all of the exercises.She gives you a lot of ideas of how to use the book in the beginning, but what worked well for me as a beginner, was to first just listen to the chapter and see how much I could understand. Verbal understanding is definitely my weakness at this point. Next, I read through it in Portuguese and try to figure out what it means before reading the translation. This brings a lot more understanding as reading comprehension is my strength currently. Then I relisten to it while reading along so I know how to pronounce any words I am uncertain of. Finally, I read the chapter out loud and then do the lesson and exercises. I legit enjoyed the story itself, let alone how much I learned from her lessons. I think that I will reread this one multiple times and in different ways as my learning and fluency level progresses. Highly recommended to people that are studying European Portuguese, as well as her online program, The Portuguese Academy. ...more",Notes are private!,2,20,1,"Jun 21, 2023","Oct 27, 2023","Jun 21, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/124947956-o-tesouro-submerso

Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.You know that bitter family member or coworker that thinks the world revolves around them, who believes they are smarter than everyone while they continuously over analyze the actions of others with heavy judgment, while never turning that analysis internally to do any self-reflection and perpetually considers themselves to be a victim because it is inconceivable that anything could ever be their fault? Well, that is who narrates this novel. Much like the real life versions of the narrator, the fictional version’s company is equally tedious and tiresome to suffer. While visualizing herself as a contemporary feminist and champion of women, the heroine has an intellectual affair with the husband of one of her “friends” and obsessively ruminates over their differences as she scrutinizes the other’s perceived flaws. While I did not find this novel to be a good fit for my personal tastes, I do think I would enjoy a lively book club discussion around it. Hours of a pompous circular narrative were painful to trudge through, and I should have heeded my instinct to DNF less than 10% in. But because it was short and I erroneously was hopeful it would improve, I continued until the very end, which was the only great part of the novel…because it finally provided some dopamine by concluding. I could only recommend this one to book club members, and those that enjoy pretentious, rambling inner monologues of unlikeable characters. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: When I accused Wah of being an insult to women — ‘an insult to womankind’ was my unfortunate phrase — we were sitting with our husbands at a fashionable rooftop restaurant in downtown Los Angeles.Favorite Quote: What is falling out of love but a sort of crisis of perception?...more",Notes are private!,2,18,1,"Sep 25, 2023","Sep 26, 2023","May 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60304345-my-nemesis

It did send me down numerous rabbit holes and I walked away having learned numerous new things, which is always a plus. Written before the blatant current regression in civil rights and humanity in the USA started, the author hit the nail on the head of one catalyst following the included Marx quote, “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” The author expanded that  “People tend to resort to religion in countries where they feel insecure in their lives, unsupported by health care and other social welfare provisions; more at risk in this world, so more tempted to place their forlorn hopes in a mythical next world.” This rings true to me and helps to explain why the USA is by far the most religious of developed countries. We also are the most insecure and unsupported society amongst these nations. Dawkins feels that while he is committed to persuading people on intellectual grounds that God is not real,  “a better route to killing religion is to abolish poverty and especially inequality.” The church industry that currently rakes in around 75 billion dollars a year in the USA alone, need not worry about that solution happening for quite some time, regretably.While not a perfect read, this book did provoke self-reflection and philosophical thinking, and any book that is effective at this, will always be a book I am glad to have read.Why should a divine being, with creation and eternity on his mind, care a fig for petty human malefactions?

The audiobook is read by the author and is recommended as it adds a level of authenticity and rawness. The only place I have ever heard of Jennette McCurdy is here on Goodreads. I have never seen any of her acting work or heard any of her music. What I did see and hear often, is how fantastic this memoir is, which is how I ended up reading it. Unlike the synopsis and some s, I did not find anything about it to be funny. It was mostly sadness, heartbreak and outrage with some hope towards the end, but definitely no laughter. Nothing wrong with sad books, but just a warning as the blurb that claims it is hilarious gives false expectations.Millions of people dream of being famous, and here I am famous and hating it. I somehow feel entitled to my hatred since I was not the one who dreamed of being famous. Mom was. Mom pushed this on me. I’m allowed to hate someone else’s dream, even if it’s my reality.Also having a toxic narcissist for a mother myself is what intrigued me to read this one, but it turned out that was the only interest I have to relate to in the book. This resulted in the majority of the book being about topics that hold no appeal for me personally. I am very sorry for what Jennette endured and I am glad she is now in control of her life and focusing on her happiness and health. If you have an interest in toxic relationships, as well as acting and eating disorders, then this memoir is highly recommended. I’ve pretended to be other people my whole life, my whole childhood and adolescence and young adulthood. The years that you’re supposed to spend finding yourself, I was spending pretending to be other people. The years that you’re supposed to spend building character, I was spending building characters.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: It’s strange how we always give big news to loved ones in a coma, as if a coma is just a thing that happens from a lack of something to be excited about in your life.

Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.But war’s war, Sassenach. Honor only makes it a bit easier to live wi’ yourself, afterward.I have read over 9,000 pages in Gabaldon’s Outlander series. In previous books I have found her to be a phenomenal storyteller that brings historical fiction to life with vivid characters. This amount of reading time spent with the same characters has led to my loving and caring for them. And that is the only reason I suffered through this hot mess of disappointment. If I had not come into this book already being invested in the characters, there is no possible way I would have finished the book. For the first 700-ish pages, nothing of interest or significance happens. It’s page after page of hanging out around the homestead, learning in graphic detail how bodies decompose along with every single other random tidbit Gabaldon has ever researched being forced into the story. But after slogging through a measly 700 superfluous pages, things actually started to happen and the story finally became interesting. The ending was heartfelt and strong, and absorbing enough to rope me in for the next installment, though my expectations will be very low going into the rumored finale. I suspect that with the huge success of the series (both print and TV), that Gabaldon is being given free reign as though she can do no wrong, with very little editing, if any, being applied to her bloated project of self-indulgence. This is the 9th full length novel and by far the weakest. This book falls massively short of the quality from most of the earlier books.Know going into this one, that you will be waiting until the back 20% of the book for the story to begin, and that all throughout you must suffer boredom from random tidbits which are crammed into the story for no apparent reason other than to show off the author's research abilities. Children seem to multiply every few chapters to the point that I felt I was reading a book about a dozen kids, which is not a book I would ever select knowingly. Gabaldon normally excels with realistic dialogue but the kids' blabbering was annoying and endless. I have no idea, but I would suspect she has recently become a grandparent or something because the intensive focus on babies, children, and the joys of having as large of a family as possible was constant and cheesy enough to belong to Hallmark. As another disillusionment bonus, she jumped the shark with this one. I can buy time travel through standing stones, but I am not able to suspend disbelief enough for all the hokey magic miracles that suddenly appear, or multiple characters developing telepathic abilities out of nowhere. In addition to being historical fiction, sci-fi, and romance, I suppose this is a fantasy series as well now. I also did not appreciate Roger’s character, the once interesting historian turned now dull minister, being hollowed out into a bland caricature, destroying his appeal to the point that no one would notice if he never appeared in a book again. I can only recommend this one to hardcore Outlander fans, and fellow masochists. If you want to continue the series without suffering heavy disappointment, just start reading at page 700 or so. Nothing of great significance would be lost.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: There was a stone under my right buttock, but I didn’t want to move.Favorite Quote: “So you don’t think the sins of the fathers should be visited upon the children?” Grey sighed, pressing his shoulders against the chair to ease the stiffness in his back. “If they were, I should think humanity would have ceased to exist by now, pressed back into the earth by the accumulated weight of inherited evil.”...more",Notes are private!,5,32,1,"Jul 19, 2023","Oct 30, 2023","Nov 23, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57699848-go-tell-the-bees-that-i-am-gone

Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.I loved and thoroughly enjoyed Ready Player One, making this one of my most eagerly anticipated releases of 2020. Much like everything else this year, it ended up being a disappointment. The bones are the same as RPO - lots of 80’s trivia and nerdy gaming lingo propels an action-driven plot towards saving the day. I really don’t understand why this one does not hold the same charm as the first, but it simply doesn’t. I tell other readers that they do not need to be a gamer to appreciate RPO, but I cannot say the same for RPT. I can’t imagine anyone getting into this story if they have not had a gaming period at some point in their life. I still love Ernest Cline and look forward to reading his future works, but this one was a disappointment for me that I would not recommend to others. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: After I won Halliday’s contest, I remained offline for nine straight days - a new personal record. Favorite Quote: Life is like an extremely difficult, horribly unbalanced videogame. When you’re born, you’re given a randomly generated character, with a randomly determined name, race, face, and social class. Your body is your avatar, and you spawn in a random geographic location, at a random moment in human history, surrounded by a random group of people, and then you have to try to survive for as long as you can.Sometimes the game might seem easy. Even fun. Other times it might be so difficult you want to give up and quit. But unfortunately, in this game you only get one life. When your body grows too hungry or thirsty or ill or injured or old, your health meter runs out and then it’s Game Over....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Nov 29, 2020","Dec 29, 2020","Nov 24, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54447930-ready-player-two

She brings up interesting topics around race in America that are thought provoking. A little before half way through the book, Barack makes an appearance and the stories about their dating were charming. These were the highlights for me.I was ambitious, though I didn’t know exactly what I was shooting for. Now I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child - What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.In contrast, the second half of the book was mostly a trudge. Covering the political campaign trail was exhausting to even read about, let alone having to live it. It is also very heavy on parenting, motherhood and numerous topics about children - none of which are of interest to me. Not that it was ever a consideration, but her honest portrayal of life in politics convinced me to never go down that career path.It did end on a positive note, highlighting Michelle’s many achievements from her time as FLOTUS and briefly touching on some of the most significant moments of Barack's presidency. I also enjoyed her calling out Cheeto’s bullying and how he rallied the “wingnuts and kooks” in the country. While I was not blown away by this memoir like most of my GR friends, it was a good read, and well worthy of my time. I've learned that it's harder to hate up close.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: When I was a kid, my aspirations were simple.Favorite Quote: Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result.

A gruesome pandemic assaulted the globeIronically hobbling our head germaphobe.For when tragedy strikes of this harrowing scope,It tends to expose a duplicitous dope.

Lots of depressing information is laid out as Sir Attenborough drops truth in this book, truth that the entire world desperately needs to listen to and begin to understand. It’s not all doom and gloom as he also lays out very achievable ways we can start to reverse course if we act now. Please read and then educate the people around you. Tick tock. Humankind now uses up the equivalent of 1.7 times what the Earth can regenerate in a single year.Give and take, that is the essence of what balance is all about. When humankind as a whole is in a position to give back to nature at least as much as we take, and repay some of our debt, we will all be able to lead more balanced lives.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Pripyat in the Ukraine is a place unlike anywhere else I have ever been. Favorite Quotes: Among all of these social improvements, one in particular is found to significantly reduce family size - the empowerment of women. Wherever women have the vote, wherever girls stay in school for longer, wherever women are in charge of their own lives and not dictated to by men, wherever they have access to good healthcare and contraception, wherever they are free to take any job and their aspirations for life are raised, the birth rate falls. The reason for this is straightforward - empowerment brings freedom of choice and when life offers more options for women, their choice is often to have fewer children. ‘There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla,’ I said quietly, ‘than with any other animal I know. Their sight, their hearing, their sense of smell are so similar to ours that they see the world in much the same way as we do. We live in the same sort of social groups with largely permanent family relationships. They walk around on the ground as we do, though they are immensely more powerful than we are. So if there were ever a possibility of escaping the human condition and living imaginatively in another creature’s world, it must be with the gorilla. The male is an enormously powerful creature but he only uses his strength when he is protecting his family and it is very rare that there is violence within the group. So it seems really very unfair that Man should have chosen the gorilla to symbolise everything that is aggressive and violent, when that is the one thing that the gorilla is not - and that we are.’...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Oct 06, 2020","Oct 27, 2020","Oct 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53916142-a-life-on-our-planet

Of course, that pesky dollar often gets in the way of doing what is right…This is the first book I have read that actually did have this type of world and the author did a great job of explaining how it would work logically, and based off of current scientific data. I enjoyed spending an hour in this story and watching the heroine work through her own priorities and desires. Even though she chose the opposite path that I would have, it was still interesting and enjoyable to follow along. It’s short length held it back, as it feels mildly rushed and obviously cannot reach the depths of a fully fleshed out story that a novel or even novella would offer. I’d love to hear about other books if you know of any, that are based in similar worlds where most people choose to not have children due to overpopulation and government incentives.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: A few of us from Global Care were lunching out to celebrate our Spring Dividend.Favorite Quote: “You’d become pregnant.” “Got it.” (Dry-mouthed.) “This would likely lead to a cascade of physical, emotional, and mental changes over the next approximately forty weeks. Normal symptoms of pregnancy include fatigue, breast tenderness, nausea, excess saliva, increased urination, bloating, mood swings, cramping, hunger, constipation, food aversions and cravings, indigestion, heartburn, flatulence, lines on skin—” The list was filling me with rising panic. “—nasal congestion, extreme weight gain, swelling of hands and feet, vaginal discharge, faintness, energy fluctuations, varicose veins, cysts, urinary blockage, alterations in sex drive, back pain, shortness of breath, and trouble sleeping.” “Jesus!” How had any woman ever gone through this?

She answered: “Shrinkage of gray matter associated with social activities such as conversation.

The book is written in an informal manner that keep4 stars = Fantastic and easy to recommend.I learned quite a bit about these fascinating creatures. The book is written in an informal manner that keeps the reader engaged, conveying facts intimately like shared secrets. This is so much more enjoyable than the style of a dry textbook, though without the same depth of information. 5 favorite facts that I learned:1. Octopuses is actually the correct plural, not octopi as is commonly misused. Octopus is Greek while an ending with an “i” for plurality is Latin.2. “The giant Pacific octopus is one of the fastest-growing animals on the planet. Hatching from an egg the size of a grain of rice, one can grow both longer and heavier than a man in three years.”3. “Octopuses have a dominant eye, as people have dominant hands.”4. “An octopus is put together completely differently, with three hearts, a brain that wraps around its throat, and a covering of slime instead of hair. Even their blood is a different color from ours; it’s blue, because copper, not iron, carries its oxygen.”5. “Three fifths of octopuses’ neurons are not in the brain but in the arms. If an arm is severed from an octopus’s body, the arm will often carry on as if nothing has happened for several hours. One presumes the severed arm might continue hunting and perhaps even catching prey - only to pass it back toward a mouth to which the arm is, sadly, no longer attached.”Bonus fact that I learned which is not even about octopus, is that chimpanzees are so closely related to humans that we can share blood transfusions.This is an easy book to recommend to my fellow animal lovers. I now want to learn more about them and will seek out a book that is less memoir and more substance, though I am thankful for the author's introduction to these animals. I feel it is important for humans to learn more about animals as it will hopefully inspire us to change behaviors that are destructive. As she said in this article, ""Our giant Pacific octopuses show us that when we damage our seas, we not only poison a resource: We kill thinking, feeling creatures whose minds might be startlingly like our own.""-------------------------------------------First Sentence: On a rare, warm day in mid-March, when the snow was melting into mud in New Hampshire, I traveled to Boston, where everyone was strolling along the harbor or sitting on benches licking ice cream cones. Favorite Quote: American naturalist Henry Beston writes that animals “are not brethren, they are not underlings” but beings “gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 18, 2020","Sep 26, 2020","Sep 18, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30844156-the-soul-of-an-octopus

I loved it. “The truth is….nature always protects itself by whatever means possible.”This one opens with a bit of predictable drama, but it doesn’t take long for the heroine to arrive in Norway. From that point until the last page, the story grips you as shenanigans ensue.

The author enriches the story by infusing several Nordic folklore fables. I will remember the vivid characters, especially the “sad lady” for quite some time. If you like scary (but not gory), taunt thrillers, be sure to look out for this one in a couple of weeks. It would be an excellent choice to read for Halloween. Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the advance reader copy in exchange for an honest . This was the first book I had read by C.J.

I l3 stars = Good and worthwhile but something held it back from being great.I am assuming that anyone reading this  has already read Twilight. I liked Twilight despite its flaws. To me, it is simply a wonderful variation on the classic story of good versus evil, with very memorable characters. The writing in this one is better than that of Twilight, but if you had issues with the plot or character behaviors before, those have not changed. It is still the same story, but from a different perspective.This time the story is told from Edward’s POV. As a result, there is very little of Jacob present which made the story suffer in my opinion. Jacob was so light, carefree and funny - his absence left a void in this book that no other character could quite fill. You do learn more about the Cullen family, but not enough new information to make reading the book worthwhile for that sole purpose. Edward’s mind, is incredibly verbose. He tells a slightly shorter story (no Jacob side plots) with 270 MORE pages of words. It’s simply too long. The romance also suffers with him being the narrator and feels like insta-love instead of the conflicted slower burn Bella experienced. I loved the sweet tenderness from Bella’s perspective which does not come off quite the same here. The literary crush I had on Edward in Twilight, also does not convey when you are in his head, instead of hers looking at him. All that being said, I think this would have been a 4 star read had I read it first, and did not already know what was going to happen. My three favorite scenes from Twilight are still my favorites here (Port Angeles dinner, confrontation with the hunter and hospital aftermath, and prom), but none of them are as touching as they were in Bella’s head. Even with the improvement in writing and new insights into the Cullens, to me, Twilight is easily the more enjoyable read of the two. For fans that want more of Meyer’s world, however, this is in no way a waste of your time. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: This was the time of day when I most wished I were able to sleep.

A few parts were funny, but I highly suspect that had I instead watched her perform the same material or listened to her read it on audiobook that it would have been hilarious. No matter which format you choose, in addition to making you smile, she offers great nuggets of wisdom. Bitterness and resentment is unhealthy and can slow down or stop your progress. Stop looking where your peers are and concentrate on your own career. Back when ‘Time Out’ magazine listed loads of comedy gigs, I’d buy a copy whenever I was in London and trawl through it.

Same info, different outlook. Be positive.

I’d even go so far to say that you end up feeling sorry for him. Toxic families have long lasting effects on individuals, and money clearly does not improve the outcome. Trump is simply a product of the environment he has lived in his whole life.Not that they will, but Trump’s fervent fan base would benefit from reading this, as well as those of us that cannot wrap our mind around decisions that have been made.He has denied the unconscionable failures that have already killed thousands, lied about the progress that’s being made, and scapegoated the very people who are risking their lives to save us despite being denied adequate protection and equipment by his administration…..Lying, playing to the lowest common denominator, cheating, and sowing division are all he knows.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: I’d always liked my name.

A European power made a present of an Arab territory to a Jewish lobby. And did not consult a single inhabitant of the territory concerned. To be completely fair, this is not my go-to type of novel. A friend of mine wanted to do a buddy read as this is one of her favorite novels.Entertainment wise for me it was a 2.5 (about average), which is great considering I typically would not even like a book about political espionage. The author does an amazing job of explaining both sides with the Israel / Palestine conflict. You truly appreciate where everyone is coming from and why there is conflict, and for that, I have to bump up the rating. I absolutely love a book that teaches in addition to entertaining. If you enjoy this genre, this one is easy to recommend. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: It was the Bad Godesberg incident that gave the proof, though the German authorities had no earthly means of knowing this.

I loved it.“When a wave comes, it washes over you and runs up the beach. Then, the wave turns around, and recedes over you, going back to the ocean….This is like the breath, which exhales, transitions, inhales, transitions, and then starts the process again.”My work in cardiopulmonary rehab involves teaching patients that have a respiratory disease such as asthma or COPD. I figured that if I learned more about breathing, I could pass on the information to them. With expectations for it to be dry and boring, I picked it up but was fascinated from the very first chapter. I love how the author brings up intriguing questions that had not previously occurred to you, such as why humans are the only mammal out of 5,400 different species to regularly have overbites, underbites and snaggled teeth. The author spent a decade traveling all around the world learning about various modern and historical teachings about breathing. In addition to thoroughly researching the topic, he participates in several scientific studies as well. Everything that was revealed was interesting and encourages you to research further on your own.I also appreciated how the author would include fascinating tidbits about the human body that I, a healthcare professional, did not realize. For example:“In a single breath, more molecules of air will pass through your nose than all the grains of sand on all the world’s beaches - trillions and trillions of them. These little bits of air come from a few feet or several yards away. As they make their way toward you, they’ll twist and spool like the stars in a van Gogh sky, and they’ll keep twisting and spooling and scrolling as they pass into you, traveling at a clip of about five miles per hour.”The main moral of the story is, mouth breathers look stupid for a reason. If possible, only breathe through your nose. If you enjoy learning about the human body, inner balance, or longevity, this is an easy book to recommend. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: The place looked like something out of Amityville: all paint-chipped walls, dusty windows, and menacing shadows cast by moonlight.

At the speed of light, time freezes. Completely...When we gather light originating from the furthest reaches of our visible universe, we get pictures of the universe as it was back then. For every one pound of ordinary matter made out of neutrons and protons and electrons, there are five pounds of dark matter, made out of who-knows-what.Most of the chapters were interesting, but there were also a few that were not. I personally have a strong preference for macro concepts vs micro. The book starts and ends with a bang (pun intended), while the middle felt like a dull high school lecture.If mankind could, one way or another, harvest all the energy the Sun radiates in one second, it would be enough to sustain the entire world’s energy needs for about half a billion years.For some stars, when they die, can leave behind diamonds the size of a moon.I learned much from this book and would recommend it to anyone that is interested in the subject and appreciates technical concepts explained in an approachable way.The Milky Way is big. The Sun (and therefore the Earth), being a bit deeper inside, travels around the Milky Way in slightly less than 225 million years, a period called a galactic year. The last time the Earth was at the galactic position it has today, the dinosaurs still had 160 million years to live. Using such terminology, the Big Bang occurred about sixty-one galactic years ago, and if we start from today, after twenty more rounds the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy will be so close to each other that they will start to collide. Incidentally, the sun will explode a few galactic months later. Put like that, it doesn’t sound that far off.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Picture yourself on a faraway volcanic island on a warm, cloudless summer night.

Jeri is gender fluid (male vs female depending on if it was day or night, at sea or on land). That’s cool, diversity is great. But Jeri explained this a dozen times to anyone and everyone immediately upon meeting them. The reader is continuously pulled out of the story to be beat over the head with this as it is repeatedly forced into the dialogue in the most awkward of ways. There were also several situations in which the characters are backed into a corner and a miracle happens just in the nick of time to turn things around, very convenient. This was done again and again and again.This series is the first I have read by the author and I was very impressed by the first two. But this conclusion comes across as cheap, generic, tropey YA fodder. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: I have found that building a sandbox around a domineering child, then allowing that child to preside over it, frees the adults to do the real work.

How fitting.Hilary Mantel is able to make several characters come to life and jump off the page, especially Cromwell. I also love her witty humor and beautiful prose.

This conclusion to her trilogy falls somewhere in the middle. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: Once the queen’s head is severed, he walks away.

Matthew Thatcher had committed the slow murder of hope or, indistinguishably, watched in helpless torments as it committed suicide. But at last it was done. Hope lay at his feet, unmoving.All throughout the novel, the author has a strikingly lovely way with words. It was thought-provoking to see the division of Christianity (Catholic vs Protestant) in the 16th century through the eyes of a Muslim, Mahmoud Ezzedine. Dr. Ezzedine’s philosophical character was the strongest part of the novel. Christian kingdoms hate one another and are divided on how best to show their love for Jesus Christ. How mad, you think, to hate over how best to love.Unfortunately, the other characters were not nearly as memorable. Especially King James, who despite all the time spent in his company, even his character lacked vitality and memorability. As a lover of historical fiction about real figures, this was a rather significant negative. This was the first book I have read by Arthur Phillips, and I would read another by him without hesitation. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quotes: The day comes when, like a river changing direction, every day we try to lose as little as possible.It was no more than an older man’s pity at a young man not yet aware of how irrelevant so many things are.

I really loved it.Some share their stories carefully, selectively, finding a faithful ear and then chanting their words like p4.5 stars - Incredible. I really loved it.Some share their stories carefully, selectively, finding a faithful ear and then chanting their words like prayers. Other migrants are like blown-open grenades, telling their anguish compulsively to everyone they meet, dispensing their pain like shrapnel so they might one day wake to find their burdens have grown lighter. Luca wonders what it would feel like to blow up like that. But for now, he remains undetonated, his horrors sealed tightly inside, his pin fixed snugly in place.Politics and controversy aside, let me tell you about this amazing book I just read. It is one of those rare gems that you think of all day, looking forward to when you have time to return to its pages. At the bones of this novel is a universal classic tale that can cross any genre and appeal to any reader: In a world where survival is extremely difficult, you would do anything to save your loved one. Along the treacherous journey, you must take the measure quickly of people you meet to predict if they are friend or foe. Will they survive? You’ll want to read it for yourself to see.It also explores the ripple effects life choices/karma have on those closest to you. It’s in parts a tragic love story encased within timely talking points that will inspire important conversations, a perfect choice for a book club. I understand that many people feel the author was out of place in writing about an experience she had not lived herself. She expresses her own doubts in the author’s note at the end, which she ends with the thought, If you’re a person who has the capacity to be a bridge, why not be a bridge? But if we limit authors to only those experiences they have personally held, while we would theoretically gain authenticity, we would lose entire genres because most authors have never been to space, battled a fantastical creature, or lived during a past historical period. It is not uncommon for skilled authors to effectively write about a time, place or event that they have not personally experienced. It would be a travesty to cage authors into the unimaginative realm of their personal reality.This novel had me, someone far removed from the character’s situation, not only thinking more deeply about the plight of migrants daily but also considering immigration from a drastically different light than what is presented in the news and general media. This is the magic that powerful books are capable of - they are catalysts for change.The truth about American Dirt, the controversial recent selection for Oprah’s book club, is that it is a worthwhile, engaging and thought-provoking novel that is easily recommended to other readers. Is diversity important in literary publishing? Of course. Should there specifically be more Latino authors getting published? Yes, please! Is our country in need of immigration reform? Certainly. Does any of this take away from the excellence of this novel? No, it does not. As an esteemed scholar, Norma Prieto, told the author, “We need as many voices as we can get, telling this story.” -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: The worst will either happen or not happen, and there’s no worry that will make a difference in either direction.

A thriller you won’t be able to put down!The blurb above...all lies. This is a slow-moving suspense novel with very few twists that will leave you bored with a sluggish pulse. The main character is also an over the top baby worshiper, frequently making vomit-inducing statements that are insulting and demeaning to women with the implication that we are only as worthy as our wombs. My empty womb has made me feel like I’m not a real woman, not worthy of my husband’s love.Our existence together is a shallow one. If not for children, what is there? Sex? Companionship? Is anything more important than bringing life into the world? I reach up absently to lay a hand on my womb. Forever empty.I trudged through hoping it would end with the thrilling twisty plot that was promised. Instead, it ended in a ludicrous, nonsensical manner that was utterly disappointing. Continuing to read it until the end was my mistake and I wish I could trade those wasted hours in on a better book. I would be extremely reluctant to read another work by this author.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: No one tries hard to keep their husband unless they’ve already lost him.

Other readers that enjoy this theme should consider this a must read. Personally, I would have preferred the historical aspects to be the focus of the story rather than the frequent rehashing of small minded imbeciles.*********After reading and enjoying The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek, I came across the controversial plagiarism claims set against The Giver of Stars. Like any avid reader with a curious mind, I had to decide for myself by reading the two novels back to back. The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek teaches you much about the Blue People of KY while exploring themes about survival and racism. The author is from the Appalachian region, which lends an authenticity to the dialect and customs of the area.The Giver of Stars teaches you much about the KY pack librarians while exploring themes about unmet expectations and female friendship. The author being from the UK (as is the heroine), provided an interesting comparison in cultures, particularly regarding funeral customs.After reading both novels back to back, I suspect Jojo Moyes may have borrowed a few plot points from Richardson’s manuscript, but the end result is still two completely different novels. I enjoyed both and learned different things from each, never once feeling like there was enough overlap to take away from either reading experience. They are both worth your time.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: A marriage in the fall would bring a union of rebirth that’d bud slow, grow steady and strong from the dying season, while a marriage made in the hot summer would be short-lived and quick to whither.

She refueled during the day by grabbing moments of solitude and sometimes felt her life was a long-distance swim between islands of silence. She enjoyed people—she really did—she just needed to take them in homeopathic doses; a little of the poison was the cure.The story itself was ok, but I loved the relatable heroine, Nina. Her introverted ways, confidence and love of reading spoke to my soul. I enjoyed the author’s prose, with passages that will appeal to any reader. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Her favorite sound was no sound at all.

In many ways, she is the queen’s opposite, impulsive, rebellious, and devilishly witty. I chose this novel to indirectly learn more about her. The main focus of the story, however, is on the heroine, Vera Strathmore, who ends up befriending and working for the princess. Vera is also interesting, primarily due to her writing racy novels under a nom de plume. Unfortunately, she is not nearly as fascinating as the princess, who took a backseat in the novel. Margaret’s life is most intriguing to me, after her divorce. This book focuses on her earlier life as an older teen through her mid 20’s. Still interesting, but not captivating. -------------------------------------------First Sentence: The Honorable Vera Strathmore touched her naked ring finger, tracing a circle where her engagement ring had once been.

I loved it.A charming novel about two writers of penny-dreadful stories in Victorian England, both of which are clever and humorous in their own way. One is a proper lady secretly writing under a male pen name and the other is a man that has prospered and moved far up in life from his street urchin roots. Romance ensues.Amidst the main story, each of the character’s story serializations are interspersed and I liked both of those stories as well.

Like any avid reader with a curious mind, I had to decide for myself by reading the two novels back to back. The Giver of Stars teaches you much about the KY pack librarians while exploring themes about unmet expectations and female friendship. The author being from the UK (as is the heroine), provided an interesting comparison in cultures, particularly regarding funeral customs.The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek teaches you much about the Blue People of KY while exploring themes about survival and racism. The author is from the Appalachian region, which lends an authenticity to the dialect and customs of the area.After reading both novels back to back, I suspect Jojo Moyes may have borrowed a few plot points from Richardson’s manuscript, but the end result is still two completely different novels. I enjoyed both and learned different things from each, never once feeling like there was enough overlap to take away from either reading experience. They are both worth your time.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: There is always a way out of a situation. Might be ugly.

The unlikely heroine, Ofelia, is an elderly woman approaching 80 years old, who has lived in this corporate colony for over half of her life. She buried her husband and two of her children on this planet and decides to covertly stay behind when the corporation decides to shut the colony down and move its workers to a new planet of the company’s choosing. She fears she will not survive the long flight in a cryogenic state, but mostly, she just wants to be alone with no demands placed on her so she can enjoy her remaining years in peace and solitude. She revels in being able, for the first time in almost 8 decades, to truly be herself. She wears what she wants (very little) and does whatever feels good, relishing a return to her childhood state while still keeping everything going and maintained like a boss, despite the limitations of her aging body with its aches and pains.The joy of creation, of play, had been the empty place unfilled by family and social duties. She would have loved her children better, she thought now, if she had realized how much she herself needed to play, to follow her own childish desire to handle beautiful things and make more beauty.In no way does it seem to bother the elderly woman that she is the only human on the entire planet, the only human for light years in any direction. She happily goes about her business, until the day comes that she realizes she may be the only human, but she is not alone. When a nomadic group of aliens arrive and make first contact, the story truly begins. While some ers call this one slow, I did not find that to be the case. I enjoyed the buildup to her making first contact, but I love novels such as this one that feature strong characterization and character growth. If you prefer novels that are plot driven, you will enjoy the second half of the novel much more than the first.I appreciated the themes and morals that this book conveys, from its realistic portrayal of how inconsiderate and cruel corporations are towards their employees, to the importance of finding a way to connect with other cultures that fosters mutual learning and understanding. It addresses ageism and sexism and the author deftly writes accurate human behaviors and tendencies across several demographics. “Are you flirting?” Ofelia asked. She thought so; why else wear that perfume? Why else swing her ripe young body back and forth like fruit on a vine, every motion declaring her readiness to be picked and eaten?This novel is very approachable and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people that typically do not enjoy science fiction. Most of all, I enjoyed the sections that were narrated by the aliens as they try to decide what to make of this “monster” human they have encountered in their land. I always enjoy seeing humanity through the eyes of outsiders, and the insightful revelations that so often result, including finding those universal truths that seem to permeate across most social species. Wicked pleasure bubbling in her veins to see that woman discover that she had been seen, that her mind had been as naked to an old woman’s knowledge of human nature as the old woman’s body had been to her external eyes.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Between her toes the damp earth felt cool, but already sweat crept between the roots of her hair.Favorite Quote: You did not like my answers before; you told me I didn’t understand.

I really loved it.On Midsummer Eve, Alinor waits in the church graveyard, hoping to encounter her missing husband’s ghost and 4.5 stars - Incredible. I really loved it.On Midsummer Eve, Alinor waits in the church graveyard, hoping to encounter her missing husband’s ghost and thus confirm his death. Instead, she meets a stranger, a man named James, who is a Catholic priest and a spy in secret service to the exiled King Charles.Unlike most of the novels I have read by Philippa Gregory, politics and royal intrigue are in the background here with romance being in the foreground. At first, I didn’t think I would like this format as much, and the first half was not exactly riveting to read (still good, but not 4.5 stars). I’m so thankful I stuck with it though as it ended up being an incredible story and the second half, in particular, is fantastic. This is a historical fiction novel that can even appeal to people that normally don’t like HF.The main family’s characters are vivid and memorable, particularly the mother and daughter. I enjoyed that many other characters were morally gray and complex like people are in reality. This always make for a more enjoyable reading experience, and for characters that linger in your mind long after the book is closed.The author has an interesting concept with this series, which is to follow several generations of the same family to show their rise from obscurity to prosperity over 250 years and 3 continents. I eagerly anticipate reading future works in this series. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quotes: God will judge him now. And that is a court to which we all must come.Perhaps this was her punishment for foolishly trusting a young man who spoke of priceless love but lived inside an expensive world, who called himself mad for her but was all too thoughtful when it came to his future.First Sentence: The church was gray against a paler gray sky, the bell tower dark against the darker clouds....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Oct 08, 2019","Oct 12, 2019","Aug 20, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43268390-tidelands

GL is a characteristically female way of thinking that appears to be contradictory and circuitous but is actually a complicated and highly evolved way of considering every choice and its repercussions before we make a move toward what we want.I only recently discovered Iliza, but she’s incredible. If you haven’t watched it yet, I highly recommend her Netflix special, Elder Millenial.I couldn’t relate to a lot of the dating stories (I’ve been with my husband for over half of my life and can’t even comprehend what dating today would be like), but the majority of the book was insightful as well as being humorous, especially the back half. I really enjoyed the pictures she included at the end as well. The point is, this book deserves far more recognition than it has received.What I love most about her style of humor is that beneath the laughs, there are sharp, perspective observances and explanations. She’s not just funny and beautiful, she’s also intelligent. Smart people are awesome, funny people are awesome, but when you get both in one package, it’s a beautiful thing. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You teach people how to treat you.

It was good overall but could have been great with a severe editing cut. It felt like 500 pages of story stretched out to the point that things progressed at a crawl.The author did a great job of creating grey characters (with one exception being the main bad guy - he could have used more white paint in his grey color composition). I also loved his way of vividly describing things, such as,  ""Her mouth tasted of pennies” or my personal favorite,  “She leaned forward with the certainty of a drunk at the bar about to tell you he just ran over Bigfoot with his pickup truck.”I’m not opposed to long novels by any means, many of my favorites are 1000+ pages, but this one did not feel like my time invested was fully paid off.

This timeline was ok though the heroine’s stupidity is exasperating to the point it can pull you out of the story. (view spoiler)[ She’s financially strained and paying rent with credit cards, suspects her fiance of cheating on her with valid reasons for her suspicions. When calculating it has been almost a month since they had sex she realizes she is a week late with her period. Hopes and prays she is pregnant and effing CRIES (sad tears, not happy relief tears) when her period starts. A rational person in this situation would have been crying when they thought they were pregnant by a cheating fiance while broke and indebted. (hide spoiler)]The older timeline is focused on Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales. This one was more interesting and had me googling various historical topics for supplementation.The whole novel held my interest and I wouldn’t hesitate to read something else by the author, but I also did not feel compelled to highlight any snippets of prose.

The taste of him on her tongue was like sun-warmed honey. Like cool water sliding down her parched throat. Like the promise of all her tomorrows in a single sigh. When she wound her fingers in his hair to draw her body against his, he stilled for breath, and she knew, as he knew, that they were lost. Lost forever.

I’ve also wanted to start the Shetland Island series by this author for years, so this looked intriguing when the publisher offered the ARC in exchange for an honest .The novel had a slower build in the first 1/3, with full engagement not happening until around 35% through. The initial tone is also repeatedly antagonistic towards Christians, coming across as preachy and superfluous. While some of it made sense eventually, I found it to be jarring and distracting for too long, focusing on the perceived author’s message, as opposed to focusing on the characters. And some of it truly was just superfluous. Once well settled into the book however, you’re invested in the characters for the remainder, and I found myself considering multiple plot lines with various killers, motives and deceptions. It’s lovely when a mystery has me pondering possible outcomes when not actively reading. Most of the characters were flawed (my favorite flavor) and the author was crafty with showing how a detective’s train of thought process may advance.It looks like the author will be turning this into a series as well, and I wouldn’t hesitate to read the next installment.

The other 70% is spent on various family drama that each individual character / neighbor is going through. It’s a good book that I could solidly recommend to anyone that is interested in the synopsis. While it didn’t reach “love” status for me, I would read something else by the author in the future with no reservations. Unfortunately, there were no passages that called out to be highlighted or saved, which is one thing I typically need to thoroughly enjoy and love a novel.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: The earth trembles....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 31, 2019","Apr 05, 2019","Mar 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40641074-if-then

There is an eye-roll-inducing scenario near the end that is so obvious I was confused when it was “revealed” as a shocking twist. In general, the writing was unremarkable and unmemorable. This one lacked the humor, sweet romance, and outsider under-dog that gave charm to the first. Instead, the reader is served 500 pages of vapid, gossipy, small-minded characters as they fret, compete and create drama over trivial things that have no importance. That is right up some people’s alley and they will love this book, but if you enjoyed the same things that I did about the first one, be warned that you will not find those elements in this sequel. Overall, it felt like a total waste of my time. I *might* consider reading another book from the author in the future if it was a stand-alone or the first in a completely different series. But the odds of a sequel ever being picked up are very slim and there are concerns he may be a one-trick pony. Unfortunately, I feel this book will do damage to the author’s reputation with discerning readers - it falls far, far short of his wonderful debut novel. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Beauty fades, but wit will keep you on the invitation lists to all the most exclusive parties.

Just ok.What I did like: One short paragraph about the merits of an umbrella insurance policy.What I didn’t like: Treating the reader as though they are obtuse by unnecessarily explaining the obvious. The more expensive your life is, the harder it is to save money.Eye rolling motivational cliches. Get ready to dream big! Asking the reader questions that feel like a dated middle school workbook. For example: Tough questions here, like: What does your work-optional dream life look like in very concrete terms? What are you willing to sacrifice to get to that goal? Nor did the checklists help in this regard. In all fairness: This is a subject upon which I am quite educated and was disappointed to glean very little from my invested reading time. A total novice to the personal finance world that doesn’t know the difference between a stock and a bond, or doesn't have the forethought to consider a side job to increase income, may find this more helpful than I did. For that reason, and because this book does not yet have many s, I am generously rounding my rating up from a more honest 1.5 (didn’t like it) to 2 stars (meh). I’d recommend checking out the FIRE blogger community instead.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: When the Social Security Act of 1935 was passed in the US, the retirement age was set at age 65, but at the time, the life expectancy for an American male at birth was only 58.First Sentence: It’s eight p.m. on a Friday, and I’m asleep on the couch....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2019","Feb 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40696975-work-optional

First you code something fun, then you build a world around it to make people care.I love debut novels, I love books about time travel, and I love that Mike Chen did not disappoint on either front.Not being a mother myself, normally I have a very difficult time relating to books that pivot around a parental relationship. Not the case here, as Chen conveys heartfelt feelings in such a natural flow, that anyone who has ever cared deeply for another person will have no difficulty with engagement.Like many great sci-fi novels, this book produces thought provoking ethical questions and mind benders with the time travel element. It would be an excellent choice for a book club discussion.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: We’re all different people all through our lives, but that’s okay, as long as you remember all the people you used to be.First Sentence: No pulse beat beneath the skin....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 14, 2019","Feb 23, 2019","Jan 29, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36630924-here-and-now-and-then

I loved it.We sleep, the theory goes, in order to forget.March 22, 2020 - Current reality is akin to living in a dystopian novel. It is highly unlikely that people will one day fondly look back at 2020 as the best year ever. As a healthcare provider amid a Coronavirus plague, life has been more, shall we say, stressful.People deal with stress in different ways, and many here on GR enjoy reading. Perhaps sadistically, I enjoy reading books that deal with problems reflected in current real-life situations, as frequently things in fiction are so much worse than reality, which makes me feel better.There is a comfort in thinking up something worse than what is.So it turned out that this book was not the horrific dystopian to bring comfort with comparison to real life that I was originally seeking, but I still really loved it and now want to read the author's other novel. It could be categorized as Sci-Fi light with a philosophical bend. Walker has a relaxed, beautiful way of weaving words with many thoughtful passages. It’s not a thrilling page-turner, but it progresses along steadily with full engagement throughout. It doesn’t wrap everything up in a perfect bow at the end, nor is every question answered for the reader. So in some ways, it’s very much like real-life and sometimes that’s refreshing in literature. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: It’s easy to mistake a wish for a fact, a hope for a lie, a better world for the one that is.

I found myself talking about the premise with friends and coworkers and can see where this novel would shine in a bookclub setting, with many discussion points.The back half, however, where things started to resolve for these characters, was only satisfying for one or two as the whole thing turned into a big messy soap opera. Several characters’ stories ended in eye-rolling cheesiness, sappy Hallmark fashion or cliched predictability. Sadly, I also found no quotable prose to highlight, which always makes a book more enjoyable for me.Overall, a page turning, fun read that would be great for a vacation, or for a lively bookclub discussion, but I would not call it a “must read”.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: Mandy stared at the photograph on her computer screen and held her breath....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 29, 2019","Jun 30, 2019","Dec 11, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40670312-the-one

The author does very well with building a sense of time and place, as well as creating suspense and tension in all the right places. My sole disappointment was that Grace’s storyline and her obsession with randomly found photos of strangers was simply not believable. Uprooting her life and risking her job in a desperate attempt to figure out the mystery behind them felt forced and convoluted. While I enjoyed the alternating perspectives of “During the War” and “After the War”, I wish the author would have found a stronger way to link them. Perhaps if Grace would have been chasing down the story behind photos of an ancestor it would have worked better than those of a total stranger?Recommended for those that enjoy historical fiction, particularly WWII HF, or stories of espionage.

""There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.”[image]A flawed but memorable story about surviving against the odds, told beautifully with a strong ending. This was such a mixed bag for me. The author writes beautifully, and I highlighted throughout the novel. It was actually difficult to pick out a favorite quote. The constant inclusion of nature was lovely and spoke to my soul.It’s a unique story with memorable characters, a tale that will stick with you long after it’s finished. I would love to read another novel by the author focusing solely on the life that Jumpin and Mabel had together.It ends magnificently, leaving me very relieved that I did not give up on it due to its plausibility issues. There is also a trial scene that is done in the very best way - direct, tension-filled, interesting witness testimonies, great closing speeches by the attorneys, and any boring stuff was skipped over.The author’s writing is beautiful, but her imagination could use some stretching. There were serious believability issues, most of which had to do with the comical romantic triangle. It read like a forced, contrived obstacle that was utterly farcical and impossible to take seriously. One is simply not conflicted over the choice between ice cream and stale moldy bread.Other things that were not realistic: (view spoiler)[1. In real life, when Tate finally showed back up, Kya would have dropped Chase before his dumb ass even realized what was going on. 2. The book describes Tate away at college, pining away for the love of his life (Kya), who he finds it “difficult to breathe without”. No one else in the world compares in any way to her. Yet….his dumb ass hides from her anytime he sees her and is too timid to even write letters to her? Bullshit. His character was confident even as a young kid. None of these actions fit with the character the author had strongly built, nor does it make any sense in any parallel universe for any person to act this way. Ridiculous, cheap writing used to force a conflict that was needed to set up the rest of the story.3. Speaking of lazy writing that completely changes the core of a character for plot convenience, let’s talk about Chase. Chase was consistently an ass, but for almost 4 years he pressure and pushes Kya to have sex, but ultimately respects and steps down when she says no. For 4 freaking years, he patiently waits until she desires him as well. Then just a few months later after they have broken up, when he tries to make the moves on her and she refuses, he beats and rapes her. This is completely inconsistent with the character’s build prior to that point.4. What are the odds that Kya’s mother, and multiple siblings would all leave and never check on her again, even decades later? Not impossible, but again, it felt like cheap writing because it was convenient for the story.  (hide spoiler)]For this to be, in large part, a character study, it is a shame that two characters are not realistically portrayed. It comes across as lazy writing that has them do something extremely inconsistent with their character in order to advance the plot. (Details in the spoiler section). ""Female fireflies draw in strange males with dishonest signals and eat them; mantis females devour their own mates. Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.”The narrator, Cassandra Campbell, did a terrific job with having distinct voices for each character and used the perfect amount of emotion with her performance. Her southern accent, however, would never be passable to anyone actually from the south. She also extremely over-exaggerates the slower pace that southerners speak, which required me to listen at 2.5X speed for it to not be painful. (I normally listen to audiobooks at 1.7-2.0x).[image]-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Faces change with life's toll, but eyes remain a window to what was.

Zob3.5 stars - It was really good.Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite books, so I always love to read an author’s take on a retelling. Zoboi easily has the most original and fresh version that I have read thus far.Things still were far from perfection however. The beginning and end were lackluster but the middle was terrific and brought the overall rating of the book up. Zuri’s poetry and haikus initially were annoying (I’m not a huge poetry fan), but they grew on me by the end and a few were rather impressive. I wish certain themes would have not been so repetitive. Readers understood very early on that the story takes place in the hood. We did not need to be told 72 times. I also wish the ending would have been as touching as the original instead of an abrupt wrap up. The dialogue, while accurate, was a sharp reminder of how our society has changed. The contrast between the early 1800’s and modern day colloquial dialogue is embarrassing. Then: There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.Now: Cool. Sounds like you know your shit.But in the middle of the story, Darius touched my heart and invoked warm gooey feelings reminiscent of the one and only Mr. Darcy. Most retellings fail in this aspect. I also appreciated that the author made the story her own with P&P being a loose basis, rather than a rigid framework. Her subplots do not follow down the exact same paths, which was refreshing.Recommended for other die hard P&P fans, or readers interested in a modern literary analysis of class culture and the effects (positive and negative) of gentrification.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: If I listen closely enough, I can hear Bushwick’s volume turning down real slowly. Getting quiet. My sisters don’t believe me when I tell them that even though it’s still noisy, our neighborhood is getting quieter and quieter every summer, as if the tiny musical sounds that fill up my hood are popping like bubbles, one by one, and disappearing into empty silence.

Just ok.Unlike the majority of Goodreads readers, I found the author’s All Soul’s Trilogy to be underwhelming and overrated, despite having a plot synopsis that rang several of my trigger bells. Comparing the author to Diana Gabaldon and Neil Gaiman is, shall we say, misleading. I picked this one up under the impression that it is a stand alone novel. It is actually more of the same dull, passionless characters, except now you also have the tedium of parenting toddlers included. But wait, there’s more! In this novel you will also find characters that are the most special kind of special - 3 especially special characters to be exact. Newsflash for authors and publishers - readers are incredibly over this trope! On a positive note, I must admit that Persephone was a brilliant name choice for the kitty. However, Harkness and I are simply not a great fit for one another, and I do not intend to pick up another novel by her.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You’ll be wanting to ripen a bit more before you take me on.

Brilliant start that grabs you right away but after those first couple chapters, you just wonder endlessly through dullness, reading much about superfluous boring activities like knitting. (No offense to knitters, but that’s not how this book is sold in the synopsis and I can only imagine that knitting is far more interesting to do than to read about.)Most GR ers, as well as a few authors that I respect, rave about her writing, but I found it mostly to be stilted and elementary to middle school level in quality and complexity. Since I’m clearly in the minority, in fairness below is an excerpt so you can judge the writing for yourself. Panova Mandelstam and I held the reins of the horses while Panov Mandelstam and Algis stamped down the snow around an open place. Horses are much bigger than goats. I was a little scared of them, but I had to help hold them, and they only stayed still and did not jump like goats did, and I could tell they were very tired. Finally we led the horses in the open place and then we took all the blankets from the sleigh and covered them with the blankets. Panov Mandelstam took the bags out of the sleigh and put them in the little hollow, and then he helped Panova Mandelstam climb down from the sleigh and over the snow to sit on them. Then he straightened up and looked at Algis. Algis was standing next to the back of the sleigh. His head was hanging. He said, low, “I didn’t fill the bucket.” He meant the grain bucket. So there was no food for the horses.There are numerous POV narrators with new ones being introduced frequently and switches happen multiple times within each chapter. The author gives no delineation or heading to imply who is speaking and since all the characters “sound” alike (flat, 1-D, cardboard), it can take a few paragraphs to use context clues to figure out who is narrating. This made for a fragmented reading experience. Especially since each narrator speaks in 1st person (eye roll), there is no excuse for all the characters “sounding” the same. It did not help that the audiobook narrator scarcely changes her voice or inflection to imply it is a new character speaking. So no matter which format you utilize, it ends in frustrated disappointment.This was my 2nd novel by the author, the first being the also much-hyped, Uprooted. I went back and read my  for it which was also a bored 1.5 stars with subpar narration that was DNF'd at just over ½ way through the book. So at least she’s consistent. I will say she has strong beginnings, but as for me, no matter how hyped her future books are, I shall not be tempted. There are far, far, far, far, far, far, far better fantasy books to be read.------------------------------------------- First Sentence: The real story isn’t half as pretty as the one you’ve heard....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 25, 2019","Jan 16, 2020","Sep 13, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39032118-spinning-silver

Just ok. This story has a fascinating premise and a beautiful cover, and those are the only positive things I have to say.The dialogue 2 stars - Meh. Just ok. This story has a fascinating premise and a beautiful cover, and those are the only positive things I have to say.The dialogue felt extremely artificial and was not helped by an audiobook narrator that portrayed the main character as a timid, mousy person. The book was heavy on dialogue which made for a stilted, clipped read much of the time.Characters did things that did not make sense or feel true to who they were supposed to be. It seemed like a lot of the time they would do these unbelievable (not preposterous, but feeling forced) things in order to advance the plot.When you finally trudge through to the end, because the only reason you are still reading is to see how things turn out, the ending is rushed and far from heartfelt. When I picked it, I looked forward to seeing how civilization would be maintained with an abrupt huge loss of population, but the solutions in this book are nonimaginative and frankly, rather boring to read about.Aside from time travel, no other significant world-building was created. They can travel through time in this alternate world, but they still use the Dewey decimal system to catalog at the library. Okay.Inaccuracies in a book can be jarring but they are frankly annoying when they are repeated and emphasized. The author frequently mentions the year 2000 being the start of a new millennium and makes a huge point of this over and over and over. Too bad that is incorrect as a new millennium (and century) begins with the year ending in 01. 2001 was the start of the new millennium, not 2000. Why was this not caught by the editor or researched initially by the author? A smaller inaccuracy was a character lamenting that Texas does not have any wind. Four of the top ten windiest cities in America are in Texas so that seemed like an odd thing to use to create ambiance when so few place descriptives were used.This premise had promising potential that was never realized. I would be hesitant to read another book by this author, but not completely opposed to it. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Eventually, Donna tells her that if she has nothing bad to say about Chad, she is not allowed to say anything at all.First Sentence: People wishing to time travel go to Houston Intercontinental Airport....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 25, 2019","Sep 06, 2019","Jul 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42202089-an-ocean-of-minutes

It’s not rocket science, it’s that rule of opposites and attraction.Totally different than her debut novel, “You”, and while I personally prefer the debut, it is rather polarizing and will not suit everyone’s tastes. In contrast, I could see the majority of readers that are interested in a suspenseful mystery with a touch of light science fiction also enjoying this one. There’s just something about her writing that grabs my attention in the first chapter and doesn’t let go of it until the end of the book. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You regress when you go home.First Sentence: I brung Pedro home for Thanksgiving break and tomorrow I have to bring him back to school. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 04, 2018","Sep 06, 2018","Jul 01, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40098361-providence

I really loved it. “This second,” his father liked to tell him, “just became the past. As soon as you noticed it, it was already gone. Too bad for you, Son. It’s lost forever.”Such memorable characters and highlightable prose. The main character is a patriarch that is dying, reflecting on his life and trying to wrap up loose ends before it happens. He broke my heart with his reference to rhinos as it was clear in his frail state that he coveted their impenetrability. Mija - a rhino has such thick skin, mosquitoes and flies can’t bite him. They bend their beaks on him.Since I am trying to become fluent in Spanish, I enjoy books that mix the two languages. For those that don’t, the author does a wonderful job of giving the translation smoothly, or it is obvious from context. Between his thoughtful prose and vivid, grey characters, I became an instant fan. Really loved the writing and eagerly look forward to reading the author’s other works as well.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Death. What a ridiculous practical joke.

But there is never a way into the before. All you can do with the past is carry it around, feeling its weight slowly increase, praying it never crushes you completely.I have read several books by Matt Haig now, fiction and nonfiction, and thoroughly enjoyed each one. The concept for this book is fascinating - a subset of people that age extremely slowly after puberty leading to them living for close to a millenial, but having to move and start over repeatedly to avoid attention. Funny how everything can change, yet stay the same. These ‘albatrosses’ kept their slow aging a secret in the 1500’s because people’s superstitions could cause them to be killed for witchcraft. In modern day, they must kept it a secret as biotech firms would do nefarious things to find a way to profit from a miracle anti-aging drug. The illustrations throughout were a nice edition - I wish more adult books had them. It’s a nostalgic touch that added to the reading experience without being so frequent as to be obtrusive.The author also includes very thoughtful insights with the progression of the world over the last 500 years and the effects it has on the human psyche. Readers that enjoy this aspect of the novel should really read his nonfiction book, Notes on a Nervous Planet.‘Anxiety’, Kierkegaard wrote, in the middle of the nineteenth century, ‘is the dizziness of freedom.’This is a problem with living in the twenty-first century. Many of us have every material thing we need, so the job of marketing is now to tie the economy to our emotions, to make us feel like we need more by making us want things we never needed before. We are made to feel poor on thirty thousand pounds a year. To feel poorly traveled if we have been to only ten other countries. To feel too old if we have a wrinkle. To feel ugly if we aren’t photoshopped and filtered.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: The main lesson of history is: humans don’t learn from history.First Sentences: I often think of what Hendrich said to me, over a century ago, in his New York apartment. ‘The first rule is that you don’t fall in love,’ he said....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 13, 2019","May 27, 2019","Apr 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35411685-how-to-stop-time

It happens sometimes in families; one child who doesn’t fit,  whose rhythm is off, whose meter is set to the wrong tune.What an enthralling, memorable read with smooth, quotable prose. It felt like three different stories, seamlessly rolled into one, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.The first part of the book deals with the author’s upbringing, which was radically different from that of the average American. Enjoy reading about drastically different cultures from your own? I’d recommend this book.The second part of the book deals with the author going out into the “real world”, which vividly displayed a sharp contrast between the world she had previously known, and the one she currently found herself in. Enjoy reading about sudden immersions into foreign worlds and cultures (i.e., time travel novels)? I’d recommend this book.The final part of the book deals with the author’s insightful reckoning, which ends with the realization that sometimes toxic people should not have a place in your life, even if you do love them. The “crazy” you may have dealt with in your family could be a different flavor, but the aftereffects often taste the same and are so utterly relatable. Enjoy reading about dysfunctional families? I’d recommend this book.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them.

I really loved it.I have read enough about Tudor history to know that Queen Elizabeth was not actually the golden angel pop culture often portrays her as today, nor do I believe that ""virgin queen"" is an appropriate moniker though that does give me a great chuckle. This novel however really highlighted how malicious and manipulative she was through the factual choices she made in dealing with her cousins. While I applaud her progressive feminist mindset that was centuries ahead of her time, I feel she must have been a horribly cruel monarch to serve. It seems she inherited both her mother’s guile and her father’s paranoia and viciousness - a rather menacing combination.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Red is the color of defiance, red is the color of life, red is the color of love, and so it is my color.

Half way through a book I still wasn’t invested in the characters or the plot so I am setting this one aside. I picked it up after watching the movie trailer which looked intriguing. While I haven’t yet seen the movie, the book has been slow, not very believable and unengaging.My thoughts were very similar to those of my GR friend, Carmen, though in her  she words them much more elegantly and includes several excerpts that showcase what went wrong (for me) with the novel.

Here are the Ruttledges, who have forsaken the glitter of London to raise sheep and cattle, gentle Jamesie Murphy, whose appetite for gossip both charms and intimidates his neighbors, handsome John Quinn, perennially on the look-out for a new wife, and the town's richest man, a gruff, self-made magnate known as ""the Shah."" Following his characters through the course of a year, through lambing and haying seasons, market days and family visits, McGahern lays bare their passions and regrets, their uneasy relationship with the modern world, their ancient intimacy with death.Released Feb 2015, 233 pages....more",Notes are private!,0,2,0,not set,not set,"May 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175823.By_the_Lake

Women’s fiction / Chick-lit / light contemporary fiction….whatever it is called today, it’s not my favorite genre, but it is one I hanker for 3-4 times a year. Sarah Jio in the past has easily been one of my favorite authors in this arena, but this book fell flat, was too predictable and completely unbelievable. It was not horrible per se, but it was also not particularly memorable, nor did it make me feel the feels (despite the author’s attempt, which came across as a bit sappy tbh). If you have never read any of her books, I’d highly recommend picking up The Violets of March instead, which is one of my favorite novels.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: He left.

The author also chose to follow in the minimal punctuation style that has become so popular of late. Thankfully I read this as an audiobook or I would not have finished it. I find the new trend of dropping quotation marks and other formatting to make for tedious reading and typically will choose a more professionally formatted book to read visually instead. But I digress. I wasn’t a fan of the above mentioned writing style as it sounded stilted and made engagement more difficult, but the book was interesting enough to keep me reading to the end and can be easily read in one sitting. I just think it will be forgettable for most readers.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: But he was loved by you, she said insistently, the love of a wife is different, it’s important.More important than the love of his mother? I asked. I immediately regretted it, I would have taken the question back if I could, the woman’s son had just died, if I could not be generous to her now, when would I? But she replied, somberly, Yes, it is the most important love, the love of the mother is a given, it is taken for granted. A child is born and for the rest of his or her life the mother will love the child, without the child doing anything in particular to earn it. But the love of a wife has to be earned, to be won in the first place and then kept.First Sentence: It began with a telephone call from Isabella....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Feb 12, 2017","Feb 12, 2017","Feb 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30407998-a-separation

It’s a love letter and a slow farewell between a man and his grandson, and between a dad and his boy.Such a sweet and touching read – easily devoured in one sitting. Backman does an amazing job of vividly putting into words the special bond between a child and their grandparent, while simultaneously displaying the heartbreaking, cruel effects of Alzheimer’s and similar diseases. It is a unique and contrasting combination of topics but the author dances between them beautifully. This story is told in simple but powerful words – one of my favorite writing styles. I particularly enjoyed how he described the world inside the grandfather’s mind; very creative and results in imagery that will not soon be forgotten. “Our teacher made us write a story about what we want to be when we’re big,” Noah tells him.“What did you write?”“I wrote that I wanted to concentrate on being little first.”“That’s a very good answer.”“Isn’t it? I would rather be old than a grown-up. All grown-ups are angry, it’s just children and old people who laugh.”“Did you write that?”“Yes.”“What did your teacher say?”“She said I hadn’t understood the task.”“And what did you say?”“I said she hadn’t understood my answer.”P.s. This will make you miss your grandparents if you have lost them, especially your grandfather(s).-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Isn’t that the best of all life’s ages, an old man thinks as he looks at his grandchild.

Easily read with a few interesting things to ponder. However, the author stresses how much happier you will be if you don’t care about every little thing or place such high expectations on yourself. While I agree with that whole-heartedly he doesn’t exactly explain how one might go about the transformation of a perfectionist into a mellow happy hipster.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quotes: Rather than report on real stories and real issues, the media find it much easier (and more profitable) to find something mildly offensive, broadcast it to a wide audience, generate outrage, and then broadcast that outrage back across the population in a way that outrages yet another part of the population. This triggers a kind of echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two imaginary sides, meanwhile distracting everyone from real societal problems. It’s no wonder we’re more politically polarized than ever before.First Sentence: Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jan 17, 2018","Nov 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck

Intriguing enough to finish, but not enough to like it.Why, most men jump at the chance to give up everything for nothing. There's nothing we're so slapstick with as our own immortal souls.Perhaps if I had read this one when I was a middle school aged child, I too would have felt the magic that most ers enjoyed. If I had a time machine, I would make sure to have read this beloved classic back then. But now I am a middle aged adult, too cynical to enjoy the farcical plot - not just the fantasy elements, but also little details like 13 year old boys recognizing Chopin’s “Funeral March”. I could not buy into any of it. They whispered to Caesar that he was mortal, then sold daggers at half-price in the grand March sale.Written two years after “To Kill a Mockingbird”, the father felt like a ripoff of Atticus Finch. He was unrealistically good to the point he felt like a caricature. The dialogue overall was too sweet and sappy, too golly-jinkers for my tastes. And there is not enough caffeine in the world for me to enjoy over 300 pages with loud, exuberant children. Child narrators are not my favorite as a rule, but there are plenty of exceptions. Here, even on the page, these boys were too tumultuous and excited for my sensitive ears. They drained my energy, a scarce resource to begin with. God, how we get our fingers in each other’s clay. That’s friendship, each playing the potter to see what shapes we can make of the other.I am glad I finally read this so I can relate to its cultural inclusions, but it was a disappointment for me. I was looking for a mildly creepy book, but this felt more Disney-esque than scary to me. I bet I would have loved it when I was a kid though, and plenty of other adults love and cherish it still, so don’t let my  deter you. We salt our lives with other people’s sins.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: First of all, it was October, a rare month for boys.Favorite Quote: Death doesn’t exist. It never did, it never will. But we’ve drawn so many pictures of it, so many years, trying to pin it down, comprehend it, we’ve got to thinking of it as an entity, strangely alive and greedy. All it is, however, is a stopped watch, a loss, and end, a darkness.

It is set in my favorite locale for novels, the Pacific Northwest, but there was no real sense of atmosphere and you only knew the location because the author mentioned it intermittently.

I do not see myself picking up another work by the author in the future though.Writing sample:No. Have is the wrong word. There is nothing I would not do to be in contact with her.

I really loved it.What a compelling story with endearing characters and the perfect amount of tension. If done correctly, this would make for an epic film. My only complaint is that while the story flowed perfectly well, the author does not have a quotable literary flair with his prose (which is my favorite type of writing).From the author’s note:Once the United States entered the war, my father-in-law enlisted in the Army and, because of his facility with languages, was placed in the Intelligence Corps. As with his upbringing in Poland, whatever it was he did in the service has never been spoken of to any in his family. What you’ve read is my story, not his. But if I could somehow have pushed through his pained and brooding expressions when urged to speak about his past; through his inability to articulate the long-held-in burdens of guilt and loss; if he was able to tell his own story, the whole tale, of his past in Poland and the role he played during the war, I always imagined it would read something like this.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: The private room is on the fourth floor of the Geriatric wing at the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital outside Chicago, bent, old men shuffling down the hall in hospital gowns with nurses guiding them and portable IVs on their arms....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Apr 14, 2017","Apr 24, 2017","Sep 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28221006-the-one-man

The author has an easy and smooth writing style with consistent pacing throughout the novel, and I look forward to reading his other works. I enjoyed the quotations that he included from Gates and Jobs and appreciated the nod to a more modern technology showdown of sorts. It was especially appreciated how the author went into great detail at the end to separate fact vs fiction as well as to recommend further reading on several figures. In addition he includes a detailed historical timeline on his website.Never before had I read a novel that painted Edison in such a pompous, assertive and egotistical light. Normally when Edison is referred to it is all balloons and banners – reading this author’s take on him (which is based on Edison's letters and actual events) makes the legend seem much more human.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: One doesn't lie down with a lion and get to act surprised if one finds oneself devoured.First Sentence: On the day that he would first meet Thomas Edison, Paul watched a man burn alive in the sky above Broadway....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Oct 07, 2016","Oct 12, 2016","Sep 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28363972-the-last-days-of-night

I always enjoy Gregory’s historical fiction novels. She has a unique way of grabbing my interest from the first page and truly bringing historical figures to life. I appreciate that at the end of her novels she briefly addresses fact vs fiction (typically because the truth is unknown for these areas). Finally, I love that when I read her novels, I find myself researching more about the characters and events in her novels – always a sign of high engagement. This one was also inclusive of those wonderful things, though Mary Tudor, Queen of Scotland, could alternate quickly between being a progressive strong woman and a catty selfish flake, which was jarring at times. Is this inconsistent characterization or a more accurate reflection of human nature? At the end you are left contemplating how much the three queens truly shared in common with their life experiences.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: When men have authority over women, women can be brought very low—and they will be brought very low.

Those books are lovely, but this was not one of them. With a boring start, it felt like everything was taking forever to progress and the heroine was annoying and whiny. Characters acted randomly with no explanation for their abnormal behavior, just whatever was convenient to create conflict for the plot.Around 40% through, still was not engaged and had a hard time staying focused on the story. It was such a slog that my mind would wander to other things, as my eyes were “reading” the book. DNF’d with no regrets. I would be hesitant to read another book by this author.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: The first inkling that something was wrong was waking in darkness to find the cat pawing at my face....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 06, 2019","Jul 16, 2019","Aug 01, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29918785-the-woman-in-cabin-10

I loved it.[image] A gritty character study about hard lives, consequences, and the cycle of abuse, all told in a powerful story. The story points out that it sucks to be poor, or to live in Jamaica if you are gay.As the story progresses, each character is revealed in phases like peeling an onion, as you learn more about their past and what made them who they’ve become. Your opinions and thoughts about each one evolve as each new layer is revealed.The author especially does a wonderful job of showing how sometimes toxic mothers are unloving because they too were not treated well. Abuse and unhappiness are the only thing they know, and so, that’s what they give.“You did more harm to me than anyone else,” she says to her mother.Much of the dialogue is written in Jamaican dialect which made the story more immersive. The ending was not what I had hoped for from the plot, but I always appreciate when a book ends unpredictably. Impressive for a debut novel.“At di end ah di day, dis is we life. Look around uh, gyal. Look where yuh is. Dis piece ah ground worth more than we. Yuh see dis air we breathing? Is debt we owing.”[image] -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Margot was ten years old when Delores came home from work one day and saw her beaming.

For most of my life, I assumed I’d be a mother, and I’m sure it is rewarding, when they’re not having tantrums. But the older I’ve gotten, the less I’ve wanted it for myself...I like my life now, there’s stuff I want to do in the future that isn’t compatible with having kids, and it’s not even a big, tortured decision.

As usual, the book is far better, especially as the movie rushed many plot points, left significant events out and flat out changed the ending. If you start with the movie, you will have several plot twists from the book ruined that would be better enjoyed having read the story first. It reads well as a stand alone but I look forward to seeing if the sequel is just as great. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Doing nothing can sometimes be the most effective form of action.First Sentence: Nicholas Young slumped into the nearest seat in the hotel lobby, drained from the sixteen-hour flight from Singapore, the train ride from Heathrow Airport, and trudging through the rain-soaked streets. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 17, 2018","Dec 23, 2018","Apr 21, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18158562-crazy-rich-asians

I really loved it.Miller’s Valley is a masterly study of family, memory, loss, and, ultimately, discovery, of finding true identity and a new vision of home. As Mimi says, “No one ever leaves the town where they grew up, not really, even if they go.” More of a melancholy literary drama and character study than a fast-moving plot driven novel, this one will not appeal to everyone as much as it did to me. But if you appreciate characters that will stick with you for a long time and a thought provoking realistic story that drips of authenticity and naturalism, then you too are in for a fictional treat.Miller’s Valley is like the rest of America, a small feeble downtown with rings of suburbs, like the rings on a tree. Seventies, eighties, nineties, now.Even though this is set in post-Vietnam Pennsylvania, I found the novel to have a folksy southern-lit feel. I enjoyed the colloquial, unpretentious inner monologue of the main character as she transitioned into womanhood, especially in a time that women’s rights were effectively taking hold. While heartbreaking at times I adored the quirky, flawed family members and friends that jumped off the page, almost demanding their own subplots in which to tell their stories. She tells everybody that she’s sixty, which is funny because I’ll be sixty-five next birthday, and I can remember when we were both the same age. But whatever, as the kids say.Reflecting life’s ever changing state and with numerous talking points, including the highly controversial matter of eminent domain, this novel is ripe for a vibrant book club discussion.The difference between fifty and sixty is nothing; the difference between eight and eighteen is more or less a lifetime.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: It’s strange little moments that live inside you and keep peeking out the windows that open suddenly in your mind.First Sentence:It was a put-up job, and we all knew it by then....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Mar 19, 2017","Mar 26, 2017","Apr 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26131641-miller-s-valley

I loved it.After reading and really disliking the overrated Wolf Hall, I never thought I would find myself picking up another book by Mantel. Watching the BBC series, Wolf Hall, however, changed my mind. I thought the series was fantastic and did not recognize much of the material - it seems the majority of the series came from this book vs the first in the series.Thankfully, the sequel easily and far surpassed the first in this series. It did not suffer from a dreadfully slow pacing, nor did the author seem to meander about aimlessly with her prose. It seemed like it was written altogether by a different author, and for that I was grateful. I hope she continues with this same pacing and smoother narrative in her next installment rather than returning to the pompous drudgery that was Wolf Hall.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You can be merry with the king, you can share a joke with him.

Few synopses have grabbed my attention and set off my ""definitely want to read this"" bells as much as this one. It has all the wonderful, fantastical things: An epic novel of magic and mysticism, Celts and faeries, mad kings and druids, and the goddess struggling to reign over magic’s last outpost on the Earth.Unfortunately, it all fell apart in execution. There was an overabundance of characters, yet a dearth of character development. The novel is plot driven, yet central plot points are rushed and undeveloped. The story unfolds in a non-linear manner, jumping abruptly forwards, sideways and backwards, but was done in a style that felt like an incohesive tangle of short vignettes. It comes across like writing geared towards a juvenile target audience, but with nonessential adult sexual situations randomly thrown in, as if to remind the reader that this book is for grown-ups.The author had a brilliant idea and fascinating subject matter, but the writing style killed it all for me.

Like1.5 stars - I didn't like it.I can completely appreciate how this one will be loved by many fans of cozy mysteries, but it was not my cup of tea. Like most cozies, it was too cute, too sweet, too neat, and had a vexatious protagonist that thought she was a mastermind sleuth. Cozy novices are always so incredibly clever that they are able to magically run circles around the professionals to crack the case, yet they are so stupid as to not recognize the most obvious of dangers. I also felt the food inclusions were far too repetitive and forced feeling at times (and this is coming from a foodie). Around 85% into the novel I decided to just skim through to the end due to a persistent lack of engagement.I will say the main character was more charming than that in most cozies and she did have a nice way with words when doling out advice. Fans of this type of book will surely love it. As for me, I will stick with the mysteries that spare you the violence and gore while retaining some grit, and also have a professional working the case. Recommendable series that fit this description that I have read thus far would be those by Tana French and Louise Penny.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Bruises and bones can heal.

Would enjoy visaully re-reading this one in the future to highlight and  a lot of the more interesting segments. As a childfree by choice woman, the unintended consequences of the one child policy were especially fascinating. The author, and statistics, imply that once Chinese people were brainwashed taught all of the benefits to having a smaller family, that they are now unable to reverse that train of thought. I was also shocked to see how little of an effect this has had on gender equality in China. The author said something along the lines that due to the demographic gender shift combined with other factors affecting marriage, that fertile women are now a rare commodity, which means they are more valuable than before, but not necessarily more valued. The ending switches to case studies which wasn't quite as fascinating as the rest of the book, but was still interesting. I did really enjoy the epilogue and the author's pithy comments on being the fun Auntie instead of a mom (yay for Aunties!), but a paragraph later she is a mom, so....

I also enjoyed the plot and learning more about the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy. However, I felt the novel suffered from far too many points of view, and the writing was more juvenile than in Sepetys' debut novel, Between Shades of Gray. The novel would have been far stronger if written in 3rd person from a single omniscient narrative vs the plethora of 1st person POV narratives. I also didn't care for the writing style which seemed to be written for a younger audience. In particular, the frequent simplistic self questions became annoying: Would I be safe? Where would I go? How could I make it? Did he know I was here?, etc. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: The Wilhelm Gustloff was pregnant with lost souls conceived of war.

After reading her book, I now know her to be a beautiful, intelligent woman that has accomplished many great achievements in her career. But, she is not a great writer.While supposed to be nonfiction, the author blatantly spews so much vitrol for Durst that it made me question anything that was said. When writing nonfiction about a criminal and his trials, at least some semblance should be made towards being nonbiased and factual. He’s a serial murderer, not an innocent little kid riding his bike down the street. “Bobby” is a grown man, the epitome of cruelty and evil. Bobby, my ass.Then, fired up again, I said, “Son of a bitch!” That was my celebration, like, “You piece of garbage! You can’t get away anymore! Damn you!”She basically writes how she speaks, which may be charismatic in person or on camera, but comes across as immature, juvenile and gossipy in writing.THE JURY. Dear God. Those eight women and four men were an egg carton full of stupid.Seeing all the familiar faces was sort of like a family reunion. I got to judge them all, as in, “Oh, God. This one didn’t age too well,” or, “She looks good.” If I do say so myself, I didn’t look half bad.Between the bully spirit and hatefulness, it was difficult for me to take the writing seriously. It simply read like a trashy tabloid, which is unfortunate given how intelligent the author appears to be from all of her accomplishments.After the FBI arrested him, Durst was thrown in jail and then moved to the hospital wing due to his various illnesses. Hydrocephalus. Esophageal cancer. I wondered if his diseases were real, or if they were another trick.I grinned at him, and he turned beet red. Maybe he had high blood pressure. Maybe he swilled too much moonshine. Maybe he sat in front of too many campfires. I don’t know! I did wonder if he was going to have a heart attack, and if it might be insensitive to film it for my show.The only saving grace was the fascinating subject matter and that the author did include a few tidbits that were not covered in Jinx. On the other hand, it was painful enough that I do not imagine myself picking up another book by her in the future.-------------------------------------------First Sentence: As I write this, Robert Alan Durst is rotting in a federal facility....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Nov 08, 2016","Nov 11, 2016","Jan 10, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25363505-he-killed-them-all
