Readers of Deep Breathing will recognize some of the characters and enjoy revisiting their lives. Reader of The Law of Unintended Consequences too. But new readers won’t feel left behind, and could easily pick this intriguing novel up first.Jandrey’s characters are no cardboard cutouts. Those with physical, mental, or emotional difficulties are never defined by their trials, but rather by who they really are—not invisible, not ignorable either. Relationships are complex, not broken. Healing requires quiet effort and conscious thought. And mysteries are made for forgiveness and kindness to strangers, not mere intellectual exercise.From cops to homeless guys, from wheelchair to wedding, and from traditional (large) family values to real values, this novel entertains (with great humor), entices (with fascinating puzzles), and engages the reader (with trials and triumphs). It’s far more than police procedural or cozy (or uncozy) mystery. It’s slice of life, outlook on life, and celebration of life in all its complications, and it’s a great read.Disclosure: I read Deep Breathing and I was delighted to find I could meet those characters again....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 08, 2024","Apr 08, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/208966228-cold-colder-coldest

Meanwhile the more distant past echoes through the mysteries of unexpected death and a murder in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, VA. The resulting novel is a perfect addition to Howard Owen’s Willie Black mystery series, moving the slow demise of the news pages to a time just as Covid starts winding down in the US.The end of Covid brings conflicting needs—to get out, and to settle down. So now, reporter Willie Black and his wife dream of buying the apartment where they’ve long been isolated. And an old man plans a huge and glorious celebration, but dies the same day. A much younger man, who might be related, is murdered. And of course, since both the deceased are white, newspaper readers demand lots of background and lots of detail. Willie will have to write those column inches on time, as well as filling space on the newspaper’s blog. And of course, as a newspaperman, he will want to know more.The truth lies in the details, and Willie investigates with his usual careful attention and far-reaching awareness. Strange symbols, curious locations, and enough vaguely Biblical references to raise the interest of a local preacher, soon have him researching the history of a locally famous family, with enough tangled webs to enthrall the most jaded reader.The story is told in the convincing voice so familiar to readers of this series.

Slavery is the hot-button topic with its origins growing in the novel. But Hiram Martin’s Journal begins with a former English street-kid, tempted to an exciting future.Readers follow the protagonist's journey to the States and the world he finds there, and the novel gives a convincing first-person view of how that world betrays its dreams and changes the people who inhabit it. There are Indians, reviled by some settlers, but clearly with a culture all their own that the settlers might destroy. There are the unlettered who can’t tell when they’re being cheated in their seven years' servitude. And there are the shortages of labor brought about when Britain's Industrial Revolution demands more laborers from the streets, leaving fewer so eager to emigrate. So how will that need be filled?Women’s issues, social issues, nations, governments and people all come to the fore in this book, told with a convincing voice, and captivating readers with just the right level of detail. The author’s writing brings the 1600s to life, and reveals the concerns of real people to be not so different from those of the present day. Societies change, but people stay the same.

It’s quite a come-down, colored by the quarrel between her estranged parents, one of whom continues to be wildly successful while the other pursues some very different aims. But it’s only for a little while, till things look up again, maybe.The mining company, at least in this story, seems equally harsh in its treatment of land and of people. And the heart of the story is the young lawyer’s learning the importance of both. She learns to care for her neighbors; to enjoy the world outside the mad rush of glass-walled offices, city streets and bars; and to long for justice for everyone, not just for exciting, big cases. Meanwhile, as a reader, I’m invited into a world I’ve never seen. To imagine such beauty spoiled brings me up short, and adds depth to both the story and the characters.Depth is added too in the relationship between the protagonist and her parents, as both father and mother begin to be seen through different eyes.There are bad guys and good guys in this novel.

I remember as a child, admiring the beauties of the Lake District in England, and being surprised to learn that the countryside wasn’t “meant to be” like that. Human actions had shaped it.Bruce Glass’s The Anthropocene Epoch offers the regular reader a deeper look into how human actions have shaped and are still shaping the world, with much farther-reaching consequences than beautiful mountains and lakes. Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction is just one of the very many volumes the author uses in the course of this well-researched book. And readers are invited to look far beyond the headlines, the politics, and the vested interests of the modern world as they read.Excellent graphs and diagrams clarify the issues and, while climate change is an obvious topic of the book, the explanation of how the world has been changed by us goes much deeper, reaching forward from the far-distant past, giving this book a much wider scope than many others. But history also reveals a more convincing threat. After all, the earth has survived through worse storms than this, but not all its inhabitants have.A chapter on the age of unreason addresses historical religion and politics as well as those of the present day, and offers a balanced, well-reasoned view of modern America’s slide away from facts and truth. The author wisely shares out the blame, without pretending that it has to be equally shared. But the facts, as they pile on each other, show a world that is truly hurting, and not only in the ways we’ve heard before. Cars and planes aren’t the only problem. Genetic engineering of food isn’t evil. Vaccines save lives. Influential people lie. Money talks. And…In the end, this book is hopeful rather than depressing. Yes, the world has been changed by humanity, but we’ve been changing it for a very long time. And yes, we could become extinct. But “With our many discoveries, inventions, innovations, and great expansion of knowledge, humankind has created a wonderful time to be alive for most people… Surely we have the capacity to preserve our planet…” When you finish reading this book you’ll agree with the author’s conclusion.Appendices include copious notes, lists of endangered animals, text from the Green New Deal and more.

Pamela Cowan’s Cold Kill places readers, at times, in the mind of the attacker, then in the minds of his victims, then at the table with cops searching for solutions. Each point of view works convincingly in a story that combines physical ability and disability, mental stability and the slide to insanity, and the importance of friendship and kindness.

Part of the appeal, of course, is that you really can look back and check, which is satisfying for the “I want to solve it” reader, while leaving the “just give me answers” reader comfortably reading on. For myself, I was surprised how much time (late at night) I spent trying to solve the mystery of the “book within the book”—the one with the missing chapters. Like a perfect Agatha Christie novel, it just needed an ending to tie those thoughts and characters together. And the ending, when it finally comes, is perfectly satisfying without being predictable. It fits one of the late-night-imagined scenarios, without being obvious. Meanwhile the present-day mystery comes to its own logical conclusion.

They are very different characters, but gradually they, and the reader, come to recognize the beauty and value of difference – different ways of doing, different points of view and what should be done an how.Meanwhile, not very much in the background, is the forceful character of Anastasia, who owns the boat. She has a past as well, part of which will be gradually revealed – as much a blend of stories as is the history of the canals. But it’s just as hard to predict her future as it is to predict the futures of Eve and Sally – and just as hard to guess the pasts of the other characters who gather themselves into the story.I really enjoyed the time spent with these characters, and I’m almost inclined to look differently at myself and others now, having read this book.

The characters might be familiar to anyone familiar with Jesus’ miracles, but author Kathryn Elizabeth Jones gives them imagination and depth that brings them to life for the reader. Nicely researched background details feed naturally into these stories of believably ordinary people in a world touched by the extraordinary. And readers, ordinary as most of us are, are pleasingly invited in to share in the wonder.The dialog is well imagined, with large sections taken directly from the Bible. To my English ears, the (KJV) old English felt odd initially, but soon became natural and fitting to the author's enticing descriptions of location and occasion. I particularly enjoyed the later chapters in the book, where the reader gets to walk alongside those who saw Jesus die, sharing the mix of confusion and excitement, and the struggle to reconcile personal experience with what the authorities proclaim.An enjoyable easy-reading book, with depth to make you want to dip into it again and again, this is a great addition to any Christian library and a really good reminder that ordinary people – the least of these – are those He came to save.Disclosure: I was given a copy, and I really enjoyed reading it.

It’s a novel that certainly portrays the danger of gossip, however innocently meant, and it’s a scary tale of danger and suspicion.

And for me, the answer is it works brilliantly. A boy who wakes up in a different body each day, desperate to have a relationship with someone… anyone… and finding there’s someone special who he’s eager to meet again: The practical problems—will he even live close enough to meet next time he wakes—pale next to the human ones—will the body he inhabits next even be willing to meet? And the human issues of people uncomfortable (or awkwardly comfortable) in their own bodies are very powerfully portrayed, giving reason to view every stranger with empathy, while learning about the ultimate stranger who inhabits the story.

Rather than everyone struggling in poverty, the few survivors of this world's calamity live overly luxurious or desperately strange lives, while some maybe wish they could have staved off what led them here. With the curious ability to open windows to the past, this wish can’t come true in their own world, but maybe these odd pioneers might change the pasts of some other parallel worlds, including ours—depending of course on whether this is our future or someone else's.Future technology blends convincingly with present, and the characters of a very near-future world have just the right amount of future-shock when they experience impossible technology. Meanwhile the more-distant-future characters have an enjoyably different view of their own past, and the whole is entertaining, fascinating, exciting, and thought-provoking.

Chicago’s railroad station with striking workers and dangerous fury is depicted vividly and contrasts powerfully with the peace and beauty of the secretive community. But the trials of community life are shown just as honestly as its joys. Not everyone in Amana wants to stay there. And not everyone visiting Amana will be allowed to stay.Jacob Hirsch is fleeing the hopelessness of his life after losing his wife and his job. But he carries a small child with him, and when she becomes ill, the Amana community is happy to offer aid. What they’re less happy to offer is a place to stay afterward, and Jacob’s growing attraction to one of their unwed maidens, betrothed as she is, only makes things more difficult.The author explores the darkness caused by keeping secrets, the joy of trust, and the comfort of community in this novel, where sweet coincidence just might be God’s action and God’s testing of a growing relationship and hope.

Eastabrooks’ Inauspicious, a novel inspired by real events, propelled by the magnetism of kindness and synchronicity, and beautifully presented in smooth, sometimes delightful, sometimes horrifying prose.Triti is a very young new bride in India when her husband dies and her life is shattered on the fiery assumptions of tradition. Suddenly alone in the world, afraid of the consequences of her escape, she finds help in people who have, themselves, needed help, and betrayal in some who seem to have most to offer. Initially naïve, she learns to avoid trust, then struggles to trust again. And those on society’s fringes prove the truest friends.Meanwhile in the United States, Jaq is pursuing a successful education when male assumptions throw her down. Her fall won’t be as dramatic or terrifying as Triti’s, but the plight of women, forced to follow the rules of men, is as real in one country as the next. Triti’s wounds show on her hands and feet, and in the secrets that weight down her soul. Jaq’s are in failure when she strives for success, rejection when she strives to be accepted, and in the punishment that a beautiful face gives the women who wears it.When these two characters meet, the synchronicity of their separate fates becomes one story, driven to healing and hope. It’s a beautiful read, with gorgeous depictions of scenery, food, and drink, wonderful introductions to different ways of life, a glorious cast of memorable characters, and an ending that so perfectly fits the plot.

So the chance to read “his” story drew me to this book. And it’s a wonderful book. The story’s told from a blend of different points of view – an old man reminiscing on days gone by; another old man still wondering if the world might change; and the Emperor Julian himself, in a well-imagined memoir. The voices are convincing, and the world becomes rapidly real. Reading Julian gives readers the chance to learn history, to revisit new arguments that turn out to be singularly old, and to watch the creation and recreation of empires through war, architecture, religion, and diplomacy. I loved this book – a novel of convincing history, fascinating social issues, religious diversity, and of people trying to survive, to do their best, and maybe even to change the world.Disclosure: I was given a copy by a friend....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 18, 2021","Dec 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8719.Julian

In People Like Her, author Ellery Lloyd takes a social success and slowly reveals, not just the shadows behind the marketing ploys, but also the shadows behind the power. A speaker who can conjure crowds, answer questions with instant honesty, whatever truth she’s hiding, can seem like the perfect, real, and true (not imaginary) friend. But how willing will she be to keep her (perfect) children on display, describing the real (or imagined) life where she sympathizes with everyone else’s pain? What happens when the child begins to grow, and the dream begins to sour?People Like Her is intriguingly and sadly convincing. The power and the lure of fame is vividly portrayed, from first page to last. The growing mystery and sense of mistrust, the agonies of parenthood, the fear of loss, all become achingly real. And, even if you don’t like the characters, you’ll long for things to turn out right because… well, there are kids involved.Don’t read this is you’re easily scared.

One wife seems almost perfect, fitting in with everyone’s wishes, caring for a difficult child but keeping up appearances perfectly. The other is singularly out-of-place, bringing her lower-class world with her into the beauty and serenity of middle-class security. And neither wife is talking about their fears.A tale of blended families, power plays, and family secrets, the Silent Wife had me wondering which wife was actually silent as the story progressed. Both hide mysteries, both try to protect their children, and both are clearly, deeply in love with their spouses.

After all, how else would you be so invested in the fate of Holmes and Moriarty at the infamous Reichenbach Falls? So now a Pinkerton agent, far out of his territory, arrives with warnings of a hole in London’s underworld, ready to be filled by Moriarty’s successor. But who is this fiendish new mastermind, and how shall he be stopped?The story’s told in the convincing voice of American, Frederick Chase, who joins forces, reluctantly it seems, with a Scotland Yard detective. But this is no ordinary detective; Athelney Jones is as deeply devoted to the memory of Holmes as Chase is to the forgetting of Moriarty. And a twisted, scary tale follows, of criminal masterminds, informants trustworthy and otherwise, and surprises half-guessed, half-forgotten, and half-guessed again.

His military father had plans for him, but it’s his childhood friend, not J-Bee, who’s chosen to go to war. And J-Bee is now at Columbia, navigating an era of drugs and rebellion, looking for meaning in all the wrong places, and determined to make something of his life that matters.The Serpent of the title could be the mysterious poet who speaks in the catacombs of the campus café. It could be the tempter offering the solace of increasingly hazardous drugs. It could be the twisting head of political lies, threatening the futures of all the students as their draft numbers are set. Or it could be the coiling uncertainties that lurk in the protagonist’s dreams.J-Bee listens to the Serpent poet then tells his own first-person tale in his own poetic voice – oddly resonant at the start, but quickly hypnotizing the reader, like the gaze of a snake. Memory’s serpent coils in J-Bee’s past. Temptations seek to mesmerize. And violence erupts near the end of the book as police and demonstrators collide. But all the twists and turns lead up to a single, arrow-straight path. And this tale of a young man finding his way, a poet’s voice finding a listener, and truth holding out its hand to truth-seeker, is a beautiful novel – haunting in the tone of its voice, fascinating in its recreation of an era, and filled with wisdom that’s relevant to any era, perhaps most especially to today.Disclosure: I received a p edition and I really enjoyed reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2021","Dec 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58231696-the-serpent-papers

And is it even possible to question it, since surely only the church can interpret the Bible? Of course, that was a really old question, back in the day when they questioned whether plebs like us should be allowed to read the Bible in case we misunderstood, but the world has a way of bringing things full circle. Davidson and Turner, on the other hand, don’t try to square circles, but instead take all these questions deeper and show how something as huge as “the word of God” must surely be more than just printed translations on the page and one man’s “interpretation.”History, science, myth, symbol? Those words are so simple, but these authors take readers deeper into the text, to find song, analogy, polemic, covenant, temple, calendar, and land (the headings of their seven layers). In each chapter, they offer a new way (new to many readers, anyway) of reading the text, with Biblical references to other parts of the Bible that show a deeper relevance, all tied to scriptural truth and the history and arguments of our time as well as those of times before.My favorite chapter deals with Genesis as Covenant, and pleasingly satisfies my (personal) sense that God delights in the wildness of lions even more than I do in watching them on TV.Well-planned tables and well-drawn clarify the meaning. Well-argued examples draw the reader in. And the “challenges and responses” together with discussion questions at the end of each section invite the reader to make their own minds up and question their preconceptions. It’s a beautifully presented book, a delight to read, truly thought-provoking, and deeply faithful to the text of the sacred Book. Yes, we can ask questions.

Things fall apart in what was meant to be an everyday protest, and a watcher comments that people just get tired--""tired of asking politely... tired of knocking at that same old door....""

The hard-working, hard-studying Doctor Agnes might lose the studious life she’s fought so hard to gain, as her mentor determines to leave the relative comfort of a Parisian hospital for somewhere closer to the front during WWI. Meanwhile hard-playing and thoroughly bored teenager Madeleine, safe in a Swiss finishing school, determines to give up the life her family is offering her and take her own, more dangerous path. Both young women sacrifice plans and future for medicine in a front-line chateau, wonderfully depicted in Hannah Byron’s evocative writing. But war, here so close, can come closer still, changing everyone’s perspectives on relationships, love, and loss… and on interior decoration. I particularly enjoyed how convincingly the beautiful chateau is converted to a hospital and place of war, and how the past overlaps so achingly with the story’s present, echoing into the future.Both women find and display great inner strength as this story progresses. Their companions, male and female, good, bad and indifferent, are convincingly portrayed. And the cruel effects of war on landscapes and people, castle and countryside, history and the future become all too real. The story’s told from the points of view of the two female protagonists, whose different voices and concerns make the transitions easy for the reader.

The newspaper industry I love Howard Owen’s Willie Black Mysteries, but you don’t need to know the background to pick up this new novel and enjoy it. The newspaper industry is failing, as we know all too well. Modern society alternates between crumbling and building itself back up. Love and hate are powerful emotions. And journalist Willie Black is supplementing his income by ghost-writing a memoir. Unfortunately, the book will never be finished, and Black becomes a suspect in the murder of his client.Black’s mixed-race heritage has caused problems before. Now he’s faced with the death of a white man, the innocence of a black youngster, and the threat of recent history repeated. Meanwhile he has friends and family who may be in need of protection, and police colleagues who’d rather just close the case and move on.Set in Richmond, Virginia, against a backdrop of modern-day America, Jordan’s Branch details the death of a former resident in a neighborhood built over a long-buried creek where former slaves once lived. The heritage of slavery is alive and well, if likewise hidden, in the present day, where distrust goes both ways, but the crimes of the white are easier to forgive and forget.The novel builds convincingly from a simple murder case, with mounting threat and confusion, until, by the middle of the book, an unputdownable race against time begins, because things that are hidden have an unpleasant habit of suddenly becoming visible.The creek still flows in secret, but hatreds run deep, and Jordan’s Branch is smoothly told, in the smokey voice of a fantastic narrator, with the convincing side-thoughts that bring everything to life, and the sense of threat that makes a reader take stock. Great characters, fascinating plot, up-to-date detail and relevance, and genuine heart… it’s another wonderful read in a great collection.Disclosure: I was given a p edition and I love it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,"Dec 08, 2020not set","Dec 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55844090-jordan-s-branch

Would-be puppeteers of any faith or none could do well to learn from the author’s very gentle and natural explanations of how personal interactions between puppeteer, puppet, and audience drive a message. Her book offers practical insights into puppeteering, puppet choice, use of voice, and how to overcome stage fright, adding some very wise advice for puppet script-writers (and all authors) about how to show emotion, write dialog, and make (short) fiction believable and fun.With humorous images (from the author’s son) and enjoyable anecdotes and explanations, the author (and her son) invite anyone to choose a puppet that fits their life. Sample scripts illustrate lessons not just in faith, but also in writing and the art of puppeteering. And some excellent explanations of writing techniques (the importance of callback for example, or well-chosen illustrations of “show don’t tell”) will be useful for anyone wanting to write... anything.Fun scripts, examples of written (and spoken) misunderstandings, and a natural cast of characters that includes the author’s son, a delightful Holstein cow, a furry puppet and more, make Linda Bonney Olin’s book a pleasure to read, and an amazing resource for any aspiring puppet ministry—also an encouragement to any youth ministry team to consider adding puppets to their repertoire!

From a surprisingly settled beginning, these Viking survivors set out in search of a safe place, and travel through dangers of land and culture, toward promises, entirely plausible, which may or may not be fulfilled.A fine cast of characters draw the reader in, from old to young, warriors and wild child and more.

It’s a masterful effort, blending very earthbound imagination with the wonders of heaven, making the highest mountain and furthest star fall at just the right point to fit the “plot.”Reading them was interesting, but not enthralling. It intrigued me but didn’t educate me or change my faith. It makes science less relevant than technology in the face of end-times, and perhaps, in that, it’s fitting to the present day. But the blend of awkward horror with unswerving attention to detail left little room for the miracles of science and awed interpretation… and left me behind.Disclosure: I’m glad I finally read it but I’m disappointed not to share other readers’ enthusiasm.

Meanwhile generations live and die on a spaceship, condemned to small horizons by their ancestors who longed for distant lights. Add a touch of “things break” and a hint of machine intelligence, and the result is a wholly believable tale of small-town homes on a small-world ship, heading for big-world dreams and hopes. Once enough things have broken though, the travelers might question if the dream itself is broken. Can science really tame another world to be our home? Can relationships really cope with changing from the dangerously familiar to unfamiliar danger? And will it really work?Aurora has enough science, convincingly told, to satisfy the good old-fashioned “science fiction should be scientific” reader.

Meanwhile the rebellious teen might have an identity crisis of her own. And the devotee, like so many children in Gilead, knows who her parents are, but not her biological past. Only those entrusted with secrets know who is the child of whom, because handmaids don’t count. The problem, of course, is that relationships, when revealed, might matter enough to change the world.The past of Gilead becomes terrifyingly plausible in this novel, with a road to entrapment paved in the newspapers of the present. All that’s missing is the current virus, but it would fit the tale perfectly. Fear makes us agree to strange deals. Guilt compounds guilt. And redemption might be born of condemnation. But the truth might, maybe, set the people free… if the truth can be believed.From ditzy teens to snarky rich-girls to silently secretive Aunts-in-training, these characters grow and change believably, both sadly and hopefully.

Dead bodies, suffering children, multiple suspects, and everyone hiding skeletons in their cupboards; it’s a heady mix and leads to an appropriately tortuous investigation.A “multi-lingual English, Spanish and French-speaking Politics Philosophy and Economics, Oxford graduate with a postgrad MBS, and more than just a smattering of Hebrew” is hired to investigate, but she has other cases to work on, and an unravelling plait of relationships to distract her. Still, she’s good at her job, whether that be self-defense or rescuing secret missions.Detailed descriptions of locations from Lyme Regis to London and beyond provide the background scenery, where areas of “mainly Victorian terraced houses, … developed by Solomon Barnett between 1895 and 1900…” compete with beach and gardens for the reader’s attention. Detailed backstories aren’t always believable, but they enhance the TV feel of the novel, giving it an episodic feel, explaining, for example, the life of an autistic young man abandoned at birth by his father because he looked wrong, or the choices of strong woman who left a bully in a waste paper basket when she was a kid.Chapter headings are enhanced with vignette photographs, adding to the sense of place.

Perhaps it’s the fascinating twists of fate that give a sense of strength, reality and direction. Or perhaps it’s just that Christopher McPherson both writes and researches really well. Whatever it is, Sincerely Dina Lamont becomes an un-put-downable novel for this non-Hollywood, non-memoir-reading er, bringing to life the trials of the depression, the excitement and awe of the first movie sound tests, the novelty of film, and the magic of opportunity. Plus there’s a house lifted up from its foundation and dumped a mile away… in real life!Dina Lamont’s story is a story of real strength, real struggle, and real humanity. The protagonist works hard to achieve great goals, falls far without ever giving up, and climbs again till the reader sighs in delight at the resolution of final years. From stage to “flickers” (which is what films were derisively called in those early years), to Hollywood; there’s real-life networking (no internet), time-consuming effort, and a new world dawning, until “everything old is new again.” The names of movies and stars half-remembered (or even truly famous), share the pages with friends and family. The world owes nothing to no-one. And Dina Lamont truly takes that world by storm.Then the author meets her and turns that storm, now long forgotten, into a surprisingly evocative, fascinating and enthralling biographical novel. You don’t need to love Hollywood or history to love this book; it’s a tale of people and the world they live in, of beauty and change, and persistence and hope.Disclosure: I was given an ecopy and I can’t believe it took me so long to get around to reading it.

UtoSet in 1890s Michigan, Eden Waits retells the story of real characters facing real historical problems that are, sadly, hauntingly relevant today. Utopian dreams fuel an attempt to create a society where everyone is cared for; you can’t be fired on a whim; you can’t be driven out by overcharging; you can’t be made to starve just because you’re sick… It sounds great, but outside the Utopian village is a real world waiting to win, and inside there are real characters, driven by a wholly convincing blend of faith, hope and the determination to succeed.Author Maryka Biaggio recreates her characters convincingly, divining believable motivations, and bringing the reader deeply into both the practicalities of 1890s life (house-building, farming, logging…) and the tortured loyalties of good people making honest mistakes. The dialog feels real, the voices are compelling, and the storyline moves pleasingly from a well-chosen start to a perfectly-timed finish.Some typos distracted me at the start, but perhaps I had an early copy.

Boyle’s The Terranauts is absorbing, compelling, fascinating and totally believable. Drawn from one real (failed) socio-scientific experiment, it imagines a “better” second attempt and vividly portrays the tribulations of a small group of people living in a giant terrarium. The science feels true to life—even the animals’ behavior and headaches from lack of oxygen feel real. The social science of a small group, closely observed and fiercely controlled, feels entirely authentic too (though sad). Relationships form and break under glass. Technological marvels break too. The outside world watches and outside disasters break in. But the true disaster happens entirely inside and carries the potential to change everything.I enjoyed the interplay of different points of view in this novel, and the quietly growing tension between characters. The ending felt predictable, but I liked how larger themes were buried in the details.

The Roman Empire and the ChristDouglas Burton’s evocative novel of 6th Century Constantinople brings to life the pomp and misery of a changing world. The Roman Empire and the Christian church are split into opposing factions, while emperors cling to power, popes cling to dogma, and streets fall to chaos. Young Theodora’s happy childhood is abruptly halted by the death of her father, and Far Away Bird tells the story of her growth into powerful womanhood. Readers will know she’s destined to be an Empress, but how does a helpless girl sold to the highest bidder reach such heights?Vivid depictions of a city in chaos, rebellion, fire and smoke, draw the reader in. A fascinating heroine, who already knows “it was the will of the people that mattered… it was the Christian god who mattered most,” promises a fascinating future. And the novel is equally gripping and evocative in its descriptions of riot and violence as of music and monks, rich with sunsets and smoke, and filled with haunting scenes from the Hippodrome to the Hagia Sophia and across the world.Unflinching in its depiction of cruelty and seduction, haunting in the trials of a girl who might prefer revenge to the forgiveness of a crucified “god,” and authentically relevant to the present day in its questions of social and personal control, the pages turn quickly, and great characters reveal great wisdom. “[I]n the end all battles are social battles,” says one character. “Kingdoms used to fight over territory… Now we fight over the definition of God,” says another. And a third, looking at relationships, describes how “real partnership requires no law.”The novel stands alone, taking a child in a changing world to a place where she can cause change, and leading to a very satisfying ending.

The book is written for writers, and most of us would agree that some goal—getting published, earning royalties, becoming a household name—defines success for us. Most of us would probably confess as well, that each new goal achieved just leads to another reason to feel we’re not successful “yet.”By contrast, author Derek Doepker defines success as “a process and way of being.” We’re successful as long as we’re working toward a goal, be it an old goal or a new one. Setbacks aren’t failures, but rather the “the exact experience you need to make your next breakthrough.” If I learn nothing else from reading his book, I will be grateful for this definition.Will I ask what book will sell before I start to write? I’m not sure. Will I “just” take the next step in trying to market my book? Probably. Will I have a business-minded approach to my writing? I hope so, but my writing definitely emphasizes the “small” in small business.Each well-defined “mistake” is followed with a “how to fix” it section, and it’s all presented smoothly and sensibly. Practical details abound—such as how to balance the time you spend doing something yourself against the time you could spend using your skill to write another book. Of course, the author has a reason for writing this book, and some of the fixes involve buying courses or paying for assistance. That said, there are lots of intriguing and useful links to various sites and techniques, including a fascinating site where you define “punishments for failing to act”!“Imitation + creation = innovation” appeals to me for mathematical clarity and for the way it reminds me of my childhood self painstakingly copying out a book to prove that I could write.
