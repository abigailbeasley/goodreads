I ADORED this collection of short stories. I laughed out loud so many times and caught myself smiling as I read it. There was a story about a science teacher that really resonated. The final story about the climate scientists was also one of my favourites. Don't worry though, this is NOT a science book. It's about finding our identities and how we relate to others. Anyway, the last story had me worried as I started to panic about the climate crisis, but it left me with a feeling of hopefulness that was very much needed on this cold February morning.
